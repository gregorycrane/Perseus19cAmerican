<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>It was a hard saying of a Spanish aphorist of the <num value="17" type="ordinal">seventeenth</num> century that <quote>to equal a predecessor <num value="1">one</num> must have twice his worth.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>We should deprecate the application of that standard to <title>The <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> history of American literature</title>, yet we are not without hope that the work, of which we here present the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volume, will be found to mark some progress in the right direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>We would call attention to the following as perhaps its chief distinctive features: (<num value="1">1</num>) It is on a larger scale than any of its predecessors which have carried the story from colonial times to the present generation; (<num value="2">2</num>) It is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> history of American literature composed with the collaboration of a numerous body of scholars from every section of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and from <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>; (<num value="3">3</num>) It will provide for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time an extensive bibliography for all periods and subjects treated; (<num value="4">4</num>) It will be a survey of the life of the <rs>American</rs> people as expressed in their writings rather than a history of <hi rend="italics">belles-lettres</hi> alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>The significance of these features may be emphasized by some reference to the characteristic merits and defects of previous works in this field, to which we are under obligations too extensive for detailed mention.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>The earliest and the latest historians of a literature have great advantages: the earliest, that he has no predecessors; the latest, that he has many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>It is a pleasure to remember <persName n="Knapp,,Samuel,L.,," id="n0187.0001.00002.00001" reg="default:Knapp,Samuel,L.,,"><foreName>Samuel</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Knapp</surname></persName>, who in the preface to his <title>Lectures on American literature</title>, published in <dateStruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></dateStruct>, easily justified the publication of that interesting and patriotic overture: <quote>We have very good histories-narrative, political, military, and constitutional; but I know none, as yet, that can be called literary-meaning by the term, a history of our literature, and of our literary men.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/><quote>You are aware,</quote> he continues, <quote>that it has been said by foreigners, and often repeated, that there was no such thing as American literature; that it would be vain for anyone <pb id="p.-003" n="-003"/> to seek for proofs of taste, mind, or information, worth possessing, in our early records; and some of our citizens, who have never examined these matters, have rested so quietly after these declarations, or so fondly denied them, that the bold asserters of these libels have gained confidence in tauntingly repeating them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>The great epoch in our history-the revolution of <dateStruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></dateStruct>-seemed sufficient, alone, to many of the present generation, to give us, as a people, all the celebrity and rank, among the nations of the earth, we ought to aspire to, without taking the trouble to go back to the previous ages of heroick virtue and gigantick labours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Many of the present generation are willing to think that our ancestors were a pious and persevering race of men, who really did possess some strength of character, but, without further reflection, they are ready to allow that a few pages are <q direct="unspecified">ample room and verge enough</q> to trace their character and their history together: I have ventured to think differently</quote> ;--and the editors of the present work are at this point in accord with <persName n="Knapp,,,,," id="n0187.0001.00003.00002" reg="nearbymention:Knapp,Samuel,L.,,"><surname>Knapp</surname></persName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/><quote>My plan,</quote> he says, in a passage which throws an illuminating beam down the whole pathway of American literary scholarship-<quote>My plan when I commenced my researches was an extensive <num value="1">one</num>, and I gathered copious materials to carry it into effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>For several years past I have had access to libraries rich in American literature; but when I sat down to work up the mass I had collected, the thought suggested itself to my mind, that no adequate compensation could ever be reasonably expected for my pains. . . . Still I could not be persuaded to relinquish altogether my design, and I therefore set about abridging my outlines, dispensing with many of my remarks, and giving up many elaborate finishings I had promised myself to make in the course of my work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>And another thought struck me most forcibly, that a heavy publication would not be readily within the reach of all classes of youth in our country, but that a single volume of common size, in a cheap edition, might find its way into some of <pb id="p.-004" n="-004"/> our schools, and be of service in giving our children a wish to pursue the subject of our literary history as they advanced in years and knowledge.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The philosophic observer may here remark that our historian, like his innumerable successors, follows the way of all flesh in that when he has abandoned his ideal immediately there bolts into his mind an excellent reason for abandoning it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>A <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> temptation of the <rs>American</rs> historian, which appeared long before <persName n="Knapp,,,,," id="n0187.0001.00004.00004" reg="nearbymention:Knapp,Samuel,L.,,"><surname>Knapp</surname></persName> and persisted long after him, is to magnify the achievements of <num value="1">one</num>'s own parish at the expense of the rest of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>In the more temperate passages of the <title>Magnalia Christi Americana</title> he cultivates the just self-esteem of his section with considerations like these: <quote>I will make no odious comparisons between <orgName n="Harvard College" type="college">Harvard College</orgName> and other universities for the proportion of worthy men therein educated; but <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, compared with other parts of <placeName key="tgn,7012149;tgn,2131963;tgn,2131961;tgn,2131960;tgn,2026331;tgn,2002460" n="0.013 000000.9090	placename;tgn,7012149;United States, North and Central America, ,North and Central America;0.013 000000.9090	placename;tgn,2131963;America City, Nemaha, Kansas,Nemaha,Kansas,United States,North and Central America;0.013 000000.9090	placename;tgn,2131961;America, McCurtain, Oklahoma,McCurtain,Oklahoma,United States,North and Central America;0.013 000000.9090	placename;tgn,2131960;America, Wabash, Indiana,Wabash,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;0.013 000000.9090	placename;tgn,2026331;America, Pulaski, Illinois,Pulaski,Illinois,United States,North and Central America;0.013 000000.9090	placename;tgn,2002460;America, Walker, Alabama,Walker,Alabama,United States,North and Central America" reg="United States, North and Central America, ,North and Central America;America City, Nemaha, Kansas,Nemaha,Kansas,United States,North and Central America;America, McCurtain, Oklahoma,McCurtain,Oklahoma,United States,North and Central America;America, Wabash, Indiana,Wabash,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;America, Pulaski, Illinois,Pulaski,Illinois,United States,North and Central America;America, Walker, Alabama,Walker,Alabama,United States,North and Central America">America</placeName>, may certainly boast of having brought forth very many eminent men, in proportion more than any of them; and of <orgName n="Harvard College" type="college">Harvard College</orgName> (herein truly a Sion College) it may be said, <hi rend="italics">this and that man were bred there</hi>; of whom not the least was <persName n="Shepard,Mister,Thomas,,," id="n0187.0001.00004.00007" reg="default:Shepard,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Shepard</surname></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>But no sooner was the ruthless hand of tory absolutism struck down than the long gathering forces of social discontent came to a head and broke with the moderate party of Presbyterian reformers; whereupon there followed the real <placeName reg="Puritan, Vinton, Ohio" key="tgn,2601475">Puritan</placeName> revolution which had been preparing since the days of Wyclif.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>The Separatists seized control of Parliament and set about the work of erecting a government that should be a commonwealth of free citizens; the voice of the democratic underling, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in <name>English</name> history, was listened to in the national councils, and the army of the democrat stood ready to enforce his demands with the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>But not before its real work was done; not before the political principles, which hitherto had been obscurely entangled in theological disputation, were set free and held up to the view of Englishmen; not before the new democratic philosophy had clarified its fundamental principle, namely, that the individual both as Christian and citizen derives from nature certain inalienable rights which every church and every government is bound to respect.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>Possessed of ample means and of good social position, they were liberals rather than radicals, and they shared the common Presbyterian hope of capturing the ecclesiastical establishment as a whole instead of separating from it. But they had been preceded to <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> by the <rs>Plymouth</rs> congregation, a body of low-born Separatists, who had set up a church upon frankly democratic principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>In an unfortunate moment for Presbyterianism, the pioneer church at <placeName reg="Salem, Columbiana, Ohio" key="tgn,2081744">Salem</placeName> came under the influence of the <rs>Plymouth</rs> example, and the following <pb id="p.35" n="35"/> year, when the main body of Puritans came over with <persName n="Winthrop,,,,," id="n0187.0004.00035.00318" reg="nearbymention:Winthrop,John,,,"><surname>Winthrop</surname></persName>, they fell in with the <rs>Salem</rs> example and set up the new churches on the <rs>Congregational</rs> principle, as seeming to provide the most suitable form for the development of a theocracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>The inconsistency of an arrangement by which an aristocratic leadership accepted a democratic church organization was obscured for the moment by the unanimity of ministers and congregation; but it was clearly perceived by the <name>Presbyterians</name> of the old country, and it was to prove the source of much contention in later years.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>Out of this fundamental inconsistency sprang a large part of the literature with which we are concerned in the present chapter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>The ministers, as the spokesmen of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, soon found themselves embroiled in controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>During the later years, when Presbyterianism had been definitely overthrown in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, the controversy lay between the theocratic hierarchy &mdash; which after the year <dateStruct value="1637--"><year reg="1637">1637</year></dateStruct> was the dominant power-and the dissenting democracy; the former seeking to Presbyterianize the church away from its primitive Congregationalism, the latter seeking to maintain the purity of the <rs>Plymouth</rs> ideal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>In dealing with the several ministers, therefore, we shall divide them into the emigrant generation and the native generations, and set the aristocratic Presbyterians over against the democratic Congregationalists, endeavouring to understand the chief points at issue between them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>The most authoritative representative of the ideals of the middle period of Puritanism-its aristocratic conservatism in the guise of theocratic polities &mdash; was the celebrated John Cotton, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Teacher to the church at <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>Good men were drawn to him irresistibly by his sweetness of temper, and evil men were overawed by his venerable aspect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>For all his severe learning he was a lovable man, with white hair framing a face that must have been nobly chiselled, gentle-voiced, courteous, tactful, by nature <quote>a tolerant man,</quote> than whom none <quote>did more placidly bear a dissentient,</quote> or more gladly discover a friend in an antagonist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>If his tactful bending before opposition, or his fondness for intellectual subtleties, drew from his grandson the appellation <quote>a most excellent casuist,</quote> we must not therefore conclude that he served the cause of truth less devotedly than the cause of party.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>For in his mildly persistent way John Cotton was a revolutionist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>A noble ideal haunted his thought, as Utopian as any in the long roll of Utopian dreams &mdash; the ideal of a Christian theocracy which should supersede the unchristian government which Englishmen had lived under hitherto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>A devout scripturist, he accepted the <rs>Hebrew Bible</rs> as the final word of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, not to be played fast and loose with but to be received as a rule of universal application, perfect to the last word and least injunction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>The sufficiency of the <name>Scriptures</name> to social needs was an axiom in his philosophy; <quote>the more any law smells of man the more unprofitable,</quote> he asserted in his proposed draft of laws; and at another time he exclaimed, <quote lang="la">Scripturae plenitudinem adoro.</quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>It was a frankly aristocratic world in which John Cotton was bred, and if he disliked the plebeian ways of the <rs>Plymouth</rs> <pb id="p.37" n="37"/> democracy equally with the <name>Brownist</name> tendencies of Plymouth Congregationalism, it was because they smacked too much of popular sovereignty to please him. And when he found himself confronted by signs of democratic unrest in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> his course of action seemed to him clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>The desire for liberty he regarded as the sinful prompting of the natural man, a godless denial of the righteous authority of the divinely appointed rulers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>If democracy were indeed a Christian form of government, was it not strange that divine wisdom should have overlooked so significant a fact?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/></p> 
<p>From my childhood up, my mind had been full of objections against the doctrine of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> sovereignty, in choosing whom he would to eternal life, and rejecting whom he pleased; leaving them eternally to perish, and be everlastingly tormented in hell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>It used to appear like a horrible doctrine to me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>I have often since had not only a conviction, but a delightful conviction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>The doctrine has very often appeared exceeding pleasant, bright, and sweet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>Absolute sovereignty is what I love to ascribe to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>But my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> conviction was not so.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance that I remember of that sort of inward, sweet delight in <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and divine things that I have lived much in since, was on reading those words, <hi rend="italics">Now unto the <rs>King</rs> eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, be honour and glory for ever and ever, A</hi> men. As I read the words, there came into my soul, and was as it were diffused through it, a sense of the glory of the <rs>Divine Being</rs> . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>Not long after I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> began to experience these things, I gave an account to my father of some things that had passed in my mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>I was pretty much affected by the discourse we had together; and when the discourse was ended, I walked abroad alone, in a solitary place in my father's pasture, for contemplation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>And as I was walking there, and looking up on the sky and clouds, there came into my mind so sweet a sense of the glorious <hi rend="italics">majesty</hi> and <hi rend="italics">grace</hi> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, that I know not how to express.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>I seemed to see them <pb id="p.60" n="60"/> both in a sweet conjunction; majesty and meekness joined together; it was a sweet and gentle, and holy majesty; and also a majestic meekness; an awful sweetness; a high, and great, and holy gentleness.</p></quote> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>It should seem also that he not only suppressed his personal ecstasy in his works for the press, but waived it largely in his more direct intercourse with men.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>Now the <name>Edwardian</name> theology was a part of the great deistic debate which took its root in the everlasting question of the <pb id="p.66" n="66"/> origin of evil in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>It was a <num value="3">three</num>-cornered contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>The <rs>Calvinists</rs> and the infidels both believed in a kind of determinism, but differed over the nature of the determining cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>The <rs>Calvinists</rs> found this cause in a personal Creator, omnipotent and omniscient, to whom they did not scruple to carry up all the evil as well as all the good of the universe--<quote lang="fr">c'est que <persName n="Dieu,,,,," id="n0187.0005.00066.00461" reg="mostcommon:Dieu,nomatch:0"><surname>Dieu</surname></persName>,</quote> as <persName><foreName>Calvin</foreName></persName> himself states categorically, <quote lang="fr">non seulement a preveu la cheute du premier homme, et en celle la ruine de toute sa posterity, mais qu'il l'a ainsi voulu.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>The deists, who at this time formed the fighting line of the infidels, while verbally acknowledging the existence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and theorizing on the nature of evil, virtually regarded the universe as a perfectly working machine in which there was no room for a personal governor or for real sin. To the <name>Arminians</name>, including the bulk of the orthodox churchmen, the alliance between Calvinism and deism seemed altogether to outweigh the differences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>As <persName n="Whitby,,Daniel,,," id="n0187.0005.00066.00462" reg="default:Whitby,Daniel,,,"><foreName>Daniel</foreName> <surname>Whitby</surname></persName> declares in the preface to his discourses <title>On the <num value="5">five</num> points of Calvinism</title> (<dateStruct value="1710--"><year reg="1710">1710</year></dateStruct>; reprinted in America), to hold <name n="God" type="God">God</name> responsible for evil is to play directly into the hands of the atheists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>And so the age-old dispute between Augustinian and Pelagian, and between Calvinist and Arminian, took on a new life from the deistic controversy, and there sprang up a literature which undertook to preserve the idea of an omnipotent personal Creator and at the same time to save his face, if the expression may be tolerated, by attributing to men complete free will and accountability for their actions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>It was in answer to <placeName key="tgn,7013140" n="1.000 3" reg="whitby, ontario">Whitby</placeName>'s book and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> others of the kind that <persName n="Edwards,,,,," id="n0187.0005.00066.00463" reg="nearbymention:Edwards,Jonathan,,,"><surname>Edwards</surname></persName> composed his <title>Freedom of the will</title>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>His argument has a psychological basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>In the <title>Treatise concerning religious affections</title> he had divided the soul into <num value="2">two</num> faculties: <num value="1">one</num> called the understanding, by which it discerns, views, and judges things; the other called the heart or will, being nothing else but the inclination of the soul towards or the disinclination from what is discerned and judged by the understanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>In the <title>Freedom of the will</title> he starts with <persName n="Locke,,,,," id="n0187.0005.00066.00464" reg="mostcommon:Locke,nomatch:0"><surname>Locke</surname></persName>'s statement that <quote>the <name>Will</name> is perfectly distinguished from Desire, which in the very same action may have a quite contrary tendency from that which our <persName n="Wills,,,,," id="n0187.0005.00066.00465" reg="mostcommon:Wills,nomatch:0"><surname>Wills</surname></persName> set us upon.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>It follows from this that the will at any moment is determined by the strongest motive acting upon the soul; we are free in so far as no obstacle is presented to our willing in accordance with our inclination, but our inclination is determined by what at any moment seems to us good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>In his attack on the common arguments for the freedom of the will <rs>Edwards</rs> is magnificently victorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>If the psychology by which the <name>Arminians</name> sought to relieve <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of the burden of evil in human life is pushed into a corner, it shows itself as nothing more than this: Man's will is a faculty absolutely indeterminate in itself and entirely independent of his inclinations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>When, therefore, a man errs, it is because, the choice between evil with its attendant suffering and good with its attendant happiness being presented to him, the man, having full knowledge of the consequences and being impelled by no momentary preponderance of the <num value="1">one</num> or the other from his innate disposition, deliberately and freely chooses what is evil and painful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>Such an account of human action is monstrous, inconceivable; it offered an easy mark for so sharp a logician as <persName n="Edwards,,,,," id="n0187.0005.00067.00467" reg="nearbymention:Edwards,Jonathan,,,"><surname>Edwards</surname></persName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>(He himself would put it the other way about: <quote>Herein does very much consist that image of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> wherein he made man.</quote> ) The passage in which he develops this thesis, though generally overlooked by his critics, is of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> importance: <pb id="p.68" n="68"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>We must conceive of Him as influenced in the highest degree, by that which, above all others, is properly a moral inducement, viz., the moral good which He sees in such and such things: and therefore He is, in the most proper sense, a moral Agent, the source of all moral ability and Agency, the fountain and rule of all virtue and moral good; though by reason of his being supreme over all, it is not possible He should be under the influence of law or command, promises or threatenings, rewards or punishments, counsels or warnings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>The essential qualities of a moral Agent are in <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, in the greatest possible perfection; such as understanding, to perceive the difference between moral good and evil; a capacity of discerning that moral worthiness and demerit, by which some things are praiseworthy, others deserving of blame and punishment; and also a capacity of choice, and choice guided by understanding, and a power of acting according to his choice or pleasure, and being capable of doing those things which are in the highest sense praiseworthy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>In other words, the will of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is precisely like the will of man; it is merely the inclination, or <hi rend="italics">moral inducement</hi>, to act as he is <hi rend="italics">influenced</hi> by external power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>The fatal mystery of good and evil, the true cause, lies above and beyond him; he is, like ourselves, a channel, not the source.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>The only difference is that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has complete knowledge of the possibilities of being, and therefore is not moved by threats and blind commands but, immediately, by what <persName n="Edwards,,,,," id="n0187.0005.00068.00472" reg="nearbymention:Edwards,Jonathan,,,"><surname>Edwards</surname></persName> elsewhere calls the <quote>moral necessity</quote> of governing in accordance with the best of the <quote>different objects of choice that are proposed to the <rs>Divine Understanding</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>By such a scheme <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is really placed in about such a position as in the <name>Leibnitzian</name> continuation of <persName n="Valla,,Laurentius,,," id="n0187.0005.00068.00473" reg="default:Valla,Laurentius,,,"><foreName>Laurentius</foreName> <surname>Valla</surname></persName>'s <title>Dialogue on free will and <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName></title>, where he is naively portrayed as looking upon an infinite variety of worlds piled up, like cannon balls, in pyramidal form before him, and selecting for creation that <num value="1">one</num> which combines the greatest possible amount of good with the least possible admixture of evil.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>From this pretty sport of the imagination <rs>Edwards</rs> would no doubt have drawn back in contempt, and indeed in his ordinary language <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is merely the supreme Cause, without further speculation.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>An old-time classification of the human faculties will serve to explain the development of American thought in the <num value="18" type="ordinal">eighteenth</num> century, a development which led to the overthrow of high Calvinism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>As there were <num value="3">three</num> divisions of the human mind-intellect, sensibility, and will, so were there <num value="3">three</num> divisions among the enemies of orthodoxy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>Those who followed the intellect were the rationalists, or deists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>Those who followed sensibility were the <quote>hot</quote> men, or enthusiasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>Those who followed the will were the ethical reformers, who emphasized the conscious cultivation of morality rather than a divinely wrought change in man's nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>This last group constituted the <name>Arminians</name>, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in order of time in leading the assault upon embattled tradition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>When <persName n="Edwards,,Jonathan,,," id="n0187.0006.00072.00495" reg="default:Edwards,Jonathan,,,"><foreName>Jonathan</foreName> <surname>Edwards</surname></persName>, in <dateStruct value="1734--"><year reg="1734">1734</year></dateStruct>, complained of the <quote>great noise in this part of the country about Arminianism,</quote> he showed his alertness to the preliminary attack of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>That attack was especially directed against the middle of the <num value="5">five</num> points of Calvinism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>It was not so much against particular redemption, or the perseverance of the saints, as against irresistible grace that the battle-cry was raised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>The reason given was that such grace was bound to destroy man's free agency and convert him into a mere machine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>This explains why <persName n="Edwards,,,,," id="n0187.0006.00072.00496" reg="nearbymention:Edwards,Jonathan,,,"><surname>Edwards</surname></persName> threw up as a counterscarp his massive work upon the freedom of the human will wherein that freedom was virtually denied.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>Meanwhile, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> group, the men of feeling, came into action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>Received as allies, they turned out to be anything but a help to the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>After the religious revival and the great awakening of <dateStruct value="1734--"><year reg="1734">1734</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Edwards,,,,," id="n0187.0006.00072.00497" reg="nearbymention:Edwards,Jonathan,,,"><surname>Edwards</surname></persName> the logician became, in a measure, <persName n="Edwards,,,,," id="n0187.0006.00072.00498" reg="nearbymention:Edwards,Jonathan,,,"><surname>Edwards</surname></persName> the enthusiast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>But calling in the aid of evangelists <pb id="p.73" n="73"/> like <persName n="Whitefield,,George,,," id="n0187.0006.00073.00499" reg="default:Whitefield,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Whitefield</surname></persName> carried sensibility beyond the limits of sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>To argue against the <name>Arminians</name> that, because of irresistible grace, men lack all native moral power, was to make men altogether passive in conversion and to run the risk of being carried away in a flood of feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>So while <persName n="Edwards,,,,," id="n0187.0006.00073.00500" reg="nearbymention:Edwards,Jonathan,,,"><surname>Edwards</surname></persName> warmed up his system by his writings on the <title>Religious affections</title>, <persName n="Whitefield,,,,," id="n0187.0006.00073.00501" reg="nearbymention:Whitefield,George,,,"><surname>Whitefield</surname></persName> had to be cautioned by the <rs>Connecticut</rs> divine for his too great dependence upon impulse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>Brought in as an ally, <persName n="Whitefield,,,,," id="n0187.0006.00073.00502" reg="nearbymention:Whitefield,George,,,"><surname>Whitefield</surname></persName> thus became an unconscious underminer of high Calvinism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>It was <num value="1">one</num> thing to preach irresistible grace; it was another to lack the restraining grace of common sense.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>It was this lack which brought in the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> group, those who sought the test of intellect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>Agreeing with the <name>Arminians</name> as to the importance of the will, and opposing the enthusiasts for their extravagance of feeling, they had behind them the whole weight of the age of reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>But here a paradox appears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>While, in general, our <num value="18" type="ordinal">eighteenth</num>-century thought went through the <num value="3">three</num> phases of the conventional classification of man's powers, the development of that thought was anything but conventional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>Before the problems of the will and of the feelings could be determined by the orderly processes of reason, the controversy was complicated by the irruption of a foreign force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>It was not denied that the evangelist did some good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>The fault lay in the way in which he did it. Against this inspired son of a tavern keeper the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> clergy united in using the adjective <quote>low,</quote> and naturally, as leaders of provincial society, they damned anything that was low.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/><placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> now saw revealed the old struggle between masses and classes, between town and gown.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>The latter, in his reply, does not deign to defend the college against the charge of being a seminary of paganism, but proceeds to attack its defamer: <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, because of his manners, next, because of his ways of making money, and lastly, because of the evil fruits of enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>He grants that an itinerant, who frequently moves from place to place, may have a considerable use in awakening his hearers from a dead and carnal frame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>But while such an exhorter may have a manner which is very taking with the people, and a power to raise them to any degree of warmth he pleases, yet in thrusting himself into towns and parishes he destroys peace and order, extorts money from the people, and arouses that pernicious thing-enthusiasm.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>This attack was to be expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>The <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> clergy, as chosen members of a close corporation, abhorred the disturbers of their professional etiquette and were alarmed at poachers upon their clerical preserves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>It not only threatened their social pedestals but it touched their pockets to have these <quote>new lights</quote> taking the people from their work and business and leading them to despise their own ministers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>This aspect of the <name>Whitefield</name> controversy shows that the causes of the opposition were largely social and economic, the same causes which worked-though in the other direction-in the opposition to the establishment of <name>English</name> episcopacy in the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>When the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> fathers had both <quote>pence and power,</quote> as <persName n="Paine,,Tom,,," id="n0187.0006.00074.00509" reg="default:Paine,Tom,,,"><foreName>Tom</foreName> <surname>Paine</surname></persName> would say, it was natural that they should not relish the loss of either, at the expense of high churchmen or low itinerants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>But a cause deeper than the economic lay in this outraging of the spirit of the times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>This was the age of reason, and the leaders of church and college <pb id="p.75" n="75"/> prided themselves on being of a cool and logical temperament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>Hence <persName n="Wigglesworth,,,,," id="n0187.0006.00075.00510" reg="nearbymention:Wigglesworth,Edward,,,"><surname>Wigglesworth</surname></persName>'s most serious charge against <persName n="Whitefield,,,,," id="n0187.0006.00075.00511" reg="nearbymention:Whitefield,George,,,"><surname>Whitefield</surname></persName> is that of irrationality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>Enthusiasm, he explains, is a charge of a higher nature than perhaps people are generally aware of. The nature of enthusiasm is to make a man imagine that almost any thought which bears strongly upon his mind is from the <name>Spirit</name> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, when at the same time he has no proof that it is.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1371"/>Judged either by his principles or by his performance, <placeName reg="Franklin, Williamson, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017751">Franklin</placeName>'s moral breadth and moral elevation have been absurdly underestimated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1372"/>It is perhaps in the field of politics that <persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n0187.0007.00105.00763" reg="nearbymention:Franklin,B.,,,"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName> exhibits the most marked development of his power and his vision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1373"/>A realistic inductive thinker, well versed in the rudiments of his subject long before the revolutionary theorists handled it, he was not rendered by any preconception of abstract rights indocile to the lessons of his immense political experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1374"/>He formulated his conceptions in the thick of existing conditions, and always with reference to what was expedient and possible as well as to what was desirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1375"/>He served his apprenticeship in the <rs>Philadelphia Junto Club</rs>, which at its inception was little more than a village improvement society, but which threw out branches till it became a power in the province, and a considerable factor in the affairs of the colonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/>In this association he learned the importance of co-operation, mastered the tactics of organization, practised the art of getting propaganda afoot, and discovered the great secret of converting private desires into public demands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1377"/>In proposing in <dateStruct value="1754--"><year reg="1754">1754</year></dateStruct> his plan for a <orgName n="Colonies Union" type="union">union of the colonies</orgName> he was applying to larger units the principle of co-operative action by which he had built up what we might call to-day his <quote>machine</quote> in <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1378"/>Writers like <persName n="Milton,,,,," id="n0187.0007.00105.00764" reg="mostcommon:Milton,nomatch:0"><surname>Milton</surname></persName> and <persName n="Sidney,,Algernon,,," id="n0187.0007.00105.00765" reg="default:Sidney,Algernon,,,"><foreName>Algernon</foreName> <surname>Sidney</surname></persName> had reenforced his natural inclination towards liberal forms of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1379"/>But he had in too large measure the instincts and the ideas of a leader, and he had too much experience with the conflicting prejudices and the resultant compromises of popular <pb id="p.106" n="106"/> assemblies, to feel any profound reverence for the <quote>collective wisdom</quote> of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1380"/><quote>If all officers appointed by governors were always men of merit,</quote> he wrote in his <title>Dialogue concerning the present state of affairs in <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName></title>, <quote>it would be wrong ever to hazard a popular election.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1381"/>That his belief in popular representation was due as much to his sense of its political expediency as to his sense of its political justice is suggested by a passage in his letter on the imposition of direct taxes addressed to <persName n="Shirley,Governor,,,," id="n0187.0007.00106.00766" reg="mostcommon:Shirley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Shirley</surname></persName>, <dateStruct value="1754-12-18"><day reg="18">18</day> <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1754">1754</year></dateStruct>: <quote><hi rend="italics">In</hi> matters of general concern to the people, and especially where burthens are to be laid upon them, it is of use to consider, as well what they will be apt to think and say, as what they ought to think.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1382"/>His sojourn in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> widened his horizons, but not beyond the bounds of his nationality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1383"/>As agent, he felt himself essentially a colonial Englishman pleading for the extension of <name>English</name> laws to <name>British</name> subjects across the sea, and playing up to the <rs>Imperial</rs> policy of crushing out the colonizing and commercial rivalry of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1384"/>The ultimate failure of his mission of reconciliation effected no sudden transformation of his political ideas; it rather overwhelmed him with disgust at the folly, the obstinacy, and the corruption rampant among <name>English</name> politicians of the period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1385"/>He returned to the arms of the people because he had been hurled from the arms of the king; and he embraced their new principles because he was sure that they could not be worse applied than his old ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1386"/>His respect for the popular will was inevitably heightened by his share in executing it in the thrilling days when he was helping his fellow-countrymen to declare their independence, and was earning the superb epigraph of <persName n="Turgot,,,,," id="n0187.0007.00106.00767" reg="mostcommon:Turgot,nomatch:0"><surname>Turgot</surname></persName>: <foreign lang="la">Eripuit fulmen coelo, sceptrumque tyrannis</foreign>. His official residence in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName> completely dissolved his former antagonism to that country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1387"/>In the early stages of the conflict his wrath was bitter enough towards <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, but long before it was over he had taken the ground of radical pacificism, reiterating his conviction that <quote>there is no good war and no bad peace.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1388"/>He who had financed the <name>Revolution</name> had seen too much non-productive expenditure of moral and physical capital to believe in the appeal to arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1389"/>If nations required enlargement of their territories, it was a mere matter of arithmetic, he contended, to show that the cheapest way was purchase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1390"/><quote>Justice,</quote> he <pb id="p.107" n="107"/> declared, <quote>is as strictly due between neighbour Nations as between neighbour Citizens, . . . and a Nation that makes an unjust War, is only a <hi rend="italics">great Gang</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1391"/>So far as he was able, he mitigated the afflictions of non-combatants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1392"/>He proposed by international law to exempt from peril fishermen and farmers and the productive workers of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/>He ordered the privateersmen under his control to safeguard the lives and property of explorers and men of science belonging to the enemy country; and he advocated for the future the abolition of the custom of commissioning privateers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1394"/>In the treaty which he negotiated with <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName> he actually obtained the incorporation of an article so restricting the <quote>zone of war</quote> as to make a war between <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> under its terms virtually impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1395"/>His diplomatic intercourse in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> and his association with the <name>Physiocrats</name> had opened his eyes to the common interests of all pacific peoples and to the inestimable advantages of a general amity among the nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1396"/>His ultimate political ideal included nothing short of the welfare and the commercial federation of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1397"/>To that extent he was a believer in <quote>majority interests.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1398"/>It may be further said that his political development was marked by a growing mastery of the art of dealing with men and by a steady approximation of his political to his personal morality.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1399"/>For the broad humanity of <placeName reg="Franklin, Williamson, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017751">Franklin</placeName>'s political conceptions undoubtedly his interest in the extension of science was partly responsible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1400"/>As a scientific investigator he had long been a citizen of the world; and for him not the least bitter consequence of the war was that it made a break in the intellectual brotherhood of man. If he had not been obliged to supply the <orgName>army of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0187.0007.00107.00768" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName></orgName> with guns and ammunition, he might have been engaged in the far more congenial task of supplying the <rs>British Academy</rs> with food for philosophical discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1401"/>He could not but resent the brutal antagonisms which had rendered intellectual co-operation with his <name>English</name> friends impossible, and which had frustrated his cherished hope of devoting his ripest years to philosophical researches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1402"/>A natural endowment he certainly possessed which would have qualified him in happier circumstances for even more distinguished service than he actually performed in extending the frontiers of knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1403"/>He had the powerfully developed curiosity of the <pb id="p.108" n="108"/> explorer and the inventor, ever busily prying into the causes of things, ever speculating upon the consequences of novel combinations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1404"/>His native inquisitiveness had been stimulated by a young civilization's manifold necessities, mothering manifold inventions, and had been supplemented by a certain moral and idealizing passion for improvement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1405"/>The practical nature of many of his devices, his interest in agriculture and navigation, his preoccupation with stoves and chimneys, the image of him firing the gas of ditch water or pouring oil on troubled waves, and the celebrity of the kite incident, rather tend to fix an impression that he was but a tactful empiricist and a lucky dilettante of discovery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1406"/>It is interesting in this connection to note that he confesses his lack of patience for verification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1407"/>His prime scientific faculty, as he himself felt, was the imagination which bodies forth the shapes and relations of things unknown &mdash; which constructs the theory and the hypothesis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1408"/>His mind was a teeming warren of hints and suggestions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1409"/>He loved rather to start than to pursue the hare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1410"/>Happily what he deemed his excessive penchant for forming hypotheses was safeguarded by his perfect readiness to hear all that could be urged against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1411"/>He wished not his view but truth to prevail &mdash; which explains the winsome cordiality of his demeanour towards other savants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1412"/>His unflagging correspondence with investigators, his subscription to learned publications, his active membership in philosophical societies, and his enterprise in founding schools and academies all betoken his prescience of the wide domain which science had to conquer and of the necessity for co-operation in the task of subduing it. <persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n0187.0007.00108.00769" reg="nearbymention:Franklin,B.,,,"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName> was so far a Baconian that he sought to avoid unfruitful speculation and to unite contemplation and action in a stricter embrace for the generation of knowledge useful to man. But in refutation of any charge that he was a narrow-minded utilitarian and lacked the liberal views and long faith of the modem scientific spirit may be adduced his stunning retort to a query as to the usefulness of the balloons then on trial in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName>: <quote>What is the use of a new-born baby?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1413"/>Of <placeName reg="Franklin, Williamson, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017751">Franklin</placeName>'s style the highest praise is to declare that it reveals the mental and moral qualities of the man himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1414"/>It is the flexible style of a writer who has learned the craft of expression by studying and imitating the virtues of many <pb id="p.109" n="109"/> masters: the playful charm of <persName n="Addison,,,,," id="n0187.0007.00109.00770" reg="mostcommon:Addison,nomatch:0"><surname>Addison</surname></persName>, the trenchancy of <persName n="Swift,,,,," id="n0187.0007.00109.00771" reg="mostcommon:Swift,nomatch:0"><surname>Swift</surname></persName>, the concreteness of <persName n="Defoe,,,,," id="n0187.0007.00109.00772" reg="mostcommon:Defoe,nomatch:0"><surname>Defoe</surname></persName>, the urbanity of <persName n="Shaftesbury,,,,," id="n0187.0007.00109.00773" reg="mostcommon:Shaftesbury,nomatch:0"><surname>Shaftesbury</surname></persName>, the homely directness of <persName n="Bunyan,,,,," id="n0187.0007.00109.00774" reg="mostcommon:Bunyan,John,,,:1"><surname>Bunyan</surname></persName>'s dialogue, the unadorned vigour of <persName n="Tillotson,,,,," id="n0187.0007.00109.00775" reg="mostcommon:Tillotson,nomatch:0"><surname>Tillotson</surname></persName>, and the epigrammatic force of <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n0187.0007.00109.00776" reg="mostcommon:Pope,Alexander,,,:1"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1415"/>His mature manner, however, is imitative of nothing but the thoroughly disciplined movement of a versatile mind which has never known a moment of languor or a moment of uncontrollable excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1416"/>Next to his omnipresent vitality, his most notable characteristic is the clearness which results from a complete preliminary vision of what is to be said, and which in a young hand demands deliberate preconsideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1417"/>To <persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n0187.0007.00109.00777" reg="nearbymention:Franklin,B.,,,"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName>, the ordering of his matter must have become eventually a light task as, with incessant passing to and fro in his experience and with the daily habit of epistolary communication, he grew as familiar with his intellectual terrain as an old field marshal with the map of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1418"/>For the writing of his later years is marked not merely by clearness and force but also by the sovereign ease of a man who has long understood the interrelations of his ideas and has ceased to make revolutionary discoveries in any portion of his own nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1419"/>His occasional wrath does not fluster him but rather intensifies his lucidity, clarifies his logic, and brightens the ironical smile which accompanies the thrust of his wit. The <quote>decent plainness and manly freedom</quote> of his ordinary tone-notes which he admired in the writings of his maternal grandfather Peter Folger-rise in parts of his official correspondence to a severity of decorum; for there is a trace of the senatorial in the man, the dignity of antique <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1420"/>He is seldom too hurried, even in a private letter, to gratify the ear by the turning and cadence of sentence and phrase; and <num value="1">one</num> feels that the harmony of his periods is the right and predestined vesture of his essential blandness and suavity of temper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1421"/>His stylistic drapery, however, is never so smoothed and adjusted as to obscure the sinewy vigour of his thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1422"/>His manner is steadily in the service of his matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1423"/>He is adequate, not copious; for his moral <quote>frugality and industry</quote> prompt him to eschew surplusage and to make his texture firm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1424"/>His regard for purity of diction is classical; he avoids vulgarity; he despises the jargon of scientific pedants; but like <persName n="Montaigne,,,,," id="n0187.0007.00109.00778" reg="mostcommon:Montaigne,nomatch:0"><surname>Montaigne</surname></persName> he loves frank and masculine speech, and he likes to enrich the language <pb id="p.110" n="110"/> of the well bred by discreet drafts upon the burry, homely, sententious, proverbial language of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1425"/>Like <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Bacon</foreName></persName> and like many other grave men among his fellow-countrymen, he found it difficult to avoid an opportunity for a jest even when the occasion was unpropitious; and he never sat below the <name>Attic</name> salt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1426"/>When his fortune was made, he put by the pewter spoon and bowl of his apprenticeship; his biographers remind us that he kept a well stocked cellar at <placeName key="tgn,7009424" n="1.000 1" reg="passy,haute-savoie,rhone-alpes,france,europe">Passy</placeName> and enjoyed the distinction of suffering from the gout.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1434"/>The development of the colonial press coincides with a period often regarded as narrowly provincial in American literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1435"/>That spirit of adventure which enlivens the early historical narratives had settled into a thrifty concern with practical affairs, combined with an exaggerated interest in fine-spun doctrinal reasoning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1436"/>The echoes of <persName n="Spenser,,,,," id="n0187.0008.00111.00785" reg="mostcommon:Spenser,nomatch:0"><surname>Spenser</surname></persName> and other Elizabethans to be heard in some few <placeName reg="Puritan, Vinton, Ohio" key="tgn,2601475">Puritan</placeName> elegies and in <persName n="Anne Bradstreet,,,,," id="n0187.0008.00111.00786" reg="mostcommon:Anne Bradstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Anne Bradstreet</surname></persName>'s quaint imagery, had died away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1437"/>Knowledge of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> had become so casual that the colonial newspaper often found it necessary to describe <placeName reg="Dresden, Weakley, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098870">Dresden</placeName> or <placeName reg="Berlin, Berlin, Deutschland" key="tgn,7003712">Berlin</placeName> as <quote>a fair, large, and strong city of <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 4" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>,</quote> and to insert other geographical notes of the simplest sort.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1438"/>These limitations in the colonial point of view, however, had several striking effects on the early journalism between <dateStruct value="1704--"><year reg="1704">1704</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></dateStruct>, or thereabouts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1439"/>The reader who examines the small, ill-printed, half illegible news sheets is surprised to find them more varied in many ways, and more distinctly literary than modern journalism aims to be. The simple fact of the matter is that the dearth of news at length forced the editorial mind to become inventive and even, in some instances, creative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1440"/>When we remember that <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> news failed entirely during the long winters; that intercolonial communication was irregular and unsystematic; that criticism of the government in political editorials meant an official inquiry followed by the forced discontinuance of the paper, if not by a trial for libel; that the public already had enough religious exhortation from the pulpit and from pamphlets <pb id="p.112" n="112"/> on <title>The fatal consequences of unscriptural doctrine or <num value="20">twenty</num> considerations against</title> Sin,--remembering these things it will not seem so extraordinary that the newspapers turned to the spectacle of the actual life about them, and, to convey it, sought their models in the world of letters so little known in the colonies.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3413"/>Of his artistry this study has scarcely spoken; yet it has <pb id="p.274" n="274"/> been throughout implied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3414"/>His qualities of thought, feeling, imagination, were communicated, were indeed only communicable, because so wrought into his diction, his rhymes, cadences, and stanzas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3415"/>Indeed, there is no separating a poet's feeling, say, for a beautiful flower from his manner of expressing it &mdash; for all we know about his feeling for the flower is what he succeeds in communicating by speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3416"/>It is tautology to say that a poet treats a sublime idea sublimely &mdash; for it is the sublimity in the treatment that makes us realize the sublimity of the idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3417"/>We can at most conceive a poet's <quote>style</quote> as a whole; as, along with his individual world of meditation and vision, another phase of his creative power &mdash; as his creation of music.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3418"/>Possibly it is the deepest and most wonderful of the poet's creations, transcending its manifestation in connection with any single poem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3419"/>Perhaps, for instance, <placeName reg="Milton, Norfolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014069">Milton</placeName>'s greatest creative act was not <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Lycidas,,,,," id="n0187.0015.00274.02772" reg="mostcommon:Lycidas,nomatch:0"><surname>Lycidas</surname></persName></hi>, or the <hi rend="italics">Sonnets</hi>, or <title>Paradise lost</title>, but that music we call Miltonic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3420"/>Certainly this is the more true the more organic the style is; and, as said before, <persName n="Bryant,,,,," id="n0187.0015.00274.02773" reg="nearbymention:Bryant,I.,,,"><surname>Bryant</surname></persName>'s style was highly organic.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3422"/>Such a mind would not need to be told that <persName n="Bryant,,,,," id="n0187.0015.00274.02775" reg="nearbymention:Bryant,I.,,,"><surname>Bryant</surname></persName>'s diction was severe, simple, chaste, narrower in range than that of his political prose; that his rhymes were dignified, sonorous, exact and emphatic rather than subtle or allusive, and narrow in range &mdash; not from artistic poverty but because the rhyme vocabulary of the simple and serious moods is in English itself narrow, and much novelty and variety of rhyme is in our speech possible only when, like <persName n="Browning,,,,," id="n0187.0015.00274.02776" reg="mostcommon:Browning,nomatch:0"><surname>Browning</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> portrays the grotesque and the eccentric, or like <persName n="Shelley,,,,," id="n0187.0015.00274.02777" reg="mostcommon:Shelley,nomatch:0"><surname>Shelley</surname></persName> the fantastic, or like <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n0187.0015.00274.02778" reg="mostcommon:Butler,Samuel,,,:1"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> the comic, or like <persName n="Chaucer,,,,," id="n0187.0015.00274.02779" reg="mostcommon:Chaucer,nomatch:0"><surname>Chaucer</surname></persName> the familiar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3424"/>Indeed, and would our critic not likewise guess, especially if recently schooled at <placeName key="tgn,7012329" n="1.000 1" reg="leipzig,leipzig,sachsen,deutschland,europe">Leipzig</placeName> under Sievers, the very pitch of his voice in verse-strongest in the lower octaves &mdash; as well as the intrinsic alliteration,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3430"/>But the metrics alone do have their peculiarities, which can, however, hardly be examined here: line endings like <quote>and the green moss,</quote> caesuras at the end of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 4">fourth foot</orgName>, the tendency to repeat the same caesura and cadence through a succession of lines, a stanza group of <num value="5">five</num> or more lines with full stop followed by a single line or so, inverted accent at the beginning of a line, and a differentiated, strong cadence at the conclusion of the whole poem which gives the effect of a completion, not of a mere stopping,--these are all contributing factors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3431"/>Yet <persName n="Bryant,,,,," id="n0187.0015.00275.02787" reg="nearbymention:Bryant,I.,,,"><surname>Bryant</surname></persName> is not <num value="1">one</num> of the world's master-poets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3432"/>It is not so much that he contributed little or nothing to philosophic thought or spiritual revolution, not altogether that his range was narrow, not that he never created a poem of vast and multitudinous proportions, drama, epic, or tale, not that he knew nature better than human life and human life better than human nature, not that he now and then lapsed from imaginative vision into a bit of sentiment or irrelevant fancy,--not either that there is not a single dark saying, or obscure word, construction, allusion, in all his verse, for the judicious to elucidate at a club or in a monograph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3433"/>He is not <num value="1">one</num> of the world's master-poets, because he was not pre-eminently endowed with intellectual intensity and imaginative concentration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3434"/>The character of his whole mind was discursive, enumerative, <pb id="p.276" n="276"/> tending, when measured by the masters, to the diffuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3435"/>Thus, among other results, his report of things has given man's current speech but few quotations, of either epigrammatic criticism or haunting beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3436"/>A book could be written on this thesis, but a paragraph must suffice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3827"/>It is hard, indeed, to see how he could have added to the scout without taking something from the spy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4095"/>With the fading of the <name>Renaissance</name>, <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> had passed into an age of criticism, during which all it had inherited and achieved in the preceding era was subjected to the test of reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4096"/>Throughout the <num value="18" type="ordinal">eighteenth</num> century especially, the existing structure of society was subtly undermined, and when, at the end of that century, it finally collapsed, the revolution which in reality had long been in preparation took on an abrupt and miraculous appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4098"/>Smiles and wrecks, these were the characteristic products of the time, blasted institutions and blossoming ideals.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4099"/>What those ideals were &mdash; some of them soon to be realized, others destined to remain distant visions &mdash; is tolerably clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4100"/>Socially this revolution meant democracy, the assertion of the brotherhood and potential equality of men. Politically and religiously it meant the overthrow of feudal and ecclesiastical tyrannies and customs, and the setting up of liberal forms of government and belief as instruments for testing the new social doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4101"/>Philosophically it meant the contention, in the face of existing rationalisms and skepticisms, that man's practical <pb id="p.327" n="327"/> and imaginative faculties play a part in his apprehension of the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4102"/>In the realm of art and literature it meant the shattering of pseudo-classic rules and forms in favour of a spirit of freedom, the creation of works filled with the new passion for nature and common humanity and incarnating a fresh sense of the wonder, promise, and romance of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4103"/>In the scientific and industrial worlds it meant those fundamental and far-reaching changes which came with the constantly fuller recognition and adoption of the scientific method.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4104"/>To the special student, each of these revolutionary movements has its separate history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4105"/>But life, in spite of the student, is not a matter of water-tight compartments, and a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fact to be seized and held fast in any discussion of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> transcendentalism is that the new spirit which appeared in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> a century and more ago was neither social, nor political, nor industrial, nor economic, nor literary, nor scientific, nor religious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4106"/>It was all of them at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4107"/>It transcended every phase of life-though it is true, of course, that in this particular locality or at that particular time, in this individual or in that social atmosphere, it did take on this or that predominant emphasis or colour.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4108"/>On this side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, for instance, it assumed at the outset a pre-eminently political character, and America, in her own Revolution and in the events which followed it, made an early and memorable contribution to that greater revolution of the human spirit of which the source and centre was in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4109"/>But <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, save in the case here and there of an exceptional mind, remained largely unconscious, even as a matter of political theory, of the general significance for the world of what she had accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4110"/>Still less had she distilled from her democratic practice any fresh philosophy or faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4111"/>When, then, voices from abroad of those who were seeking a religion for the new order of things penetrated to a community which, religious to the core, had long been religiously starved, those voices were bound to be heard and answered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4115"/>The unsettling of traditional foundations, the ferment of thought and emotion, the aspirations, the excesses, the unleashing of dormant and unsuspected powers, all the effects, in fact, which attend such an experience in the case of the individual were reproduced on a wider scale when the spirit of revolutionary <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> descended upon a group of the finest minds of early <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num>-century <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4117"/>And suddenly-so at least it seemed-this group of young men and women became intensely aware of that fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4118"/>The new ideas and ideals found their way to them through a score of channels and affected as many phases of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4119"/>But because of the predominant part which religion still played in that life and its traditions, it was within the religious world that the influence of the new spirit was immediate and marked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4120"/>Transcendentalism was the religious conversion of early <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num>-century <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4121"/>And because of the relative cultural eminence of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, it became indirectly, in some measure, the religious conversion of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4181"/>The word <quote>transcendental</quote> in its philosophic sense goes back to <persName n="Kant,,,,," id="n0187.0018.00334.03561" reg="mostcommon:Kant,nomatch:0"><surname>Kant</surname></persName> and the <title>Critique of pure reason</title>, though in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, as elsewhere, the term lost its narrowly technical application and borrowed at the same time a new shade of meaning from the <title>Critique of practical reason</title>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4182"/><persName n="Kant,,,,," id="n0187.0018.00334.03562" reg="mostcommon:Kant,nomatch:0"><surname>Kant</surname></persName> had taught that time and space are not external realities but ways in which the mind <quote>constitutes</quote> its world of sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4183"/>The same is true, he had contended, of cause and effect and the other categories of the mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4184"/>Furthermore, as he brought out in his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <hi rend="italics">Critique</hi>, the ideas of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, of freedom, and of immortality are inevitable intuitions of the practical nature of man, and these intuitions, since man is essentially a practical and moral being, have therefore not a merely sentimental but a real validity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4185"/>From these and other Kantian conceptions a broad generalization was made, and the word <quote>transcendental</quote> came to be applied, in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, to whatever in man's mental and spiritual nature is conceived of as above experience and independent of it. Whatever transcends the experience of the senses is transcendental.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4186"/>Innate, original, universal, <hi rend="italics">a priori</hi>, intuitive-these are words all of which convey a part of the thought swept under the larger meaning of the term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4187"/>To the transcendentalists the name <rs>John Locke</rs> stood for the denial of innate ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4188"/><quote>Sensationalism</quote> was the prevalent description of the doctrine of his <hi rend="italics">Essay</hi>. Transcendentalism, on the other hand, reaffirmed the soul's inherent power to grasp the truth, and upon this basis went on to erect <pb id="p.335" n="335"/> a metaphysical structure similar in its main outlines to the leading Platonic and idealistic philosophies of the past.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4189"/>According to this view of the world, the <num value="1">one</num> reality is the vast spiritual background of existence, the <name>Over</name>-Soul, <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, within which all other being is unified and from which it derives its life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4190"/>Because of this indwelling of divinity, every part of the world, however small, is a microcosm, comprehending within itself, like <persName n="Tennyson,,,,," id="n0187.0018.00335.03563" reg="mostcommon:Tennyson,nomatch:0"><surname>Tennyson</surname></persName>'s flower in the crannied wall, all the laws and meaning of the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4191"/>The soul of each individual, therefore, is identical with the soul of the world, and contains, latently, all that that larger soul contains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4192"/>Thus the normal life of man is a life of continuous expansion, the making actual of the potential elements of his being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4193"/>This may occur in <num value="2">two</num> ways: either directly, in states which vary from the ordinary perception of truth to moments of mystical rapture in which there is a conscious influx of the divine into the human; or indirectly, through the instrumentality of nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4194"/>Nature is the embodiment of spirit in the world of sense &mdash; it is a great picture to be appreciated, a great book to be read, a great task to be performed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4195"/>Through the beauty, truth, and goodness incarnate in the natural world, the individual soul comes in contact with and appropriates to itself the spirit and being of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4196"/>From these central conceptions all the other teachings of the transcendentalists are derived: their doctrines of self-reliance and individualism, of the identity of moral and physical laws, of the essential unity of all religions, of the negative nature of evil; their spirit of complete tolerance and of absolute optimism; their defiance of tradition and disregard for all external authority.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4197"/>It must not be understood, however, that metaphysics was a central interest of the transcendentalists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4198"/>They were not system makers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4199"/>The idealistic philosophy was to many of them more a spirit and attitude of mind than a consciously reasoned-out theory of the world, and it is as such a pervading spirit that its virtue still survives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4200"/>As an explanation of the mystery of existence the transcendental philosophy makes little appeal to our own hard-headed and scientific generation; but no <num value="1">one</num>, assuredly, with any measure of spiritual and poetic perception can give himself sincerely and unreservedly to <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.336" n="336"/> of the literary masterpieces of the transcendental school, to <num value="1">one</num> of the greater essays of <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0187.0018.00336.03564" reg="nearbymention:Emerson,Waldo,,,"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> for example, the <hi rend="italics">Self-Reliance, Compensation, <persName n="Laws,,Spiritual,,," id="n0187.0018.00336.03565" reg="default:Laws,Spiritual,,,"><foreName>Spiritual</foreName> <surname>Laws</surname></persName></hi>, or <title>The over-soul</title>, without a consciousness, as he puts down the volume, of having passed for the time into a higher sphere of being, without a deepened conviction of the triviality, the relative unreality, of material concerns, without a sense of spaciousness, of clarity, of nobility, of power, a feeling that that much abused word <quote>eternal</quote> has suddenly put on a very real and concrete meaning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4201"/>Against such an actual experience no mere argument can avail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4202"/>Nor does the emotion thus evoked end in a vague mystical exaltation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4203"/>It leaves, rather, whether the reader profit by it or not, a distinct sense of its bearing on the daily conduct of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4204"/>This spirit of uplift, together with the moral impulsion it imparts, is the heart of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> transcendentalism.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4205"/>But the transcendentalists were not always at the level of their masterpieces, and from the outset <num value="2">two</num> results of a movement whose essence was so intangible and ideal were practically inevitable: <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that it should be misunderstood and misinterpreted by those who viewed it from outside; and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, that it should lead to excesses among the initiated themselves which would lend colour and, in a measure, justification to its critics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4206"/>So quickly, indeed, did these results appear that to the public the word <quote>transcendental</quote> soon came to mean, to all intents and purposes, <quote>transcending common sense,</quote> and this use of the term gained added sanction from the difficulty of distinguishing sharply between transcendentalism and other currents of social and religious unrest then pulsing through <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4207"/>Some notion of the varieties of <quote>dissent</quote> and <quote>reform</quote> contending at that time for public attention is conveyed in <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0187.0018.00336.03566" reg="nearbymention:Emerson,Waldo,,,"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName>'s description of the <rs type="place">Chardon Street</rs> Convention which was held in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct>: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4210"/>The stories told of him, to be sure, were often outright inventions or gross exaggerations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4215"/>For <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> this was his chief vocation, and it is interesting to note that toward the end of this period he came in contact with <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> <persName><foreName>Quakers</foreName></persName>, whose religious views seem to have influenced his thinking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4218"/>He believed in the plenary inspiration of childhood, and his method may be described as an attempt to realize in practice the thought of <persName n="Wordsworth,,,,," id="n0187.0018.00337.03573" reg="mostcommon:Wordsworth,nomatch:0"><surname>Wordsworth</surname></persName>'s ode on the <title>Intimations of immortality</title>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4219"/>The publication of some of his conversations with his pupils, owing to their references to the phenomena of birth, brought adverse criticism and tended to impair the prosperity of the school.
