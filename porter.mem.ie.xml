<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>The object aimed at in this narrative is to recount the daily acts of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0034.0001.00000.00002" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,:7"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> in the field, to describe minutely his personal traits and habits, and to explain the motives which actuated him in important crises by giving his criticisms upon events in the language employed by him at the time they took place. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>The chief effort of the author has been to enable readers to view the <rs>Union</rs> commander near by, and to bring them into such intimate contact with him that they may know him as familiarly as those who served by his side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>It has been no part of the author's purpose to give a detailed history of the campaigns referred to, but to describe the military movements only so far as necessary to show <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0034.0001.00000.00003" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,:7"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s intentions and plans and the general results of his operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Mention of particular commands, subordinate commanders, and topographical features, therefore, had to be in large measure omitted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>While serving as a personal aid to the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs> the author early acquired the habit of making careful and elaborate notes of everything of interest which came under his observation, and these reminiscences are simply a transcript of memoranda jotted down at the time. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>While sitting in my quarters in the little town of <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga, Tennessee</placeName>, about an hour after nightfall, <dateStruct value="1863-10-23"><day type="name">Friday</day>, <month reg="10">October</month> <day reg="23">23</day>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, an orderly brought me a message from <persName n="Thomas,General,George,H.,," id="n0034.0002.00001.00009" reg="default:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Commander">Commander</rs> of the <orgName n="Army of the Cumberland" type="army">Army of the Cumberland</orgName>, on whose staff I was serving, summoning me to headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>A storm had been raging for <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure>, and a chilling rain was still falling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>A few minutes' walk brought me to the plain wooden, <num value="1">one</num>-story dwelling occupied by the commander, which was situated on <address><street n="Walnut street">Walnut street</street></address>, near <num value="4" type="ordinal">Fourth</num>, and upon my arrival I found him in the front room on the left side of the hall, with <num value="3">three</num> members of his staff and several strange officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>In an arm-chair facing the fireplace was seated a general officer, slight in figure and of medium stature, whose face bore an expression of weariness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>He was <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> carelessly dressed, and his uniform coat was unbuttoned and thrown back from his chest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>He held a lighted cigar in his mouth, and sat in a stooping posture, with his head bent slightly forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>His clothes were wet, and his trousers and top-boots were spattered with mud. <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0034.0002.00002.00010" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName> approached this officer, and, turning to me and mentioning me by name, said, <quote>I want to present you to <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0034.0002.00002.00011" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,:7"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Thereupon the officer seated in the chair, without changing his position, glanced up, extended his arm to its full length, shook hands, and said in a low voice, and speaking slowly, <quote>How do you do?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>This was my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meeting with the man with whom I was destined afterward to spend so many of the most interesting years of my life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The strange officers present were members of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0034.0002.00002.00012" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,:7"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The next morning he sent a despatch to the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, beginning with the words, <quote><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0034.0002.00002.00014" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> arrived last night, wet, dirty, and well.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>About a month before, that army, after having fought at <placeName reg="Chickamauga, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,7013598">Chickamauga</placeName> <num value="1">one</num> of the most gallantly contested and sanguinary battles in the annals of warfare, had fallen back and taken up a defensive position on the south side of the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee River</placeName>, inclosing within its lines the village of <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The opposing forces, under <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n0034.0002.00002.00016" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>, had invested this position, and established such a close siege that the lines of supply had been virtually cut off, rations <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> and forage were about exhausted, and almost the last tree-stump had been used for fuel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Most of the men were without overcoats, and some without shoes; <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> animals had died of starvation, and the gloom and despondency had been increased by the approach of cold weather and the appearance of the autumn storms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/><persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0034.0002.00003.00017" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, upon assuming the responsibilities of his new command, had fully realized the critical condition of the <orgName n="Army of the Cumberland" type="army">Army of the Cumberland</orgName>, and had set out at once for its headquarters to take charge in person of its future operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>On his way to the front he had telegraphed <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0034.0002.00003.00018" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, from <placeName reg="Louisville, Jefferson, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013915">Louisville</placeName>, to hold <placeName key="tgn,7017496" n="1.000 4" reg="chattanooga, hamilton, tennessee">Chattanooga</placeName> at all hazards, to which that intrepid soldier made the famous reply, <quote>I will hold the town till we starve.</quote>

<p><persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0034.0002.00003.00019" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> had started, the day before the incident I have described, from <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName>, a place <placeName><distance reg="30miles">thirty miles</distance> below <placeName key="tgn,7017496" n="1.000 4" reg="chattanooga, hamilton, tennessee">Chattanooga</placeName></placeName>, where the <orgName n="Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad" type="railroad">Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad</orgName> crosses the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee River</placeName>, and had ridden by way of <placeName reg="Walden Ridge, Tennessee" key="tgn,2747976">Walden's Ridge</placeName>, the only route left open by which communication could be had with the beleaguered town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>We had been advised that he was on his way, but hardly expected that he would reach <placeName key="tgn,7017496" n="1.000 4" reg="chattanooga, hamilton, tennessee">Chattanooga</placeName> that night, considering the state of the weather, the wretched condition of the roads, or rather bridle-paths, over the mountain, and the severe injury to his leg which had been caused by a fall of his horse several weeks before, and from which he was still suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>When he arrived he had to be lifted from his saddle, and was evidently experiencing much pain, as his horse had slipped in coming down the mountain, and had further injured the lame leg; but the general showed less signs of fatigue than might have been supposed after his hard ride of <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> under such trying circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><pb id="p.4" n="4"/> </p> 
<p>As soon as <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0034.0002.00004.00020" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> had partaken of a light supper immediately after his arrival, <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0034.0002.00004.00021" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName> had sent for several general officers and most of the members of his staff to come to headquarters, and the room soon contained an exceedingly interesting group.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>A member of <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0034.0002.00004.00022" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName>'s staff quietly called that officer's attention to the fact that the distinguished guest's clothes were pretty wet and his boots were thoroughly soaked with rain after his long ride through the storm, and intimated that colds were usually no respecters of persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/><persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0034.0002.00004.00023" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName>'s mind had been so intent upon receiving the commander, and arranging for a conference of officers, that he had entirely overlooked his guest's travel-stained condition; but as soon as his attention was called to it, all of his old-time <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> hospitality was aroused, and he at once begged his newly arrived chief to step into a bedroom and change his clothes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>His urgings, however, were in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The general thanked him politely, but positively declined to make any additions to his personal comfort, except to light a fresh cigar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Afterward, however, he consented to draw his chair nearer to the wood fire which was burning in the chimney-place, and to thrust his feet forward to give his top-boots a chance to dry. The extent of his indulgence in personal comfort in the field did not seem to be much greater than that of bluff old <persName n="Suvaroff,Marshal,,,," id="n0034.0002.00004.00024" reg="mostcommon:Suvaroff,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Marshal">Marshal</roleName> <surname>Suvaroff</surname></persName>, who, when he wished to give himself over to an excess of luxury, used to go so far as to take off <num value="1">one</num> spur before going to bed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>At <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0034.0002.00004.00025" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s request, <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0034.0002.00004.00026" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, <persName n="Smith,General,William,F.,," id="n0034.0002.00004.00027" reg="default:Smith,William,F.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, his chief engineer, commonly known in the army as <quote><persName n="Baldy,,,,," id="n0034.0002.00004.00028" reg="mostcommon:Baldy,nomatch:0"><surname>Baldy</surname></persName></quote> <persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n0034.0002.00004.00029" reg="nearbymention:Smith,William,F.,,"><surname>Smith</surname></persName>, and others, pointed out on a large map the various positions of the troops, and described the general situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>After a while he straightened himself up in his chair, his features assumed an air of animation, and in a tone of voice which manifested a deep interest in the discussion, he began to fire whole volleys of questions at the officers present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>So intelligent were his inquiries, and so pertinent his suggestions, that he made a profound impression upon every <num value="1">one</num> by the quickness of his perception and the knowledge which he had already acquired regarding important details of the army's condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>His questions showed from the outset that his mind was dwelling not only upon the prompt opening of a line of supplies, but upon taking the offensive against the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>In this he was only manifesting <num value="1">one</num> of his chief military characteristics &mdash; an inborn dislike to be thrown upon the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Even when he had to defend a position, his method of warfare was always that of the <quote>offensive-defensive.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/></p> 
<p>After talking over a plan for communicating with our base of supplies, or, as he called it in his conversation, <quote>opening up the cracker line,</quote> an operation which already had been projected and for which preliminary steps had been taken, he turned to me as chief of ordnance of the <orgName n="Army of the Cumberland" type="army">Army of the Cumberland</orgName>, and asked, <quote>How much ammunition is there on hand</quote> I replied, <quote>There is barely enough here to fight <num value="1">one</num> day's battle, but an ample supply has been accumulated at <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName> to await the opening of communications.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/></p> 
<p>At about <time value="9:30oclock">half-past 9 o'clock</time> he appeared to have finished his search after information for the time being, and turning to a table, began to write telegrams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Communication by wire had been kept open during all the siege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> despatch was to <persName n="Halleck,General,,,," id="n0034.0002.00005.00031" reg="nearbymention:Halleck,H.,W.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Halleck</surname></persName>, the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and read: <quote>Have just arrived; I will write to-morrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Please approve <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> order placing <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0034.0002.00006.00032" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,Billy,,,:2"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> in command of <orgName n="Department of the Tennessee" type="department">Department of the Tennessee</orgName>, with headquarters in the field.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>He had scarcely begun to exercise the authority conferred upon him by his new promotion when his mind turned to securing advancement for <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0034.0002.00006.00033" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,Billy,,,:2"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, who had been his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> in command in the <orgName n="Army of the Tennessee" type="army">Army of the Tennessee</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>It was more than an hour later when he retired to bed in an adjoining room to get a much-needed rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>As he arose and walked across the floor his lameness was very perceptible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Before the company departed he had made an appointment with <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n0034.0002.00006.00034" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName> and <persName n="Smith,General,,,," id="n0034.0002.00006.00035" reg="nearbymention:Smith,William,F.,,"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Smith</surname></persName> and several staff-officers to accompany him the next day to make a personal inspection of the lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Early on the morning of the <num value="24" type="ordinal">24th</num> the party set out from headquarters, and most of the day was spent in examining our lines and obtaining a view of the enemy's position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>At <placeName reg="Brown's Ferry">Brown's Ferry</placeName> <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0034.0002.00006.00036" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> dismounted and went to the river's edge on foot, and made his reconnaissance of that important part of the line in full view of the enemy's pickets on the opposite bank, but, singularly enough, he was not fired upon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Being informed that the general wished to see me that evening, I went into the room he was occupying at headquarters, and found <num value="2">two</num> of his staff-officers seated near him. As I entered he gave a slight nod of the head by way of recognition, and pointing to a chair, said rather bluntly, but politely, <quote>Sit down.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>In reply to a question which he asked, I gave him some information he desired in regard to the character and location of certain heavy guns which I had recently assisted in putting in position on the advanced portion of our lines, and the kind and amount of artillery ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>He soon after began to write despatches, and I arose to go, but resumed my seat as he said, <quote>Sit still.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>My attention <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> was soon attracted to the manner in which he went to work at his correspondence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>At this time, as throughout his later career, he wrote nearly all his documents with his own hand, and seldom dictated to any <num value="1">one</num> even the most unimportant despatch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>His work was performed swiftly and uninterruptedly, but without any marked display of nervous energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>His thoughts flowed as freely from his mind as the ink from his pen; he was never at a loss for an expression, and seldom interlined a word or made a material correction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>He sat with his head bent low over the table, and when he had occasion to step to another table or desk to get a paper he wanted, he would glide rapidly across the room without straightening himself, and return to his seat with his body still bent over at about the same angle at which he had been sitting when he left his chair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Upon this occasion he tossed the sheets of paper across the table as he finished them, leaving them in the wildest disorder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>When he had completed the despatch, he gathered up the scattered sheets, read them over rapidly, and arranged them in their proper order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Turning to me after a time, he said, <quote>Perhaps you might like to read what I am sending.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Some of the earliest pictures purporting to be photographs of him had been manufactured when he was at the distant front, never stopping in <num value="1">one</num> place long enough to be <quote>focused.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>Nothing daunted, the practisers of that art which is the chief solace of the vain had photographed a burly beef-contractor, and spread the pictures broadcast as representing the determined, but rather robust, features of the coming hero, and it was some time before the real photographs which followed <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> were believed to be genuine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>False impressions of him were derived, too, from the fact that he had come forth from a country leather store, and was famous chiefly for striking sledge-hammer blows in the field, and conducting relentless pursuits of his foes through the swamps of the <rs>Southwest</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>His eyes were dark-gray, and were the most expressive of his features.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Like nearly all men who speak little, he was a good listener; but his face gave little indication of his thoughts, and it was the expression of his eyes which furnished about the only response to the speaker who conversed with him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>His &mdash; mouth, like <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>'s, was of the letter-box shape, the contact of the lips forming a nearly horizontal line.

The firmness with which the general's square-shaped jaws were set when his features were in repose was highly expressive of his force of character and the strength of his will-power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>His hair and beard were of a chestnut-brown color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>The beard was worn full, no part of the face being shaved, but, like the hair, was always kept closely and neatly trimmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>In his case it was small, and located on the right side just above the line of the beard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>His face was not perfectly symmetrical, the left eye being a very little lower than the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>His brow was high, broad, and rather square, and was creased with several horizontal wrinkles, which helped to emphasize the serious and somewhat careworn look which was never absent from his countenance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>This expression, however, was in no wise an indication of his nature, which was always buoyant, cheerful, and hopeful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>He never carried his body erect, and having no ear for music or rhythm, he never kept step to the airs played by the bands, no matter how vigorously the bass drums emphasized the accent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>When walking in company there was no attempt to keep step with others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>In conversing he usually employed only <num value="2">two</num> gestures; <num value="1">one</num> was the stroking of his chin beard with his left hand; the other was the raising and lowering of his right hand, and resting it at intervals upon his knee or a table, the hand being held with the fingers close together and the knuckles bent, so that the back of the hand and fingers formed a right angle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>When not pressed by any matter of importance he was often slow in his movements, but when roused to activity he was quick in every motion, and worked with marvelous rapidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>He was civil to all who came in contact with him, and never attempted to snub any <num value="1">one</num>, or treat <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> anybody with less consideration on account of his inferiority in rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>A few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> to the west, and in the northwest angle formed by the two intersecting roads, was a knoll from which the old trees had been cut, and upon which was a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> growth of scraggy pine, scrub-oak, and other timber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>The knoll was high enough to afford a view for some little distance, but the outlook was limited in all directions by the almost impenetrable forest with its interlacing trees and tangled undergrowth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>At <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time> <pb id="p.63" n="63"/> the enemy had been completely repulsed, and fell back, leaving a large number of his dead and wounded on the field. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>While the most critical movements were taking place, <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0034.0005.00063.00440" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> manifested no perceptible anxiety, but gave his orders, and sent and received communications, with a coolness and deliberation which made a marked impression upon those who had been brought into contact with him for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time on the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>His speech was never hurried, and his manner betrayed no trace of excitability or even impatience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>He never exhibited to better advantage his peculiar ability in moving troops with unparalleled speed to the critical points on the line of battle where they were most needed, or, as it was sometimes called, <quote>feeding a fight.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>There was a spur on the heel of every order he sent, and his subordinates were made to realize that in battle it is the minutes which control events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>He said, while waiting for <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n0034.0005.00063.00441" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> to get into position and attack: <quote>The only time I ever feel impatient is when I give an order for an important movement of troops in the presence of the enemy, and am waiting for them to reach their destination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>Then the minutes seem like hours.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>He rode out to important points of the line twice during the day, in company with <persName n="Meade,General,,,," id="n0034.0005.00063.00442" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName> and <num value="2">two</num> officers of the staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>It was noticed that he was visibly affected by his proximity to the wounded, and especially <pb id="p.64" n="64"/> by the sight of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>He would turn his face away from such scenes, and show by the expression of his countenance, and sometimes by a pause in his conversation, that he felt most keenly the painful spectacle presented by the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>Some reference was made to the subject in camp that evening, and the general said: <quote>I cannot bear the sight of suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>The night after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day's fight at <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName> I was sitting on the ground, leaning against a tree, trying to get some sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>It soon began to rain so hard that I went into a log-house near by to seek shelter; but I found the surgeons had taken possession of it, and were amputating the arms and legs of the wounded, and blood was flowing in streams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>I could not endure such a scene, and was glad to return to the tree outside, and sit there till morning in the storm.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>I thought of this remark while sitting by his bedside <measure n="21years" type="date">twenty-one years</measure> afterward, when he, in the last days of his fatal illness, was himself undergoing supreme physical torture. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>As the general felt that he could be found more readily, and could issue his orders more promptly, from the central point which he had chosen for his headquarters, he remained there almost the entire day. He would at times walk slowly up and down, but most of the day he sat upon the stump of a tree, or on the ground, with his back leaning against a tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>The thread gloves remained on his hands, a lighted cigar was in his mouth almost constantly, and his penknife was kept in active use whittling sticks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>He would pick up <num value="1">one</num> small twig after another, and sometimes holding the small end away from him would rapidly shave it down to a point; at other times he would turn the point toward him and work on it as if sharpening a lead-pencil; then he would girdle it, cut it in <num value="2">two</num>, throw it away, and begin on another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>We had long been accused <pb id="p.65" n="65"/> of being a nation of whittlers, and this practice on the part of such a conspicuous representative American seemed to give color to the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>He seldom indulged in this habit in subsequent battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>The occupation played sad havoc with the thread gloves, and before nightfall several holes had been worn in them, from which his finger-nails protruded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>After that day the gloves disappeared, and the general thereafter went without them in camp, and wore the usual buckskin gauntlets when on horseback.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>It was not till the <rs n="Appomattox Campaign" type="campaign">Appomattox campaign</rs> that another pair of thread gloves was donned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>There was a mystery about the use of those gloves which was never entirely solved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>The impression was that <persName n="Grant,Mrs.,,,," id="n0034.0005.00065.00443" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> had purchased them, and handed them to the general before he started from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and that, either in deference to her, or because he had a notion that the officers in the <rs>Eastern</rs> armies were greater sticklers for dress than those in the armies of the <rs>West</rs>, he wore the gloves continuously for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> of his opening campaign in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>; that is to say, as long as they lasted under the wear and tear to which he subjected them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>His confidence was never for a moment shaken in the outcome of the general engagement in the <rs>Wilderness</rs>, and he never once doubted his ability to make a forward movement as the result of that battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>At a critical period of the day he sent instructions to have all the pontoon-bridges over the <rs>Rapidan</rs> in his rear taken up, except the <num value="1">one</num> at <placeName reg="Germanna Ford">Germanna Ford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>A short time after giving this order he called <persName n="Rawlins,General,,,," id="n0034.0005.00065.00444" reg="mostcommon:Rawlins,John,A.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Rawlins</surname></persName>, <persName n="Babcock,Colonel,,,," id="n0034.0005.00065.00445" reg="mostcommon:Babcock,E.,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Babcock</surname></persName>, and me to him, and asked for a map. As we sat together on the ground, his legs tucked under him, tailor fashion, he looked over the map, and said: <quote>I do not hope to gain any very decided advantage from the fighting in this forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>I did expect excellent results from <pb id="p.66" n="66"/> <persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n0034.0005.00066.00446" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,W.,S.,,:1"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName>'s movement early this morning, when he started the enemy on the run; but it was impossible for him to see his own troops, or the true position of the enemy, and the success gained could not be followed up in such a country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>I can certainly drive <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0034.0005.00066.00447" reg="mostcommon:Lee,R.,E.,,:5"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> back into his works, but I shall not assault him there; he would have all the advantage in such a fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>If he falls back and intrenches, my notion is to move promptly toward the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>This will, in all probability, compel him to try and throw himself between us and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and in such a movement I hope to be able to attack him in a more open country, and outside of his breastworks.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>This was the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time only that he had looked at the maps since crossing the <rs>Rapidan</rs>, and it was always noticeable in a campaign how seldom he consulted them, compared with the constant examination of them by most other prominent commanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>The explanation of it is that he had an extraordinary memory as to anything that was presented to him graphically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>After looking critically at a map of a locality, it seemed to become photographed indelibly upon his brain, and he could follow its features without referring to it again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>Besides, he possessed an almost intuitive knowledge of topography, and never became confused as to the points of the compass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>He was a natural <quote>bushwhacker,</quote> and was never so much at home as when finding his way by the course of streams, the contour of the hills, and the general features of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>I asked him, <num value="1">one</num> day, whether he had ever been deceived as to the points of the compass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>He said: <quote>Only once-when I arrived at <placeName reg="Cairo, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo, Illinois</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>The effect of that curious bend in the river turned me completely around, and when the sun came up the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> morning after I got there, it seemed to me that it rose directly in the west.</quote>

<p>During a lull in the battle late in the afternoon, General <pb id="p.67" n="67"/> <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0034.0005.00067.00448" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, in company with <num value="2">two</num> staff-officers, strolled over toward the <placeName reg="Germanna">Germanna</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>While we stood on the bank of a small rivulet, a drove of beef-cattle was driven past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/><num value="1">One</num> of the animals strayed into the stream, and had evidently made up its mind to part company with its fellows and come over to our side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/><num value="1">One</num> of the drovers yelled out to the general, who was a little in advance of his officers: <quote>I say, stranger, head off that beef-critter for me, will you?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>The general, having always prided himself upon being a practical farmer, felt as much at home in handling cattle as in directing armies, and without changing countenance at once stepped forward, threw up his hands, and shouted to the animal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>It stopped, took a look at him, and then, as if sufficiently impressed with this show of authority, turned back into the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>The general made no comment whatever upon this incident, and seemed to think no more about the salutation he had received than if some <num value="1">one</num> had presented arms to him. He knew, of course, that the man did not recognize him. If he had supposed the man was lacking in proper military respect, he would perhaps have administered to him the same lesson which he once taught a soldier in the <orgName type="regiment" key="IL21">Twenty-first Illinois</orgName>; when he commanded that regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>An officer who had served under him at the time told me that <persName n="Grant,Colonel,,,," id="n0034.0005.00067.00449" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, as he came out of his tent <num value="1">one</num> morning, found a strapping big fellow posted as sentinel, who nodded his head good-naturedly, smiled blandly, and said, <quote>Howdy, colonel?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>His commander cried, <quote>Hand me your piece,</quote> and upon taking it, faced the soldier and came to a <quote>present arms</quote> ; then handing back the musket, he remarked, <quote>That is the way to say <q direct="unspecified">How do you do</q> to your colonel.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/></p> 
<p>It was now about sundown; the storm of battle which had raged with unabated fury from early dawn had <pb id="p.68" n="68"/> been succeeded by a calm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>The contemplated general attack at <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time> had been abandoned on account of the assault of the enemy on <persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n0034.0005.00068.00450" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,W.,S.,,:1"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName>'s front, and the difficulty of perfecting the alinements and supplying the men with ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>It was felt that the day's strife had ended, unless <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0034.0005.00068.00451" reg="mostcommon:Lee,R.,E.,,:5"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> should risk another attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>Just then the stillness was broken by heavy volleys of musketry on our extreme right, which told that <persName n="Sedgwick,,,,," id="n0034.0005.00068.00452" reg="mostcommon:Sedgwick,nomatch:0"><surname>Sedgwick</surname></persName> had been assaulted, and was actually engaged with the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>The attack against which the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs> during the day had ordered every precaution to be taken had now been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>Darkness had set in, but the firing still continued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>Aides came galloping in from the right, laboring under intense excitement, <pb id="p.69" n="69"/> talking wildly, and giving the most exaggerated reports of the engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>Without the change of a muscle of his face, or the slightest alteration in the tones of his voice, he quietly interrogated the officers who brought the reports; then, sifting out the truth from the mass of exaggerations, he gave directions for relieving the situation with the marvelous rapidity which was always characteristic of him when directing movements in the face of an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>Reinforcements were hurried to the point attacked, and preparations made for <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Sedgwick,,,,," id="n0034.0005.00069.00472" reg="mostcommon:Sedgwick,nomatch:0"><surname>Sedgwick</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> to take up a new line, with the front and right thrown back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>A general officer came in from his command at this juncture, and said to the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs>, speaking rapidly and laboring under considerable excitement: <quote><persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0034.0005.00069.00474" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, this is a crisis that cannot be looked upon too seriously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>I believe the chief reason why he was more successful than others was that while they were thinking so much about what the enemy was going to do, <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0034.0005.00070.00480" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was thinking all the time about what he was going to do himself.</quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>As the staff-officers threw themselves upon the <pb id="p.72" n="72"/> ground that night, sleep came to them without coaxing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>They had been on the move since dawn, galloping over bad roads, struggling about through forest openings, jumping rivulets, wading swamps, helping to rally troops, dodging bullets, and searching for commanding officers in all sorts of unknown places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>Their horses had been crippled, and they themselves were well-nigh exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>For the small part I had been able to perform in the engagement, the general recommended me for the brevet rank of major in the regular army, <quote>for gallant and meritorious services.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>The undergrowth stayed their progress, the upper growth shut out the light of heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>Officers could rarely see their troops for any considerable distance, for smoke clouded the vision, and a heavy sky obscured the sun. Directions were ascertained and lines established by means of the pocket-compass, and a change of position often presented an operation more like a problem of ocean navigation than a question of military maneuvers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>It was the sense of sound and of touch rather than the sense of sight which guided the movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>It was a battle fought with the ear, and not with the eye. All circumstances seemed to combine to make the scene <num value="1">one</num> of unutterable horror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>At times <pb id="p.73" n="73"/> the wind howled through the tree-tops, mingling its moans with the groans of the dying, and heavy branches were cut off by the fire of the artillery, and fell crashing upon the heads of the men, adding a new terror to battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>Forest fires raged; ammunition-trains exploded; the dead were roasted in the conflagration; the wounded, roused by its hot breath, dragged themselves along, with their torn and mangled limbs, in the mad energy of despair, to escape the ravages of the flames; and every bush seemed hung with shreds of blood-stained clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>A fog, combined with the smoke from the smoldering forest fires, rendered it difficult for those of us who were sent to make reconnaissances to see any great distance, even where there were openings in the forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>I said: <quote>I think it was last night, when the attack was made on our right.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>He did not follow up the subject, for he always spoke with great reluctance about anything which was distinctly personal to himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>The only way in which we could ever draw him out, and induce him to talk about events in his military career, was to make some misstatement intentionally about an occurrence.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>An officer related to the general an incident of the attack the night before, which showed that even the gravest events have a comical side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>In the efforts to strengthen our light, a number of teamsters had been ordered into the ranks and sent hurriedly to the front.

<p>After leaving the breakfast-table, the general lighted a cigar and took his seat on a camp-stool in front of his tent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>In a conversation with the staff he then began to discuss the operations of the day before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>He expressed himself as satisfied with the result in the main, saying: <quote>While it is in <num value="1">one</num> sense a drawn battle, as neither side has gained or lost ground substantially since the fighting began, yet we remain in possession of the field, and the forces opposed to us have withdrawn to a distance from our front and taken up a defensive position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>We cannot call the engagement a positive victory, but the enemy have only twice actually reached our lines in their many attacks, and have not gained a single advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>This will enable me to carry out my intention of moving to the left, and compelling the enemy to fight in a more open country and outside of their breastworks.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/></p> 
<p>An old officer who was passing by, an acquaintance of the general's, now stepped up to the group.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>He had recently been ordered in from the plains, and his wild tales of red-handed slaughter in the land of the savages had already made him known in the army as the <quote>Injun-slayer.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>An aide remarked to him, <quote>Well, as you've been spoiling for a fight ever since you joined this army, how did yesterday's set &mdash; to strike you by way of a skirmish</quote> <quote>Oh,</quote> was the reply, <quote>you had large numbers engaged, and heavy losses; but it was n't the <pb id="p.77" n="77"/> picturesque, desperate hand-to-hand fighting that you see when you're among the <name>Injuns</name>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/><quote>No; but we got in some pretty neat work on the white man,</quote> said the aide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/><quote>Yes; but it didn't compare with the time the <rs>Nez Perces</rs> and the <rs>Shoshonee</rs> tribes had their big battle,</quote> continued the veteran.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/><quote>Why, how was that?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>cried all present in a chorus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/><quote>Well, you see,</quote> explained the narrator, <quote><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the <rs>Nez Perces</rs> set up a yell louder than a blast of <persName><foreName>Gabriel</foreName></persName>'s trumpet, and charged straight across the valley; but the <name>Shoshonees</name> stood their ground without budging an inch, and pretty soon they went for the <rs>Nez Perces</rs> and drove 'em back again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>As soon as the <rs>Nez Perces</rs> could catch their breath they took another turn at the <name>Shoshonees</name>, and shoved them back just about where they started from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>By this time the ground between 'em was so covered by the killed and wounded that you could n't see as much as a blade of grass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>But still they kept on charging back and forth across that valley, and they moved so fast that when their lines of battle passed me, the wind they made was so strong that I had to hold my hat on with both hands, and once I came mighty near being blown clear off my feet.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/><quote>Why, where were <hi rend="italics">you</hi> all this time?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>asked several voices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/><quote>Why,</quote> remarked an officer, <quote>I should think they would have killed you in the scrimmage.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>Then the face of the veteran of the plains assumed an air of offended innocence, and in a tone of voice which made it painfully evident that he felt the hurt, he said, <quote>What?-the <name>Injuns</name>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/><rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, they all knew <hi rend="italics">me</hi>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>The general joined in the smiles which followed this bit of sadly mutilated truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>Similar Munchausenisms, indulged in from time to time by this officer, demonstrated the fact that he had become so skilled in warping veracity <pb id="p.78" n="78"/> that <num value="1">one</num> of his lies could make truth look mean alongside of it, and he finally grew so untrustworthy that it was unsafe even to believe the contrary of what he said. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>Troops know but little about what is going on in a large army, except the occurrences which take place in their immediate vicinity; but this night ride of the general-in-chief told plainly the story of success, and gave each man to understand that the cry was to be <quote>On to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>Soldiers weary and sleepy after their long battle, with stiffened limbs and smarting wounds, now sprang to their feet, forgetful of their pains, and rushed forward to the roadside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>Wild cheers echoed through the forest, and glad shouts of triumph rent the air. Men swung their hats, tossed up their arms, and pressed forward to within touch of their chief, clapping their hands, and speaking to him with the familiarity of comrades.

As I was mounting the general added: <quote>I had started to write a note to <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n0034.0007.00093.00626" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>; just wait a moment, and I'll finish it, and you can deliver it to him.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>He stepped into his tent, and returned in a few minutes and handed me the note.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>I set out at once at a gallop toward our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/><num value="1">One</num> was a circuitous route some distance in rear of our lines; the other was much shorter, but under the enemy's fire for quite a distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>The latter was chosen on account of the time which would thereby be saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>When the exposed part of the road was reached, I adopted the method to which aides so often resorted when they had <pb id="p.94" n="94"/> to take the chances of getting through with a message, and when those chances were not particularly promising-putting the horse on a run, and throwing the body down along his neck on the opposite side from the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>Although the bullets did considerable execution in clipping the limbs of the trees and stirring up the earth, they were considerate enough to skip me. The horse was struck, but only slightly, and I succeeded in reaching <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n0034.0007.00094.00628" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> rather ahead of schedule time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>His headquarters had been established on the north side of the river <rs>Ny</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1746"/>The general considered the question not only from a military standpoint, but he took a still broader view of the situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1747"/>The expenses of the war had reached nearly <measure n="4000000dollars" type="currency">four million dollars</measure> a day. Many of the people in the <rs>North</rs> were becoming discouraged at the prolongation of the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1748"/>If the army were transferred <pb id="p.173" n="173"/> south of the <rs>James</rs> without fighting a battle on the north side, people would be impatient at the prospect of an apparently indefinite continuation of operations; and as the sickly season of summer was approaching, the deaths from disease among the troops meanwhile would be greater than any possible loss encountered in the contemplated attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1749"/>The loss from sickness on the part of the enemy would naturally be less, as his troops were acclimated and ours were not.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1750"/>Delays are usually dangerous, and there was at present too much at stake to admit of further loss of time in ending the war, if it could be avoided. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>It has been stated by inimical critics that the men had become demoralized by the many assaults in which they had been engaged; that they had lost much of their spirit, and were even insubordinate, refusing to move against the earthworks in obedience to the orders of their immediate commanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1843"/>The general-in-chief realized that he was in a swampy and sickly portion of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1844"/>The malaria was highly productive of disease, and the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> fever was dreaded by all the troops who had a recollection of its ravages when they campaigned in that section of the country <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/>The operations had been so active that precautions against sickness had necessarily been much neglected, and the general was anxious, while giving the men some rest, to improve the sanitary conditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>By dint of extraordinary exertions the camps were well policed, and large quantities of fresh vegetables were brought forward and distributed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>Cattle were received in much better condition than those which had made long marches and had furnished beef which was far from being wholesome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>Greater attention was demanded in the cooking of the food and the procuring of better water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1849"/>Dead animals and offal were buried, and more stringent sanitary regulations were enforced throughout the entire command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1850"/>What was most distressing at this time was the condition of affairs at the extreme front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1851"/>No <num value="1">one</num> who did not witness the sights on those portions of the line where the opposing troops were in exceptionally close contact can form an idea of the sufferings experienced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1852"/>Staff-officers used to work their way on foot daily to the advanced points, so as to be able to report with accuracy these harrowing scenes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1853"/>Some of the sights <pb id="p.184" n="184"/> were not unlike those of the <quote>bloody angle</quote> at <placeName key="tgn,2114316" n="1.000 8" reg="spotsylvania, spotsylvania, virginia">Spottsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1854"/>Between the lines where the heavy assaults had been made there was in some places a distance of <num value="30">thirty</num> or <measure n="40yards" type="distance">forty yards</measure> completely covered by the dead and wounded of both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/>The bodies of the dead were festering in the sun, while the wounded were dying a torturing death from starvation, thirst, and loss of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>In some places the stench became sickening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/>Every attempt to make a change in the picket-line brought on heavy firing, as both sides had become nervous from long watchfulness, and the slightest movement on either front led to the belief that it was the beginning of an assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1858"/>In the night there was often <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName>-firing, sometimes accompanied by musketry, with a view to deterring the other side from attacking, or occasioned by false rumors of an attempt to assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/>The men on the advanced lines had to lie close to the ground in narrow trenches, with little water for drinking purposes, except that obtained from surface drainage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>They were subjected to the broiling heat by day and the chilling winds and fogs at night, and had to eat the rations that could be got to them under the greatest imaginable discomfort. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1861"/>The staff-officers, in their frequent visits to the front of our lines, had learned the most exposed points, and in passing them usually quickened their speed so as to be a shorter time under the enemy's fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1862"/>There was <num value="1">one</num> particularly dangerous place where a dirt road ran along the foot of a knoll on the side toward the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1863"/>A prominent citizen from the <rs type="place">Pacific coast</rs>, whom <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0034.0013.00184.01275" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> knew, had arrived from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and was spending a few days at headquarters to see what an army in the field looked like.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1864"/><num value="1">One</num> morning, as the general was mounting with a portion of his staff to make <num value="1">one</num> of his frequent reconnoitering trips along the <pb id="p.185" n="185"/> lines, the visitor proposed to ride with him, but said before starting: <quote>Is there going to be much shooting where you're going, general?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1865"/>For I've got a wife and children waiting for me on the <rs>Pacific</rs> slope, and I don't want to get pinked by the <rs>Johnny Rebs</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1866"/><quote>Well, they're not very particular over there where their shots strike when they begin firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1867"/>I always advise persons who have no business to transact with them to keep away,</quote> replied the general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/><quote>Yes; but I want to see as much of this show as possible, now that I've come here,</quote> said the guest; and mounting a horse which had been ordered up for him, he rode along with the party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>Pretty soon some stray artillery shots flew in our direction, but the visitor rode on without showing any signs of disturbance, except a very active ducking of the head, accompanied by a running comment upon the utter carelessness and waste of ammunition on the part of the enemy, and the evident disposition to mow down a mild-mannered and harmless civilian with as little hesitation as they would the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs> who was crowding them with all his armies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1870"/>After a while we came to the dangerous portion of the dirt road, and the staff-officers reminded the general that it was usually pretty hot there; but he passed over it at a walk without paying attention to the warning, and stopped at the most exposed point to examine the position in front, which seemed to him to present some features of importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>A battery instantly opened, and shot and shell shrieked through the air, and plowed the ground in a most enlivening manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1872"/>The visitor, whose head was now bobbing from <num value="1">one</num> side to the other like a signal-flag waving a message, cried out to the commander: <quote>See here, general; it don't appear to me that this place could have been selected by you with special reference to personal safety.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1873"/>The general was <pb id="p.186" n="186"/> absorbed in his examination of the ground, and made no reply for a minute or <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1874"/>Then, looking at his guest, who was growing red and pale by turns, and rolling nearly out of his saddle in dodging to tie right and left, remarked with a smile: <quote>You are giving yourself a great deal of useless exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1875"/>When you hear the sound of a shot it has already passed you.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1876"/>Just then a shell exploded close by, scattering the dirt in every direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1877"/>This was too great a trial for the overstrained nerves of the visitor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1878"/>He turned his horse's head to the rear, drove both spurs into the animal's flanks, and as he dashed away with the speed of a <persName n="Gilpin,,John,,," id="n0034.0013.00186.01276" reg="default:Gilpin,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Gilpin</surname></persName>, he cried back to us: <quote>I have a wife and family waiting for me, and I'm pressed for time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1879"/>Besides, I'm not much of a curiosity-seeker anyway.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1880"/>Just then his black silk hat blew off, but he did not stop to recover it, and was soon out of sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1881"/>He had evidently reached a state of mind when the best of hats appears to be of no special value. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1882"/>That evening in camp the general perpetrated a number of jokes at the visitor's expense, saying to him: <quote>Well, you appear to have won that race you entered your horse for this afternoon.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1883"/><quote>Yes,</quote> said the visitor; <quote>I seem to have got in <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1884"/><quote>Perhaps,</quote> continued the general, <quote>you felt like that soldier in <num value="1">one</num> of our retreats who, when asked by an officer where he was going, said: <q direct="unspecified">I'm trying to find the rear of this army, but it don't appear to have any.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1886"/><quote>I think,</quote> said the general, <quote>it must have been that high hat which attracted his attention.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1887"/><quote>Great Scott!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1888"/>screamed the visitor, springing from his camp-stool as if the enemy had again opened fire on him; <quote>do you know that that hat had a card in it with my name on?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1889"/>Holy smoke I <pb id="p.187" n="187"/> If the boys get hold of it, and give me away, and the news gets out to the <rs>Pacific</rs> slope, I'll be a dead duck in the next political campaign!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1891"/>He was fully impressed with its hazardous nature, but was perfectly confident that he could carry it out without encountering extraordinary risks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/>The army had to be withdrawn so quietly from its position that it would be able to gain a night's march before its absence should be discovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>The fact that the lines were within <num value="30">thirty</num> or <measure n="40yards" type="distance">forty yards</measure> of each other at some points made this an exceedingly delicate task.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/>Roads had to be constructed over the marshes leading to the lower <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, and bridges thrown over that stream preparatory to crossing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1895"/>The army was then to move to the <rs>James</rs>, and cross upon pontoon-bridges and improvised ferries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1896"/>This would involve a march of about <measure n="50miles" type="distance">fifty miles</measure> in order to reach <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n0034.0013.00187.01279" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s position, while <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0034.0013.00187.01280" reg="mostcommon:Lee,R.,E.,,:5"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, holding interior lines, could arrive there by a march of less than half that distance. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2158"/>It now came my turn to take a hand in managing the affairs of the mess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2159"/>The general, while he never complained, was still the most difficult person to cater for in the whole army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2160"/>About the only meat he enjoyed was beef, and this he could not eat unless it was so thoroughly well done that no appearance of blood could be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2161"/>If blood appeared in any meat which came on the table, the sight of it seemed entirely to destroy his appetite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2162"/>(This was the man <pb id="p.214" n="214"/> whose enemies delighted in calling him a butcher.) He enjoyed oysters and fruit, but these could not be procured on an active campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2165"/>Evidently he could never have been converted to cannabalism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2166"/>He did not miss much by declining to eat the chickens which were picked up on a campaign, for they were usually tough enough to create the suspicion that they had been hatched from hard-boiled eggs, and were so impenetrable that an officer said of <num value="1">one</num> of them that he could not even stick his fork through the gravy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2167"/>The general was fonder of cucumbers than of anything else, and often made his entire meal upon a sliced cucumber and a cup of coffee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2168"/>He always enjoyed corn, pork and beans, and <rs n="buckwheat cakes" type="product">buckwheat cakes</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2169"/>In fact, he seemed to be particularly fond of only the most indigestible dishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2170"/>He had been eating so little for several days just before I took my turn as caterer that I looked about to try to find some delicacy that would tempt his appetite, and after a good deal of pains succeeded in getting some sweetbreads sent down from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2171"/>They had been nicely cooked, and I announced them, when they came on the table, with an air of ill-disguised triumph; but he said: <quote>I hope these were not obtained especially for me, for I have a singular aversion to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2172"/>In my young days I used to eat them, not knowing exactly what part of the animal they came from; but as soon as I learned what they were my stomach rebelled against them, and I have never tasted them since.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2173"/></p> 
<p>When any fruit could be procured, it was placed on the table by way of helping to ornament it, and afterward used as dessert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2175"/>He used to do this in a sly way, like a child helping itself to some forbidden dish at the table, and afraid of being caught in the act.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2176"/><num value="1">One</num> of the reasons I do not enjoy dining out as much as I do at home is because I am compelled to sit through a long list of courses, few of which I eat, and to resist the constant temptation to taste a little fruit in the meanwhile to help pass away the time.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2179"/>He was always refined in his manners at table, and no matter how great was the hurry, or what were the circumstances of the occasion, he never violated the requirements of true politeness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2180"/>He ate less than any man in the army; sometimes the amount of food taken did not seem enough to keep a bird alive, and his meals were frugal enough to satisfy the tastes of the most avowed anchorite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2181"/>It so happened that no <num value="1">one</num> in the mess had any inclination to drink wine or spirits at meals, and none was carried among the mess's supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2182"/>The only beverage ever used at table besides tea and coffee was water, although on the march it was often taken from places which rendered it not the most palatable or healthful of drinks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2183"/>If a staff-officer wanted anything stronger he would carry some commissary whisky in a canteen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2184"/>Upon a few occasions, after a hard day's ride in stormy weather, the general joined the officers of the staff in taking a whisky toddy in the evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2185"/>He never offered liquor of any kind to visitors at headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2186"/>His hospitality consisted in inviting them to meals and to smoke cigars. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2431"/>The general had occupied himself continually during this anxious and exciting period in giving specific instructions by wire and messengers to meet the constantly changing conditions which were taking place from day to day and from hour to hour in the theater of military operations; and no despatches were ever of greater importance than those which were sent from headquarters at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2432"/>His powers of concentration of thought were often shown by the circumstances under which he wrote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2433"/>Nothing that went on around him, upon the field or in his quarters, could distract his attention or interrupt him. Sometimes, when his tent was filled with officers, talking and laughing at the top of their voices, he would turn to his table and write the most important communications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2434"/>There would then be an immediate <quote>Hush!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2435"/>and abundant excuses offered by the company; but he always insisted upon the conversation going on, and after a while his officers came to understand his wishes in this respect, to learn that noise was apparently a stimulus rather than a check to his flow of ideas, and to realize that nothing short of a general attack along the whole line could divert his thoughts from the subject upon which his mind was concentrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2436"/>In writing his style was vigorous and terse, with little of ornament; its most conspicuous characteristic was perspicuity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2437"/><persName n="Meade,General,,,," id="n0034.0017.00240.01652" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName>'s chief <pb id="p.241" n="241"/> of staff once said: <quote>There is <num value="1">one</num> striking feature about <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0034.0017.00241.01653" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s orders: no matter how hurriedly he may write them on the field, no <num value="1">one</num> ever has the slightest doubt as to their meaning, or ever has to read them over a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time to understand them.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2439"/>He had studied French at <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>, and picked up some knowledge of Spanish during the <rs>Mexican</rs> war; but he could not hold a conversation in either language, and rarely employed a foreign word in any of his writings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2440"/>His adjectives were few and well chosen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2441"/>No document which ever came from his hands was in the least degree pretentious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2442"/>He never laid claim to any knowledge he did not possess, and seemed to feel, with <persName n="Addison,,,,," id="n0034.0017.00241.01655" reg="mostcommon:Addison,nomatch:0"><surname>Addison</surname></persName>, that <quote>pedantry in learning is like hypocrisy in religion &mdash; a form of knowledge without the power of it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2443"/>He rarely indulged in metaphor, but when he did employ a figure of speech it was always expressive and graphic, as when he spoke of the commander at <placeName reg="Bermuda Hundred, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2110639">Bermuda Hundred</placeName> being <quote>in a bottle strongly corked,</quote> or referred to our armies at <num value="1">one</num> time moving <quote>like horses in a balky team, no <num value="2">two</num> ever pulling together.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2444"/>His style inclined to the epigrammatic without his being aware of it. There was scarcely a document written by him from which brief sentences could not be selected fit to be set in mottos or placed upon transparencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2445"/>As examples may be mentioned: <quote>I propose to move immediately upon your works</quote> ; <quote>I shall take no backward steps</quote> ; the famous <quote>I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer,</quote> and, later in his career, <quote>Let us have peace</quote> ; <quote>The best means of securing the repeal of an obnoxious law is its vigorous enforcement</quote> ; <quote>I shall have no policy to enforce against the will of the people</quote> ; and <quote>Let no guilty man escape.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2447"/>His military training had educated him to treat purely official documents with respect, and these were always handed over to <persName n="Bowers,Colonel,,,," id="n0034.0017.00242.01658" reg="mostcommon:Bowers,T.,S.,,:2"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Bowers</surname></persName>, the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">adjutant-general</rs>, to be properly filed; but as to his private letters, he made his coat-pockets a general depository for his correspondence until they could hold no more, and then he discharged their contents upon his desk in a chaotic mass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2448"/>The military secretaries made heroic struggles to bring about some order in this department, and generally saw that copies were kept of all letters of importance which the chief wrote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2449"/>Whatever came from his pen was grammatically correct, well punctuated, and seldom showed an error in spelling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2450"/>In the field he never had a dictionary in his possession, and when in doubt about the orthography of a word, he was never known to write it <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> on a separate slip of paper to see how it looked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2451"/>He spelled with heroic audacity, and <quote>chanced it</quote> on the correctness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2452"/>While in rare instances he made a mistake in doubling the consonants where unnecessary, or in writing a single consonant where <num value="2">two</num> were required, he really spelled with great accuracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2453"/>His <pb id="p.243" n="243"/> pronunciation was seldom, if ever, at fault, though in <num value="2">two</num> words he had a peculiar way of pronouncing the letter d: he always pronounced corduroy <quote>corjuroy,</quote> and immediately <quote>immejetly.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2533"/>He never consumed his time in reading over court-martial proceedings, or figuring up the items of supplies on hand, or writing unnecessary letters or communications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2534"/>He held subordinates to a strict accountability in the performance of such duties, and kept his own time for thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2535"/>It was this quiet but intense thinking, and the well-matured ideas which resulted from it, that led to the prompt and vigorous action which was constantly witnessed during this year, so pregnant with events. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2536"/>He changed his habits somewhat at this period about going to bed early, and began to sit up later; and as he preferred to have some <num value="1">one</num> keep him company and discuss matters with him of an evening, <num value="1">one</num> of the staff-officers always made it a point not to retire until the chief was ready for bed. Many a night now became a sort of <quote>watch-night</quote> with us; but the conversations held upon these occasions were of such intense interest that they amply compensated for the loss of sleep they caused, even after a hard day's ride at the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2537"/>The general, however, did not always curtail the <measure n="8hours" type="date">eight hours</measure> of rest which his system seemed to require; for he often <pb id="p.251" n="251"/> pieced out the time by lying in bed later in the morning when there was no stirring movement afoot. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3388"/>This port had become the principal resort for vessels running the blockade, and was of incalculable importance to the enemy on account of the supplies received from foreign countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3392"/>It is at least foolish to think that the effect of the explosion could be transmitted to such a distance with enough force to weaken the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3393"/>However, they can use an old boat which is not of much value, and we have plenty of damaged powder which is unserviceable for any other purpose, so that the experiment will not cost much, at any rate.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3432"/>He explained that what he meant by that was that the general, in mentioning something that had taken place, would direct his mind so earnestly to stating unimportant details with entire accuracy that he would mar the interest of the story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3433"/>For instance, after returning from a walk around <pb id="p.341" n="341"/> camp he would say: <q direct="unspecified">I was told so and so about the wounded by <rs type="role">Dr.</rs> &mdash; while we were talking this morning inside of his tent</q> ; and <num value="0.5">a half</num>-hour afterward he would take the trouble to come back and say, as if it were a matter of the greatest importance: <q direct="unspecified">I was mistaken when I told you that my conversation with <rs type="role">Dr.</rs> &mdash; occurred inside his tent; that was not correct: it took place while we were standing in front of his tent.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3454"/>The principal reputation he gained among his fellow-cadets was for common sense, good judgment, entire unselfishness, and absolute fairness in everything he did.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3964"/>The general, who had remained standing during the presentation speech, with his right hand clasping the lapel of his coat, received the medal, and expressed his appreciation of the gift in a few well-chosen words, but uttered with such modesty of manner, and in so low a tone of voice, that they were scarcely audible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3966"/>The officers soon selected their partners from among the ladies present, and the evening's entertainment was continued to a late hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3967"/>The general was urged to indulge in a waltz, but from this he begged off. However, he finally <pb id="p.394" n="394"/> agreed to compromise the matter by dancing a square dance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3968"/>He went through the cotillion, not as gracefully as some of the beaux among the younger officers present, but did his part exceedingly well, barring the impossibility of his being able to keep exact time with the music.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3969"/>He did not consider dancing his forte, and in after life seldom indulged in that form of amusement, unless upon some occasion when he attended a ball given in his honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3970"/>In such case he felt that he had to take part in the opening dance to avoid appearing impolite or unappreciative. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4194"/>The story was the more charming from the fact that it was related without the manifestation of the slightest egotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4195"/>His field of operations had covered more than half of the entire theater of war; his orders always spoke with the true bluntness of the soldier; he had fought from valley depths to mountain heights, and marched from inland rivers to the sea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4984"/>He was imbued with a deep reverence, however, for all subjects of a religious nature, and nothing was more offensive to him than an attempt to make light of serious matters, or to show a disrespect for sacred things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5115"/>Nothing touched the hearts of the spectators so deeply as the sight of the old war-flags as they were carried by-those precious standards, bullet-riddled, battle-stained, many of them but remnants, often with not enough left of them to show the names of the battles they had seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5116"/>Some were decked with ribbons, and some festooned with garlands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5185"/>He therefore adopted a more open order of battle, made an extensive use of skirmish-lines, employed cavalry largely as mounted infantry, and sought to cultivate the individuality of the soldier instead of making him merely an unthinking part of a compact machine.
