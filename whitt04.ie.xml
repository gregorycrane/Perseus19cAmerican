<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>I have ventured, in compliance with the desire of dear friends of my beloved sister, <persName n="Whittier,,Elizabeth,H.,," id="n0315.0006.00318.00342" reg="default:Whittier,Elizabeth,H.,,"><foreName>Elizabeth</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Whittier</surname></persName>, to add to this little volume the few poetical pieces which she left behind her. As she was very distrustful of her own powers, and altogether without ambition for literary distinction, she shunned everything like publicity, and found far greater happiness in generous appreciation of the gifts of her friends than in the cultivation of her own. Yet it has always seemed to me, that had her health, sense of duty and fitness, and her extreme self-distrust permitted, she might have taken a high place among lyrical singers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>These poems, with perhaps <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> exceptions, afford but slight indications of the inward life of the writer, who had an almost morbid dread of spiritual and intellectual egotism, or of her tenderness of sympathy, chastened mirthfulness, and pleasant play of thought and fancy, when her shy, beautiful soul opened like a flower in the warmth of social communion.
