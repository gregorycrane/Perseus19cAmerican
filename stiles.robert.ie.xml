<p>At the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blush this title may strike <num value="1">one</num> as inaccurate, lacking in dignity, and bordering on the sensational.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Yet the author prefers it to any other and is ready to defend it; while admitting, though this may seem inconsistent, that explanations are in order. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> of his men was an actual follower of <persName n="Lee,,Robert,,," id="n0036.0001.00017.00001" reg="default:Lee,Robert,,,"><foreName>Robert</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> for <num value="4">four</num> full years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>In that <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> position, as also in his assignment, somewhat later, to the conduct, under the advice of the <rs>President</rs>, of the operations of all the armies of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, he of course had more or less supervision and control of the armies in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Such continued to be <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0036.0001.00018.00005" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s position and duties, and his relations to the troops in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, until <persName n="Johnston,General,Joseph,E.,," id="n0036.0001.00018.00006" reg="expanded:Johnston,Joseph,Eggleston,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Joseph</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, commanding the army defending <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, was struck down at <placeName reg="Seven Pines, Marion, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119933">Seven Pines</placeName>, or <placeName key="possibilities=15" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Fair Oaks</placeName>, <dateStruct value="1862-06-01"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="1">1st</day>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, when <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n0036.0001.00018.00007" reg="mostcommon:Davis,James,Lucius,,:2"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> appointed <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0036.0001.00018.00008" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> to succeed him in command of that army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>From this brief review it appears clearly that the men who, after <dateStruct value="1862-06-01"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="1">1st</day>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, followed <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0036.0001.00018.00009" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s banner and were under his immediate command were, even before that time and from the very outset, in a large and true sense his soldiers and under his control; so that, while strictly speaking no soldier followed <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0036.0001.00018.00010" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> for <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, yet we who served in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> from the beginning to the end of the war are entitled, in the customary and popular sense, to speak of our term of service as <quote><hi rend="italics"><measure n="4years" type="date">Four years</measure> under <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0036.0001.00018.00011" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName></hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/></p> 
<p>But our claim is, <quote><measure n="4years" type="date">Four years</measure> under <persName><roleName n="Massa">Marse</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Why <quote><persName><roleName n="Massa">Marse</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName></persName>?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/></p> 
<p>So, in <persName n="Randolph,,Innes,,," id="n0036.0001.00018.00012" reg="default:Randolph,Innes,,,"><foreName>Innes</foreName> <surname>Randolph</surname></persName>'s inimitable song, <quote>A good old Rebel,</quote> the hero thus vaunts his brief but glorious annals: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Again, why <quote><persName><roleName n="Massa">Marse</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName></persName>?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/></p> 
<p>The passion of soldiers for nicknaming their favorite leaders, re-christening them according to their unfettered fancy and their own sweet will, is well known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/><quote>The little corporal,</quote> <quote>The iron <rs>Duke</rs>,</quote> <quote><persName n="Marshall,,,,," id="n0036.0001.00018.00014" reg="mostcommon:Marshall,Charles,,,:1"><surname>Marshall</surname></persName> forwards,</quote> <quote>Bobs,</quote> <quote>Bobs Bahadur,</quote> <quote>Little Mac,</quote> <quote>Little Phil,</quote> <quote>Fighting <persName><foreName>Joe</foreName></persName>,</quote> <quote><persName n="Stonewall,,,,," id="n0036.0001.00018.00015" reg="mostcommon:Stonewall,nomatch:0"><surname>Stonewall</surname></persName>,</quote> <quote>Old Jack,</quote> <quote>Old Pete,</quote> <quote>Old Jube,</quote> <quote>Jubilee,</quote> <quote><persName n="Rooney,,,,," id="n0036.0001.00018.00016" reg="mostcommon:Rooney,nomatch:0"><surname>Rooney</surname></persName>,</quote> <quote><persName n="Fitz,,,,," id="n0036.0001.00018.00017" reg="mostcommon:Fitz,nomatch:0"><surname>Fitz</surname></persName>,</quote> <quote><persName><roleName n="Massa">Marse</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName></persName></quote> --all these and many more are familiar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>There is something grotesque about most of them and in many, seemingly, rank disrespect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Yet the habit has never been regarded as a violation <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> of military law, and the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs> of an army, if a staunch fighter, and particularly if victory often perches on his banner, is very apt to win the noways doubtful compliment of this rough and ready knighthood from his devoted troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>But however this may be, <quote><persName><roleName n="Massa">Marse</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName></persName></quote> is far away above the rest of these soldier nicknames in pathos and in power. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>In the first place, it is essentially <hi rend="italics">military</hi>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Though in form and style as far as possible removed from that model, this quaint title yet rings true upon the elemental basis of military life-unquestioning and unlimited <hi rend="italics">obedience</hi>. It embodies the strongest possible expression of the short creed of the soldier: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/></p><l>Their's not to reason why, </l><l>Their's but to do and die.</l></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>I do not believe an army ever existed which surpassed <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0036.0001.00019.00018" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s ragged veterans in hearty acceptance and daily practice of this soldier creed, and there is no telling to what extent their peculiar nickname for their leader was responsible for this characteristic trait of his followers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Men who spoke habitually of their commanding general as <quote>Master</quote> could not but feel the reflex influence of this habit upon their own character as soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>This much may certainly be said of this graphic title of the great captain; but this is not all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/><quote><persName><roleName n="Massa">Marse</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName></persName>!</quote> It goes without saying that the title is distinctively <hi rend="italics">Southern</hi>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The homely phrase was an embodiment of the earliest and strongest associations of the men applied in reverent affection, but also in defiant yet pathetic protest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It was, in some sense, an outcry of the social system of the <rs>South</rs> assailed and imperilled by the war and doomed to perish in the great convulsion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The title <quote><persName><roleName n="Massa">Marse</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName></persName></quote> fitted at once the life of the soldier and the life of the slave, because both were based upon the principle of absolute obedience to absolute authority. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>In this connection it may not be uninteresting to note --what is perhaps not generally known &mdash; that during the <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> last months of the war the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities canvassed seriously the policy of arming the <rs>Southern</rs> slaves and putting them in the field as soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>I was told by a leading member of the <name>Senate</name> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> that, by special invitation, <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0036.0001.00020.00019" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> came over from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> and appeared before, as I remember, a joint committee of the two Houses, to which this matter had been referred, and gave his opinion in favor of the experiment upon the ground, mainly, that unhesitating and unlimited obedience &mdash; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> great lesson of the soldier &mdash; was ingrained, if not inborn, in the <rs>Southern</rs> slave. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Yet once more &mdash; to christen <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0036.0001.00020.00020" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> <quote>Master</quote> was an act of homage peculiarly appropriate to his lofty and <hi rend="italics">masterful personality</hi>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>There never could have been a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <quote><persName><roleName n="Massa">Marse</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName></persName>;</quote> as, but for the unparalleled elevation and majesty of his character and bearing, there would never have been the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>He was of all men most attractive to us, yet by no means most approachable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>We loved him much, but we revered him more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>We never criticised, never doubted him; never attributed to him either moral error or mental weakness; no, not even in our secret hearts or most audacious thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>I really believe it would have strained and blurred our strongest and clearest conceptions of the distinction between right and wrong to have entertained, even for a moment, the thought that he had ever acted from any other than the purest and loftiest motive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>I never but once heard of such a suggestion, and then it so transported the hearers that military subordination was forgotten and the colonel who heard it rushed with drawn sword against the <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">major-general</rs> who made it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The proviso with which a ragged rebel accepted the doctrine of evolution, that <quote>the rest of us may have descended or ascended from monkeys, but it took a <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to make <persName><roleName n="Massa">Marse</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName></persName>,</quote> had more than mere humor in it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>I am not informed whether the figure of speech to which I am about to refer ever obtained outside the <rs>South</rs>, or whether its use among us was generally known beyond our borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It undoubtedly originated with our negroes, being <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> an expression of their affectionate reverence for their masters, by metaphor, transferred to the <num value="1">one</num> great <quote><rs type="role2">Lord</rs> and master</quote> of us all; but it is certainly also true that Southern white men, and especially Southern soldiers, were in the habit-and that without the least consciousness of irreverence &mdash; of referring to the <rs>Divine Being</rs> as <quote>Old Marster,</quote> in connection especially with our inability to comprehend His inscrutable providences and our duty to bow to His irreversible decrees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>There is no way in which I can illustrate more vividly the almost worship with which <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0036.0001.00021.00021" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s soldiers regarded him than by saying that I once overheard a conversation beside a camp fire between <num value="2">two</num> Calvinists in Confederate rags and tatters, shreds and patches, in which <num value="1">one</num> simply and sincerely inquired of his fellow, who had just spoken of <quote>Old Marster,</quote> whether he referred to <quote>the <num value="1">one</num> up at headquarters or the <num value="1">One</num> up yonder.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/></p> 
<p>We never compared him with other men, either friend or foe. He was in a superlative and absolute class by himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Beyond a vague suggestion, after the death of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0036.0001.00021.00022" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:9"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, as to what might have been if he had lived, I cannot recall even an approach to a comparative estimate of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0036.0001.00021.00023" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>As to his opponents, we recked not at all of them, but only of the immense material force behind them; and as to that, we trusted our commanding general like a providence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>There was at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> a mild amusement in the rapid succession of the <rs>Federal</rs> commanders, but even this grew a little trite and tame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>There was, however, <num value="1">one</num> point of great interest in it, and that was our amazement that an army could maintain even so much as its organization under the depressing strain of these successive appointments and removals of its commanding generals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>And to-day I, for <num value="1">one</num>, regard the fact that it did preserve its cohesion and its fighting power under and in spite of such experiences, as furnishing impressive demonstration of the high character and intense loyalty of our historic foe, the <rs>Federal</rs> <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>As to the command of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>, so far as I know or have reason to believe, but <num value="1">one</num> man in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> ever dared to suggest a change, and that <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> <num value="1">one</num> was <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0036.0001.00022.00024" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> himself, who &mdash; after the <rs n="Battle of Gettysburg" type="battle">battle of Gettysburg</rs>, and again, I think, though I cannot verify it, when his health gave way for a time under the awful strain of the campaign of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>-suggested that it might be well he should give way to a younger and stronger man. But the fact is, that <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0036.0001.00022.00025" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s preeminent fitness for supreme command was so universally recognized that, in spite of the obligation of a soldier to undertake the duties of any position to which he may be assigned by competent authority, I doubt whether there was an officer in all the armies of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> who would have consented to accept appointment as <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0036.0001.00022.00026" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s successor in command of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>--possibly there was <num value="1">one</num>--and I am yet more disposed to question whether that army would have permitted <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0036.0001.00022.00027" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> to resign his place or any other to take it. Looking back over its record, from <placeName reg="Seven Pines, Marion, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119933">Seven Pines</placeName> to <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName>, I am satisfied that the unquestioned and unquestionable preeminence, predominance, and permanence of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0036.0001.00022.00028" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, as its commander-in-chief, was <num value="1">one</num> of the main elements which made the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> what it was. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>I have said we never criticised him. I ought, perhaps, to make <num value="1">one</num> qualification of this statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>It has been suggested by others and I have myself once or twice felt that <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0036.0001.00022.00029" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> was too lenient, too full of sweet charity and allowance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>He did not, as <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0036.0001.00022.00030" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:9"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> did, instantly and relentlessly remove incompetent officers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The picture is before you, and yet it is not intended as a full picture, but only as such a presentation of him, from the point of view of his soldiers, as will explain and justify the quaint title which they habitually applied to their great commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>I have not attempted and shall not attempt a complete portrait.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Why should I, when the most eloquent tongues and pens of <num value="2">two</num> continents have labored to present, with fitting eulogy, the character and career of our great Cavalier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>It is our patent of nobilty that he is to-day regarded &mdash; the world over &mdash; as the representative of the soldiery of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/><pb id="p.23" n="23"/> </p> 
<p>Not only is it true of him, as already intimated, that he uniformly acted from the highest motive presented to his soul-but so impressive and all-compelling was the majesty of his virtue that it is doubtful whether any <num value="1">one</num> ever questioned aught of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>It is perhaps not too much to say that the common consensus of Christendom-friend and foe and neutral-ranks him as <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest captains of the ages and attributes to him more of the noblest virtues and powers, with less of the ordinary selfishness and littleness of humanity, than to any other great soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>This is what is meant by our dedication &mdash; that the world has come to view him very much as his ragged followers did in the grand days when they were helping him to make history. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Can you point to another representative man upon whom the light of modern day has been focussed with such intensity, of whom these supreme things may be said with so little strain; or rather, with acquiescence practically universal?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>For our part, we say emphatically-we know not where to look for the man. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The scheme of this book is a modest <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The author makes no pretense that he is qualified to write history or to discuss learnedly, from a professional standpoint, the battles and campaigns of armies; while of course an old veteran cannot be expected always and absolutely to refrain from saying how the thing looked to him. All that is really proposed-and the writer will be more than content if he acquit himself fairly well of this limited design &mdash; is to state clearly and truthfully what he saw and experienced as a private soldier and subordinate officer in the military service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> from <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>It is not proposed, however, to give a consecutive recital of all that occurred during these <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, even within the narrow range of the writer's observation and experience; but rather to select and record such incidents, arranged of course in a general orderly sequence, as are deemed to be of inherent interest, or to shed light upon the portrait of the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldier, the personality of prominent actors in the war drama upon the <rs>Southern</rs> side, the salient points <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> of the great conflict, or the general conditions of life in and behind the <rs>Confederate</rs> lines. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Again, such are the imperfections of human observation and such the irregularities and errors of human memory, especially in the record of events long past, that many may be disposed to question the value of such a book as this, written to-day, relating to our civil war. I can only reply that not a few of the incidents recorded were reduced to writing years ago, indeed soon after they occurred; while perhaps as much has been gained in perspective as has been lost in detail, by waiting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Certainly it can be better determined to-day what is worthy of preservation and publication than it could have been immediately after the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The slips and vagaries of memory, however, cannot be denied or excluded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>It can only be said, <quote>forewarned is forearmed.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>I shall endeavor to exercise that conscientious care which the character of the work requires, but cannot hope to attain uniform and unerring accuracy in every detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>In the record of conversations, interviews, and speeches I shall sometimes adopt the form of direct quotation, even where not able to recall the precise words employed by the speakers and interlocutors &mdash; if I am satisfied this form of narrative will best convey the real spirit of the occasion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>And as the writer is, in the main, to relate what he saw and heard and did, he craves in advance charitable toleration of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> personal pronoun in the singular number. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>There are features of my antecedent personal history calculated, perhaps, to impart a somewhat special interest to my experiences as a Confederate soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>I was the eldest son of <persName n="Stiles,Reverend,Joseph,C.,," id="n0036.0002.00025.00032" reg="expanded:Stiles,Joseph,Clay:1:Clifford:1,,"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev.</roleName> <foreName>Joseph</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Stiles</surname></persName>, a Presbyterian minister, born in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, where his ancestors had lived and died for generations, but who moved to the <rs>North</rs> and, from my boyhood, had lived in <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York City</orgName> and in New Haven, Conn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>I was prepared for college in the schools of these <num value="2">two</num> cities and was graduated at <orgName type="college" n="Yale college">Yale</orgName> in <dateStruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>It so happened that I had never visited the <rs>South</rs> since the original removal of the family, which occurred when I was some <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> of age; so that practically all my education, associations and friendships were Northern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>True, I took position as a Southerner in all our college discussions and debates, but never as a <quote>fire-eater</quote> or secessionist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Indeed, I was a strong <quote>Union man</quote> and voted for <persName n="Bell,,,,," id="n0036.0002.00025.00033" reg="mostcommon:Bell,John,,,:1"><surname>Bell</surname></persName> and <persName n="Everett,,,,," id="n0036.0002.00025.00034" reg="mostcommon:Everett,Edward,,,:1"><surname>Everett</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>After my graduation in <dateStruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></dateStruct> I passed the late <rs type="season">summer</rs> and <rs type="season">autumn</rs> in the <rs>Adirondack</rs> woods fishing and hunting with several classmates, and devoted the rest of the year to general reading and some little teaching, in New Haven; until, becoming deeply interested in the fierce struggle over the <name>Speakership</name> of the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, I went to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and from the galleries of the <rs type="place">House</rs> and Senate eagerly overhung the great final debates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>I had paid close attention to oratory during my college course and I doubt whether there was another onlooker in the <rs>Capitol</rs> more deeply absorbed than I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>On more than <num value="1">one</num> occasion <pb id="p.26" n="26"/> the excitement and pressure of the crowd in the galleries of the <rs type="place">House</rs> was fearful, and once at least persons were dragged out, more dead than alive, over the heads of others sc densely packed that they could not move; but I never failed to secure a front seat. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>How could I help glowing with pride and brightening with hope!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>Alas! the shriek of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shell that burst over <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> shattered these fair hopes-and pandemonium reigned in New York. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>It is not within the province of this book to discuss the responsibility for that shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>I will, however, be candid enough to say that I never entertained a doubt as to the <rs>South</rs> having the best of the <name>Constitutional</name> argument; and yet, so strong was my love for the <rs>Union</rs> and my affection for my friends, at least <num value="9">nine</num>-<num value=".1">tenths</num> of whom were on the <rs>Northern</rs> side, that I often felt, and more than once said, I could never strike a blow or fire a shot in the conflict, if it should come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>Nevertheless, I was inexorably led in the sequel to give myself unreservedly and whole-heartedly to the defense of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/><num value="1">One</num> link in the chain that led to this decision was the conviction that forced itself upon me that I could not remain in New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>After the firing upon <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> the whole city was in an uproar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>A wild enthusiasm for <quote>the flag</quote> seized and swept the entire population which surged through streets hung with banners and bunting, their own persons bedecked with small <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> flags and other patriotic devices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>It is not worth while to go further into these details.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/><pb id="p.36" n="36"/> Enough to say that it was manifestly as uncomfortable and impracticable, at that time, for me to remain in New York as for an able-bodied young man, of strong convictions on the <rs>Northern</rs> side of the controversy, to remain in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>Therefore I returned to New Haven, where, with the entire family assembled, we conferred over the situation and decided that father and his <num value="3">three</num> boys must go South as soon as possible, leaving mother and the girls to follow when the way should be clear and we ready to receive them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>As there was no assurance of reaching our destination in safety without passports, father, who knew <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n0036.0003.00036.00140" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Thomas,Y.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> well, applied to him for passes <placeName reg="South River, Rockbridge, Virginia" key="tgn,2681713">South</placeName> for himself and his <num value="3">three</num> boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>My next younger brother was an expert sailor, having followed the sea for years, and was recognized as perhaps the most daring and skilful manager of a small sailing craft to be found about <placeName reg="New Haven Harbor, New Haven, Connecticut" key="tgn,2539217">New Haven harbor</placeName>, or indeed anywhere in that part of <placeName reg="Long Island Sound" key="tgn,2467766">Long Island Sound</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>As there seemed to be no other way to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> open to us, we bought a staunch, swift sail-boat, had her carefully caulked and overhauled, and set to work to make her some extra sails which my brother thought we might need during our voyage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>We procured a copy of a detailed survey of the coast along that part of the <orgName type="mil" key="EasternShore">Eastern Shore of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName></orgName> where we proposed to land, and also letters to gentlemen living along that coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>The preparation of the boat and the working up of our expedition was a great relief, not only in giving us something to do, but also in holding out the prospect of interesting adventure accompanied by a reasonable spice of peril. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>About this time I discovered, in taking a sort of spiritual inventory of myself, that I had passed to another and distinct stage of feeling and of purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>I believed firmly my people in the <rs>South</rs> were right; I knew well they were weak; I saw clearly they were about to be invaded; and I was striving to get to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>To what end?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>With what purpose?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>To <pb id="p.37" n="37"/> give them another mouth to feed, or to give them another man to fight?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Right, weakness, invasion!-how could there be any save <num value="1">one</num> inference from such a trinity of propositions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>I did not fully realize this process as it was wrought out in me; but when I came to find my scruples and my shrinking gone-though not my sorrow &mdash; I looked back and plainly saw the path along which I had been led. From that hour, throughout the <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of my service as a Confederate soldier, never did I entertain a doubt as to my being where I should be and doing what I should do. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>While our boat was making ready for the trip, some <num value="1">one</num> called at the house and asked for me, but sent no card, so I went to the reception-room, having no idea who my visitor was. </p>

<p>Who was the man who thus, without hesitation, reservation or condition, cast in his lot with us? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The story is in every way so remarkable that I cannot forbear a full recital of it. It should not be forgotten, however, that while the peace of death has, years agone, passed upon the chief actor in this strange, sad drama, and probably also upon most of his relatives living when he died --there may yet be others now living to whom the record of his life and death must needs be somewhat painful; therefore I shall endeavor to tell the story simply and quietly. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>When I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> knew <persName n="Beers,,James,H.,," id="n0036.0003.00037.00143" reg="default:Beers,James,H.,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Beers</surname></persName> he was an intelligent young mechanic-originally, I think, from <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Fairfield, Connecticut" key="tgn,7013453">Bridgeport, Conn.</placeName>, but at the time living in New Haven, where I was a college student.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>We were both members of a Bible-class connected with a church of which my father was then pastor, and <persName n="Hallock,Mister,Gerard,,," id="n0036.0003.00037.00144" reg="default:Hallock,Gerard,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Gerard</foreName> <surname>Hallock</surname></persName>, of the <orgName n="New York Journal of commerce" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Journal of Commerce</hi></orgName>, the most prominent member.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>This was a few years before the war, but <persName n="Beers,,,,," id="n0036.0003.00038.00147" reg="nearbymention:Beers,James,H.,,"><surname>Beers</surname></persName> continued to visit New Haven often, perhaps regularly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>We heard from time to time that he had exhibited unusual facility for journalism and had been rapidly advanced, until he had come to be an assistant to the night editor of <persName n="Hallock,Mister,,,," id="n0036.0003.00038.00148" reg="nearbymention:Hallock,Gerard,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hallock</surname></persName>'s great paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>It was probably through his connection with the leading Democratic daily that he imbibed the views he held as to the construction of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> and the relations between the <rs>Federal Government</rs> and the <name>States</name>; views which he followed to their logical conclusion and in defense of which he ultimately laid down his life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>As the sectional excitement increased and civil war became more and more imminent, <persName n="Beers,,,,," id="n0036.0003.00038.00149" reg="nearbymention:Beers,James,H.,,"><surname>Beers</surname></persName> grew more and more restless and unhappy, until actual hostilities began with the bombardment of <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>, when he informed <persName n="Hallock,Mister,,,," id="n0036.0003.00038.00150" reg="nearbymention:Hallock,Gerard,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hallock</surname></persName> that it would be impossible for him to continue to discharge his duties upon the paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>Thereupon he left New York and appeared in New Haven, as above described. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>When he announced his determination of going with us I discouraged it, reminding him that he was a Northern man and had, besides, a wife and <num value="2">two</num> little girls to provide for; mentioning also his fine position and prospects, all of which would necessarily be sacrificed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>He replied that he had some money which he would leave with our mother, trusting her to use it for his wife and children and to bring them South when she came; adding that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> never gave a man a wife and children to stand in the way of the discharge of his plain duty, and that it was plainly his duty to go with us and aid the <rs>South</rs> in defense of her clear and clearly-violated rights. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>I cut the matter short by referring him to my father, and he at once went to his room and saw him. Father afterwards told me it was obvious that <persName n="Beers,Mister,,,," id="n0036.0003.00038.00151" reg="nearbymention:Beers,James,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Beers</surname></persName>' mind was irrevocably made up and that it would be worse than useless to <pb id="p.39" n="39"/> resist him further; so it was settled he was to go with us. I do not remember whether his wife and children were then in New Haven, but they were committed by him to the care of our mother and sisters, and later followed <persName n="Beers,,,,," id="n0036.0003.00039.00152" reg="nearbymention:Beers,James,H.,,"><surname>Beers</surname></persName> to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, as I now recollect, in company with the ladies of our family. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Everything was arranged and we were to embark and sail on a certain night, but during the preceding day a telegram was received from a friend who was standing guard for us in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, which by a sort of prearranged cipher we understood to mean that we could slip through safely if we left New York by a certain train the next day.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>We reached <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and got safely across the river and to our destination, but, by some untoward accident, <persName n="Beers,,,,," id="n0036.0003.00039.00154" reg="nearbymention:Beers,James,H.,,"><surname>Beers</surname></persName> was left behind and experienced some difficulty in dodging the <orgName n="Provost Guard" type="guard">provost guard</orgName> and completing the last stage of his <quote>on to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>We were very uneasy, met every train from the <rs>North</rs>, and were unspeakably relieved when he arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>We had told his story to our friends and he was welcomed into the same hospitable family circle which was entertaining us.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>A day or <num value="2">two</num> after his arrival a most unpleasant experience befell poor <persName n="Beers,,,,," id="n0036.0003.00039.00155" reg="nearbymention:Beers,James,H.,,"><surname>Beers</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>Walking by himself in the street, he was arrested as a spy and locked up in the negro jail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>For hours we were unable to ascertain what had become of him, and when we did find out it was too late to procure his release on <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi>; so with profound mortification and profuse apologies we had to content ourselves with doing what we could to make him comfortable where he was, he protesting that he needed nothing and could suffer no real inconvenience that <num value="1">one</num> night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>Indeed, noble fellow that he was, he met me with a manly smile at the door of his cell, expressing mingled amusement and approbation; saying that <pb id="p.40" n="40"/> while the charge of his being a spy was a little wide of the mark, yet the mistake was a very natural <num value="1">one</num>, that there were doubtless numbers of such characters about, and he was glad to see that we were on the alert for them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Next morning when his case was called in the <rs type="place">Mayor's Court</rs> something of the truth with regard to him had gotten abroad and the court-room was crowded with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gentlemen of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>I was the main witness, and it goes without saying that the dramatic points of <persName n="Beers,,,,," id="n0036.0003.00040.00156" reg="nearbymention:Beers,James,H.,,"><surname>Beers</surname></persName>' strange story, especially those that would most commend him to the <rs>Southern</rs> people, lost nothing in the telling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>He was not only honorably discharged, but he was vociferously cheered by the entire audience, and he walked out of the court-room the idol of the hour &mdash; the rest of the last rebel reinforcement from the <rs>North</rs> shining somewhat in his reflected light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Thus, to our great relief, the awkward contretemps of his arrest contributed rather to the reputation and advantage of our friend. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>concurred in the view that the principles which protected citizens of the <rs>Southern</rs> and seceded States were, to say the least, of doubtful application to us, and that it would probably go rather hard with us if we should be captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>Notwithstanding, I enlisted, and <persName n="Beers,,,,," id="n0036.0003.00040.00162" reg="nearbymention:Beers,James,H.,,"><surname>Beers</surname></persName> would probably have done so with equal promptness had he not been an expert mechanic-men so qualified being then very scarce in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and very much needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Such he was then.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>At last we were in <quote>the army;</quote> and what was it after all?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>We walked perhaps a mile or more through the camps, and the prominent ideas borne in upon me were-multitude, overloading, lack of cohesion and of organization, absence of women and children, and a general sense of roughness and untidiness, of discomfort and confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Of course these impressions were soon to give way to others; but it was not alone my impressions that changed, it was the army itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>During the few months next ensuing it dispensed with useless baggage and equipment, acquired cohesion, organization, power and endurance, and men learned to do fairly well for themselves what women had theretofore invariably done for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>Under the discipline of the next <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>, imperfect as it was, we trained down and trained up, just as the fighting men do, to a condition of bare, hard flesh; compact yet supple muscles; clean, clear lungs; sound, strong hearts; and perfect possession and control of all our fighting powers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>In connection with this process of training down to fighting weight, it occurs to me that the wagon train of the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Company">First Company</orgName>, Richmond Howitzers, during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="9months" type="date">nine months</measure> of the war was, I verily believe, quite as large as that of any infantry brigade in the army during the grand campaign of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Many of the private soldiers of the company had their trunks with them, and I remember part of the contents of <num value="1">one</num> of them consisted of a dozen face and a smaller number of foot or bath towels; and when the order came <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> for trunks to be sent back to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> or abandoned, the owner of this elaborate outfit, although but a <quote>high private in the rear rank,</quote> actually wrote and sent in to the captain an elegant note resigning his <quote>position.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>Yet this curled and scented gentleman became a superb soldier and used to laugh as heartily as any of us when, in after years, at some point of unusual want and stringency and discomfort, some impudent rascal would shout out, <quote><persName><foreName>Jim</foreName></persName>, old fellow, don't you think it's about time for you to resign again?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/></p> 
<p>As to the battle-field, if it showed marked traces of the conflict that had taken place I do not recall them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/><num value="1">One</num> scene and incident, however, I do recall, which made a very tender impression upon me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>I did not want to go, but I knew the poor fellow's sisters and felt as if I ought to go, and I went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Few interviews have ever made deeper impression upon me. The heroic <name>Christian</name> man had been a prominent member of the <rs>Richmond</rs> bar and the mainstay and support of his sisters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>He was now lying seriously wounded, in a deserted house, from which, as I remember, even the doors and windows had been carried off, and in which there seemed to be little or no furniture save the bed he occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>The attendant who took care of him was not at the moment in the building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>My comrade and I entered and I walked to the bedside, made myself known to the <rs>Captain</rs> and told him that I had seen his sisters within a day or <num value="2">two</num> and that they were well, but very anxious about him. He did not seem to be suffering greatly at the time, but was evidently death-struck and I think fully aware of it. Yet there was no shrinking and no tremor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>His voice was firm and clear and he was entirely self-possessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>I took his hand, or he took mine, and my recollection is that my comrade and I knelt by the bedside and we all prayed together for a few moments, and then we left him there in that desolate place to meet the last enemy; but I felt, and I am sure he did, that he would not meet him alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/><pb id="p.48" n="48"/> </p> 
<p>I had helped to take wounded men from the trains in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, but they were surrounded by relatives and friends, or by admiring, almost worshiping crowds, and the entire city, with all it contained of sympathy and help, was at their feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Here, however, was an entirely different picture, and for a long time my mind every now and then reverted to it with a sadness I could not dispel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>The intellectual atmosphere of the <rs>Confederate</rs> camps was far above what is generally supposed by the people of this generation, even in the <rs>Southern States</rs>, and this intellectual aspiration and vigor of the men were exhibited perhaps equally in their religious meetings and services and in their dramatic representations and other exhibitions gotten up to relieve the tedium of camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>But however this may be in general it cannot be denied that the case of the <rs>Richmond Howitzers</rs> was exceptional in this regard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>The corps was organized at the time of the <rs>John Brown</rs> raid by <persName n="Randolph,,George,W.,," id="n0036.0004.00048.00185" reg="expanded:Randolph,George,Wythe,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Randolph</surname></persName>, afterwards <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, and has never been disbanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>In <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> it was recruited up to <num value="3">three</num> companies and formed into a battalion, but unfortunately the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Company">first company</orgName> was never associated with the other <num value="2">two</num> in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>The composition of the <num value="3">three</num> companies was very similar; that is, all of them were made up largely of young business men and clerks of the highest grade and best character from the city of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, but included also a number of country boys, for the most part of excellent families, with a very considerable infusion of college-bred men, for it was strikingly true that in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> the flower of our educated youth gravitated toward the artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>The outcome was something quite unparalleled, so far as I know.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>During the earlier stages of the war our artillery corps was very inadequately provided with clumsy ordnance and defective ammunition, manufactured for the most part within the <rs>Confederate</rs> lines; but as the struggle went on this branch of our service, as well as our infantry, was, to a constantly increasing degree, supplied with improved guns and ammunition captured from the armies opposed to us.

<p>For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> the armies of thy Confederacy adhered to that very defective organization in which single batteries of artillery are attached to infantry brigades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/><num value="2">Two</num> evils resulted: the guns were under the command of brigadier-generals of infantry, who generally had very little regard for artillery and still less knowledge as to the proper handling of it; and the scattering of the batteries prevented that concentration of fire in which, upon proper occasion, consists the great effectiveness of the arm. At and after <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>, however, the artillery of the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName>, certainly that of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>, began to be massed into battalions composed of, say, <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> batteries and <num value="15">fifteen</num> to <num value="25">twenty-five</num> guns, and these placed under the command of trained and experienced artillery officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>From that time the artillery began to be really reckoned and relied upon in estimating the effective strength of the army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>So much for the physical aspect of the artillery of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0036.0005.00053.00196" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>A word now as to the character of the men who composed that corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>It will of course be admitted by every man of intelligence and candor who served under <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0036.0005.00053.00197" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, that his infantry was essentially his army; not alone because it constituted the bulk and body of its fighting strength, but also because it did the bulk and body of the fighting; and yet I think even the infantry itself would admit that the artillery, though appearing to afford least opportunity for personal distinction, yet furnished, in proportion to its numbers, perhaps more officers below the rank of general who were conspicuous for gallantry and high soldiership than either of the other <num value="2">two</num> arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>Their names rise unbidden to my lips-Pegram and <persName n="Pelham,,,,," id="n0036.0005.00053.00198" reg="mostcommon:Pelham,John,,,:1"><surname>Pelham</surname></persName>, and Breathed and <persName n="Carter,,,,," id="n0036.0005.00053.00199" reg="mostcommon:Carter,Tom,,,:2"><surname>Carter</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Haskell,,,,," id="n0036.0005.00053.00200" reg="mostcommon:Haskell,Alexander,Cheves,,:1"><surname>Haskell</surname></persName>, and many, many more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>Every veteran of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> is familiar with the splendid roll. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>If this claim be challenged, it may perhaps best be tested by asking this question: admitting that the fact be so, <hi rend="italics">can any satisfactory explanation of it be suggested</hi>? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>For <num value="1">one</num>, I answer unhesitatingly-yes, I think so; explanation amounting to demonstration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>I believe that any man <pb id="p.54" n="54"/> who looks into the matter without prejudice will be ready to admit that it is to be expected that artillery soldiers should excel in <num value="4">four</num> great soldierly qualities-<hi rend="italics">intelligence</hi>, <hi rend="italics">self-possession, comradeship, loyalty to the gun</hi>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>I will not stay now to prove that these qualities characterized our artillery in an eminent degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>The remaining chapters of this book will furnish abundant demonstration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>As to <hi rend="italics">intelligence</hi>, the chapter last preceding would seem to be all-sufficient; but apart from these positive exhibitions of intelligence and even culture of a high order, it is obvious that the very nature of the arm and its operation, its comparative mechanical elaboration and complexity, and the blending of scientific knowledge and manual and bodily dexterity required for its most effective use, must in large degree influence the original selection and the after development of the men of the artillery branch of the service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>Again, an artilleryman, officer or private soldier, should be a broader-gauged man, especially as to his view and comprehension of battle and campaign, than an infantryman of corresponding grade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>An infantry company in the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>, during the latter part of the war, averaged certainly not over <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num> men, and covered but a small space on the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>A captain of infantry saw and touched little outside these narrow limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/><num value="2">Two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> strides, so to speak, would cover all of the line he was familiar with and responsible for, and he came in contact with no officer of wider domain and control, save his colonel, under whose eye and immediate direction he was always, save when on picket duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>A captain of artillery, on the contrary, was often separated from his colonel by the stretch of several brigade fronts; for a battalion, as usually placed, would cover about the front of a division, and as he received no orders-after the organization of the artillery into battalions &mdash; from any infantry officer of less rank than a major-general, he was necessarily thrown in great measure upon his own resources in the management of a command which, including all its departments, was really of greater complexity and difficulty than an infantry brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/><pb id="p.55" n="55"/> </p> 
<p>I trust I may not be misunderstood, or regarded as attempting to magnify over-much myself or my office, when I say that all this applies with special force to the adjutant of an artillery battalion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>This officer,--if he does his full duty,--as adjutant of the command, as personal staff and aide to the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs>, and often as battalion chief of the line of caissons-familiarizing himself with the positions of all the guns in battle, seeing that all are fully supplied with ammunition and anything and everything else that may be required, and passing from <num value="1">one</num> to another as the exigencies of the fight may demand-covers as wide a stretch of the line, sees as much of the campaign, and comes as much into contact with officers of high grade as any officer of his rank in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>To-day, more than a generation after that heroic Olympiad, it is a deep satisfaction to be able to say that I endeavored to do my full duty as adjutant of <orgName n="Battalion"><persName n="Cabell,,,,," id="n0036.0005.00055.00201" reg="nearbymention:Cabell,H.,C.,,"><surname>Cabell</surname></persName>'s Battalion</orgName> &mdash; to attend to all my duties in this broader and fuller construction of them, and in battle, as far as possible, to be with that <num value="1">one</num> of our batteries which was most heavily engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>The campaign of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct> was the only <num value="1">one</num> in which I acted as adjutant of an artillery battalion from the outset to the end, and in consequence my knowledge of that campaign is at once more comprehensive ana more detailed than of any other, and what I have to tell of it is of greater value. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>The training of the artillery service in the development of imperturbable <hi rend="italics">self-possession</hi>, in emergency and crisis, is self-evident and requires no comment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>To appreciate it to the full, it was only necessary to look at <num value="1">one</num> of our guns, already overmatched, at the moment when a fresh gun of the enemy, rushing up at a wild gallop, and seizing a nearer and enfilading position, hurled a percussion shell, crashing with fearful uproar against our piece, and sweeping almost the entire gun detachment to the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>At such a moment I have marked the sergeant or gunner of such a piece coolly disengage himself from the wreck and, stepping to <num value="1">one</num> side, stoop to take his observations and make his calculations, of distance and of time, free from the dust and smoke of the explosion; then, with ringing voice, call out to <num value="6">No. 6</num> <pb id="p.56" n="56"/> at the limber,--whose duty it was to cut the fuse,--<quote><measure n="3seconds" type="date">three seconds</measure>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>then, stepping back and bending over the trail handspike, doggedly aim his strained and half-disabled piece, as the undisabled remnant of the detachment step over the dead and dying bodies of their comrades, each in the discharge of the doubled and trebled duties now devolving upon him. The story I have to tell is full of kindred scenes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>Another of the most marked and developing features of the artillery service is <hi rend="italics">comradeship</hi>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>I do not mean that lighter sense of happy and kindly association which certainly did characterize the artillery, of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0036.0005.00056.00202" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> at least, in very high degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>I refer now to an element far deeper and more powerful &mdash; the <hi rend="italics">interdependence</hi>, the reliance upon each other, which inheres in the very nature of artillery service, and is indispensable of the effective working of the gun. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>The unit of the infantry is the man; of the cavalry, the man and horse; of the artillery, the detachment.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>Meanwhile, the gunner of this particular piece, a tall, splendid-looking fellow, stood hard by, with his lip curled in scorn and his arms twitching convulsively; until at last, unable to stand it longer, he sprang into the midst of the blundering infantry and hurled them right and left, shouting: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>In the spring of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, throughout our service, the men reenlisting were allowed to elect their own officers; so that for weeks about this time the army, and that in the face of the enemy, was resolved &mdash; it is the highest proof of its patriotism and character that it was not also dissolved-into nominating caucuses and electioneering meetings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>This compliment, by the way, is as well deserved by the men voluntarily reenlisting and electing their own officers, on the <rs>Federal</rs> side as the <rs>Confederate</rs>, if, as I presume, the same system was adopted by the <rs>Federals</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>I do not say this is not the usual mode of organizing a volunteer army, at least in this country; nor do I deny that the result was better, on the average, than might have been anticipated, but it was bad enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>It is fair also to add that the result, in the case of our own company &mdash; as I have abundantly shown an exceptionally intelligent corps,--so far as the newly-elected captain was concerned, could not have been more satisfactory, as he was a man of the noblest nature and every inch a soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>But this was not by any means the case with all the officers elected by us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>Soon after our arrival the enemy attempted a crossing in force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>Our guns being called for, we made an inspiring rush for the point of attack and were loudly cheered by the long lines of waiting infantry as we thundered by with our horses at a wild gallop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>My recollection is that our company was the rear battery during the next day and that we several times unlimbered our pieces, but never fired a shot; so the evening of the <dateStruct value="-05-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> found us on the <rs>Richmond</rs> side of <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, hitched up and ready to fall in behind our brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>We heard firing in the rear, but thought little of it until a mounted officer rode up with orders from competent authority to bring up as rapidly as possible the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Battery">first battery</orgName> he could find ready hitched up, and so we passed rapidly back through <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, and became at once hotly engaged, doing good service, as we also did the next day. Indeed our action the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> evening might, without much strain, be termed <quote><hi rend="italics">distinguished</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>The enemy, under a heavy fire from our battery and another, abandoned a <measure n="3inch" type="distance">three-inch</measure> rifled gun and a caisson of ammunition, and the general at whose orders we had entered the fight calling for volunteers to bring them into our lines, our boys volunteered and brought them off the field, using the captured gun with fine effect the following day. <pb id="p.79" n="79"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/><placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> was not in any sense a decisive battle, perhaps not designed to be so on either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>Upon our side certainly, perhaps upon both sides, it accomplished its limited purpose, which upon our part was to let <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0036.0007.00079.00275" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,Brinton,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> see that it would not be well for him to seriously interfere with or molest us in our <quote>change of base,</quote> or <quote>retreat,</quote> if <num value="1">one</num> prefers that term, though, as above remarked, it cannot be contended that the line we were leaving could ever have been designed for permanent occupation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>It is obvious, I say, that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0036.0007.00079.00276" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,Brinton,,:1"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> did learn the lesson we intended; for after <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> our army was allowed to pursue its march very leisurely up the peninsula &mdash; a considerable part of it stopping to finish the reenlistment and reorganization by the election of new officers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>But it is not a satisfactory battle to contemplate, because the administering of this lesson cost too much in blood, and this because, as so often happens, some <num value="1">one</num> blundered.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>He makes substantially the following points: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/><persName n="Magruder,General,,,," id="n0036.0007.00079.00280" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,John,Bankhead,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Magruder</surname></persName> had built, and was commended for building, a chain of redoubts across the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs> from the <rs>York</rs> to the <rs>James</rs>, as a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line; <placeName reg="Fort Magruder">Fort Magruder</placeName>, a strong closed work, about a mile from <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, on the main road running down the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>, being the key of the entire line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>The battle was fought in and from these fortifications, we occupying <placeName reg="Fort Magruder">Fort Magruder</placeName>, but, incredible as it may seem, not occupying the other works, and not even those within a short distance of the main road along which lay our route to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>Indeed <persName n="Hancock,General,,,," id="n0036.0007.00079.00281" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,Winfield,Scott,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hancock</surname></persName> was allowed, without firing a shot, to possess himself of <num value="1">one</num> or more of these works, and yet the heaviest loss in the action was entailed in the attempt to dislodge <persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n0036.0007.00079.00282" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,Winfield,Scott,,:1"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName>, which failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>Several of the <rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">general officers</rs>, by whose apparent neglect all this happened, <pb id="p.80" n="80"/> have publicly defended themselves by stating that they did not know and were not informed as to the location of these works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>It seems to go without saying that they ought to have been informed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>Furthermore, it is evident that if a single general officer upon our side was fully informed as to &mdash; the entire line, it was <persName n="Magruder,General,,,," id="n0036.0007.00080.00283" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,John,Bankhead,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Magruder</surname></persName>, who built it, and who, it seems, took no part in this battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>Indeed, as I remember, he had been sent on toward <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>As above intimated, it would seem impossible that all these facts should co-exist with prudence and generalship upon the part of all our leading officers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>There is, however, <num value="1">one</num> relief to the rather sombre picture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>Our troops, whether prudently and wisely led or not, certainly fought well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/><quote>Hancock the superb</quote> was generous enough to say that the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA24">Twenty-fourth Virginia</orgName> and the <orgName type="regiment" key="NC5">Fifth North Carolina</orgName>, the <num value="2">two</num> regiments which attacked his strong force in its fortified position, deserved to have the word <quote>immortal</quote> inscribed upon their banners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/><num value="2">Two</num> of the most vivid pictures in the gallery of my memory are set in the framing of this battle &mdash; the <num value="1">one</num> the most shocking instance of the unhuman demoraliation of war, the other the most inspiring illustration of the noblest traits developed by it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>During a lull in the fighting our guns were withdrawn and were in column parallel to the road, in a common on the outskirts of the town, resting and awaiting orders, when a number of wounded Federal prisoners were brought up in an ambulance and laid temporarily on the grass, while a field hospital was being established hard by. Among them was a poor wretch, shot through the bowels, who was rolling on the ground in excruciating agony and beseeching the bystanders to put him out of his misery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>There did not appear to be anything that could be done for him, at least not in advance of the coming of the surgeons, so I was in the act of turning away from the painful spectacle when a couple of Tureos, or <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> tigers, the most rakish and devilishlooking beings I ever saw, came up and peered over the shoulders of the circle of onlookers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>Suddenly <num value="1">one</num> of them pushed through the ring, saying: <quote>Put you out of your misery?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>Certainly, sir!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>and before <pb id="p.81" n="81"/> any <num value="1">one</num> had time to interfere, or even the faintest idea of his intention, brained the man with the butt of his musket; and the bloody club still in his hands, looking around upon the other wounded men, added glibly, <quote>Any other gentleman here'd like to be accommodated?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/></p> 
<p>It is impossible to express my feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>I fear that if I had had a loaded musket in my hands I should have illustrated the demoralization of war a little further by shooting down in his tracks the demon, who suddenly disappeared, as a gasp of horror escaped the spectators. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>For the honor of human nature, let me quickly give you the other picture. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>At the crisis of the battle we were stationed in <placeName reg="Fort Magruder">Fort Magruder</placeName>, as above explained, the key of our position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>I was standing, sponge-staff in hand, awaiting the firing of my gun, the next piece to the left being a gun of the <orgName n="Fayette Artillery" type="artillery">Fayette Artillery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>As my eye fell upon it, <num value="1">No. 1</num> was sponging out, <num value="3">No. 3</num>, of course, having his thumbstall pressed upon the vent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>Suddenly I saw <num value="3">No. 3</num> stoop, clapping his right hand upon his leg below the knee, and then I saw him topple slowly forward, never, however, lifting his thumb from the vent, but pressing it down close and hard-his elbow strained upward as his body sank forward and downward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>The heroic fellow had been <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot in the calf of the right leg, and as he bent to feel that wound a bullet crashed through his skull; but his last effort was to save <num value="1">No. 1</num> from the loss of his hands by premature explosion as he rammed home the next charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>I have never witnessed more sublime faithfulness unto death than was exhibited by the downward pressure of that thumb as it was literally dragged from the bole of the piece by the weight of the sinking body of the noble cannoneer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>This incident reminds me of another which well illustrates how receptive and retentive of pictorial impression are the minds of men-especially men of a certain type-at moments of intense excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>It is this faculty, in great measure, which imparts special interest and value to the personal reminiscences of men of this character. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>Nearly <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> after the <rs n="Battle of Williamsburg" type="battle">battle of Williamsburg</rs>, I think in <dateStruct value="1865-03-"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, entering the office of the provostshal <pb id="p.82" n="82"/> of the city of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and only time during the war, I found an officer, in a new uniform of a colonel of cavalry, in an unpleasant altercation with <num value="1">one</num> of the employees of the office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>As I approached he turned to me, saying: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>While pouring out this complaint the <rs>Colonel</rs> gazed at me with increasing interest and, as he ceased-starting a little-said abruptly: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/><quote>Yes, <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>,</quote> I replied, <quote>or at least, I have seen you, and I recall just when and where it was; but as you are the ranking officer won't you be good enough to say <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, if you can, when and where you saw me?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/></p> 
<p><quote>Certainly, sir,</quote> said he; <quote>it was at the <rs n="Battle of Williamsburg" type="battle">battle of Williamsburg</rs>, in <dateStruct value="1862-05-"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/></p> 
<p>My recollection exactly coincided with his. The officer, I think, was <persName n="Davis,Colonel,J.,Lucius,," id="n0036.0007.00082.00284" reg="expanded:Davis,James,Lucius,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>Lucius</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, who commanded a body of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> troops at <placeName reg="Charles Town, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117756">Charlestown</placeName> or <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> during the <rs>John Brown</rs> raid; but, whoever he was, he was not a colonel at <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, but I think a captain; and, as I remember, then wore a brown-gray tunic belted around his waist, and his hair, which was then quite long, swept back from his forehead as he gallantly led his men, sabre in hand, at full speed against the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>We never met save on the <num value="2">two</num> occasions mentioned and could not possibly have seen each other at <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> more than a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>The rank, dress, bearing-everything, indeed, save the essential personality of the <num value="2">two</num> men-was entirely different at the <num value="2">two</num> meetings, and yet neither of us felt the slightest hesitation as to mutual identification or the time, place, and circumstances of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/><pb id="p.83" n="83"/> </p> 
<p>The <num value="1">one</num> feature of the march up the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs> was mud. Even the great <quote>Mud turtle</quote> himself must have been satiated with it. As for me, I had never imagined anything approximating to it. The ground had been saturated by recent heavy rains, which seemed to have brought down with them myriads of diminutive green frogs, the only living organisms, except of course the mud turtle, which could enjoy the big lob-lolly puddles into which the road-bed had been churned by the multitude of houghs and wheels and the feet of the trampling <num value="1000">thousands</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>Our company wagon, containing a present supply of commissary and quartermaster stores and all our extra clothing, sank to the hubs and had to be abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>We feared for the guns and could not think of wasting teams on wagons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>The danger was really imminent that the guns themselves would have to be abandoned, and the captain instructed me to have at hand a haversack with hammer and spikes and to keep near the rear of the battery, and if a gun could not be dragged through the mud, then to <quote>spike it</quote> as thoroughly as I could, slip the trunnions from the sockets and let the piece drop into the deepest mud I could find, and mark the spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>By dint, however, of fine driving, and heavy lifting and shoving at the wheels, we managed to save our brazen war dogs, for which we were beginning to feel a strong attachment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>The poor horses often sank to their bellies, and we were several times compelled to unhitch a stalled horse, tie a prolonge around him, hitch the rest of the team to the rope and drag him out. I mean just what I say when I aver that I saw a team of mules disappear, every hair, under the mud, in the middle of the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>Of course they had <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fallen, in their impotent efforts to extricate themselves, and they afterwards arose and emerged from their baptism of mud, at once the most melancholy and the most ludicrous-looking objects that could be imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>It was wretched, and yet it had its funny side. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>We mounted upon the gun and caisson horses, for the emergency, the very best men, regard being had to the single requisite of skill and experience in handling draft horses and heavy loads, and no regard whatever as to whether or <pb id="p.84" n="84"/> not they had theretofore been battery drivers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>In this way it happened that <num value="2">two</num> of the finest soldiers in the command were driving at my gun, the <num value="1">one</num> the wheel team and the other the lead, there being at the time <num value="6">six</num> horses to the piece.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>It was stalled, and <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> unsuccessful efforts having been made to start it, the wheel driver declared that it was the fault of the leader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>The latter retorted, and the war of words waxed hot, until suddenly the wheel charioteer dismounted in the thigh-deep mud and, struggling up abreast of the lead team, dared the driver of it to get down and fight it out then and there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>It is possible the other would have accepted the challenge if a glance down at his friend and foe had not brought the absurdity of the entire thing so vividly before him that he simply threw his head back in a burst of laughter, saying, <quote>Why <persName><foreName>Billy</foreName></persName>, you must take me for an infernal fool, to expect me to get down in that infernal mud to fight you!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>Whereupon the gentleman in the mud laughed, too, as did everybody within sight and hearing, and <persName><foreName>Billy</foreName></persName> struggled back to his wheelers, remounted, and with <quote>a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull altogether</quote> --out she came. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>Another gentleman-he who had <quote>resigned</quote> when all trunks were sent to the rear from Manassas-having gotten at the company wagon this day, just before it was abandoned, had on a beautiful new suit of <quote><persName n="Crenshaw,,,,," id="n0036.0007.00084.00285" reg="mostcommon:Crenshaw,nomatch:0"><surname>Crenshaw</surname></persName> gray,</quote> and, thus arrayed, was making a perilous passage out in the woods parallel to the road, dodging behind the big pine trees and springing from tussock to tussock of swamp grass and bushes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>The boys had been watching him for some time, but he begged so hard, by cabalistic signs, that they had not <quote>told on him.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>But finally the lieutenant saw him and called to him to come and get in the mud and help start a stalled gun. Of course he had to come, but he came very slowly, meanwhile beseeching the boys to <quote>put on a little more steam and get the gun out!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/></p> 
<p>But the fellows had now come to appreciate the fun of the thing, as had also the lieutenant, and he ordered them to do nothing until <persName><foreName>Jim</foreName></persName> should get down in the mud with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>He wriggled and squirmed, his comrades standing in <pb id="p.85" n="85"/> the mud about the gun jeering and jibing at him, as he mounted and walked upon a big pine log which projected out to the slough of despond in which the gun was stuck, till, getting about squarely over it, he stopped and begged once more; but the boys shouted derisively, and the lieutenant called out, <quote>Get down to it, sir; nobody's going to shove a pound until you get in and shove with the rest!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>Poor <persName><foreName>Jim</foreName></persName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>He lifted his foot and stamped it down in vexation on the wet bark, which parted and slipped from the smooth, slick bole of the tree, and down came <persName><foreName>Jim</foreName></persName>, with a great splash like the mules, hide and hair and <persName n="Crenshaw,,,,," id="n0036.0007.00085.00286" reg="mostcommon:Crenshaw,nomatch:0"><surname>Crenshaw</surname></persName> gray, all into and under the mud. I don't think I ever heard such a shout as greeted this <quote>knight of the sorrowful figure</quote> as he emerged, from his thighs up, the liquid mud dripping from every part of the upper half of his person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>But it cured him and his suit as well, the beautiful <placeName reg="Crenshaw, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098680">Crenshaw</placeName> gray thenceforward exhibiting a sickly, jaundiced, butter-nut hue, like the clothes some backwoods cracker regiments wore when they <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> came to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>Only <num value="1">one</num> other feature of our march up the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs> merits notice, and that was our almost actual starvation on the way. The cause of. this was separation from our brigade, which was probably <placeName><distance reg="10miles">ten miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName></placeName> before we were ordered to follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>In the condition of the roads already described, catching up with any particular body of troops was of course out of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>We really had nothing to eat for <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> and nights, except, that, as we were compelled to impress corn for the horses &mdash; of course old, hard corn-we roasted a little of it for ourselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>On the <dateStruct value="--3"><day reg="2">third</day></dateStruct> <time>day</time> we overhauled a commissary train, in a by-road we were traveling to escape the jam and the mud, and <persName n="McCarthy,Captain,,,," id="n0036.0007.00085.00287" reg="mostcommon:McCarthy,Daniel,Stephens,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>McCarthy</surname></persName>, making known the extreme need of his men, begged rations enough to give them just <num value="1">one</num> meal; but the officer in charge answered: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>We sprang with a shout to execute the <rs>Captain</rs>'s order, and in a few moments had our <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> rations, cooking them in the few utensils we always kept with us, and soon made a good square meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>But I cannot give a fairer or better idea of our view of the battle than by quoting from pages <num value="48">48</num>, <num value="49">49</num> of <persName n="Taylor,Colonel,,,," id="n0036.0009.00103.00392" reg="nearbymention:Taylor,Walter,H.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>'s admirable book: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>From these extracts I think it will be clear to the candid reader that the retreat to the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName> was a compulsory <num value="1">one</num>, and due to a defeat then acknowledged by <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0036.0009.00103.00393" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,Brinton,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> himself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>The fighting, however, was not invariably attended with success to the <rs>Confederates</rs>; notably, the defense of <placeName key="tgn,2489907" n="1.000 203" reg="malvern hill, charles city, virginia">Malvern Hill</placeName> by the <rs>Federals</rs> was in favor of the latter, which result was as much due to the mismanagement of the <rs>Confederate</rs> troops as to the naturally strong position occupied by the <rs>Federals</rs> and their gallantry in its defense. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>Considerable delay was occasioned in the pursuit from the fact that the ground was unknown to the <rs>Confederate</rs> commanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>On this occasion <persName n="Magruder,General,,,," id="n0036.0009.00103.00394" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,John,Bankhead,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Magruder</surname></persName> took the wrong route and had to be recalled, thereby losing much precious time; and when after serious and provoking delay the lines were formed for attack, there was some misunderstanding of the orders of the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs>, and instead of a spirited, united advance by the entire line, as contemplated, the divisions were moved forward at different times, each attacking independently, and each in turn repulsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>Moreover, owing to the peculiar character of the ground, artillery could not be advantageously placed to aid the assaulting columns; whereas the <rs>Federal</rs> batteries, strongly posted and most handsomely served, contributed in a very great degree to the successful stand made by <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0036.0009.00103.00395" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,Brinton,,:1"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s retreating army at <placeName key="tgn,2489907" n="1.000 203" reg="malvern hill, charles city, virginia">Malvern Hill</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>I have characterized the foregoing as a fair statement, as it certainly is, and yet even this fails to convey an adequate impression of the stunning and temporarily depressing effect of this battle upon our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>As to my own experience and feelings, the revelation I am about to make may be a damaging <num value="1">one</num>, yet I have no desire to sail under false colors, and then, too, my own case may serve to confirm and in part to explain the remarkable statements below made as to the sudden and fearful deterioration in the condition of our army which this battle, for the time, effected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/><num value="3">Three</num> of the guns of the old battery were put in action against <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0036.0009.00103.00396" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,Brinton,,:1"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s majestic aggregation of batteries, by way of at least making a diversion in favor of our assaulting <pb id="p.104" n="104"/> infantry, a diversion which I presume we to some extent accomplished; for I never conceived anything approximating the shower and storm of projectiles and the overwhelming cataclysm of destruction which were at once turned upon our pitiful little popguns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>In the short time they existed as effective pieces they were several times fired by fragments of Federal shell striking them after the lanyard was stretched and before it was pulled; and in almost less time than it takes to tell it the carriages were completely crushed, smashed, and splintered and the guns themselves so injured and defaced that we were compelled to send them to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, after the battle, to be remoulded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>We were put in action, too, after a long, hot run. I was as sound and strong as human flesh could well be, and yet my lungs seemed to be pumped out, my brain reeled and my tongue clave to the roof of my mouth, which was burnt so dry that I experienced great difficulty in swallowing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>Nevertheless, I managed to do my part in serving my gun, until, in a few moments, it was completely disabled, when I fell to the earth, a horror of great darkness came upon me, and the only distinct impression I can recall is that I felt I would be glad to compromise on annihilation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>When I roused myself from this semi-stupor or swoon the detachment seemed to have disappeared, but in a few moments I found most of the men. I remember catching by the collar <num value="1">one</num> who had dropped down, <quote>all in a heap,</quote> in an unnecessarily exposed position on the projecting root of a large tree and jerking him up; when on the instant a shell tore to pieces the root upon which he had been seated, and yet he sank down again but a step or <num value="2">two</num> from the spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>It was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> battle in which members of the company had been killed outright.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>The wonder is that any survived who were working these <num value="3">three</num> pieces; but I suppose it is to be accounted for by the fact that the guns were quickly disabled and put out of action. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/>I think it was even worse than this, and that in some cases single brigades advanced to the attack and were almost literally swept backward by what seemed to be the fire of a continuous line of battle of artillery. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>He was fond of horses, an excellent judge of them, and used to ride or drive the very best that could be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>I say <quote>ride or drive.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>He was then between <num value="65">sixty-five</num> and <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure> of age and, though vigorous and enthusiastic, found it very comfortable to drive sometimes; but his selected vehicle was at once the most unclerical and unmilitary that could well be imagined &mdash; a regulation skeleton <quote>trotting sulky.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>He <pb id="p.112" n="112"/> kept his saddle at our battery and his habit was, when we were not actually fighting or on the move, to return to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> at night, coming down in the morning with a big market basket strapped under his sulky full of bread and good things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>His approach was generally heralded by the shouts of the soldiers who followed; when, looking up the road, we would see him, often standing on the shafts, scattering biscuit and reading aloud the latest telegrams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>Hundreds of men would sometimes follow him to our camp, and then he would have prayers with them and make a brief religious address. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>It will at once occur to the reader as remarkable that father was not arrested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>He was, a few days later, at <placeName key="tgn,2489907" n="1.000 203" reg="malvern hill, charles city, virginia">Malvern Hill</placeName>, by order of <persName n="Rans,General,,,," id="n0036.0009.00112.00456" reg="mostcommon:Rans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Rans</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>It must be remembered that my father was a Christian minister, devoted to the soldiers, and a sort of chaplaingeneral among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>He was ready to whisper the consolations of religion in the ear of a dying man, to help the litter bearers, or to carry a wounded man off on his horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>Then, too, he was well known to many of our generals to whom, by the way, he carried a vast amount of information gathered on his daring scouts ahead even of our skirmishers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>I myself heard <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of the most prominent generals say that it was their belief my father had seen more of the fighting of the <measure n="7Days" type="date">Seven Days</measure>, from start to finish, than any other <num value="1">one</num> man in or out of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>I was of course deeply anxious about him, but he could not be controlled, and my belief was then, and is now, that the <rs>Federal</rs> skirmishers often refrained from firing upon him simply because they did not care at the time to expose their position. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>Many of our soldiers knew him, especially the <name>Georgians</name>, <persName n="Virginians,,,,," id="n0036.0009.00113.00459" reg="mostcommon:Virginians,nomatch:0"><surname>Virginians</surname></persName> and Mississippians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/><placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> was his native State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>In his early days he had done a great deal of evangelistic work in all parts of it, and many young men and boys in the army had heard their parents speak of him. I remember <num value="1">one</num> evening, after a most impressive sermon to <persName n="Cobb,,,,," id="n0036.0009.00113.00460" reg="mostcommon:Cobb,Tom,,,:1"><surname>Cobb</surname></persName>'s or <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Cummings,,,,," id="n0036.0009.00113.00461" reg="mostcommon:Cummings,nomatch:0"><surname>Cummings</surname></persName>' brigade</orgName>, overhearing a lot of soldiers talking at a spring, when <num value="1">one</num> of them, anxious to appear a little more familiarly acquainted with the preacher than the rest, said, <quote>I've heard my mother talk of the old <rs>Doctor</rs> many a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>I reckon the old fellow's given me many a dose of physic for croup.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/></p> 
<p>An incident occurred, on or near the <measure n="9Mile" type="distance">Nine-Mile</measure> road, some time before the week of battle opened which is strongly <pb id="p.114" n="114"/> illustrative at once of my father's faith and of the childlike simplicity of the great bulk of our soldiery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/><num value="2">Two</num> companies, <orgName type="company" n="Company I">I</orgName> think from <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, were supporting a section of our battery in an advanced and somewhat isolated position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>About the middle of the afternoon father drove down from <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and after he had distributed his provisions and talked with us a while, proposed to have prayers, which was readily acceded to. Quite a number of men from the neighboring commands gathered, and just as we knelt and my father began his petitions the batteries across the way sent <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> shells entirely too close to our heads to be comfortable &mdash; I presume just by way of determining the object of this concourse. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>I confess my faith and devotion were not strong enough to prevent my opening my eyes and glancing around.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>The scene that met them was almost too much for my reverence and came near being fatal to my decorum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>Our <placeName reg="Carolina City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2222249">Carolina</placeName> supports, like the rest of us, had knelt and closed their eyes at my father's invocation and, simple-hearted fellows that they were, felt that it would be little less than sacrilege to rise or to open them until the prayer should be completed; and yet their faith was not quite equal to assuring them of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> protection, or at least they felt it would be wise and well to supplement the protection of heaven by the trees and stumps of earth, <hi rend="italics">if they could find them</hi>, and so they were actually groping for them with arms wide extended but eyes tight closed, and still on their knees. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>I hardly know what might have been the effect upon me of this almost impossibly ludicrous scene had I not glanced toward my father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>As was his habit in public prayer, he was standing; his tall, majestic figure erect and his worshipful, reverent face upturned to Heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>Not a nerve trembled, not a note quavered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>In a single sentence he committed us all to <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> special keeping while he worshiped; and then, evidently, he did worship and supplicate the <rs>Divine Being</rs> without the slightest further consciousness of the bursting shells, which in a few moments ceased shrieking above or about us, and our little service closed without further interruption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>And then it was beautiful to observe how these simple-hearted boys gazed at my father, as if indeed <pb id="p.115" n="115"/> he had been <num value="1">one</num> of the ancient prophets; but I heard some of them say they liked that old preacher mighty well, but they didn't just feel certain whether they wanted him around having prayers so close under the <rs>Yankee</rs> guns; that he <quote>didn't seem to pay hardly enough attention to them things.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>They were exposed to the fire I have already described, and of course suffered bloody repulse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>On the way back his men proposed to carry him with them to the rear, but he refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>He was sitting up and pluckily applying his handkerchief as a tourniquet above the wound, and he simply said: <quote>Tell the <name>Twentyfirst</name> they can't get me till they take those guns!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/></p> 
<p>When the line passed him on the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> charge, <persName n="Brandon,,,,," id="n0036.0009.00115.00466" reg="nearbymention:Brandon,Lane,,,"><surname>Brandon</surname></persName> put his hat on his sword, held it up and waved it, cheering the regiment on, but in a few moments the bleeding remnant staggered to the rear again, and again they came for their colonel, insisting that they must carry him with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>The old soldier actually drew his revolver, declaring that he would shoot down any man who laid hands upon him, and he repeated his former message: <quote>Tell the <num value="21" type="ordinal">Twenty-first</num> they can't get their colonel till they take those guns!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/></p> 
<p>Again the charge swept by the prostrate old man, who waved his sword and his hat, urging his men up the awful slope; but when again they returned to the rear utterly broken and shattered, the old hero had fainted and the litter bearers bore him off the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>I saw him in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> a few days later.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>His leg had been amputated below the knee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>He was doing wondrous well physically, but was full of deep dissatisfaction, mortification <pb id="p.116" n="116"/> and rage about the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>I admitted the gross mismanagement and was saying something in extenuation, when the old fellow broke in: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/></p> 
<p>I confess I was utterly confounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>My recollection is that officers were not mounted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>Of course he quickened his pace, partly because his presence was required <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> at <num value="1">one</num> end of the line and then at the other; but the marvel to me was that he lived at all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>But the fact is, I was that exceptionally fortunate soldier who never experienced either disabling sickness or wounds or captivity until the very end of the struggle, and my absence from the active front is to be accounted for on other grounds. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>I think, too, though I am not sure, that the churches had already begun to give their bells to be moulded into cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>Our mother and sisters had not yet been able to get South, but the faithful people of my father's former pastoral charge assured me that they stood ready to receive and care for them with open hearts in open homes, and, until they arrived, noble women stood ready, in case my brother or I should need such ministrations, to do, as far as possible, a mother's and a sister's part by us. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/>I recall this as <num value="1">one</num> of the most comfortless and trying nights of my life, and yet so sound and tough were we that I do not recall that a single man of us wheezed, or even.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/>Indeed the right to grumble is the only civil, political, or social right left to the soldier, and he stands much in his own light if he does not exercise it to the full.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>We found rather an uncomfortable and forbidding location selected for us outside of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, and we were in a temper too bad to do much for its improvement, so that, as to external conditions, we had rather a hard, comfortless winter; though, even as to these, we perhaps did better than the commands who were ordered to the front later. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/>The next incident of interest was the bombardment of the old town, but I do not care to enlarge upon this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1111"/>I never saw a more pitiful procession than they made trudging through the deep snow, after the warning was given and as the hour drew near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1112"/>I saw little children tugging along with their doll babies,--some bigger than they were,--but holding their feet up carefully above the snow, and women so old and feeble that they could carry nothing and could barely hobble themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>There were women carrying a baby in <num value="1">one</num> arm and its bottle, its clothes, and its covering in the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>Some had a Bible and a <rs n="tooth brush" type="product">tooth brush</rs> in <num value="1">one</num> hand, a picked chicken and a bag of flour in the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1128"/>It is fair to say for <persName n="Barksdale,General,,,," id="n0036.0010.00129.00553" reg="mostcommon:Barksdale,Thomas,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Barksdale</surname></persName> that when our captain galloped rapidly into town and explained the matter to him, he himself withdrew his own order; but <persName n="McLaws,General,,,," id="n0036.0010.00129.00554" reg="mostcommon:McLaws,Lafayette,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McLaws</surname></persName> had already acted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1227"/>No account of my experience as a Confederate soldier would be complete if it failed to refer to the religious life of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1228"/>This was an element of importance in all our armies, from the outset to the end, and was recognized and fostered as such by our leading generals, many of whom attended the religious services held among the men of their commands, some of them taking loving direction of these services. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1229"/>I remember on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, when my father was preaching to <persName n="Cobb,,Tom,,," id="n0036.0011.00138.00592" reg="default:Cobb,Tom,,,"><foreName>Tom</foreName> <surname>Cobb</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="brigade">brigade</orgName>, on the lines about <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, that the service was interrupted by sharp firing in front and the command marched off into the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1230"/>It proved a false alarm, however; the troops soon returned and the service was resumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1231"/>But the men were preoccupied, nervous, and widely scattered, and everything dragged, until the general, rising, begged my father to wait a moment, and called out: <quote>Men, get up close together here in front, till your shoulders meet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1258"/>To this graphic picture may I add a few touches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1259"/>There was a soldier in a red blanket overcoat who had a voice like the sound of many waters, and who almost invariably sat or stood on the pulpit steps and led the singing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1260"/>I remember, too, the many marks of cannon balls upon and in and through the building, and that it added to the thrill of the services to realize that we were gathered under the frowning batteries upon <placeName reg="Stafford, Stafford, Virginia" key="tgn,2114347">Stafford Heights</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1264"/>I remember that <num value="1">one</num> of these private soldiers, in illustrating and enforcing the folly of living in this world as if we were to live in it forever, asked his comrades what they would think of the good sense or even the sanity of <num value="1">one</num> of their number who should to-morrow morning send to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> for an elegant wrapper, velvet smoking cap and slippers, and when they came, throwing away his blanket and stout shoes and clothes, should insist upon arraying himself in <quote>these butterfly things</quote> in the face of the fact that the next moment the long roll might turn him out into the deep snow or the guns of the enemy batter down his cantonment over his head. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1265"/>Another, speaking of the trivial things to which a man gives his heart and for which he may lose his soul, speculated with the finest &mdash; fancy as to what it was, and how very a trifle it may have been, that turned the heart and the gaze of <persName><foreName>Lot</foreName></persName>'s wife back toward <placeName key="tgn,7016893" n="1.000 1" reg="">Sodom</placeName> and turned her breathing body into a dead pillar of salt. </p>

<p>Brethren, I want you to know what a merciful, forgiving being the <rs>Lord</rs> is, and to do that I've got to tell you what a mean-spirited liar I am.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1272"/>Of course I couldn't pray, but at last I managed to say, <quote><rs type="role2">Lord</rs>!

<p>And so it was, brethren, all through that dreadful day; fighting, fighting, and not daring to pray. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1280"/>But, brethren, He did it, He did it; and the moment the thing was over I wouldn't give myself time to lie again, so I just took out and ran as hard as ever I could into the deep, dark woods, where <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and me was alone together, and I <pb id="p.143" n="143"/> threw my musket down on the ground and I went right down myself, too, on my knees, and cried out, <quote>Thank you, <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>; thank you, <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1284"/>Some of the chaplains were very uncommon men. My father, who was in the ministry more than <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> and had a very wide experience with men, expressed the highest estimate of them. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1286"/>My recollection is that he had been a private soldier and was commissioned chaplain, because he was already doing the work of <num value="1">one</num>-yes, of half a dozen --without the commission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1288"/>By this I do not mean to imply that his ability was small, but simply that I do not include in this statement a few men I have known, of extraordinary abilities and opportunities. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1289"/><quote><persName><roleName n="Brother">Brother</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName></persName>,</quote> as we used to call him, was also a man of the sweetest, loveliest spirit, but of the most unflinching courage as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1290"/>After he became chaplain he never felt it right or fitting that he should attempt to kill or wound a man, so he never fired another shot, yet he was seldom back of the actual line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1291"/>It may give some faint idea of his exalted <name>Christian</name> heroism to say that his regular habit was to take charge of the litter-bearers in battle, and <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to see to the removal of the wounded, Federal as well as Confederate, when the former fell into our hands; and then to attend to the burial of the dead of both sides, when we held <pb id="p.144" n="144"/> the field and the enemy did not ask leave to bury their own dead. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1292"/>It will be remembered by Federal soldiers that the <rs>American Tract</rs> or <orgName n="Bible Society" type="society">Bible Society</orgName> published Testaments with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> flag on the fly leaf, and, on the folds of the banner, the printed words, <quote>If I should fall, send this to -- ,</quote> space being left for his home address, which each soldier was supposed to write in the appropriate place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1293"/>Dear <persName><roleName n="Brother">Brother</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName></persName> could not always burden himself with all these Testaments taken from the dead soldiers' pockets; but because that was not possible, he used to carry a little blank book in which he would copy the home addresses of the dead soldiers and would afterwards write to their friends, telling them where they were buried, and, if possible, how their bodies might be identified. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1294"/>After <num value="1">one</num> of the bloody repulses of the enemy at <placeName key="tgn,2114316" n="1.000 8" reg="spotsylvania, spotsylvania, virginia">Spottsylvania</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, <persName><roleName n="Brother">Brother</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName></persName> was, as usual, out in front of our works, utterly unconscious of his own heroism or his own peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1327"/>We heard the commands of the officers, the tramp of the men, the rumble of the artillery carriages, the shouts and curses of the drivers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/>Neither of us had heretofore asked anything in the nature of a furlough, or leave of absence, feeling that our comrades who, by such leave, would be enabled to see father and mother, sisters and home, should be entitled to the preference; and now, when it became known that our dear people were in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, everyone stood back for us and urged our claims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1417"/>He was a man of intellect and culture, as well as character; as a friend ever faithful, as a companion always agreeable, as an officer enjoying the unqualified confidence and approval of his superiors, and the universal respect and affection of his subordinates. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1418"/>I am well aware that all this should have resulted in even more, but he who never did injustice to others never did full justice to himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1439"/>Upon reflection, I think the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> order of detail for duty at his headquarters, by <persName n="Cabell,Colonel,,,," id="n0036.0012.00157.00648" reg="nearbymention:Cabell,H.,C.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Cabell</surname></persName> himself, prior to <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>, as above suggested, is very probable, as I do not otherwise see how the <rs>Colonel</rs> would have known me or had reason to suppose I would be satisfactory to him in the position. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1440"/>Among matters worthy of note occurring prior to <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>, it may not be out of place to mention the very active commerce or interchange of commodities, carried on by tiny sailing vessels, between the <name>north</name> and <name>south</name> banks of the <placeName reg="Rappahannock, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1129010">Rappahannock River</placeName>, at and below <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, both before and after that battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1441"/>The communication was almost constant and the vessels many of them really beautiful little craft, with shapely hulls, nicely painted; elaborate rigging, trim sails, closed decks, and perfect working steering apparatus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1442"/>The cargoes, besides the newspapers of the <num value="2">two</num> sides, usually consisted on our side of tobacco and on the <rs>Federal</rs> side of coffee and sugar, yet the trade was by no means confined to these articles, and on a sunny, pleasant day the waters were fairly dotted with the fairy fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1443"/>Many a weary hour of picket duty was thus relieved and lightened, and most of the officers seemed to wink at the infraction of military law, if such it was. A few rigidly interdicted it, but it never really ceased. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1444"/>Another institutional amusement of the army in the winter of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">3</year></dateStruct>, which tended greatly to relieve the almost unendurable tedium of camp life, was the snow-ball battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1445"/>These contests were unique in many respects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1446"/>In the first place here was sport, or friendly combat, on the grandest scale, perhaps, known in modern times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1447"/>Entire brigades lined up against each other for the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1448"/>And not the masses of men only, but the organized military bodies-the line and field officers, the bands and the banners, the generals and their staffs, mounted as for genuine battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1449"/>There was the formal demand for the surrender of the camp, and the refusal, the charge, and the repulse; the front, the flank, the rear attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1450"/>And there was intense earnestness in the struggle-sometimes limbs were broken and eyes, at least <pb id="p.158" n="158"/> temporarily, put out, and the camp equipment of the vanquished was regarded as fair booty to the victors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1451"/>I recall a visit paid in company with my father, not long after the <rs n="Battle of Fredericksburg" type="battle">battle of Fredericksburg</rs>, to the camp of my uncle mentioned in a former chapter as having been in command of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Lawton,,,,," id="n0036.0012.00158.00649" reg="mostcommon:Lawton,Alexander,Robert,,:1"><surname>Lawton</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> in that fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1452"/>He was still in command of it. My father asked the cause of several very heavy bruises on his face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1453"/>I never saw my uncle more deeply embarrassed, as he related, blushing like a girl, what he called his <quote>preposterous experience</quote> in leading his brigade the day before in a snow battle with <persName n="Hoke,,,,," id="n0036.0012.00158.00650" reg="mostcommon:Hoke,Robert,Frederick,,:1"><surname>Hoke</surname></persName>'s, which lasted several hours-and as the really laughable picture was developed, its strong coloring heightened by my uncle's embarrassed blushes, I never saw my father more heartily amused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1454"/>It seemed that my uncle at <num value="1">one</num> point in the conflict had been dragged from his horse and captured by <persName n="Hoke,,,,," id="n0036.0012.00158.00651" reg="mostcommon:Hoke,Robert,Frederick,,:1"><surname>Hoke</surname></persName>'s men, but later had been recaptured by his own command, and on both occasions had been pretty roughly handled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1455"/><num value="1">One</num> would have supposed these veteran troops had seen too much of the real thing to seek amusement in playing at battle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1456"/>I had now been in the army for nearly <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> and was still a private soldier, yet quite content as such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1457"/>My mental attitude in this regard was perhaps rather unusual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1458"/>I had originally volunteered exclusively from sense of duty, regarding the war, so far as it affected me personally, as an interruption to my personal purposes and ambitions in connection with the law; but I was never <num value="1">one</num> of those who considered the conflict to be a matter of <num value="60">sixty</num> or <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure> or a year, and soon came to look upon it as of indefinite duration and likely to prove an absorbing business to me for a long time to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1459"/>Gradually I became interested in military life and began to contemplate it as perhaps my life work, and from this time my interest in it grew apace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1460"/>Still I had thought little of promotion except in the aspect of making myself deserving of it. True, <persName n="Hill,General,,,," id="n0036.0012.00158.00652" reg="nearbymention:Hill,A.,P.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName> had, at quite an early period, said something of a commission, but none had come, and I had continued to look upon the position, even of a corporal, as requiring a certain amount of military aptitude, not to say talent and training, which I was not confident I had. <pb id="p.159" n="159"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1461"/>But this morbid and unpractical view of things was giving way before the stubborn fact, established by observation and experience, that I every day saw men in position far above me, obviously my inferiors in every qualification and requisite for rank and command; nor could I be blind to the further fact that my commanding officers regarded me with rather special confidence and approval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1462"/>Gradually I came to entertain the idea that I might some day be offered promotion and perhaps should not feel called upon to reject it, though I could never contemplate any effort on my part to secure it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1463"/>While I was in this state of mind, some little time before the opening of the <rs n="Chancellorsville Campaign" type="campaign">Chancellorsville campaign</rs>, I received a communication from the <rs type="place">Engineer Bureau</rs> in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> containing an appointment to a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> lieutenancy in <quote>Engineer troops,</quote> a new corps about to be organized in the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1464"/>There was no explanation accompanying the paper, and I did not recognize as familiar any name connected with it, and after due reflection concluded that the communication had been sent me by mistake and was intended for my cousin, <persName n="Stiles,,Robert,Mackay,," id="n0036.0012.00159.00653" reg="default:Stiles,Robert,Mackay,,"><foreName>Robert</foreName> <foreName>Mackay</foreName> <surname>Stiles</surname></persName>, who was an engineer, as I understood, then serving in the far <rs>South</rs> in some appropriate capacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1465"/>I supposed his services were desired in organizing the new corps, and I actually returned the paper, with the above suggestion, and therewith dismissed the matter from my mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1466"/>Meanwhile there occurred <num value="1">one</num> of the most noteworthy experiences of my life. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1505"/>To our friends, the enemy, the only relation between the swelling of the sassafras buds and the spring-burst of battle was chronological; but with us the sassafras amounted almost to a sub-commissariat-we chewed it, we drank it, we smelled it, and it was ever at hand without the trouble or expense of transport. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1562"/>In that case we might exhale a deep, full breath; for a little while, at least, the extreme tension would be off. But if the horses' heads turned to the right, then we knew well that it was to be the closest and deadliest grapple we had ever experienced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1563"/>I cannot remember which I thought the wiser alternative or what part I took in the discussion; <pb id="p.167" n="167"/> but I do distinctly recall that when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun struck the main road and the heads of the leaders swung around <hi rend="italics">to the right</hi>, I drew in my breath and set my teeth, calling upon what was best and strongest in my entire being to brace me for the struggle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1564"/>I think it was a day or so before we finally left the <rs type="place">Fredericksburg lines</rs> that there occurred <num value="1">one</num> of the most remarkable minor incidents I witnessed from the beginning to the end of the war. We had lifted the ammunition chest out of the hole, back of and beneath the little work we had been occupying, and had replaced it upon the gun carriage and limbered up the piece.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1565"/>A group of about a dozen men, not all belonging to our battery, were standing upon the earth-work gazing across the river bottom to the <name>Stafford</name> side, when a little puff of white smoke indicated that the gentlemen on the other side had determined to try their longrange guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1566"/>The shell flew a little too high, but directly above us and too close to be comfortable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1567"/>Before quite reaching us, however, it began to wobble and turn over, indicating that the projectile or propulsive force was well nigh exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1568"/>My recollection is that we could see the shell distinctly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1569"/>An infantryman jumped from the work into the hole just vacated by the limber chest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1570"/>The shell exploded just after it passed us, and the base came hurtling back and actually dashed out the brains of that man, the only man who had not stood his ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1571"/>Several other shots were fired, but not a man flinched and not another man was injured. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1572"/>I was reminded of a story of <persName><roleName n="Emperor">the Emperor</roleName> <foreName>Napoleon</foreName></persName>, who in visiting his picket line with the corporal of the guard came to a position which commanded just the view he wanted of the enemy's lines, but was exposed to a galling and dangerous fire from their sharpshooters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1573"/>The little corporal was standing, absorbed as was his wont when analyzing a battle-field, head sunk between his shoulders, hands behind his back and limbs far apart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1574"/>He turned to speak to the corporal of the guard, and just as he did so a ball passed between the <rs>Emperor</rs>'s legs and killed the corporal, crouching behind him for protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1605"/>He was a Welsh fice, very small, but beautifully formed, gleaming white in color, with a few spots of jet black, his hair fine and short, and lying close and smooth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1606"/>He did not carry guns enough, metaphorically speaking, to amount to much in a canine encounter, but he was a born warrior, a perfect hero in battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1629"/>I never before felt such a rising of my heart into my throat as I did while lying just behind the crest of the ridge, gazing intently upon this scene and aiding the gunners of the <num value="2">two</num> pieces in making careful estimate of the distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1630"/>We were unwilling to waste a shot, knowing that, in the very nature of things, such an opportunity would not be long vouchsafed us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1631"/>We had already unlimbered and moved the gun3 forward by hand, so that their muzzles just failed to project over the brow of the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1632"/>We went back to the limbers, <pb id="p.173" n="173"/> took out <num value="2">two</num> shells and cut the fuses accurately in accordance with our estimate of the distance, loaded and ran both pieces forward again until they just cleared the crest of the ridge; then, running down the screws and elevating the muzzles appropriately to the distance, every man in the detachment fell into place, the primers were inserted in the vents and both lanyards pulled simultaneously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1633"/>The ear detected but <num value="1">one</num> discharge, and the <num value="2">two</num> shells flew screaming and bursting together in the very midst of the mass of <orgName n="Federal Artillery" type="artillery">Federal artillery</orgName>, exploding certainly <num value="1">one</num>, and, as it seemed, <num value="2">two</num>, ammunition chests or caissons. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1634"/>The blow was utterly unexpected, the effect overwhelming, and we gave them no time to recover, but kept throwing in <hi rend="italics">shell</hi> as rapidly as the guns could be loaded and discharged, until the entire hillside seemed to be cleared for the time of both artillery and infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1636"/>No pickets had been thrown out in our front so far as we knew; there was no infantry support with us; minie balls began to drop in very briskly; the hillside we had cleared filled up again, and it was deemed prudent for us to retire. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1637"/>Strange it is, but I have not the slightest recollection as to what artillery officer was in charge of us, but I do remember that in retiring to our former position we passed very close to <persName n="McLaws,General,Lafayette,,," id="n0036.0013.00173.00736" reg="default:McLaws,Lafayette,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>Lafayette</foreName> <surname>McLaws</surname></persName>, commanding the division to which generally, as on this occasion, we were attached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1640"/>I assured him that he was misinformed, and that I <pb id="p.174" n="174"/> knew what I was talking about, as I had helped to estimate the distance and cut the fuses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1641"/>I do not now exactly recall what the distance was, but I am positive now, as I was then, that it was within range of our shortest-ranged guns, and I insisted that with our <num value="8">eight</num> guns in action on that hill (the other <num value="8">eight</num> had been left at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> with <persName n="Early,,,,," id="n0036.0013.00174.00738" reg="nearbymention:Early,Jubal,,,"><surname>Early</surname></persName>) we could fairly blow up <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1643"/>I have an indistinct recollection that we boosted the general, who was short and stout, to the top of an old tobacco barn, but his view was very little extended even from that vantage ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1644"/>Nevertheless, he came to our opinion and sent the order for all our <num value="8">eight</num> guns to advance to the position indicated, supported by <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Semmes,,,,," id="n0036.0013.00174.00740" reg="mostcommon:Semmes,Paul,Jones,,:1"><surname>Semmes</surname></persName>' brigade</orgName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1645"/>I was almost delirious with joy, and ran back to the guns, anticipating a scene of destruction and of triumph such as no <num value="1">one</num> of us had ever before witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1646"/>But just as the <num value="2">two</num> batteries were drawn out in column on the road we learned that our troops had carried the enemy's works, that he had abandoned the position we were to have shelled, and our opportunity was gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1651"/>My enthusiasm had spent itself, or rather had oozed out with our disappointment, and I was walking down the front of the captured regiment, kept, however, at proper distance by the guard which had been placed over them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1652"/>I had heard where the prisoners hailed from and was carefully scanning their faces, recognizing many of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1653"/>At last a <pb id="p.175" n="175"/> little fellow who had been in my <orgName n="Sunday School" type="school">Sunday-school</orgName> class in New Haven recognized me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1657"/>He also offered to do anything in his power for any prisoner whose circumstances I might think required his intervention, and in this way I arranged a special exchange for a young man named <persName n="Sheldon,,,,," id="n0036.0013.00175.00750" reg="mostcommon:Sheldon,Winthrop,Dudley,,:1"><surname>Sheldon</surname></persName>, whom I had known at <orgName type="college" n="Yale college">Yale</orgName> or at a preparatory school in New Haven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/>A short time after this, I cannot say exactly how long, but that same evening and before we started back after <persName n="Sedgwick,,,,," id="n0036.0013.00175.00751" reg="mostcommon:Sedgwick,John,,,:1"><surname>Sedgwick</surname></persName>, <persName n="McLaws,General,,,," id="n0036.0013.00175.00752" reg="nearbymention:McLaws,Lafayette,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McLaws</surname></persName> called me to him and said I ought not to be in the ranks; that I was right about that movement of all our guns to that advanced position, and this showed I had a gift for handling artillery; that he would send for a commission as captain and have me assigned to the command of a certain <placeName key="tgn,7007248" n="1.000 16" reg="georgia">Georgia</placeName> battery which he mentioned; that it was true this battery had a way of getting its captains killed and wounded, but that bad luck like that didn't last forever, and that it was time the luck was turning with this battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>I thanked him heartily, but told him that I had not discovered the commanding position he referred to and didn't know who was entitled to the credit <pb id="p.176" n="176"/> of pointing it out; that I had simply reported what we had seen and done-other men no less than I; that as to the battery he had mentioned, while I thought I could sincerely say that the fate of its former captains would not deter me, yet I presumed there were officers in this battery who deserved and would expect promotion, and if so I would not be willing to cut them out of their proper dues; and besides, I much questioned whether I was really competent to be put at once in command of a battery in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/>He seemed to be a little disappointed at what he evidently thought my lack of proper ambition, but said he would talk with me further about it, and I left him, making a great effort not to show how profoundly moved I was.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1737"/>I do not think he heard all that was said by the general during our conference, or that he observed him quite as closely as I did. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1738"/>After the conference was over I saw <persName n="Williamson,Captain,,,," id="n0036.0014.00183.00819" reg="mostcommon:Williamson,William,Garnett,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Williamson</surname></persName> privately and asked him how much aid and co-operation he <pb id="p.184" n="184"/> expected from the general in getting up his company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1739"/>He said he hardly knew, and asked my views, which were quite decided and decidedly expressed &mdash; to the effect that <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n0036.0014.00184.00820" reg="nearbymention:Early,Jubal,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> had no idea of losing a musket from his division if he could avoid it; that he would aid us just so far as he was compelled to do so and no further; that our orders were somewhat defective, or at least not framed to meet such a case; that I did not mean to imply that the general was not right in the position he had taken, but that right or wrong he had clearly taken it; and as he was evidently a man of uncommon intelligence and determination, I felt satisfied he would carry his point. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1740"/>In the course of <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> the situation became clearly defined, the general taking little or no pains to conceal it, and I had another talk with <persName n="Williamson,Captain,,,," id="n0036.0014.00184.00821" reg="mostcommon:Williamson,William,Garnett,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Williamson</surname></persName>, who felt that nothing more could be done just now in the way of organizing the company, adding that <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n0036.0014.00184.00822" reg="nearbymention:Early,Jubal,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> had asked him, for the present, to act as engineer officer on his staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1741"/>He had made no such suggestion or request in my case, and <persName n="Williamson,Captain,,,," id="n0036.0014.00184.00823" reg="mostcommon:Williamson,William,Garnett,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Williamson</surname></persName> seemed to feel badly on my account; but I begged him to think no more about it, assuring him that I had sense enough to see that any such action in my case was out of the question, as I was not an engineer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1742"/>I omitted to say that my orders entitled me to a horse to be furnished and fed, as I remember, by the quartermaster of the division, and the general was very kind and prompt in seeing that these requirements were complied with; but I saw clearly that I was neither needed nor desired on the division staff and that, if I remained, the best I could expect would be the position and duty of a sort of upper courier, which I was not willing to assume. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1743"/>I therefore went directly to <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n0036.0014.00184.00824" reg="nearbymention:Early,Jubal,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> and had a full talk with him. I did most of the talking, but he heartily acquiesced, and when I was through I felt sure we thoroughly understood each other, and I thought he liked me. I told him I saw clearly that, for the present, no company of engineer troops was to be organized from his division; that indeed I rather thought the division pioneer corps, under command of <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs>, or <rs type="role2">Sergeant</rs>, Flood, was all <pb id="p.185" n="185"/> the engineer company he cared to have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1744"/>Flood was a New Orleans stevedore, a rough but very efficient man, who, among his many admirable qualifications, possessed this highly acceptable <num value="1">one</num>, that he had no sort of objection to Old Jube's airing his choice vocabulary of profane rhetoric about him, or his work, or his men whenever he might happen to need relief in that direction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1745"/>I said further to the general that I thought the pioneer corps might perhaps be regarded as the nucleus of the future company of engineer troops, and while I had no idea of meddling with <persName n="Flood,,,,," id="n0036.0014.00185.00825" reg="mostcommon:Flood,Edward,,,:1"><surname>Flood</surname></persName>'s work, which he was vastly better qualified to manage than I was, yet I could help him about his requisitions, reports, etc.; but that as we were evidently going into an active and aggressive campaign I thought I would, in action, fight in some battery of <persName n="Jones,Colonel,Hilary,,," id="n0036.0014.00185.00826" reg="default:Jones,Hilary,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>Hilary</foreName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>' <orgName n="Battalion">Battalion</orgName>, if he thought he could make use of me-standing ready, however, at all times to report back to Division Headquarters for staff duty or for anything I could at any time do for the general. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1746"/>This arrangement seemed to be entirely satisfactory to <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n0036.0014.00185.00827" reg="nearbymention:Early,Jubal,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName>, as it was also to <persName n="Jones,Colonel,,,," id="n0036.0014.00185.00828" reg="nearbymention:Jones,Hilary,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>, in <num value="1">one</num> or other of whose batteries-usually with the <orgName n="Charlottesville Artillery" type="artillery">Charlottesville Artillery</orgName>, a corps that reminded me somewhat of our old battery &mdash; I fought, whenever they were engaged, throughout the campaign, notably at <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> and <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>; sometimes in charge of <num value="1">one</num> or more pieces, and again fighting as a private soldier at a gun, or in any position where they were weakest and most needed help.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1747"/>I said the arrangement seemed to be entirely satisfactory to <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n0036.0014.00185.00829" reg="nearbymention:Early,Jubal,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName>, and yet in connection with it there occurred a series of awkward and amusing incidents which admirably illustrate some of the general's strongly-marked traits. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1748"/>Soon after <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName> my brother and I passed and missed each other, I riding over to the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 1">First Corps</orgName> to learn what had befallen my friends of the old battery, while he came over to <orgName n="division"><persName n="Early,,,,," id="n0036.0014.00185.00830" reg="nearbymention:Early,Jubal,,,"><surname>Early</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num> to inquire for me. His description of the old general was so characteristic and vivid that to this day I am prone to imagine that I saw and heard instead of my brother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1749"/>He said the sun was shining <pb id="p.186" n="186"/> after the rain, and at <placeName><persName n="Early,,,,," id="n0036.0014.00186.00831" reg="nearbymention:Early,Jubal,,,"><surname>Early</surname></persName>'s headquarters</placeName> he saw a man rather above middle age, heavily built, with stooping shoulders, a splendid head and a full gray-brown beard, sitting in his shirt sleeyes on a camp stool, with <num value="1">one</num> leg thrown over the other, his hands and apparently his every thought employed in combing out and smoothing a somewhat bedraggled black ostrich feather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1750"/>My brother had no idea who this figure was, but he passed beyond him to inquire of some less absorbed person as to my welfare and whereabouts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/>The person addressed, probably some courier, did not happen to know anything of me, and the feather dresser piped in a whining, querulous voice: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1754"/>When my brother told me this, as he did when we next met, I was at once irritated and amused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1755"/>It was after I had, with <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n0036.0014.00186.00832" reg="nearbymention:Early,Jubal,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName>'s approval, gone back to the old battalion to serve as its adjutant, under <persName n="Cabell,Colonel,,,," id="n0036.0014.00186.00833" reg="mostcommon:Cabell,Henry,Coalter,,:3"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Cabell</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1756"/>I did not happen to meet the general for some time, and meanwhile fortune had smiled upon me in many ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/>We had gotten back to the sacred soil of Old Virginia, and, under <placeName reg="Clark's Mountain">Clark's Mountain</placeName>, riding alone, I overtook and passed the general accompanied by only a single courier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>My horse had the better action and movement, and I merely saluted as I rode rapidly by. I had gotten perhaps a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> or more ahead, when the general called after me: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>This <rs n="Battle of Winchester" type="battle">battle of Winchester</rs>--there were many conflicts in and around that devoted old town &mdash; was <num value="1">one</num> of the most perfect pieces of work the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> ever did. Possibly the plan seemed so admirably clear and definite and to move with the precision and decision of a problem in mathematics, because, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, as a mounted officer and in an unusually free and independent position, I personally watched every movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>I may add that the execution of the plan was committed largely to <quote>Old Jube,</quote> who certainly wrought it out and fought it out beautifully. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/>The town of <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> and the surrounding country were dominated by a strong closed earthwork, heavily armed and manned, which it would have been madness to assault, <pb id="p.193" n="193"/> yet folly to neglect; and this work, on the only side which seemed to offer anything like a practicable approach, was protected and itself dominated by an outwork which it was absolutely necessary to carry before the inner and more powerful work could be reduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/>Our scouts and engineers had done their work thoroughly and our column was conducted by a long detour, in every foot of which we were concealed from observation from either work by forests and the configuration of the ground; until at last we found ourselves in a position which had been attained with difficulty, but which perfectly commanded the outwork.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1826"/>The infantry now lay down to rest and recover breath, while the men of <persName n="Jones,,Hilary,,," id="n0036.0014.00193.00904" reg="default:Jones,Hilary,,,"><foreName>Hilary</foreName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>' <orgName n="battalion of artillery">battalion of artillery</orgName> shoved their guns forward by hand up to and just back of a rock fence which ran along the crest of a ridge, under cover of which we had approached, and then loaded them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1827"/>They next removed a few of the stones in front of the muzzle of each gun, taking great care to remain concealed while doing this; and when everything was ready and everyone warned to do his part on the instant, the guns were discharged simultaneously upon the outwork and a rapid fire kept up upon it, while the infantry rose, and, with the wild rebel yell bursting from their lips, rushed forward in the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1828"/>The surprise was complete, the distance not great, and the effect overwhelming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1829"/>The outwork was abandoned almost without a struggle, its defenders retiring to the main fortification, and our infantry again lying down for rest and protection and to wait for us, while our guns galloped forward to the captured work, some occupying and firing from it, and others passing to the right and front to a level field hard by, from which we had the main work beautifully in range. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1830"/>But this work had us in range not less beautifully, indeed even more perfectly, and played havoc with us for a short time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1831"/>My recollection is that I was acting as <num value="6">No. 6</num> at <num value="1">one</num> of the limbers, and that I several times instinctively clapped down the lid of the ammunition chest as the shell seemed to burst immediately over it. We were at a loss to account for the preternaturally accurate aim of the guns and cutting of the fuses, until someone chanced to observe the practice <pb id="p.194" n="194"/> target of the fort standing between the gun at which I was serving and the <num value="1">one</num> next to it, when, of course, we shifted our position in a twinkling, dashing up still closer to the fort and finding, to our relief, that here the shells passed for the most part over our heads. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1832"/>On <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="2">two</num> occasions in which our guns passed to the right and front of the recumbent infantry I observed our old friend Extra <persName n="Smith,,Billy,,," id="n0036.0014.00194.00905" reg="default:Smith,Billy,,,"><foreName>Billy</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, on the front line of his brigade, standing erect, with his arms folded, his horse's bridle rein over <num value="1">one</num> shoulder and his blue cotton umbrella under the other, he and his horse the only <num value="2">two</num> figures I saw standing in all the long line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1833"/>The heroic old man was as cool as a cucumber and as smiling as a basket of chips, and he was actually bowing to the artillerymen &mdash; as with hair flying and eyes flashing they passed on a run &mdash; with that same manly, hearty greeting which had, for more than a generation, proved irresistible on the hustings in the Old Dominion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1834"/>It was an unparalleled scene-unparalleled as an exhibition of courage, of personal force, and of the force of habit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1835"/>I noted the expression on the face of each artilleryman as he recognized and responded to the old <rs>Governor</rs>'s salute, and felt-there's <num value="1">one</num> vote sure for Extra <persName><foreName>Billy</foreName></persName> as long as that gallant cannoneer lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1837"/>I cannot determine exactly when, but I received a very singular, and what threatened to be a very serious, injury during <num value="1">one</num> of the moves our guns made after becoming engaged &mdash; I rather incline to think it must have been the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time we shifted position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1838"/>At all events, I had, for some reason, given up my horse to someone and was fighting on foot in some position with <num value="1">one</num> of the guns of the <placeName key="tgn,7013585" n="1.000 66" reg="charlottesville, charlottesville, virginia">Charlottesville</placeName> battery, when the orders were given, <quote>Cease firing, limber to the front, cannoneers mount!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/>I sprang upon a limber chest upon which there were already the full complement of <num value="3">three</num> men, all faced, of course, to the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1840"/>I faced to the rear, and bracing my back against the back of the middle man, attempted to hold my position with my feet resting on the <quote>lunette plate</quote> --a flat piece of iron fitted over the end of the trail of the gun, ending in a heavy ring, which <pb id="p.195" n="195"/> was slipped over the <quote>pintle hook</quote> on the front axle, thus coupling the gun to the limber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1841"/>We started at a run and were galloping under fire through a grove, by a wood road the track of which was full of limestone rocks projecting more or less above the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1842"/>It was very difficult to keep my footing, as I had on a pair of stiff and slick-soled <name>English</name> shoes, the nails in which had worn perfectly smooth. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/>My feet, however, slipped, and I went down between the front and rear wheels and directly under the gun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>Well, I'll try anyhow to save my arms and legs in case I shouldn't be killed,</quote> and with a violent effort I did manage to get them out of the track of the hind wheels, <num value="1">one</num> of which, however, ran directly, or rather, diagonally, across the small of my back on a flat limestone rock. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>My comrades picked themselves up, all right though slightly shocked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>They thought me dead, but dragged me out of the track of the other guns, and left me lying on the grass under a tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1849"/>In a short time I came to myself, and, on taking a hurried inventory, found that though very badly jarred and bruised, yet no bones seemed to be broken, and concluded I would try to hobble on into the fight, which I did, lying down that night in a pouring rain and sleeping in a puddle &mdash; I presume about as good treatment as could have been prescribed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1850"/>Next day I was carried into <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, and after <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> rest rode on after the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2072"/>This book being in the main a record of personal reminiscence, I do not care to go into the details of these various and desultory movements and failures to move, until some time, I think early in the afternoon of the <dateStruct value="--2"><day reg="2">second</day></dateStruct>, when I was brought again in personal touch with the matter and ultimately into <num value="1">one</num> of the most tremendous experiences of my life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2073"/>As I remember, about the time mentioned, <num value="2">two</num> of <orgName n="brigades"><persName n="Early,,,,," id="n0036.0016.00215.01034" reg="mostcommon:Early,Jubal,,,:4"><surname>Early</surname></persName>'s brigades</orgName>, <persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n0036.0016.00215.01035" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,Charles,George,,:1"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName>'s being <num value="1">one</num>, were sent off to watch the <placeName reg="York, York, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014650">York</placeName> road and a suspicious-looking body of troops which had appeared and disappeared in that direction, say <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> to the left, and which threatened the left flank and rear of <persName n="Johnson,,Edward,,," id="n0036.0016.00215.01036" reg="default:Johnson,Edward,,,"><foreName>Edward</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="division">division</orgName>, which was our extreme left, and under orders to take part in a general advance against the enemy.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2075"/>When we reached our objective we readily satisfied ourselves that no danger boded from this direction, and that the troops we had regarded with suspicion were not hostile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2076"/>We did not come into absolute contact with them,--we could not wait for that,--but my recollection is that they proved to be the advance of <orgName n="cavalry"><persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0036.0016.00216.01038" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Alexander,Hugh,Holmes:1,:1"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>'s cavalry</orgName>, which had just come up, and were really doing just what we had come to do, that is, guarding our left flank and rear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2077"/>After making this discovery, the point was to get word to <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0036.0016.00216.01039" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Edward,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> at the earliest possible moment, that he could press on, feeling no uneasiness about his flanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2078"/>Not a member of <persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n0036.0016.00216.01040" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,Charles,George,,:1"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName>'s staff was with him-all were off on various errands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2080"/>The General called for volunteers, mounted officers, to take the message-<num value="2">two</num>, I think; <num value="1">one</num> to go around a longer and safer way, but <num value="1">one</num> to cut right across, or rather, as his course would be after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> quarter of a mile, directly in the teeth of the artillery fire, which was sweeping the approaches to the <rs>Federal</rs> position from our left. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2081"/>I offered to take this latter ride and do my best to get word to <persName n="Johnson,General,,,," id="n0036.0016.00216.01042" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Edward,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> promptly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2082"/>The General thanked me, and off I dashed, braced, as I thought, for anything, yet little dreaming what the ride would really be. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2083"/>For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure>, as above suggested, the configuration of the ground was such that the fire was entirely cut off &mdash; not so much as even <num value="1">one</num> stray shell whistled above my head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2084"/>But in a few moments, as I rose a hill and my course veered to the left, I struck a well-defined aerial current, a meteoric stream, of projectiles and explosions, and I felt my little horse shudder and squat under me, and then he made <num value="1">one</num> frantic effort to turn and fly. I pulled him fiercely back against the iron torrent until he breasted it squarely and then, seeming to realize the requirements of the position, he elongated and flattened himself as much as possible, while I lay as close to him as I could, and we fairly devoured the way. <pb id="p.217" n="217"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2085"/><num value="1">One</num> of the horrors of the thing, during a large part of the ride, was that I could see almost every shell that passed, as they were coming straight toward me, and their propulsive force was pretty well exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2086"/>As I approached the points at which the fire was directed, while I could not see so large a proportion of the shells, and this strain was of course diminished, yet the number of projectiles and explosions increased-until at last there was absolutely no separation between the reports, but the air was rent by <num value="1">one</num> continuous shriek of shell and roar of explosion, and torn with countless myriads of hurtling fragments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2087"/>When a man is undergoing an experience like this he does not think-his entire conscious being is concentrated upon the <num value="1">one</num> point of endurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2088"/>But unconsciously, inadvertently, he may receive powerful impressions and bear away with him vivid and unfading mental photographs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2089"/>I have borne with me ever since, in my recollections of this ride, <num value="3">three</num> pictures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2090"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is a silhouette of my little horse and me as we sped on our perilous way. I put him <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> because he did it, I only endured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2091"/>After his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shy he never shrank or swerved again, but held to his course straight and swift as a greyhound; nay, as an arrow flies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2092"/>He seemed to be possessed, whether intelligently or instinctively, of the double purpose of making himself small and getting there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2093"/>His figure was that of a running hare-low to the ground, with her ears laid flat and every limb stretched; while I was nothing but the smallest possible projection above his back and along his flanks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2094"/>I am not satisfied whether this is purely a mental and inferential picture, or whether, as I incline to think, my eye, in an involuntary sidelong glance, caught our shadow as we flew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2095"/>But of this I am satisfied-that, in all the years since, the <rs n="Battle of Gettysburg" type="battle">battle of Gettysburg</rs> has never obtruded itself upon my mental vision that this strange figure, of horse and man blent together into <num value="1">one</num> by the terrible tension, has not been the frontispiece. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2096"/>The next picture is of <orgName n="Battalion"><persName n="Latimer,,,,," id="n0036.0016.00217.01043" reg="mostcommon:Latimer,nomatch:0"><surname>Latimer</surname></persName>'s Battalion</orgName>, which, with splendid pluck but little judgment, had engaged in a most unequal artillery duel with the <rs>Federal</rs> batteries massed upon <placeName reg="Cemetery Ridge, Panola, Mississippi" key="tgn,2230295">Cemetery Ridge</placeName> and <placeName reg="Culps Hill, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2271366">Culp's Hill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2097"/>Never, before or after, <pb id="p.218" n="218"/> did I see <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num> guns in such a condition of wreck and destruction as this battalion was. It had been hurled backward, as it were, by the very weight and impact of metal from the position it had occupied on the crest of a little ridge, into a saucer-shaped depression behind it; and such a scene as it presented-guns dismounted and disabled, carriages splintered and crushed, ammunition chests exploded, limbers upset, wounded horses plunging and kicking, dashing out the brains of men tangled in the harness; while cannoneers with pistols were crawling around through the wreck shooting the struggling horses to save the lives of the wounded men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2098"/>I said the little horse did not again swerve from his course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2099"/>He was compelled to do so at this point, as it was impracticable to ride through the battalion, which lay directly in our track; but we had a full view of it as we followed the higher ground from which it had been driven. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2100"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> and last picture connected with my desperate ride is of the finish and of the doughty division commander in whose behalf I had taken it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2101"/>He was a heavy, thick-set man, and when I saw him was on foot and hobbling along with the help of this gigantic walking-cane.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2102"/>It was toward the gloaming and I did not see him very distinctly, but remember that when I gasped out the message I bore from <persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n0036.0016.00218.01046" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,Charles,George,,:1"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName>, he simply growled back, <quote>Very well, sir</quote> --and, my responsibility discharged, I dropped from the saddle to the ground, the last thing I remember being my little horse standing over me, his sides heaving and panting and his head drooping and sinking until his muzzle almost touched my body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2103"/>How long I lay and he stood there, or where we went after we recovered breath and motion, I have not the faintest recollection. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2111"/></p> 
<p>There is but <num value="1">one</num> other scene of the battle-field which I care to mention, and that only for a reason already touched upon in a like connection, namely, to give to those who had no actual experience of war some approximate conception of the variety and extravagance of horrors which the soldier is called upon, from time to time, to undergo. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2112"/>On the <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, in readjusting and straightening our lines, the guns of <persName n="Jones,,Hilary,,," id="n0036.0016.00219.01052" reg="default:Jones,Hilary,,,"><foreName>Hilary</foreName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>' <orgName n="battalion">battalion</orgName> were put in position on a part of the field which <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Hill,,,,," id="n0036.0016.00219.01053" reg="nearbymention:Hill,A.,P.,,"><surname>Hill</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> had fought over on the <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="2">1st</day></dateStruct>, and upon which the pioneer corps and burying parties had not been able to complete their work; so that the dead bodies of men and horses had lain there putrefying under the summer sun for <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>. The sights and smells that assailed us were simply indescribable-corpses swollen to twice their original size, some of them actually burst asunder with the pressure of foul gases and vapors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2113"/>I recall <num value="1">one</num> feature never before noted, the shocking distension and protrusion of the eyeballs of dead men and dead horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2114"/>Several human or unhuman corpses sat upright against a fence, with arms extended in the air and faces hideous with <pb id="p.220" n="220"/> something very like a fixed leer, as if taking a fiendish pleasure in showing us what we essentially were and might at any moment become.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2115"/>The odors were nauseating, and so deadly that in a short time we all sickened and were lying with our mouths close to the ground, most of us vomiting profusely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2116"/>We protested against the cruelty and folly of keeping men in such a position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2117"/>Of course to fight in it was utterly out of the question, and we were soon moved away; but for the rest of that day and late into the night the fearful odors I had inhaled remained with me and made me loathe myself as if an already rotting corpse. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2118"/>While a prisoner at <placeName reg="Johnson Island, Ottawa, Ohio" key="tgn,2424997">Johnson's Island</placeName>, in the spring of <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, I became much interested in <num value="1">one</num> of my fellow-prisoners, <persName n="McDaniel,Major,,,," id="n0036.0016.00220.01054" reg="mostcommon:McDaniel,Henry,Dickerson,,:1"><roleName n="Major">a Major</roleName> <surname>McDaniel</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2119"/>He did not at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> strike <num value="1">one</num> as an impressive man. Indeed, if I recollect rightly, he had somewhat of an impediment in his speech and was not inclined to talk much; but there was a peculiar pith and point and weight in what he did say, and those who knew him best seemed to regard him as a man of mark and to treat him with the greatest respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2120"/>The impression he made upon me was of simplicity and directness, good sense and good character, dignity, gravity, decorum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2121"/>They told me this surprising story of him: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2122"/>He was seriously wounded at <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, and, of course, in the hospital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2123"/>His friends who had been captured and were about to be marched off to prison, came in to bid him goodby; but he declared he would not be left behind, that he could and would go with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2124"/>Both his comrades and the <rs>Federal</rs> surgeons and nurses, who were kind and attentive, protested that this was absolutely out of the question &mdash; that he would die on the road. </p>

<p>Finally the surgeons yielded, saying that, in his condition, it would be as fatal to confine him forcibly in bed as to lift him out and attempt to transport him; that either course was certain death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2128"/>So the litter was brought, he was placed <pb id="p.221" n="221"/> upon it, his friends sadly took hold of the bearing poles and started, feeling that the marching column of prisoners was really <persName n="McDaniel,,,,," id="n0036.0016.00221.01056" reg="mostcommon:McDaniel,Henry,Dickerson,,:1"><surname>McDaniel</surname></persName>'s funeral procession. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2288"/>When he reached the flat, through which the river ran, the <rs>Federal</rs> horses raised their heads, and their riders shaded their eyes with their hands, gazing intently at the rapidly-approaching horseman and striving to make him out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2290"/>I recall a trivial incident of <placeName reg="Mine Run, Orange, Virginia" key="tgn,2516268">Mine Run</placeName> which may serve as an introduction to what may prove of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2293"/>I dismounted, threw my bridle rein over the pommel of the saddle, climbed the tree and gave it a good shake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2294"/>Meanwhile several shells whistled not far above my head and I distinctly recall laughing to myself at the difference <measure n="2.5years" type="date">two and a half years</measure> had wrought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2295"/>Just after I was mustered <pb id="p.234" n="234"/> into service I should have considered that I had made a narrow escape from shells passing as near as these, and that it was little less than profane to have so much as thought of persimmons <quote>under such solemn circumstances.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2317"/>But if such an opportunity ever existed, the invaders did not act with vigor in availing themselves of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2416"/>When the ambulance moved off, I followed it a little way, being anxious for trustworthy news of the <rs>General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2417"/>The members of his staff surrounded the vehicle, some riding in front, some on <num value="1">one</num> side and some on the other, and some behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2419"/>I never on any occasion during the <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of the war saw a group of officers and gentlemen more deeply distressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2420"/>They were literally bowed down with grief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2424"/>The blood had paled out of his face and its somewhat gross aspect was gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2425"/>I noticed how white and dome-like his great forehead looked and, with scarcely less reverent admiration, how spotless white his socks and his fine gauze undervest, save where the black red gore from his breast and shoulder had stained it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2426"/>He is not dead, I said to myself, and he is calm and entirely master of the situation-he is both greater and more attractive than I have heretofore thought him. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2448"/>He was not yet fully developed, and ordinarily appeared rather gangling and loose-jointed, but it required only the thrill of action to inspire him and to make his movements as graceful as they were powerful and effective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2461"/>He sprang aside, but settled right down again to his course, and it was some little time before I could find any trace of the shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2462"/>I soon discovered, however, that the ball had cut into <num value="1">one</num> of my saddle pockets, but not through it, and there it was, inside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2463"/>A moment later he was struck again, and this time reared and plunged violently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2464"/>Glancing around I saw that the ball had entered back of my legs about the mid line of his body <num value="1">one</num> side and had come out about opposite on the other, and, as he persisted in lying down and rolling, I concluded that the poor fellow was mortally hurt, and sprang off, endeavoring to remove saddle and bridle, which I finally accomplished, with some difficulty and at some peril of being kicked or rolled upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2465"/>I looked at him a few moments in great distress, but the fire becoming really heavy, I threw saddle and bridle across my shoulder and toddled into the works on foot. </p>

As soon as I could get off I went back to see the dear old fellow, and there he was, as good as ever, except that a rope appeared to have been drawn around the lower part of his body, just under the skin, and a little back of the proper line of the saddle girth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2524"/>It proved to be a false alarm, and we returned immediately-but he was dead, yes, dead and half-stripped; but I managed to get my hand upon his blouse a moment and looked at the buttons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2681"/>No infantry apparently had received any orders to go with us, certainly none went, and we soon passed beyond the apparent end of our infantry line, at least on the road we were traveling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2682"/>Very soon we reached a stout infantry picket, which I interviewed, and they said there were no Confederate troops down that road, unless perhaps a few cavalry videttes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2683"/>I was on very intimate terms with my colonel, and I went to him and suggested whether there was not danger in our proceeding as we were, a battalion of artillery unaccompanied by infantry, out and beyond the last picket post.

<p>Then I fell back further to the old battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2695"/>The column was pretty well closed up that morning; everybody seemed to feel it well to be so. I was strongly attached to the old company and particularly to the captain, who was a magnificent fellow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2697"/>I dismounted, <num value="1">one</num> of the fellows mounting my horse, and walked and talked and chatted with the men, and particularly with the captain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2698"/>He was altogether an uncommon person, marked by great simplicity, sincerity, kindliness, courage, good sense, personal force, and a genius for commanding men. He had been rather a reckless, pugnacious boy, difficult to manage, impatient of control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2699"/>The war had proved a real blessing to him. It let off the surplus fire and fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2700"/>Its deep and powerful undertone was just what was needed to harmonize his nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2701"/>His spirit had really been balanced and gentled and sweetened by it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2702"/>And these intellectual and cultivated men freely recognized his supremacy and admired and loved him. He seemed to be somewhat subdued and quiet that morning; even more than ordinarily affectionate and demonstrative, but not cheerful or chatty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2703"/>Several of us noticed his unusual bearing and speculated as to the cause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2704"/>As the morning wore on and we were leaving our infantry further and further behind, my uneasiness returned; and besides, I had been away long enough from the colonel, so I remounted and rode forward to the head of the column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2705"/>He had been very emphatic in repelling my suggestions, but <pb id="p.272" n="272"/> I thought it my duty to renew them, and I did.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2706"/>I reined in my horse, waiting for <persName n="Calloway,,,,," id="n0036.0020.00272.01354" reg="mostcommon:Calloway,Morgan,,,:1"><surname>Calloway</surname></persName>, and rode with him at the head of his battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2713"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2717"/>The shell from the other <num value="3">three</num> guns were exploded among the retiring skirmishers, who ran back toward the woods; while from the side of the house nearest to us <pb id="p.273" n="273"/> <num value="2">two</num> women came out, <num value="1">one</num> very stout and walking with difficulty, the other bearing a baby in her arms and <num value="2">two</num> little children following her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2791"/>Not only did I have my ordinary duties of a day of battle to perform, but I had, in addition, to open and to keep open roads for getting in ammunition, to bridge <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> ravines, to visit <persName n="Falligant,,,,," id="n0036.0020.00280.01422" reg="nearbymention:Falligant,Robert,,,"><surname>Falligant</surname></persName>'s gun several times and to keep it supplied with ammunition, which had to be passed along the infantry line by hand for quite a long distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2796"/>Once more I stretched out and dozed off.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2802"/>I experienced little difficulty in finding the road, having superintended the cutting of it and being very familiar with it, and we passed on over the little bridge, and were just passing out from behind <persName n="Wofford,,,,," id="n0036.0020.00281.01433" reg="mostcommon:Wofford,William,Tatum,,:1"><surname>Wofford</surname></persName>'s left flank and heading for <persName n="Kershaw,,,,," id="n0036.0020.00281.01434" reg="mostcommon:Kershaw,Joseph,Brevard,,:1"><surname>Kershaw</surname></persName>'s line, when someone seized my bridle rein and abruptly stopped my horse; at the same time asking who I was and what I intended to do, and what I meant by bringing artillery horses through his lines without his permission. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2803"/>The manner and tone of this address was irritating, but suspecting who my interlocutor was and knowing something of his temperament, I answered quietly that I was adjutant of <orgName type="mil" key="BattalionArtillery"><persName n="Cabell,,,,," id="n0036.0020.00281.01435" reg="mostcommon:Cabell,Henry,Coalter,,:3"><surname>Cabell</surname></persName>'s Battalion of Artillery</orgName>, and that the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> of <num value="1">one</num> of our batteries was with me; that the gun out there, which had protected this part of the line all day, belonged to his battery; that we proposed to save it, and that we had brought the horses for the purpose of hauling it off.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2804"/>He positively forbade the attempt, and did not seem disposed to yield until my cousin, <persName n="Stiles,Colonel,Edward,,," id="n0036.0020.00282.01437" reg="default:Stiles,Edward,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>Edward</foreName> <surname>Stiles</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="GA16">Sixteenth Georgia</orgName>, of-his brigade, who knew the <rs>General</rs> well, joined us and suggested as a compromise that we should make the attempt without taking the horses any further; to which I agreed, upon condition that he would furnish me with, say <num value="20">twenty</num> men, to get the gun off by hand, and that in the event of their failing I should then make the effort with the horses, as we had <persName n="Kershaw,General,,,," id="n0036.0020.00282.01438" reg="mostcommon:Kershaw,Joseph,Brevard,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Kershaw</surname></persName>'s positive orders to save the gun if possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2805"/>We got the men and started up the hill, leaving drivers and horses to await our return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2806"/>It was now absolutely dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2807"/>I remember putting my hand before my face and being unable to see it. <persName n="Calloway,,,,," id="n0036.0020.00282.01439" reg="mostcommon:Calloway,Morgan,,,:1"><surname>Calloway</surname></persName> and I rode side by side, inclining to the left, so as to guard against running out into the enemy through the gap in the lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2808"/>There was absolute silence, save the soft tread of our horses' feet in the sandy soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2809"/>In a few moments their heads rustled against dry leaves-the leafy screen which the troops had put up to protect themselves from the baking sun. We knew we were at the infantry line and turned to the right and toward the gun. There was a good deal of smoke in the air from the woods afire out in front, and we soon became conscious of an insufferable odor of burning flesh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2810"/>My horse being a rapid walker, I kept a little ahead of <persName n="Calloway,,,,," id="n0036.0020.00282.01440" reg="mostcommon:Calloway,Morgan,,,:1"><surname>Calloway</surname></persName>, and very soon was stopped again, by someone who spoke almost in a stage whisper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2811"/>It turned out to be the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> of <persName n="Kershaw,,,,," id="n0036.0020.00282.01441" reg="mostcommon:Kershaw,Joseph,Brevard,,:1"><surname>Kershaw</surname></persName>'s old brigade, and he, too, forbade our attempt and ordered us back; but the direct authority of his major-general satisfied him, and he begged only that we should wait until his men could be thoroughly roused and ready to resist any attack that might be made; adding that the poor fellows were utterly exhausted by the unrelieved strain of the past <measure n="36hours" type="date">thirty-six hours</measure>. All true; yet it was fearful to contemplate the risk they ran in sleeping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2812"/>The colonel told us, too, what we already suspected, that the odor which so offended our nostrils was that of human bodies roasting in the forest fires in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2813"/>We plainly heard the officers passing along the lines and rousing the men, and we feared the enemy heard it, <pb id="p.283" n="283"/> too; but preferred this risk to that of a sudden rush upon a slumbering brigade just as we were drawing the gun off. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2814"/>Soon after we started again, my horse snorted and sprang aside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2815"/>I knew this meant we had reached the dead horses, and told <persName n="Calloway,,,,," id="n0036.0020.00283.01442" reg="mostcommon:Calloway,Morgan,,,:1"><surname>Calloway</surname></persName> we were almost upon the gun. He dismounted, handing his bridle rein to me, and I heard him enter the little trench and feel and fumble his way along it for a few steps, and then heard him call, in a low tone, <quote><persName n="Falligant,,,,," id="n0036.0020.00283.01443" reg="nearbymention:Falligant,Robert,,,"><surname>Falligant</surname></persName>, <persName n="Falligant,,,,," id="n0036.0020.00283.01444" reg="nearbymention:Falligant,Robert,,,"><surname>Falligant</surname></persName>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2816"/>Then I heard the sort of groan or grumble a tired man gives out when he is half roused from a sound sleep, and after that a low hum of conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2817"/>Then <persName n="Calloway,,,,," id="n0036.0020.00283.01445" reg="mostcommon:Calloway,Morgan,,,:1"><surname>Calloway</surname></persName> came up out of the trench, and, groping his way to me, said: <quote>Adjutant, do you know every man in that detachment was fast asleep and the enemy is lying down in line of battle between here and that low fire out there!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2818"/>I said he must be mistaken, that I could toss a cracker into that fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2819"/>He insisted he was right and urged me to dismount and go into the trench and stoop till I could see under the smoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2820"/>I did so, and there, sure enough, was a continuous line of blue which the flickering of the flames beyond enabled me to see. My heart stopped beating at the sight, but this was no time for indulgence of over-sensibility, physical or emotional. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2821"/>As quietly and rapidly as possible we got everything ready for fight or retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2822"/>Our <num value="20">twenty</num> men had brought their muskets and <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Kershaw,,,,," id="n0036.0020.00283.01446" reg="mostcommon:Kershaw,Joseph,Brevard,,:1"><surname>Kershaw</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> was up in the trench and on their knees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2823"/>The gun was backed out of the little work, limbered up, and the ammunition chest replaced; some of the men took hold of the wheels and some of the tongue, and the piece was soon moving after us almost noiselessly, along the sassafras field toward <persName n="Wofford,,,,," id="n0036.0020.00283.01447" reg="mostcommon:Wofford,William,Tatum,,:1"><surname>Wofford</surname></persName>'s line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2824"/>In a few moments we reached the goal, returning our thanks to the <rs>General</rs>, and to my cousin and the sturdy, gallant men they lent us; the horses were hitched up and we were rolling over the little bridges and up to the new line and the position selected for this now distinguished piece. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2825"/>I trust I am not small enough to indulge in any vulgar pride in my part of the trying experiences of this day; yet I scarce recall another day for which I so thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, or which <pb id="p.284" n="284"/> has had a greater influence on my life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2864"/>Something of this is necessary to a proper understanding and appreciation of some of the incidents that occurred there.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2869"/>Just here I take occasion to correct a very wrong impression about the field works the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> fought behind in this campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2870"/>All the <rs>Federal</rs> writers who have written about these battles speak about our works as <quote>formidable earthworks,</quote> <quote>powerful fortifications,</quote> <quote>impregnable lines ;</quote> such works as no troops could be expected to take and <hi rend="italics">any troops</hi> should be expected to hold. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2871"/>Now about the parts of the line distant from us, I couldn't speak so certainly-though I am sure they were all very much the same-but <pb id="p.289" n="289"/> about the works all along our part of the line I can speak with exactness and certainty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2872"/>I saw them, I helped with my own hands to make them, I fought behind them, I was often on top of them and both sides of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2873"/>I know all about them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2874"/>I got a good deal of the mud off them on me (not for purposes of personal fortification, however). Our works were a single line of earth about <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure> high and <num value="3">three</num> to <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> thick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2875"/>It had no ditch or obstruction in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2876"/>It was nothing more than a little heavier line of <quote>rifle pits.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2877"/>There was no physical difficulty in men walking right over that bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2878"/>I did it often myself, saw many others do it, and twice saw a line of Federal troops walk over it, and then saw them walk <hi rend="italics">back</hi> over it with the greatest ease, at the rate of <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure> an hour; i. e. except those whom we had persuaded to stay with us, and those the angels were carrying to <persName><foreName>Abraham</foreName></persName>'s bosom at a still swifter rate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2879"/>Works they could go over like that couldn't have been much obstacle!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2880"/>They couldn't have made better time on a dead level. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2881"/>Such were our works actually, and still they seemed to <quote>loom large</quote> to the people in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2882"/>I wonder what could have given them such an exaggerated idea of the strength of those modest little works!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2883"/>I wonder if it could have been the <hi rend="italics">men</hi> behind them!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2884"/>There wasn't a great many of these men!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2885"/>It was a very thin gray line along them, back of a thin red line of clay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2886"/>But these lines stuck together, very hard, and were very hard indeed to separate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2887"/>The red clay was <quote>sticky</quote> and the men were just as <quote>sticky,</quote> and as the <num value="2">two</num> lines <quote>stuck</quote> together so closely, it made the whole very strong indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2888"/>Certainly it seems they gave to those who tried to force them apart an impression of great strength. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2889"/>Yes, it must have been the <hi rend="italics">men</hi>! A story in point comes to my aid here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2890"/>A handsome, well dressed lady sweeps with a great air past <num value="2">two</num> street boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2891"/>They are much struck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2894"/>That was the way with the <name>Spottsylvania</name> earthworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2895"/>The <quote>works wa'n't no great shakes.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2896"/>It was the men in 'em that made them so <quote>killing.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2897"/></p> 
<p>The men behind those works, such as they were, had perfect confidence in their own ability to hold them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2898"/>And this happy combination of <quote>faith</quote> and <quote>works</quote> proved as strong against the world and the flesh as it does against the devil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2899"/>It was perfectly effectual, it withstood all assaults. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2900"/>The original intent of such <quote>works</quote> is to afford protection against regular attack by the full line of battle of the opposite side, advancing out of their works to attack yours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2901"/>This, of course, everyone understands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2902"/>But this is only an occasional and comparatively rare thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2903"/>The constant and wearing feature of <quote>the lines</quote> is the sharpshooting, which <pb id="p.290" n="290"/> never ceases as long as there is light enough to see how to shoot; unless the skirmishers or sharpshooters of the <num value="2">two</num> sides proclaim, or in some way begin, a temporary truce, as I have known them to do. I have also known them to give explicit warning of the expiration of such a truce. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2904"/>Sharpshooting, at best, however, is a fearful thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2905"/>The regular sharpshooter often seemed to me little better than a human tiger lying in wait for blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2906"/>His rifle is frequently trained and made fast bearing upon a particular spot,for example, where the head of a gunner must of necessity appear when sighting his piece,--and the instant that object appears and, as it were, <quote>darkens the hole,</quote> crash goes a bullet through his brain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2907"/>The consequence of the sharpshooting is the <quote>coveredway,</quote> which, when applied to these rough and ready temporary lines, means any sort of protection-trenches, ditches, traverses, piles of earth, here and there, at what have proved to be the danger points, designed and placed so as to protect as far as possible against the sharpshooters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2908"/>Only in regular and elaborate lines of <quote>siege,</quote> such as we had later about <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, is seen the more perfect protection of regularly covered galleries and ways for passing from <num value="1">one</num> part of the line to another inside; just as, outside and on the face toward the enemy, such elaborate and permanent lines of works are protected by ditches, abattis or felled trees, friezes or sharpened stakes, to make the <quote>works</quote> more difficult of approach, of access, and of capture. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2913"/>No man who was ever in the <name>Howitzers</name> but will appreciate the grim absurdity of this man's feeling a lack of confidence in his own nerve and courage; but he did feel it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2914"/>Hearing someone say just as it was over that it had been <quote>pretty hot work,</quote> he asked with the greatest earnestness whether the speaker really meant what he said, and when assured that he did, he asked <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> others of his comrades, whom he regarded as experienced soldiers, whether they concurred in this view of the matter, and on their expressing emphatic concurrence, he expressed intense satisfaction at having at last a standard in his mind, and a relieving standard at that; saying that he had feared he would disgrace his family by exhibiting a lack of courage; but if this was really <quote>hot work,</quote> he felt that he would be able to maintain himself and do his duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2915"/>The story is almost too much for belief, but it is the sober truth and vouched for by gentlemen of the highest character. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2916"/>I think it was the evening after the big fight at <placeName reg="Cold Harbor">Cold Harbor</placeName> that I was sitting in the works, with <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>Howitzer</name> detachments, when the <rs>Doctor</rs> announced his intention of going to the spring for water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2917"/>I reminded him that it was not quite dark and the sharpshooters would be apt to pay their respects to him; but he said he must have some water, and offered to take down and fill as many canteens as he could carry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2918"/>His captain was present and I said no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2919"/>He was soon loaded up and started off, stepping right up out <pb id="p.292" n="292"/> of the trench on the level ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2920"/>I could not help urging him to take the <quote>covered way,</quote> but he replied, <quote>I can't do it, Adjutant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2921"/>It is dirty; a gentleman can't walk in it, sir.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2922"/></p> 
<p>Away he went, walking bolt upright and with entire nonchalance, down the hill; to my great relief reaching the spring in safety, where he was pretty well protected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2923"/>In due time he started back, loaded with the full canteens and having a tin cup full of water in his right hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2924"/>I heard the sharp report of a rifle and saw the <rs>Doctor</rs> start forward or stumble, and sprang up to go to his relief, but he steadied himself and came right on up the hill without further attention from the sharpshooters, and stepped down into the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2925"/>As he did so he handed the captain the cup of water, in the quietest manner apologizing for having spilled part of it, adding that he had met with a trivial accident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2926"/>The upper joint of his thumb had been shot away, yet he had not dropped the cup. Then he turned to me and asked my pardon for his disregard of my warning and his imprudence in getting shot, protesting still, however, that it was very hard indeed for a gentleman to walk in those filthy, abominable covered ways. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2927"/>The spring was perhaps the point of greatest power and pathos in all the weird drama of <quote>The lines.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2928"/>About this date, or very soon after, a few of us were sitting in the part of the trenches occupied by the <orgName type="regiment" key="MS21">Twenty-first Mississippi</orgName>, of our old brigade,--<persName n="Barksdale,,,,," id="n0036.0021.00292.01478" reg="mostcommon:Barksdale,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Barksdale</surname></persName>'s, now <persName n="Humphreys,,,,," id="n0036.0021.00292.01479" reg="mostcommon:Humphreys,Benjamin,Grubb,,:2"><surname>Humphreys</surname></persName>',--which was supporting our guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2932"/>In due time we heard them again as he returned, and <num value="1">one</num> of the fellows said, <quote>Ha!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2936"/>We picked him up and bore him tenderly into the trench, and, as we laid him down and composed his limbs, manly tears dropped upon his still face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2937"/>Each man disengaged and took his own canteen from the slumbering water-carrier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2980"/>He also refused to take chloroform, and directed the surgeons in exploring the track of the ball, which had crushed up his temple and the under half of the socket of his eye, and lodged somewhere in behind his nose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2981"/>After they had extracted the ball and a great deal of crushed bone, he declared there was something else in his head which must come out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2982"/>They remonstrated, but he would not be satisfied, and finally they probed further and drew out a piece of his hat brim, cut just the width of the ball and jammed like a wad into his head; after that he was much easier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2983"/>I omitted to say we never found his hat, either. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2987"/>The bony formation of the under-socket of the eye grew up and rectified itself almost entirely, and a lock of his curly hair covered the desperate-looking wound in the temple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3159"/>Perhaps the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day I was in command the <rs type="role" reg="Sergeant-Major">sergeant-major</rs> and acting-adjutant brought me his report, which I looked over and found very satisfactoryuntil I came to the added foot-note, that a first lieutenant and several non-commissioned officers and men had <quote>disappeared</quote> the preceding day while on a <quote>wood detail</quote> down the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3160"/><pb id="p.313" n="313"/> </p> 
<p>I recalled the adjutant and asked him what that entry meant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3161"/>He seemed surprised and did not answer promptly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3162"/>Changing the form of the question, I asked if it was possible it meant what it seemed to mean, and he replied that it did. I made him sit down and tell me all he knew of the matter, in the course of the conversation sending for his book of reports and examining them for some time back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3163"/>I saw no entry quite so shocking as the report of the day, but found that entries of like character were not infrequent; that every few days these details were sent down the river to get wood and were in the habit of meeting emissaries sent by the enemy for the purpose, who offered them every inducement to desert; that these inducements were embodied also in printed circulars, <num value="1">one</num> of which was shown me. I was horrified, and in the course of the next day or <num value="2">two</num> made a careful investigation into the character and condition of the command, the result of which was anything but satisfactory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3164"/>I hardly knew what to do, but through the <rs type="role" reg="acting-Adjutant">acting-adjutant</rs>, who turned out to be an excellent fellow and a trustworthy, useful, and promising officer, I was enabled to secure a conference of the best officers of the battalion, and in a long interview to secure their confidence and co-operation, and we set to work together to change the condition of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3165"/>I ingratiated myself, too, with the men by doing away with a number of petty orders and regulations which were annoying and burdensome, and instituting in their place a few which were really important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3166"/>Among other things I, of course, did away with this down-the-river wooddetail. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3167"/>It is not worth while to particularize further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3168"/>Suffice it to say, I endeavored to impress upon the men <num value="3">three</num> things: <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that I already knew a great deal about them and expected and intended to know them thoroughly; <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, that I was in command of them and expected and intended to be obeyed implicitly; and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, that I was their friend and expected and intended to do the very best I could for them in every way. I will only add that I was deeply stirred, and put my whole heart and soul into the matter and into my <pb id="p.314" n="314"/> men, and that my efforts ultimately effected more than I had even dared to hope; particularly in the line of securing the respect and confidence and friendly regard of the men. The greatest difficulty was encountered in the fact that not a few of the officers were utterly worthless, and I determined to get rid of these, but as to this was compelled to move slowly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3169"/><num value="1">One</num> other measure adopted certainly ought to be mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3170"/>There were a good many <name>Christian</name> men in the command, but they seemed to have little or no social or public religious life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3171"/>I had these assembled for special, informal conference with the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3172"/>I talked with them, in a general way, about the condition of the command, and asked their interest and assistance in doing everything possible to improve it and tone it up, and gave notice that I would myself, whenever it was practicable, conduct a simple religious service on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> evenings in our log church, to which all were invited, but none would be compelled to attend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3173"/>I believe this little service conduced as much as any other means or measure to such success as attended my efforts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3174"/>I had but <num value="2">two</num> difficulties with the men. <num value="1">One</num> was a simple, though aggravated, case of open disrespect to some announcement or order having to do with the new order of things, and which was read at dress-parade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3175"/>This I punished on the spot, and severely, and we never had any repetition of it. The other was a more complicated and troublesome affair. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3176"/>The weather was very cold, and after I put a stop to the wood-detail down the river, the men began cutting some of the standing timber upon and back of the bluff; but orders were sent me by competent authority forbidding this, and these orders were duly read at dress-parade and also posted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3177"/>I did the best I could to provide wood, but the supply was inadequate, and the men really suffered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3178"/>I explained how much I regretted the situation and added that I fared and should fare no better than they.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3179"/>I was compelled, of course, to have fire in the adjutant's office, where writing must be done; but I should have none in my house except when they had it in their houses, and no more wood than <pb id="p.315" n="315"/> they had, and I urged the observance of the regulation against cutting wood on the bluff, to which special importance seemed to be attached by the authorities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3180"/>The men were resentful and rebellious about this regulation against felling trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3181"/>My order stopping the river wooddetail was the obvious consequence of the disgraceful action of their comrades, and that they did not seem to resent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3182"/>But, <num value="1">one</num> cold night, soon after my special utterance about the preservation of the timber, while lying awake in bedvery likely from cold &mdash; I heard the regular blows of <num value="2">two</num> axes upon a tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3183"/>I got up, dressed, and armed myself, and made my way through the snow, guided by the sound, until I was close upon <num value="2">two</num> men who were chopping at a large tree which was about toppling to its fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3184"/>I waited until it did fall and then came suddenly upon them; They started to run, but I ordered them to halt, impressing the order with my revolver, and adding that I knew them both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3185"/>I reminded them that they could not possibly plead ignorance of the order and asked how they thought I ought to punish them, to which, of course, they made no response.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3186"/>I then expressed deep sympathy with them; adding that, though it would break up discipline to allow sympathy with suffering to excuse flagrant violation of orders, yet as it was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> offense, and they were so entirely in my power, and seemed to admit the truth and force of all I had said, I had determined to take no further notice of the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3187"/>They thanked me profusely and were about to return to their quarters, but I ordered them to remain and cut up the tree for use; but that, of course, it should be divided among the command or distributed by the quartermaster with his other wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3188"/>I exacted from them a promise not only not to fell any more trees themselves, but to do all in their power to put a stop to tree-cutting by others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3189"/>The <num value="2">two</num> men told this story around the battalion, with considerable amplification and adornment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3190"/>It seemed to make an unexpectedly strong and favorable impression and was <num value="1">one</num> of the definite things that aided the accomplishment of my intense desire to <hi rend="italics">get hold</hi> of my men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3191"/>Of course I greatly missed my old life, and especially its congenial and often charming companionship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3192"/>This life <pb id="p.316" n="316"/> was comparatively solitary, but it was after all a life of greater power, a life that meant more, and I was becoming deeply absorbed in it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3195"/>I recall but <num value="1">one</num> incident of these lines worth relating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3196"/>After the loss of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1864-09-"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, our picket line was retired and the enemy's advanced, in front of the fort; but nearer the river we still held our old line, and upon it a wooded knoll which commanded a full view of the enemy's main line, and so was very important to us and our tenure of it correspondingly annoying to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3197"/>The Federal lines at this point were manned by negro troops. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3198"/><num value="1">One</num> evening, sitting on the knoll and looking toward <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName>, several <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards distant</measure>, I observed the negro picket near the intersection of our old picket line and theirs, walking his beat upon our line, instead of theirs, and so coming directly toward me. Then he took his return beat toward the fort, but when he came again he extended his beat further in my direction, and another followed him. So the next time there were <num value="3">three</num> of them upon our line, and I divined their purpose, which was by moral pressure, as it were, to crowd us back from the knoll.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3199"/><pb id="p.317" n="317"/> </p> 
<p>I had only <num value="2">two</num> men with me; but I dispatched <num value="1">one</num> to <persName n="Lee,General,Custis,,," id="n0036.0022.00317.01616" reg="default:Lee,Custis,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Custis</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, with a brief note of explanation, asking that <num value="50">fifty</num> men be sent me immediately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3200"/>Meanwhile I mounted my remaining man on our old picket line, faced toward <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName>, and ordered him to walk rapidly &mdash; I walking at his side-just inside the little curtain of earth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3201"/>When the negroes saw us coming they turned back and I could see the <num value="1">one</num> nearest us was trembling as he heard our steps approaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3202"/>When we came close upon him he turned, his face actually ashy, and holding his gun in both hands horizontally, he obtruded it towards us, at the same time backing away and saying: </p>

<p>Noticing this revelation, but not remarking upon it, I picked up a billet of wood and laid it across the top of the little work, between my man and the negro, saying, <quote>If that negro steps across that piece of wood, shoot him; and if he steps off the line, on either side, shoot him.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3206"/></p> 
<p>This broke up the little scheme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3240"/>Indeed, we went into our meeting that night without any other information; but I had directed the <rs type="role" reg="acting-Adjutant">acting-adjutant</rs> to remain in his office and to bring at once to me, in the church, any orders that might come to hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3241"/>Our service was <num value="1">one</num> of unusual power and interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3242"/>I read with the men the <quote>Soldier Psalm,</quote> the <num value="91" type="ordinal">ninety-first</num>, and exhorted them, in any special pressure that might come upon us in the near future &mdash; the <quote>terror by night</quote> or the <quote>destruction <gap/> at <time value="12pm">noon</time>-<time>day</time></quote> --to abide with entire confidence in that <quote>Stronghold,</quote> to appropriate that <quote>Strength.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3243"/></p> 
<p>As I uttered these words, I noticed a well-grown, finelooking country lad named <persName n="Blount,,,,," id="n0036.0023.00321.01627" reg="mostcommon:Blount,nomatch:0"><surname>Blount</surname></persName>, who was leaning forward, and gazing at me with eager interest, while tears of sympathy and appreciation were brimming his eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3244"/>The door opened and the adjutant appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3245"/>I told him to stand a moment where he was, and as quietly as possible told the men what I was satisfied was the purport of the paper he held in his hand, and why I was so satisfied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3246"/>And then we prayed for the realization of what <persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName> had expressed in that Psalm &mdash; for faith, for strength, for protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3247"/>After the prayer I called for the paper and read it over, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> silently and then aloud, gave brief directions to the men and dismissed them-<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> calling upon such officers and noncommissioned officers of the battalion as had special duties to perform in connection with the magazines, etc., to remain a few moments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3248"/>The men were ordered to rendezvous at a given hour, and to fall in by companies on the parade, and the company officers were ordered to see that they brought with them only what was absolutely necessary, and a brief approximate list &mdash; was given of the proper campaign outfit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3249"/>But the poor fellows had been many months in garrison, and it was maddening work, within a short and fixed time, to select from their motley accumulations what was really necessary in the changed conditions ahead of us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3250"/>The orders were, in general, that the men of the fleet and of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName> defenses should leave the river about <pb id="p.322" n="322"/> midnight of the <dateStruct value="-04-2"><day reg="2">2d</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, exploding magazines and ironclads, and join the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> in its retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3251"/>Orders such as these were enough to try the mettle even of the best troops, in the highest condition, but for my poor little battalion they were overwhelming, well nigh stupefying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3252"/>The marvel is that they held together at all and left the <rs type="place">Bluff</rs>, as they did, in pretty fair condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3253"/>A few months earlier I question whether they would have been equal to it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3254"/>I said they left in pretty fair condition, and so they did, except that they had more baggage piled upon their backs than any <num value="1">one</num> brigade, perhaps I might say division, in <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0036.0023.00322.01628" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Custis,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> was bearing at the same moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3255"/>I could hardly blame them, and there was no time to correct the folly; besides, I knew it would correct and adjust itself, as it had done pretty well by morning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3256"/>The explosions began just as we got across the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3257"/>When the magazines at <placeName reg="Chaffin's bluff">Chaffin's</placeName> and <placeName reg="Drury's bluff">Drury's Bluffs</placeName> went off, the solid earth shuddered convulsively; but as the ironclads-<num value="1">one</num> after another-exploded, it seemed as if the very dome of heaven would be shattered down upon us. Earth and air and the black sky glared in the lurid light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3258"/>Columns and towers and pinnacles of flame shot upward to an amazing height, from which, on all sides, the ignited shells flew on arcs of fire and burst as if bombarding heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3259"/>I distinctly remember feeling that after this I could never more be startled-no, not by the catastrophes of the last great day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3260"/>I walked in rear of the battalion to prevent straggling, and as the successive flashes illumined the darkness the blanched faces and staring eyes turned backward upon me spoke volumes of nervous demoralization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3261"/>I felt that a hare might shatter the column. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3262"/>We halted at daylight at a country cross-road in <placeName reg="Chesterfield, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2111165">Chesterfield</placeName> to allow other bodies of troops to pass, the bulk of my men lying down and falling asleep in a grove; but seeing others about a well in the yard of a farm house over the way, I deemed it best to go there to see that nothing was unnecessarily disturbed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3263"/>I sat in the porch, where were also sitting an old couple, evidently the joint head of the establishment, and a young <pb id="p.323" n="323"/> woman dressed in black, apparently their daughter, and, as I soon learned, a soldier's widow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3264"/>My coat was badly torn, and the young woman kindly offering to mend it, I thanked her and, taking it off, handed it to her. While we were chatting, and groups of men sitting on the steps and lying about the yard, the door of the house opened and another young woman appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3265"/>She was almost beautiful, was plainly but neatly dressed, and had her hat on. She had evidently been weeping and her face was deadly pale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3266"/>Turning to the old woman, as she came out, she said, cutting her words off short, <quote>Mother, tell him if he passes here he is no husband of mine,</quote> and turned again to leave the porch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3267"/>I rose, and placing myself directly in front of her, extended my arm to prevent her escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3268"/>She drew back with surprise and indignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3269"/>The men were alert on the instant, and battle was joined. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3270"/><quote>What do you mean, sir?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3271"/>she cried. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3272"/><quote>I mean, madam,</quote> I replied, <quote>that you are sending your husband word to desert, and that I cannot permit you to do this in the presence of my men.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3273"/></p> 
<p><quote>Indeed! and who asked your permission, sir?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3274"/>And pray, sir, is he your husband or mine?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3275"/></p> 
<p><quote>He is your husband, madam, but these are my soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3276"/>They and I belong to the same army with your husband, and I cannot suffer you, or anyone, unchallenged, to send such a demoralizing message in their hearing.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3277"/></p> 
<p><quote>Army! do you call this mob of retreating cowards an army?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3278"/>Soldiers! if you are soldiers, why don't you stand and fight the savage wolves that are coming upon us defenseless women and children?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3279"/></p> 
<p><quote>We don't stand and fight, madam, because we are soldiers, and have to obey orders, but if the enemy should appear on that hill this moment I think you would find that these men are soldiers, and willing to die in defense of women and children.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3280"/></p> 
<p><quote>Quite a fine speech, sir, but rather cheap to utter, since you very well know the <rs>Yankees</rs> are not here, and won't be, till you've had time to get your precious carcasses out of the way. Besides, sir, this thing is over, and has been for some <pb id="p.324" n="324"/> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3281"/>The Government has now actually run off, bag and baggage,--the <rs>Lord</rs> knows where,--and there is no longer any Government or any country for my husband to owe allegiance to. He does owe allegiance to me and to his starving children, and if he doesn't observe this allegiance now, when I <hi rend="italics">need</hi> him, he needn't attempt it hereafter when <hi rend="italics">he</hi> wants <hi rend="italics">me</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3282"/></p> 
<p>The woman was quick as a flash and cold as steel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3283"/>She was getting the better of me. She saw it, I felt it, and, worst of all, the men saw and felt it, too, and had gathered thick and pressed up close all round the porch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3284"/>There must have been a <num value="100">hundred</num> or more of them, all eagerly listening, and evidently leaning strongly to the woman's side. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3285"/>This would never do. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3286"/>I tried every avenue of approach to that woman's heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3287"/>It was congealed by suffering, or else it was encased in adamant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3288"/>She had parried every thrust, repelled every advance, and was now standing defiant, with her arms folded across her breast, rather courting further attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3289"/>I was desperate, and with the nonchalance of pure desperation-no stroke of genius &mdash; I asked the soldier-question: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3290"/> </p> 
<p>What command does your husband belong to?</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3291"/>She started a little, and there was a trace of color in her face as she replied, with a slight tone of pride in her voice: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3292"/> </p> 
<p>He belongs to the <orgName n="Stonewall Brigade" type="brigade">Stonewall Brigade</orgName>, sir.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3293"/>I felt, rather than thought it-but, had I really found her heart?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3294"/>We would see. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3295"/><quote>When did he join it?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3296"/></p> 
<p>A little deeper flush, a little stronger emphasis of pride. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3300"/>Yes, I was sure of it now. Her eyes had gazed straight into mine; her head inclined and her eyelids drooped a little now, and there was something in her face that was not pain <pb id="p.325" n="325"/> and was not fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3301"/>So I let myself out a little, and turning to the men, said: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3303"/>I turned to look at her. It was all over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3304"/>Her wifehood had conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3305"/>She had not been addressed this time, yet she answered instantly, with head raised high, face flushing, eyes flashing- </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3307"/></p> 
<p>As she uttered these words she put her hand in her bosom, and drawing out a folded paper, extended it toward me, saying: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>If you doubt it, look at that.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3309"/>Before her hand reached mine she drew it back, seeming to have changed her mind, but I caught her wrist, and without much resistance, possessed myself of the paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3310"/>It had been much thumbed and was much worn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3311"/>It was hardly legible, but I made it out. Again I turned to the men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3312"/><quote>Take off your hats, boys, I want you to hear this with uncovered heads</quote> --and then I read an endorsement on application for furlough, in which <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0036.0023.00325.01630" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Custis,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> himself had signed a recommendation of this woman's husband for a furlough of special length on account of extraordinary gallantry in battle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3313"/>During the reading of this paper the woman was transfigured, glorified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3314"/>No Madonna of old master was ever more sweetly radiant with all that appeals to what is best and holiest in man. Her bosom rose and fell with deep, quiet sighs; her eyes rained gentle, happy tears. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3315"/>The men felt it <hi rend="italics">all-all</hi>. They were all gazing upon her, but the dross was clean, purified out of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3316"/>There was not, upon any <num value="1">one</num> of their faces an expression that would have brought a blush to the cheek of the purest womanhood on earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3317"/>I turned once more to the soldier's wife. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3323"/></p> 
<p>Not a sound could be heard save her hurried breathing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3324"/>The rest of us held even our breath. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3325"/>Suddenly, with a gasp of recovered consciousness, she snatched the paper from my hand, put it back hurriedly in her bosom, and turning once more to her mother, said: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3327"/>I stepped aside at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3328"/>She left the porch, glided down the path to the gate, crossed the road, surmounted the fence with easy grace, climbed the hill, and as she disappeared in the weedy pathway I caught up my hat and said: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3333"/>For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time I felt reasonably sure of my battalion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3334"/>It would follow me anywhere. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3335"/>No Confederate soldier who was on and of that fearful retreat can fail to recall it as <num value="1">one</num> of the most trying experiences of his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3336"/>Trying enough, in the mere fact that the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> was flying before its foes, but further trying, incomparably trying, in lack of food and rest and sleep, and because of the audacious pressure of the enemy's cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3337"/>The combined and continued strain of all this upon soft garrison troops, unenured to labor and hardship and privation and peril, can hardly be conceived and cannot be described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3338"/>Its <num value="2">two</num> most serious effects were <hi rend="italics">drowsiness and nervousness</hi>. We crossed and left <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName> at <time value="12am">midnight</time> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, were captured at <placeName reg="Sailor's Creek, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2646522">Sailor's Creek</placeName> about sundown on the <name>Thursday</name> following, and I think rations were issued to us that night by our captors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3339"/>I do not say there was only <num value="1">one</num>, but I <hi rend="italics">recall only <num value="1">one</num> issue of</hi> <pb id="p.327" n="327"/> <hi rend="italics">rations between those limits</hi>, and we were marching all day and, as I remember, a large part of every night. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3340"/>The somewhat disorganized condition of the troops and the crowded condition of the roads necessitated frequent halts, and whenever these occurred-especially after nightfall &mdash; the men would drop in the road, or on the side of it, and sleep until they were roused, and it was manifestly impossible to rouse them all. My <num value="2">two</num> horses were in almost constant use to transport officers and men who had given out, especially our doctor, whose horse was for some reason unavailable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3341"/>Besides, I preferred to be on foot, for the very purpose of moving around among the men and rousing them when we resumed the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3342"/>With this view I was a good part of the time at the rear of the battalion; but notwithstanding my efforts in this respect, individually and through a detail of men selected and organized for the purpose of waking the sleepers, we lost, I am satisfied, every time we resumed the march after a halt at night-men who were not found or who could not be roused. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3343"/>The nervousness resulting from this constant strain of starvation, fatigue, and lack of sleep was a dangerous thing, at <num value="1">one</num> time producing very lamentable results, which threatened to be even more serious than they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3344"/><num value="1">One</num> evening an officer, I think of <num value="1">one</num> of our supply departments, passed and repassed us several times, riding a powerful, black stallion, all of whose furnishings-girths, reins, etc., --were very heavy, indicating the unmanageable character of the horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3345"/>When he rode ahead the last time, about dark, it seems that he imprudently hitched his horse by tying his very stout tie rein to a heavy fence rail which was part of the road fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3346"/>Something frightened the animal and he reared back, pulling the rail out of the fence and dragging it after him full gallop down the road crowded with troops, mowing them down like the scythe of a war chariot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3347"/>Someone, thinking there was a charge of cavalry, fired his musket and, on the instant, <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> battalions, mine among them, began firing into each other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3348"/>I was never more alarmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3349"/>Muskets were discharged in my very face, and I fully expected to be shot down; but <pb id="p.328" n="328"/> after the most trying and perilous experience, the commanding officers succeeded in getting control of their men and getting them again into formation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3350"/>But while we were talking to them, suddenly the panic seized them again, and they rushed in such a wild rout against the heavy road fence that they swept it away, and many of them took to the woods, firing back as they ran. A <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time the excitement was quieted and <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> time it broke out. By this time, however, I had fully explained to my men that we had just put out fresh flankers on both sides of the road, that we could not have an attack of cavalry without warning from them, and that the safe and soldierly thing to do was to lie down until everything should become calm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3351"/>I. was much pleased that this <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> time my command did not fire a shot, while the battalions in our front and rear were firing heavily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3352"/>A field officer and a good many other officers and men were killed and wounded in these alarms, just how-many I do not believe was ever ascertained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3353"/>When we next halted for any length of time, during daylight, I formed my men and talked to them fully and quietly about these alarms, explaining the folly of their firing, and impressing upon them simply to lie down, keep quiet, and attempt to catch and obey promptly any special orders I might give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3354"/>I complimented them upon their having resisted the panicky infection the last time it broke out, and felt that, upon the whole, my men had gained rather than lost by the experience. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3355"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time> we had descended into a moist, green little valley, crossed a small stream called <placeName reg="Sailor's Creek, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2646522">Sailor's Creek</placeName>, and, ascending a gentle, grassy slope beyond it, had halted, and the men were lying down and resting in the edge of a pine wood that crowned the elevation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3356"/>A desultory fire was going on ahead and bullets began to drop in. I was walking about among the men, seeing that everything was in order and talking cheerfully with them, when I heard a ball strike something hard and saw a little commotion around the battalion colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3357"/>Going there, I found that the flag-staff had been splintered, and called out to the men that we were beginning to make a record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3358"/><pb id="p.329" n="329"/> </p> 
<p>Next moment I heard an outcry-<quote>There, Brookin is killed!</quote> --and saw <num value="1">one</num> of the men writhing on the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3359"/>I went tc him. He seemed to be partially paralyzed below the waist, but said he was shot through the neck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3360"/>I saw no blood anywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3361"/>He had on his roll of blankets and, sure enough, a ball had gone through them and also through his jacket and flannel shirt; but there it was, sticking in the back of his neck, having barely broken the skin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3362"/>I took it out and said: <quote><num value="0">0</num>, you are not a dead man by a good deal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3363"/>Here,</quote> --handing the ball to him,--<quote>take that home and give it to your sweetheart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3364"/>It'll fix you all right.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3365"/>Brookin caught at the ball and held it tightly clasped in his hand, smiling faintly, and the men about him laughed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3366"/>Just then I heard a shell whizzing over us, coming from across the creek, and we were hurried into line facing in that direction, that is, <hi rend="italics">to the rear</hi>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3368"/>The soldiers called them the <quote>Aye, Ayes,</quote> because they responded <quote>aye, aye</quote> to every order, sometimes repeating the order itself, and adding, <quote>Aye, aye, it is, sir!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3369"/>As this battalion, which followed immediately after ours, was getting into position, and seamen's and landsmen's jargon and movements were getting a good deal mixed in the orders and evolutions,--all being harmonized, however, and licked into shape by the <quote>aye, aye,</quote> --a young officer of the division staff rode up, saluted <persName n="Tucker,Admiral,,,," id="n0036.0023.00329.01632" reg="mostcommon:Tucker,Randolph,,,:1"><roleName n="Admiral">Admiral</roleName> <surname>Tucker</surname></persName>, and said: <quote><rs type="role2">Admiral</rs>, I may possibly be of assistance to you in getting your command into line.</quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3371"/>By this time a large Federal force had deployed into line on the other slope beyond the creek, which we had left not long since; <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> lines of battle, and a heavy <pb id="p.330" n="330"/> park of artillery, which rapidly came into battery and opened an accurate and deadly fire, we having no guns with which to reply and thus disturb their aim. My men were lying down and were ordered not to expose themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3372"/>I was walking backward and forward just back of the line, talking to them whenever that was practicable, and keeping my eye upon everything, feeling that such action and exposure on my part were imperatively demanded by the history and condition of the command and my rather peculiar relations to it. A good many had been wounded and several killed, when a <num value="20">twenty</num>-pounder <persName n="Parrott,,,,," id="n0036.0023.00330.01633" reg="mostcommon:Parrott,nomatch:0"><surname>Parrott</surname></persName> shell struck immediately in my front, on the line, nearly severing a man in twain, and hurling him bodily over my head, his arms hanging down and his hands almost slapping me in the face as they passed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3373"/>In that <num value="1">one</num> awful moment I distinctly recognized young <persName n="Blount,,,,," id="n0036.0023.00330.01634" reg="mostcommon:Blount,nomatch:0"><surname>Blount</surname></persName>, who had gazed into my face so intently <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>; and but for that peculiar paralysis which in battle sometimes passes upon a man's entire being-excepting only his fighting powers &mdash; the recognition might have been too much for me. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3374"/>In a few moments the artillery fire ceased and I had time to glance about me and note results a little more carefully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3375"/>I had seldom seen a fire more accurate, nor <num value="1">one</num> that had been more deadly, in a single regiment, in so brief a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3376"/>The expression of the men's faces indicated clearly enough its effect upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3377"/>They did not appear to be hopelessly demoralized, but they did look blanched and haggard and awe-struck. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3378"/>The <orgName n="Federal Infantry" type="infantry">Federal infantry</orgName> had crossed the creek and were now coming up the slope in <num value="2">two</num> lines of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3379"/>I stepped in front of my line and passed from end to end, impressing upon my men that no <num value="1">one</num> must fire his musket until I so ordered; that when I said <quote><hi rend="italics">ready</hi></quote> they must all rise, kneeling on the right knee; that when I said <quote><hi rend="italics">aim</hi></quote> they must all aim about the knees of the advancing line; that when I said <quote><hi rend="italics">fire</hi></quote> they must all fire together, and that it was all-important they should follow these directions exactly, and obey, implicitly and instantly, any other instructions or orders I might give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3380"/><pb id="p.331" n="331"/> </p> 
<p>The enemy was coming on and everything was still as the grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3381"/>My battalion was formed upon and around a swell of the hill, which threw it further to the front than any other command in the division, so that I was compelled to shape my own course, as I had received no special orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3382"/>The Federal officers, knowing, as I suppose, that we were surrounded, and appreciating the fearful havoc their artillery fire had wrought, evidently expected us to surrender and had their white handkerchiefs in their hands, waving them toward us, as if suggesting this course; and yet, so far as I remember, they did not call upon us to surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3383"/>I do not recall any parallel to this action. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3384"/>I dislike to break the flow and force of the narrative by repeated modifying references to recollection and memory; but it is not safe for a man, so many years after the event, to be positive with regard to details unless there was special reason why they should have been impressed upon him a. the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3385"/>I will say, then, that my memory records no musket shot on either side up to this time, our skirmishers having retired upon the main line without firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3386"/>The enemy showed no disposition to break into the charge, but continued to advance in the same deliberate and even hesitating manner, and I allowed them to approach very close &mdash; I should be afraid to say just how close-before retiring behind my men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3388"/>To my great delight the men rose, all together, like a piece of mechanism, kneeling on their right knees and their faces set with an expression that meant-everything.

<p>I have never seen such an effect, physical and moral, produced by the utterance of <num value="1">one</num> word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3393"/>The enemy seemed to have been totally unprepared for it, and, as the sequel showed, my own men scarcely less so. The earth appeared to have swallowed up the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line of the <rs>Federal</rs> force in our <pb id="p.332" n="332"/> front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3394"/>There was a rattling supplement to the volley and the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line wavered and broke. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3395"/>The revulsion was too sudden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3396"/>On the instant every man in my battalion sprang to his feet and, without orders, rushed, bareheaded and with unloaded muskets, down the slope after the retreating Federals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3397"/>I tried to stop them, but in vain, although I actually got ahead of a good many of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3398"/>They simply bore me on with the flood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3399"/>The standard-bearer was dashing by me, colors in hand, when I managed to catch his roll of blankets and jerk him violently back, demanding what he meant, advancing the battalion colors without orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3400"/>As I was speaking, the artillery opened fire again and he was hurled to the earth, as I supposed, dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3401"/>I stooped to pick up the flag, when his brother, a lieutenant, a fine officer and a splendid-looking fellow, stepped over the body, saying: <quote>Those colors belong to me, <rs type="role2">Major</rs>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3402"/>at the same time taking hold of the staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3403"/>He was shot through the brain and fell backward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3404"/><num value="1">One</num> of the <orgName n="Color Guard" type="guard">color guard</orgName> sprang forward, saying: <quote>Give them to me, <rs type="role2">Major</rs>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3405"/>But by the time his hand reached the staff he was down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3406"/>There were at least <num value="5">five</num> men dead and wounded lying close about me, and I did not see why I should continue to make a target of myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3407"/>I therefore jammed the color staff down through a thick bush, which supported it in an upright position, and turned my attention to my battalion, which was scattered over the face of the hill firing irregularly at the <rs>Federals</rs>, who seemed to be reforming to renew the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3408"/>I managed to get my men into some sort of formation and their guns loaded, and then charged the <rs>Federal</rs> line, driving it back across the creek, and forming my command behind a little ridge, which protected it somewhat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3409"/>I ran back up the hill and had a brief conversation with <persName n="Lee,General,Custis,,," id="n0036.0023.00332.01635" reg="default:Lee,Custis,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Custis</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>,--commanding the division, our brigade commander having been killed,--explaining to him that I had not ordered the advance and that we would be cut off if we remained long where we were, but that I was satisfied I could bring the battalion back through a ravine, which would protect them largely from the fire of the enemy's artillery, and reform them on the old line, on the right of the <pb id="p.333" n="333"/> <orgName n="Naval Battalion" type="battalion">naval battalion</orgName>, which had remained in position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3410"/>He expressed his doubts as to this, but I told him I believed my battalion would follow me anywhere, and with his permission I would try it. I ran down the hill again and explained to my men that when I got to the left of the line and shouted to them they were to get up and follow me, on a run and without special formation, through a ravine that led back to the top of the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3411"/>Just because these simple-hearted fellows knew only enough to trust me, and because the enemy was not so far recovered as to take advantage of our exposure while executing the movement to the rear and reforming, we were back in the original lines in a few moments-that is, all who were left of us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3412"/>It was of no avail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3413"/>By the time we had well settled into our old position we were attacked simultaneously, front and rear, by overwhelming numbers, and quicker than I can tell it the battle degenerated into a butchery and a confused melee of brutal personal conflicts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3414"/>I saw numbers of men kill each other with bayonets and the butts of muskets, and even bite each others' throats and ears and noses, rolling on the ground like wild beasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3415"/>I saw <num value="1">one</num> of my officers and a Federal officer fighting with swords over the battalion colors, which we had brought back with us, each having his left hand upon the staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3416"/>I could not get to them, but my man was a very athletic, powerful seaman, and soon I saw the <rs>Federal</rs> officer fall. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3417"/>I had cautioned my men against wearing <quote><name>Yankee</name> overcoats,</quote> especially in battle, but had not been able to enforce the order perfectly-and almost at my side I saw a young fellow of <num value="1">one</num> of my companies jam the muzzle of his musket against the back of the head of his most intimate friend, clad in a Yankee overcoat, and blow his brains out. I was wedged in between fighting men, only my right arm free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3418"/>I tried to strike the musket barrel up, but alas, my sword had been broken in the clash and I could not reach it. I well remember the yell of demoniac triumph with which that simple country lad of yesterday clubbed his musket and whirled savagely upon another victim. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3419"/>I don't think I ever suffered more than during the few moments after I saw that nothing could possibly affect <pb id="p.334" n="334"/> or change the result of the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3420"/>I could not let myself degenerate into a mere fighting brute or devil, because the lives of these poor fellows were, in some sense, in my hand, though there was nothing I could do just then to shield or save them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3421"/>Suddenly, by <num value="1">one</num> of those inexplicable shiftings which take place on a battle-field, the fighting around me almost entirely ceased, and whereas the moment before the whole environment seemed to be crowded with the enemy, there were now few or none of them on the spot, and as the slaughter and the firing seemed to be pretty well over, I concluded I would try to make my escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3422"/>By the way, I had always considered it likely I should be killed, but had never anticipated or contemplated capture. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3423"/>I think it was at this juncture I encountered <persName n="Lee,General,Custis,,," id="n0036.0023.00334.01636" reg="default:Lee,Custis,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Custis</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, but it may have been after I was picked up. At all events, selecting the direction which seemed to be most free from Federal soldiers and to offer the best chance of escape, I started <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> at a walk and then broke into a run; but in a short distance ran into a fresh Federal force, and it seemed the most natural and easy thing in the world to be simply arrested and taken in. My recollection is that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0036.0023.00334.01637" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Custis,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> asked to be carried before the <rs>Federal</rs> general commanding on that part of the line, who, at his request, gave orders putting a stop to the firing, there being no organized Confederate force on the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3424"/>Thus ended my active life as a Confederate soldier, my <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> service under <persName><roleName n="Massa">Marse</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName></persName>, and I was not sorry to end it thus, in red-hot battle, and to be spared the pain, I will not say humiliation, of <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3425"/>I must, however, mention an incident to which I have already briefly referred, to which it would perhaps have been more delicate not to refer at all; but the reader of this chapter can scarcely have failed to perceive that <num value="1">one</num> of the most deeply stirring episodes in my soldier life was the struggle I made to lift my battalion out of the demoralization in which I found it; to make my men trust and love me, and to rouse and develop in them the true conception of soldierly duty and devotion, courage and endurance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3426"/>Looking back upon the teeming recollections of this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and last retreat and this final battle of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> of Northern <pb id="p.335" n="335"/> <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, amid all the overpowering sadness and depression of defeat, I already felt the sustaining consciousness of a real and a worthy success; but it is impossible to express how this consciousness was deepened and heightened when <persName n="Ewell,General,,,," id="n0036.0023.00335.01638" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Ewell</surname></persName> sent for me on the field, after we were all captured, and in the presence of half a dozen generals said that he had summoned me to say, in the hearing of these officers, that the conduct of my battalion had been reported to him, and that he desired to congratulate me and them upon the record they had made. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3431"/>I do not hesitate to say the soldier cannot be highly developed without this influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3459"/>These incidents require not <num value="1">one</num> word, by way either of explanation or of emphasis.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3509"/><quote><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>,</quote> and not the general commanding in the field, was authorized to confer the medals and badges; so that, even without the distinct reference in the orders to <quote>the regular channels,</quote> it is obvious that, in practical operation, the plan would fail utterly of that rapid, responsive recognition and reward wherein consist the life and power of decoration and promotion <quote>on the field.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3510"/></p> 
<p>Again, the <name>Act</name> provided for conferring <quote>a badge of distinction upon <num value="1">one</num> private or non-commissioned officer of <hi rend="italics">each company</hi>, after <hi rend="italics">every signal victory</hi> it shall have assisted to achieve.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3511"/>Thus, by reason of the number to be decorated, the decoration would, of necessity, cease to be a distinction, and the scheme must, as it did, break down of its own weight, to say nothing of its other inherent defects. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3512"/>Perhaps the most glaring of these was the mode of selecting the men who were to be recipients of the badges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3513"/>It is expressly provided in the <name>Act</name> that: <quote>The non-commissioned officers and privates of the company who may be present on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> dress-parade thereafter (that is, <q direct="unspecified">after every signal victory</q> ) may choose, by a majority of their votes, the soldier best entitled to receive such distinction.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3514"/>Could there be devised a more shocking travesty upon the essential <pb id="p.344" n="344"/> law and character of military promotion or reward and the appropriate mode of conferring it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3515"/>Such promotion or recognition means, of course, and exclusively, recognition or promotion from above; by the determination, that is, of <num value="1">one</num>'s superior or commanding officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3516"/>To substitute in place of this the ballot of <num value="1">one</num>'s fellows is a monstrous perversion-so monstrous as to be incredible but for the absolute proofs we have submitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3517"/>It was bad enough to provide for election to military office; but to elect the bravest man in the command is an incongruity still more extreme. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3518"/>And yet there is <num value="1">one</num> feature of this remarkable statute even more exaggerated and grotesque.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3519"/>The entire scheme had been delayed a year or more because of the difficulty or expense of procuring the medals and badges, and an elective <quote>Roll of honor</quote> was the ingenious substituted device of someone to bridge over the difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3521"/>The imagination staggers at the task of picturing the scene where <num value="2">two</num> elected heroes proceeded to draw straws to determine which of the twain should be enrolled among the immortals. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3522"/>Was there ever enacted by a legislative body, or carried into effect by an <orgName n="Executive Office" type="office">executive office</orgName>, a more utterly impotent scheme or as grim a farce?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3648"/>My story is told.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3649"/>If it has failed to interest and to stir you deeply, the fault is in the telling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3650"/>And yet I cannot but hope &mdash; that, in spite of feeble and inadequate portrayal, the great outlines of the picture have so impressed themselves upon you that you are ready to admit the life of <persName><roleName n="Massa">Marse</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName></persName>'s boys, from <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, to have been a higher and greater life than you had imagined. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3651"/>It would seem as if this must be so, if you have credited the writer with a fair average of intelligence and conscientiousness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3652"/>I can well understand, however, that, without reflecting upon me in any offensive sense, some of those who have done me the honor to read these reminiscences may feel that I have unconsciously and very naturally idealized my comrades of the long ago and the vivid life we lived together in our golden youth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3653"/>It is difficult to meet such a suggestion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3654"/>I believe the strongest and most satisfactory way to meet it and, at the same time, the fittest way to end this book, will be to close with an analysis of the <name>Soldier</name>-Life, from which it will appear how natural and normal it is, that elements and forces, such as characterize that life, should produce men and deeds and scenes and incidents such as I have endeavored to portray in the foregoing pages. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3655"/>It is also, just now, specially to be desired that the essential character and training of the military life should be better and more generally understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3656"/>However we may differ as to the advisability of the new career of foreign complication and conquest upon which this country seems to have entered, and which has resulted and must necessarily result in such an expansion of its military establishment, yet we <pb id="p.359" n="359"/> must all agree that it is well the growing multitudes of young men who are entering and to enter the military service should have high and clear conceptions of that great life to which they have devoted themselves &mdash; a life, by the way, which, notwithstanding the horrors that often attended it, grew upon me every day I lived it; and to which, if the war had resulted in the establishment of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, I should have consecrated myself with whole-hearted devotion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3657"/>It will not be forgotten that I claim for the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> some peculiar characteristics, as well as a fuller and finer development of the soldierly character in general, because of the circumstances under which that army fought, and especially the leader, whose banner it followed; but, after all, the heroic story I have told is in no small degree the normal product and outcome of a grand system of physical, mental and moral training, which has been little understood and grossly misconceived and misrepresented. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3658"/>What, then, is the training and what are the formative elements and forces of the <name>Soldier</name>-Life?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3659"/>I answer: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3660"/> 
<list type="simple"> 
<item>The essential character of the <name>Soldier</name>-Life is <quote>Service;</quote> </item>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3661"/>If you have measured these elements as I have mentioned them, there can be little need of elaboration or of argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3662"/>The compact analysis makes ample impression at <pb id="p.360" n="360"/> once of theoretical soundness and of practical power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3663"/>Beyond a doubt these are the essential elements and forces of the military life; they are such as must of necessity be unceasingly operative, and their influence in the development of character can scarcely be exaggerated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3664"/>Let us briefly consider them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3665"/>The essential character of the soldier-life is <quote>Service.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3666"/></p> 
<p>Can this be questioned?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3667"/>When a man enters the military profession, whether as an officer or a private soldier, by that very act he is cut off from the pursuit of his personal aims and purposes and devoted to the service of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3668"/>Thereafter he has no home, no farm, no workshop, no business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3669"/>He knows no self-directed future, attempts nothing, expects nothing, for himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3670"/>Every man outside the army regards him, and he regards himself, as a man relieved, separated from the entanglements and opportunities of the business world, and consecrated to a service which may at any time demand the sacrifice even of his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3671"/>OurEnglish Bible, upon this, as upon so many practical phases of our human experience, rings wondrous true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3672"/>Wrote the great apostle: <quote>No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3673"/></p> 
<p>The keynote which inspires and dominates and regulates all this life of <quote>Service</quote> is the single, simple majestic law of <quote>Duty.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3674"/>No employment of the soldier is too trivial and none too great to be included in this all-embracing term and regulated by this all-pervading law. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3675"/>Descriptive names and phrases express and impress conceptions, and thus frequently constitute a sort of connecting link between causes and effects, principles and results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3676"/><quote>Service ;</quote> <quote>the service ;</quote> <quote>entered the service ;</quote> <quote>discharged from the service;</quote> <quote>promoted for gallant and meritorious service ;</quote> <quote>duty ;</quote> <quote>on duty ;</quote> <quote>off duty ;</quote> <quote>present for duty ;</quote> <quote>absent from duty ;</quote> <quote>shot to death for absence from duty</quote> --how many times, during the <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> from <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, do you suppose I read, wrote, uttered, heard these and kindred expressions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3677"/>Is it not clear that, by his everyday's experience and intercourse, this <num value="1">one</num> great figure-his <pb id="p.361" n="361"/> life a <quote>service,</quote> its employment <quote>duty</quote> --is burned in upon the soldier's soul? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3678"/>In the light of these principles, and of his lifelong training, we gain a new conception of that sublime sentence in <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0036.0026.00361.01686" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Custis,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s letter to his son, <quote>Duty is the sublimest word in the <rs>English</rs> language;</quote> and of that groan of his mighty soul in the crisis and agony of defeat, <quote>It is my duty to live.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3679"/></p> 
<p>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lesson of the soldier-life is unquestioning Obedience. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3680"/>No <num value="1">one</num> will deny the justness of the analysis here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3681"/>Undeniably, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lesson of the soldier's life, logically and chronologically, is obedience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3682"/>There is no department, no business, no station, in which instant, implicit, blindfold obedience is so vital to safety and success, or enforced by such terrible sanctions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3683"/>In military matters hesitation is disobedience, disobedience is mutiny, mutiny is death. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3684"/>The principle of the soldier's obedience is the principle of <hi rend="italics">obedience</hi>, a principle very little understood and very much contemned in this day and land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3685"/>It is this: authority is to be obeyed, not because it commands what is right, but because it has the right to command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3686"/><num value="1">One</num> under rightful authority is therefore absolved from responsibility as to the policy or propriety or consequences of the command; his sole dignity, as well as duty, is to obey with unquestioning alacrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3687"/>This principle is not palatable to the republican sovereigns of this country, yet it is a principle notwithstandingnot exclusive, nor of universal application, but it has its place, and, in its place, is of vital importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3688"/>It is the principle on which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> governs the world, the father his family, the soldier his subordinates; and it has other, many other, applications. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3689"/>Its direct antagonism is <quote><hi rend="italics">higher laze</hi>,</quote> that is, a law higher than the commands of rightful authority; in other words, authority is to be obeyed, not because it has the right to command, but because it commands what is right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3690"/>This principle, too, has its applications, but it is not applicable to a subordinate under rightful authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3691"/>The harmony between the <num value="2">two</num> is found, I think, in a limitation upon the principle of obedience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3692"/>We pass from the law of obedience <pb id="p.362" n="362"/> to the higher law when, but only when, the command is so palpably and grossly wrong that the authority can no longer be rightful and subjection to it no longer endured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3693"/>This is the right of <hi rend="italics">revolution</hi>, and is applicable by way of exception to every human relation and authority. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3694"/>The soldier, however, has very little sympathy with the right of revolution, or any modification of or exception to the law of unquestioning obedience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3695"/>His theory and practice in this regard find apt illustration in the reply of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0036.0026.00362.01687" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> to the brigade commander, who gave excellent reasons for having modified the order of march: <quote>Sir, you should have obeyed the order <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and reasoned about it afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3696"/>Consider yourself under arrest.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3697"/></p> 
<p>The last lesson of the soldier-life is unquestioned Command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3698"/>This analysis of the life and its lessons is not original with me; it is at least <measure n="1900years" type="date">nineteen hundred years</measure> old, and rests on the authority of <num value="1">one</num> who was a superb development of the most military nation of history, that grand old <name>Roman</name> centurian whose interview with the <name>Son</name> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is perhaps the most striking of the <name>Gospel</name> narratives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3699"/>Said he: <quote>I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto <num value="1">one</num>, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3700"/>Here are the <num value="2">two</num> great correlative lessons of the life, obedience and command, and both are absolute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3701"/>This is the soldier, not ashamed to obey, not afraid to command; knowing how to render, and thus learning how to exact, obedience. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3702"/>The daily lesson of the life is unceasing Accountability. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3703"/>The soldier breathes, as it were, an atmosphere of accountability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3704"/>His daily routine is made up of inspections and reports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3705"/>What he is, what he has, what he does, his person, his possessions, his conduct, are constantly passing under a scrutiny so searching that nothing escapes, however trivial, and all must conform to unvarying <quote>Regulations.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3706"/>This is perhaps the most prominent and impressive feature of the life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3707"/>I need not enlarge upon it. The fact is patentcan its influence be doubted?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3708"/>Apart now from your impression <pb id="p.363" n="363"/> as to what the soldier is, what ought he to be as the result of such training?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3709"/>Can you conceive of anything tending more to develop regularity, reliability, promptness, accuracy, even in the smallest details? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3710"/>In the upper grades of the soldier-life, mark how this accountability is retained and developed into Responsibility, which, in the case of the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs>, becomes absolutely awful, unmeasured and unmeasurable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3711"/>Responsibility! I had almost said no other human being can have any adequate conception of the meaning of the term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3712"/>Responsible for what?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3713"/>For the lives of his followers, for the future of their bereft families; but it is not life or death, not victory or defeat alone, that trembles in the balance of his battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3714"/>It is the life and honor of his country, the weal or woe of <num value="1000000">millions</num> yet to be. He orders the charge, and liberty and destiny and history flicker in the gleam of his bayonets. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3715"/>The experiences of the life are unparalleled Hardships, Perils, Crises. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3716"/>It would be superfluous to enlarge upon these, the most external and palpable features of a soldier's life, so shortly after a war which has overspread a continent and filled a land with veterans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3717"/>Nor will we stay to prove what no <num value="1">one</num> will deny, that robustness of character, dauntless determination, courage that saves from, if it does not hide, a multitude of sins, and a composure and balance of soul that no excitement can disturb, no terror overwhelm, are the legitimate fruits of the soldier training. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3718"/>The social atmosphere of the soldier-life is Freedom from Social Shams. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3719"/>The unconventionality and candor of student life are proverbial, and yet, though I stepped from the hearty, ideal student life of Old Yale into the ranks of the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldiery, it was not long before I felt that I had never before realized how unstudied, Unconventional, and absolutely sincere human life could be. It was almost startling, the degree to which I knew other men, my comrades, and felt that <num value="1">1</num> was known by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3720"/>All the little shams, insincerities, and <pb id="p.364" n="364"/> concealments of ordinary society disappeared; until, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in our lives, we seemed to be stripped bare of the disguises under which we had theretofore been accustomed to hide our real characters, not only from the world in general and from out most intimate associates and companions, but even from ourselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3721"/>It was this which imparted to the religious life of the army a power and thrill unattainable, even unapproachable, in ordinary life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3722"/>So close did men get to each other that I experienced no difficulty and no embarrassment in conversing with every man in the company on the subject of personal religion, and in these conferences have often felt that I was playing upon a naked human soul, between whom and myself there was absolutely no barrier and no screen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3723"/>It was an experience thrilling and tremendous indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3724"/>In view of it, I have more than once remarked that if my Maker should reveal to me that I had but a short time to live, and should permit me to choose a position in which I could accomplish most for the regeneration of my fellow-men, I should unhesitatingly say, <quote>Let me be an officer in an army, in a time of active service.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3725"/></p> 
<p>The compensation of the soldier-life is Fixed pay. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3726"/>The importance and influence of this feature cannot be estimated until you have answered this question: What is the most demoralizing of all human desires and pursuits?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3727"/>I know not how you will better answer than in the words of Holy Writ; for the wisdom of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has embodied the answer in a proverb, <quote>The love of money is the root of all evil.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3728"/>And the context is most impressive!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3729"/><quote>They that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3730"/>A proposition thus enunciated needs no enforcement, and no <num value="1">one</num> will contend that this terrific indictment is less true or less applicable to-day than when the noble apostle warned his <quote>son <persName><foreName>Timothy</foreName></persName></quote> against this the greatest of all the lures of the tempter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3731"/>And, so surely as opportunity makes temptation, the soldier, looking securely to his sufficient but fixed compensation, having his undivided services demanded and paid for by his country, and being <pb id="p.365" n="365"/> consequently unable to devote himself to any lucrative employment, must be in great measure protected against the debasing passion of avarice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3732"/>The inspiration of the life is Promotion from Above. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3733"/>Evidently the soldier's compensation is not the inspiration of his calling; and it is perhaps more true of him than of any other man that his chief inspiration is honorable advancement in his profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3734"/>Call it love of glory, if you please; even at that it is almost infinitely more elevating and ennobling than love of money, which is the ruling motive of much the larger part of mankind, certainly in this age and land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3735"/>But the soldier does not call it love of glory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3736"/>He is no moral philosopher or theorist; he is a practical man, and his inspiration, that of which he talks and dreams, that for which he serves and strives, is all embodied in <num value="1">one</num> word -<hi rend="italics">promotion</hi>. This is <quote>the life of the service.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3737"/>So peculiarly true is this that the soldier's progress has well nigh appropriated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3738"/>the term <quote>promotion,</quote> as the soldier's life has appropriated the title <quote>service.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3739"/></p> 
<p>But it is not the desire for promotion, however inspiring, to which I wished chiefly to ask your attention, but rather the peculiar law of military promotion, namely, that it is promotion <hi rend="italics">from above</hi>. Before you estimate the importance of this feature, let me ask you another question: What is the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> great demoralizing influence of our age, and particularly of our country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3740"/>I have not here the <name>Word</name> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for answer; but in these days of unblushing demagogism I am sure of your concurrence when I say, it is flattery and service of the mob, cowardly concession to it, in order to secure promotion <hi rend="italics">from below</hi>. I mean no reflection upon the right or principle of suffrage; but the practice of suffrage, and the means commonly resorted to to control it for personal ends are at once a disgrace to free government and a degradation of the candidate and the voter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3741"/>No honest man can now pass through a political contest without being disgusted, if happily he be not also surprised, at the means employed against him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3742"/>The true soldier knows nothing of such contests or influences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3743"/>He never dreams of promotion by any other power <pb id="p.366" n="366"/> than that of his superiors, or on any other ground than gallant and meritorious service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3744"/>No! the soldier's principle, the soldier's inspiration, is promotion <hi rend="italics">from above</hi>, and it cuts off a world of temptation and demoralization thus to lift a man's eyes and efforts <hi rend="italics">up</hi> for personal elevation and advancement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3745"/>We have finished our review of the root forces of the <name>Soldier</name>-Life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3746"/>Where will you find principles of greater power for the development of character? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3747"/>Is it objected that the soldier, as we see him in actual life to-day, fails to exhibit any close conformity to these elevated principles and lofty ideals?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3748"/>I answer that the like failure marks the embodiment among men of the principles and ideals of every lofty life-even of our holy religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3749"/>But balanced men do not on this ground question either the truth and beauty of these principles and ideals, or the sincere adoption of them by the followers of the <name>Christ</name>, or their moulding influence for good upon those who adopt them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3750"/>Is it objected further that, only the highest class of recruits could be expected to appreciate the philosophy of such a system?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3751"/>True, but the same is true of every high vocation &mdash; that only a few choice souls thoroughly grasp the inner philosophy, the root principles, the formative forces of the calling to which they have devoted their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3752"/>But it is also true that intellectual appreciation, however much to be desired, is not indispensable to the operation and the moulding power of formative forces such as we have discussed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3753"/>A young man who enters the military service and is subjected to its discipline and training may not have intellectual life and interest enough even to inquire what it is that is making a new man of him; notwithstanding, being compelled to conform his conduct to the regulations and to live the strenuous life we have just sketched, new habits will gradually be formed and the new man will unconsciously be made. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3754"/>A touching and beautiful illustration of the justness of this soldier analysis, and the character-moulding power of its principles, occurred the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time I made use of it in public <pb id="p.367" n="367"/> speech, applying it in that instance to a great soldier of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and showing how the mould prefigured the man. At the close of the address the son of another and <num value="1">one</num> of the very greatest of our Confederate leaders, who had fallen in battle early in the war, pressed his way to my side, saying, with the deepest feeling: <quote><rs type="role2">Major</rs>, you have, in a very just sense, introduced my own father to me to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3755"/>I have always admired the majestic outline of his perfect manhood, but never until I heard you just now have I realized where his qualities came from, nor sympathized, as I should have done, with my father's almost passionate love and reverence for his profession.

<p>I am not a blind enthusiast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3758"/>I admit that the almost enforced idleness of the camp in time of peace, the absence of women and children and the lack of other refining and elevating influence of home, are blemishes in the life of the soldier.
