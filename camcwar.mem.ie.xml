<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The point raised and presented to the <rs type="place">Court</rs> was, that the <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> erection of a massive edifice, like the proposed Monument, was inconsistent with the use of the <name>Common</name> as a training field, and therefore in direct violation of the intent of the grantors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The <rs type="place">Court</rs> held that such an appropriation of the land did not interfere with its use as a training field; on the contrary, the proposed Monument was a most fitting ornament for a place designed to be used for military purposes; that, considering the area of the <name>Common</name>, and the dimensions, location, design, and character of the structure, it is to be regarded as an incident or appurtenance of a training field; and therefore the city might lawfully erect it, without incurring a forfeiture of the estate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The Monument rests on a platform <measure n="25feet" type="distance">twenty-five feet</measure> square, surrounded by <num value="2">two</num> steps, making an aggregate of <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure> at the extreme base, and giving a rise of <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> <measure n="3inches" type="distance">three inches</measure> from the grading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>At the centre of the platform stands the pedestal of the <name>Monument</name> proper, which is also square in plan, having <measure n="13feet" type="distance">thirteen feet</measure> <measure n="6inches" type="distance">six inches</measure> as a length of the sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>It is surmounted by a very substantial cornice, elevated <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure> <measure n="8inches" type="distance">eight inches</measure> from the platform, and having a diameter of <measure n="14feet" type="distance">fourteen feet</measure> <measure n="5inches" type="distance">five inches</measure>, which is the extreme measure of the <name>Monument</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Above the pedestal cornice rises a heavy, plain plinth, and upon this rests the floor of the arcade, which is <measure n="11feet" type="distance">eleven feet</measure> <measure n="5inches" type="distance">five inches</measure> square, and richly moulded on the outer edge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The floor is composed of but <num value="2">two</num> stones, having an aggregate weight of something over <num value="8">eight</num> tons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>At the <num value="4">four</num> corners of this floor stand the plinths of the pilasters and imposts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The former are finished with a moulded base, and contain <num value="5">five</num> flutes on each of the <num value="2">two</num> sides, and <num value="2">two</num> on each of the others, and crowned with a composite capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The diameter above the base is <measure n="18inches" type="distance">eighteen inches</measure>, and the aggregate height of base, shaft, and capital is <measure n="11feet" type="distance">eleven feet</measure> <measure n="7inches" type="distance">seven inches</measure>. The imposts are <measure n="9.5inches" type="distance">nine and a half inches</measure> projection from the pilasters, with a depth of <measure n="13inches" type="distance">thirteen inches</measure>. They are finished with a richly moulded capital, from which spring, on each of the <num value="4">four</num> sides, <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> elliptical arches, decorated with elaborate archivolt mouldings, key-stones, &amp;c. The width of openings is <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> <measure n="11inches" type="distance">eleven inches</measure>, with a height of <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure> <measure n="7inches" type="distance">seven inches</measure> to the crown of the arch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The pilasters and imposts combined are cut out of single stones, giving great solidity and strength to the structure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The archivolt stones are also entire, extending from pilaster to pilaster; and all this work, as well as all similar parts of the <name>Monument</name>, are strongly confined together with copper dowels and clamps let into the stone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The entire surface of the inside of the alcove is finely hammered, with internal cornice moulding, grooved panel lines in the spandrels, key-stones, &amp;c. The ceiling is of a single stone, <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure> <measure n="4inches" type="distance">four inches</measure> square, exclusive of the moulding on the outer edge, and weighs something over <num value="10">ten</num> tons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>It forms the architrave of the entablature, and upon it rests the frieze; and surmounting all are <num value="4">four</num> pediments, making the cornice, &amp;c. The entablature has a height of <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> <measure n="8inches" type="distance">eight inches</measure>, and the pediments <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> <measure n="7inches" type="distance">seven inches</measure>, giving an aggregate of <measure n="27feet" type="distance">twenty-seven feet</measure> <measure n="9inches" type="distance">nine inches</measure> from the top of same down to platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The pediments are composed of but <num value="4">four</num> stones, with valleys cut at the corners of roofs; and each stone weighs nearly <num value="5">five</num> tons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The frieze of the entablature is decorated with stars, as are also the key-stones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The latter exhibit rays cut in the stone back of the stars, and the bed mould of cornice is cut in continued small archwork.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The style of mouldings on the monument throughout is the <rs>Roman</rs>, and in all instances it has been strictly adhered to and fully executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Immediately above the pediments rises the base of the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Section">first section</orgName> of the statue pedestal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>This is composed of a series of plinths and surmounting moulded bases, with a panelled die, and no cornice but a receding bevel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>In plan, this section is an irregular octagon, having <num value="4">four</num> principal and <num value="4">four</num> subordinate sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>In the former are bass-reliefs in granite, <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> representing the <num value="4">four</num> arms of the service; viz., Navy, Cavalry, Artillery, and Infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The extreme diameter of this section at the base is <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure> <measure n="1inch" type="distance">one inch</measure>, and at the die of pedestal <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> <measure n="8inches" type="distance">eight inches</measure>, with an altitude of <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> <measure n="10inches" type="distance">ten inches</measure> from the apex of pediments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Resting on this section and receding from it is another of corresponding plan; the transition being made by inverted consoles, and base mouldings cut in on the <num value="4">four</num> principal sides between.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The diameter of this section, exclusive of the consoles, is <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> <measure n="4inches" type="distance">four inches</measure>, and the height is <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> <measure n="2inches" type="distance">two inches</measure>, including a finely moulded projecting cornice, which is also in <num value="1">one</num> stone and crowning all. Above the consoles are small panels; and in the <num value="4">four</num> principal sides between are square panels, enriched by bass-reliefs cut in stone, representing respectively the coats-of-arms of the <rs>City</rs> of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge, State of Massachusetts</placeName>, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and of the <orgName n="Grand Army of the Republic" type="association">Grand Army of the Republic</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>On the large cornice-stone named rests the ornamental moulded base or sub-plinth of the statue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>This is in general outline like the section below, but at the top more nearly approaching a perfect octagon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The stone is <num value="1">one</num> foot <measure n="8inches" type="distance">eight inches</measure> high, making an extreme height of <measure n="44feet" type="distance">forty-four feet</measure> <measure n="8inches" type="distance">eight inches</measure> from the grading, or <measure n="48feet" type="distance">forty-eight feet</measure> from the average grade about the <name>Monument</name>, including a rise of <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> <measure n="4inches" type="distance">four inches</measure> as mound work about the steps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The statue from the base stone is <measure n="11feet" type="distance">eleven feet</measure> high, making in all <measure n="55feet" type="distance">fifty-five feet</measure> <measure n="8inches" type="distance">eight inches</measure> as the aggregate height of the <name>Monument</name> and steps.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>On the main platform, at the <num value="4">four</num> angles and radiating diagonally from them, are the <num value="4">four</num> tablet buttresses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>These are <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> <measure n="10inches" type="distance">ten inches</measure> in height.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>They project <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> <measure n="5inches" type="distance">five inches</measure> at the die, from the main pedestal, and are <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> <measure n="8inches" type="distance">eight inches</measure> thick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>In each end are moulded panels, and in each of the <num value="8">eight</num> sides are sunken panels, in which are the bronze memorial tablets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>In the die of the main pedestal, <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> between the buttresses, are other sunken panels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>That on the front side is occupied by the dedicatory statement, and the other <num value="3">three</num> are designed for occupation at a future day by bass-relief tablets of bronze, representing such events in the late war as may be deemed most expedient or appropriate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>A heavy moulded base projects from the buttresses, and below this a plinth, beneath which is a bevelled base and plinth, down to the platform, and the whole of these are continued around the entire work and across under the panels in the main pedestal.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The boldness of all moulded parts, and distinctness of outline to each <num value="1">one</num> throughout the entire structure, is <num value="1">one</num> of the marked excellences of the composition.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>Our aim was to produce a statue which should be typical of the citizen soldier, who left his home to do battle for the <rs>Union</rs>, realizing the solemnity of the conflict in which he was to engage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>He has met the fortunes of war with a spirit actuated by <num value="1">one</num> thought,--the salvation of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>Victory has not excited him to undue exultation, nor has defeat for a moment served to depress him. He has witnessed the slaughter of the foe with pity, and yet has been a terrible antagonist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>While unmindful of his own sufferings, he has ever been deeply moved by the sufferings of his comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>He has shrunk from no carnage, nor has he plunged into danger regardless of the object to be attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>The Rebellion suppressed, he stands in the uniform, not of the <rs>North</rs>, but of the <rs>Union</rs> he has helped to preserve, meditating on the fearful strife <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> through which he has passed,--the awful baptism by which his country has been purified,--and with a spirit ready to march again to the front to fight for Liberty at a moment's warning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>And then thoughts of his fallen comrades sweep through his mind, and with a tighter clasp of the gun on which he rests, and which has been his inseparable companion during those years of bloodshed, he uncovers his head, and with folded arms contemplates, with a mingling of solemnity, sternness, and tender memory, the scenes which these thoughts conjure before his mental eye.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>Having embodied these ideas in our small model, we tested them satisfactorily by the best military experience and critical ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>The soldier is not at <quote>parade rest,</quote> as many unacquainted with military tactics have supposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>He is at ease, taking such position as suits him best; and the beholder is at liberty to place him where his fancies may dictate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>The result of this contest is familiar to you all. At the close of that day, they knew that they were able to cope successfully with the army of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Entering upon its new career, this nation has startled the world by its development, and has become colossal in its proportions, extending from ocean to ocean; and the time is possibly not far remote, when its northern and southern boundaries will extend from sea to sea. The governments of the old world have watched with amazement our progress and growth, and the events of the last few years have demonstrated the immense vitality and strength of our Republican form of government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>Under these circumstances of prosperity, the <rs>Rebellion</rs> broke forth, and we then found, after the lapse of nearly a century, that the same nation which oppressed our fathers was indirectly aiding the leaders of the <rs>Rebellion</rs> to destroy the best government of the world,--a government of progress in every measure that tends to make mankind better and happier.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>From this experience of the past, we ought to be reminded that other days of peril and war may come to us, and that we need these memorials to incite others to emulate the example of those whose names are here to be recorded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>So long as war is to be the final arbiter, we must award the highest honors to those who are the brave defenders of the soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>No nation can long survive that neglects to pay this homage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>It has been our happiness and our extreme good fortune to have lived in the later years, and to have witnessed the actual ending of <num value="1">one</num> of the most remarkable eras in the annals of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>The century which spanned the interval between the <dateStruct value="-03-5"><day reg="5">fifth</day> day of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> in the year <dateStruct value="1770--"><year reg="1770">1770</year></dateStruct>, and the <num value="30" type="ordinal">thirtieth</num> day of the same month in the year <dateStruct value="1870--"><year reg="1870">1870</year></dateStruct>, was crowded with events of a wonderful and extraordinary character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>That century began with the sound of <name>British</name> musketry in the streets of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>; it ended with the electric flash that bore to us the intelligence that universal freedom and universal suffrage were at last established, for all races of men, throughout the length and breadth of this vast Republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>In that century what an unparalleled progress was made in the recognition of the religious, civil, and political rights of men; a change that seems little less than miraculous; a progress in a <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure> that the previous <num value="1000">thousand</num> could not boast of. In that century, now just expired, were fought the battles of the <name>Revolution</name>, redeeming the better part of a continent from foreign domination, and overthrowing kingly power forever on these western shores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>In that century transpired the astonishing series of events, which ended in the abolition of slavery, and the raising up of a down-trodden and despised race to a perfect <pb id="p.66" n="66"/> equality of rights with those who but lately claimed to be its owners and absolute masters!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>These great and noble results have been won on the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>Amid the agonies of war the nation achieved its independence and the freedom of its citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>Their names may be found recorded among the fallen on a <num value="100">hundred</num> stricken fields; their souls ascended to heaven from the scene of many a deadly conflict, where the defenders of freedom have grappled with the minions of despotic power.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>We come here to-day to dedicate a Monument in honor of such men as these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>Proudly we remember them, for, by their deeds of valor, they shed an undying lustre on the city which they loved to call their home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>Proudly we claim them as having been our brethren and fellow-citizens, for they fought and died in a sacred cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>Proudly we raise to their immortal memory this tribute of our admiration, for they defended their country in its hour of utmost peril, and taught us a new lesson of patriotism and courage and unswerving constancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>And here, as we fondly hope, will stand for many centuries this monumental pile; reminding the generations which are, in due time, successively to occupy our places, of what may be truly and fitly called the <rs>Heroic Age</rs> of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>. </p></body></text> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>Poor must he be who will not set a stone at his friend's grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>Our cities of the dead are becoming rich in memorial works of art. It is not that we fear we shall forget our friends unless we write their names in stone; but that we are compelled by our own feelings to pay them this tribute of respect and affection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>He who was at the head of our army and navy throughout the war, and he who was at the head of the soldiers of our State, were home men. If they belonged not by residence to our city, they belonged to our homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>Our <rs type="role2">President</rs> was a plain man, with a plain name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>He needed only the common lineage, and no courtly titles could have adorned him.
