<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>I have but recently returned from <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName>, and had an opportunity of reading <num value="2">two</num> works on torpedoes, or submarine mines; <num value="1">one</num> by <persName n="Stotherd,Major,R.,H.,," id="n0117.0002.00000.00003" reg="default:Stotherd,R.,H.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Stotherd</surname></persName>, R.

N.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>It is now <measure n="9years" type="date">nine years</measure> since the close of our civil war, and considering how rapidly things change in this fast age, and that we too must soon pass away, it is about time at least to commence to vindicate the truth of history; for much of the history of that conflict exists only in the memory of the actors therein, and if they die without recording their experiences the truth is lost.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>At this day I think that my letter may be fairly read and considered, and that the impartial historian will give to my statements their due weight, the object being to establish my claim to having made the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> successful application of electrical torpedoes or submarine mines as a system of defence in time of war, which system is now generally adopted in some modified form by all nations for the defence of harbors, rivers, &amp;c., and their approaches, as well as for the approaches by land to any fortified position.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>I do not know that I should ever have taken this step, but that the authors of the books to which I allude, as well as <persName n="Chesney,Colonel,,,," id="n0117.0002.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Chesney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Chesney</surname></persName>, R. E., in his <title>Essays in military Biography,</title> <ref n="page 345">page 345</ref>, seem to turn their backs, with such a studied air, upon the practical <hi rend="italics">source</hi> of electrical torpedo defences &mdash; defences which they do not conceal are becoming the chief reliance of all nations for the purposes above named.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>The works of <persName n="Stotherd,Major,,,," id="n0117.0002.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Stotherd,R.,H.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Stotherd</surname></persName>, R. E., particularly the last edition, are valuable alike to the general reader, the officer of whatever service of his country, and to the young torpedoist; whilst those of <persName n="Fisher,Commander,,,," id="n0117.0002.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Fisher,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commander">Commander</roleName> <surname>Fisher</surname></persName> are rather elementary and wanting in practical <pb id="p.2" n="2"/>information to be sure; but both of those authors would doubtless have it inferred that to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> belongs the merit, whatever it amounts to, of having devised, <hi rend="italics">without material assistance</hi>, an efficient method of torpedo defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>The fact is, however, that there is not a matter of any practical importance treated of by <persName n="Stotherd,Major,,,," id="n0117.0002.00002.00008" reg="nearbymention:Stotherd,R.,H.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Stotherd</surname></persName> in his late work on this subject, that was not understood and practiced where necessary in my torpedo department during the late war, except as to the new explosives; and I assert that he could easily have ascertained these facts by making the ordinary inquiries that every author should make in order to place before his readers a correct and impartial work; also that the facts already at his hand should have induced him to do so, for he quotes from the pamphlet on torpedo warfare, by <persName n="Steward,Captain,E.,Harding,," id="n0117.0002.00002.00009" reg="default:Steward,E.,Harding,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>Harding</foreName> <surname>Steward</surname></persName>, R. E., whose constant mention of my name in connection with the <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num></hi> and only <hi rend="italics">success</hi> of electrical torpedoes in war, showed <persName n="Stotherd,Major,,,," id="n0117.0002.00002.00010" reg="nearbymention:Stotherd,R.,H.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Stotherd</surname></persName> very clearly where the system originated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>And now for the evidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, let me say, that I purposely avoided entering into <hi rend="italics">detail</hi>, until forced to do so, as to what <hi rend="italics">was done</hi>, by the use of E. torpedoes during our civil war, not wishing to recall unpleasant scenes, but that I write now in gratification of a natural and proper ambition, recording the truth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> idea of using torpedoes on the <rs>Confederate</rs> side, originated I believe with <persName n="Mallory,the Honorable,S.,R.,," id="n0117.0002.00002.00011" reg="default:Mallory,S.,R.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">the Hon.</roleName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Mallory</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs>, and he directed the distinguished <persName n="Maury,Captain,M.,F.,," id="n0117.0002.00002.00012" reg="default:Maury,M.,F.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Maury</surname>, <roleName n="Doctor of Laws">Ll. D.</roleName></persName>, to make experiments with a view to their general employment if practicable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>I was selected as his immediate assistant.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>His work commenced in the spring of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, and continued for a few months only with electrical torpedoes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>He had arrived at no definite conclusion from his experiments, in any particular when he left the <rs>Confederacy</rs> for <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and I was ordered to take charge, subject to orders from the <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName> only, and remained so until near the closing scenes of the war, when I was relieved in command by <persName n="Jones,Captain,J.,Pembroke,," id="n0117.0002.00002.00013" reg="default:Jones,J.,Pembroke,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>Pembroke</foreName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The means used in my electrical torpedo defences differed in every essential particular from those used by <persName n="Maury,Captain,,,," id="n0117.0002.00002.00014" reg="nearbymention:Maury,M.,F.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Maury</surname></persName> in his experiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The peculiar construction of the mines, the methods of fixing them in position and connecting them with the cables and batteries; the determination of the quantities of powder to use at different depths and the effective areas, the batteries used for firing, and also for testing the mines, as well as the organization <pb id="p.3" n="3"/>and equipment of the stations from which the mines were controlled, all formed a complete system devised by myself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The results of this system were that the <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num></hi> vessels ever <hi rend="italics">injured or destroyed in war</hi>, by electrical torpedoes, were by the torpedo department operating under my immediate command, and I may add the <hi rend="italics">only</hi> ones, that I am aware of.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Those who are not well acquainted with the history of our civil war will find ample proof of my statements on file in the <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, as also by reference to <persName n="Porter,Admiral,,,," id="n0117.0002.00003.00015" reg="mostcommon:Porter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Admiral">Admirals</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lee,Admiral,S.,P.,," id="n0117.0002.00003.00016" reg="default:Lee,S.,P.,,"><roleName n="Admiral"></roleName><foreName>S.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Cushing,Commander,W.,B.,," id="n0117.0002.00003.00017" reg="default:Cushing,W.,B.,,"><roleName n="Commander">Commander</roleName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Cushing</surname></persName>, <orgName n="U.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>There are volumes of evidence to this effect that can be produced when necessary.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>I hold letters from the <num value="3">three</num> last named gentlemen, and from the late <persName n="Lee,General,R.,E.,," id="n0117.0002.00003.00021" reg="expanded:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> in reference to the efficiency of my torpedo department-also a letter from <persName n="Mallory,the Honorable,S.,R.,," id="n0117.0002.00003.00022" reg="default:Mallory,S.,R.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">the Hon.</roleName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Mallory</surname></persName>, in which he says: <quote>I regarded your service as equivalent to that of a well appointed fleet or army;</quote> and this had reference only to the defences of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 31" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>In fact when the system was nearly completed and inspected in person by <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n0117.0002.00003.00023" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:4"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0117.0002.00003.00024" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Mallory,Secretary,,,," id="n0117.0002.00003.00025" reg="nearbymention:Mallory,S.,R.,,"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Mallory</surname></persName>, it was immediately decided to withdraw large numbers of troops from that quarter for offensive operations elsewhere, it being well understood that the <rs>Union</rs> armies could not advance without the assistance of the <orgName n="Federal Squadron" type="squadron">Federal squadron</orgName>, which advance was for a long time effectually prevented by my system of submarine defences.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Many vessels were disabled or destroyed by mechanical or contact torpedoes, but such effect is known to be the result of mere chance, often as fatal to friend as foe, and produces no such demoralizing effect as the certain destruction which awaits any vessel attempting to pass electrical torpedoes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>In regard to the efficiency of the torpedo defences employed by me during the war, as compared with those of the present day, I have to say that I have been almost constantly on torpedo duty ashore and afloat since our war, making the subject a study in <pb id="p.4" n="4"/>several foreign countries and our own, and have not yet seen any material improvement or development of the original system, and if we were at war with any great naval power to-morrow, I should prefer to rely upon it when the hour of trial came.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>There are several beautiful and ingenious methods devised by those who have had no practice in war, but my experience will not permit me to give them approval.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Now, if we are to consider <hi rend="italics">practical</hi> success as the test of an <hi rend="italics">invention</hi>, have I not a right to this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Am I not as much entitled to it as <persName n="Morse,,,,," id="n0117.0002.00004.00026" reg="mostcommon:Morse,nomatch:0"><surname>Morse</surname></persName> to the telegraph?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/><persName n="Howe,,,,," id="n0117.0002.00004.00027" reg="mostcommon:Howe,nomatch:0"><surname>Howe</surname></persName> to the <rs n="sewing machine" type="product">sewing machine</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/><persName n="Colt,,,,," id="n0117.0002.00004.00028" reg="mostcommon:Colt,nomatch:0"><surname>Colt</surname></persName> to the revolver?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>And as many other men to their inventions whose success did not carry with it the original conception of the <hi rend="italics">necessity</hi> for the invention, nor the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attempts to carry out the idea, nor in whose inventions as patented is there <num value="1">one</num> original <hi rend="italics">scientific</hi> principle?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It is the effect produced by art in combination, and this is the basis of <num value="99">ninety-nine</num> out of a <num value="100">hundred</num> patents.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>And the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> successful attempt to achieve an important physical object by original principles or art in combining those which are known, is the only test by which we can be governed in awarding a patent entitling <num value="1">one</num> to an invention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>If not, where shall we draw the line of distinction?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>How shall we proceed with a <orgName n="Patent Office" type="office">patent office</orgName>?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>In the year <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, Congress adopted by an almost unanimous vote my invention for <quote>lowering, detaching, attaching, and securing boats at sea,</quote> and directed the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs> to purchase the patent right for the use of the navy, which was done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The marine world had probably seen the <hi rend="italics">necessity</hi> for such an invention since the days of <persName n="Noah,,,,," id="n0117.0002.00004.00029" reg="mostcommon:Noah,nomatch:0"><surname>Noah</surname></persName>, and there is not <num value="1">one</num> original mechanical principle in it. It is simply a combination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The invention was several years before the country, in scientific journals; was carefully examined and tested at sea in several ships by some of the best officers in the navy, and discussed during <num value="2">two</num> sessions in Congress, yet I have never known any <num value="1">one</num> to dispute my claim thereto.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The efficiency of electrical torpedo defences is so universally recognized at this day and they appear so simple to the <hi rend="italics">initiated</hi>, that many of the <quote>I know it</quote> kind may exclaim, <quote>Why I don't see any <hi rend="italics">invention</hi> in the matter, for it has been long known that if a chance was got at a ship with so much powder under her, she was bound to go up.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>But then if so simple, why did not <persName n="Fulton,,,,," id="n0117.0002.00004.00030" reg="mostcommon:Fulton,nomatch:0"><surname>Fulton</surname></persName> or <persName n="Bushnell,,,,," id="n0117.0002.00004.00031" reg="mostcommon:Bushnell,nomatch:0"><surname>Bushnell</surname></persName>, in the early history of our country, or the <name>Russians</name> during the <name>Crimean</name> <pb id="p.5" n="5"/>war, <hi rend="italics">stamp</hi> the fact upon the times, so as to render it, as it is <hi rend="italics">now</hi>, a system of defence that no nation <hi rend="italics">dares</hi> neglect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>And how did it become so?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>I trust to history for the answer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>If any <num value="1">one</num> had to contend with the abuse and sneers, and ridicule whilst in the performance of torpedo duty day and night, that fell upon me during the war, he would realize that as late as the summer of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, some of the ablest men of the day did not regard torpedo warfare as worthy of consideration, and the very attempts of <persName n="Fulton,,,,," id="n0117.0002.00005.00032" reg="mostcommon:Fulton,nomatch:0"><surname>Fulton</surname></persName> and of <persName n="Bushnell,,,,," id="n0117.0002.00005.00033" reg="mostcommon:Bushnell,nomatch:0"><surname>Bushnell</surname></persName>, and of the <name>Russians</name>, were used by those men in argument that my attempt would also be fruitless.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Much of the light has to struggle through mediums of darkness and resistance, and gradually breaks in upon us. Our <hi rend="italics">theories</hi> rarely assume a practical form, but as in many other circumstances so in naval and military matters we are controlled by theory (nearly every association having <num value="1">one</num> of its own) until the <hi rend="italics">test</hi>, the practice comes, and then in war see how the mist vanishes and light appears!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Some have made the lucky casts and win.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Can any <num value="1">one</num> think of a war that did not cause him to wonder at his own want of forethought?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>How weapons and methods are changed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>How rank is capsized!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>How he came out of the struggle other rounds higher on the ladders of science and of art!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>And every discovery of a new or improved weapon proves to be a step towards greater civilization and peace.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Apropos of the foregoing, I remember that a distinguished <rs type="role2">Admiral</rs> sent word to me when under a flag of truce during the war, that if I came down to his squadron again in a certain boat, (in which I had made the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> successful attack with the <quote><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0117.0002.00005.00034" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> &mdash; Spar-torpedo</quote> ) he would not respect the flag, as he did not acknowledge that I was engaged in civilized or legitimate warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>This glanced from my armor as many a worse shot did from my <hi rend="italics">own side</hi>, though for other reasons, for I felt that as <hi rend="italics">he</hi> was the only sufferer then, he saw the matter from but <num value="1">one</num> point of view, but that time would set it even as I replied in substance to <hi rend="italics">the officer</hi>,----------<quote><hi rend="italics">respice finem</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The end indeed was not far off, for the official reports of the day were that the admiral took up my torpedo mines as the territory was conquered, and turned them against us; and certain it is that his squadron was soon after armed with the <quote><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0117.0002.00005.00035" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>-Spar-torpedo.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>To those who know me, I trust that this letter is unnecessary, but then there is the world beside, and who knows how many in <pb id="p.6" n="6"/>it to set up a claim without having a knowledge of the facts?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>And those too who having that dangerous <quote>little knowledge</quote> may constantly employ it, as they have already done, until public opinion accepts it as its guide.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>I cannot conclude without a few words more in reference to my ever kind and lamented friend <persName n="Maury,Captain,,,," id="n0117.0002.00006.00036" reg="nearbymention:Maury,M.,F.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Maury</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>After <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0117.0007.00033.00422" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s death I received a copy of the number of the <title><orgName n="Historical magazine" type="newspaper">Historical magazine</orgName></title> containing the report from <persName n="Dawson,Mister,,,," id="n0117.0007.00033.00423" reg="nearbymention:Dawson,Henry,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Dawson</surname></persName>, and when in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1871-04-"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1871">1871</year></dateStruct>, I showed it to <persName n="Marshall,Colonel,Charles,,," id="n0117.0007.00033.00424" reg="default:Marshall,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Marshall</surname></persName>, who then informed me that when the report was written it was copied under his superintendence, and that the copy only was returned to <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0117.0007.00033.00425" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, he (<persName n="Marshall,Colonel,,,," id="n0117.0007.00033.00426" reg="nearbymention:Marshall,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Marshall</surname></persName>) retaining the rough draft, in which a number of corrections had been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/><rs type="role2">Admiral</rs> &mdash; Your letter reached me only a few days ago. It fills me with emotions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>In it I am offered the hospitalities of a great and powerful Empire, with the <rs>Grand</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Admiral">Admiral</rs> of its fleets for patron and friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>Inducements are held out such as none but the most magnanimous <pb id="p.52" n="52"/>of Princes could offer, and such as nothing but a stern sense of duty may withstand.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>A home in the bosom of my family on the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7013393" n="1.000 10" reg="Neva,Leningradskaya Oblast',Rossiya,Rossiya,Asia">Neva</placeName>, where, in the midst of books, and surrounded by friends, I am, without care for the morrow, to have the most princely means and facilities for prosecuting those studies and continuing those philosophical labors in which I take most delight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>All the advantages that I enjoyed in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> are, with a larger discretion, to be offered me in <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>Surely a more flattering invitation could not be uttered!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>Certainly it could not reach a more grateful heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>I have slept upon it. It is becoming that I should be candid, and, in a few words, frankly state the circumstances by which I find myself surrounded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>The <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName> gave me birth within her borders; among many friends, the nearest of kin, and troops of excellent neighbors, my children are planting their vine and fig tree; on her green bosom are the graves of my fathers; the political whirlpool from which your kind forethought sought to rescue me has already drawn her into fierce and bloody war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>In <dateStruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></dateStruct>, when this State accepted the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> and entered the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>, she did so with the formal declaration that she reserved to herself the right to withdraw from it for cause and resume those powers and attributes of sovereignty which she had never <hi rend="italics">ceded away</hi>, but only <quote><hi rend="italics">delegated</hi></quote> for certain definite and specific purposes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>When the <rs type="role" reg="President elect">President elect</rs> commenced to set at naught the very objects of the constitution, and without authority of law, proceeded to issue his proclamation of <dateStruct value="-04-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> last, <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, in the exercise of that reserved right, decided that the time had come when her safety, her dignity and honor required her to resume those <quote>delegated</quote> powers and withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>She did so. She then straightway called upon her sons in the <rs>Federal</rs> service to retire therefrom and come to her relief.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>This call found me in the midst of those quiet physical researches at the <name>Observatory</name> in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, which I am now, with so much delicacy of thought and goodness of heart, invited to resume in <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>Having been brought up in the school of State-Rights, where we had for masters the greatest statesmen of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, and among them <persName n="Madison,Mister,,,," id="n0117.0008.00052.00742" reg="mostcommon:Madison,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Madison</surname></persName>, the wisest of them all, I could not, and did not hesitate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>I recognized this call, considered it mandatory, and formally renouncing all allegiance to the broken Union, hastened over to the south side of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, there to renew to fatherland those vows of fealty, service and devotion which the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName> had permitted me to pledge to the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, so long only as by serving it, I might serve her.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>Thus my sword has been tendered in her cause, and the tender has been accepted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>Her soil is invaded, the enemy is actually at her gates, and here I am, contending as the fathers of the <rs>Republic</rs> did, for the right of self-government and those very principles for <pb id="p.53" n="53"/>the maintenance of which <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0117.0008.00053.00743" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:1"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> fought when this, his native State, was a colony of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>The path of duty and of honor is therefore plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>I am extremely obliged to you for the attention given to the wants of this army, and the efforts made to supply them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>Our absentees are returning, and I hope the earnest and beautiful appeal made to the country in your proclamation may stir up the whole people, and that they may see their duty and perform it. Nothing is wanted but that their fortitude should equal their bravery to insure the success of our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>We must expect reverses, even defeats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>Our people have only to be true and united, to bear manfully the misfortunes incident to war, and all will come right in the end.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>I know how prone we are to censure, and how ready to blame others for the non-fulfilment of our expectations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>This is unbecoming <pb id="p.54" n="54"/>in a generous people, and I grieve to see its expression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>The general remedy for the want of success in a military commander is his removal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>This is natural, and in many instances proper; for no matter what may be the ability of the officer, if he loses the confidence of his troops disaster must sooner or later ensue.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>I have been prompted by these reflections more than once since my return from <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> to propose to your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> the propriety of selecting another commander for this army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>I have seen and heard of expressions of discontent in the public journals at the result of the expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>I do not know how far this feeling extends in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>My <rs type="role" reg="Brother-Officer">brother officers</rs> have been too kind to report it, and so far the troops have been too generous to exhibit it. It is fair, however, to suppose that it does exist, and success is so necessary to us that nothing should be risked to secure it. I therefore, in all sincerity, request your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> to take measures to supply my place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>I do this with the more earnestness, because no <num value="1">one</num> is more aware than myself of my inability for the duties of my position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>I cannot even accomplish what I myself desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>How can I fulfil the expectations of others?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>In addition, I sensibly feel the growing failure of my bodily strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>I have not yet recovered from the attack I experienced the past spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>I am becoming more and more incapable of exertion, and am thus prevented from making the personal examinations and giving the personal supervision to the operations in the field which I feel to be necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>I am so dull, that in making use of the eyes of others I am frequently misled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>Everything, therefore, points to the advantages to be derived from a new commander, and I the more anxiously urge the matter upon your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> from my belief that a younger and abler man than myself can readily be obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>I know that he will have as gallant and brave an army as ever existed to <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> his efforts, and it would be the happiest day of my life to see at its head a worthy leader--<num value="1">one</num> that would accomplish more than I could perform, and all that I have wished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>I hope your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> will attribute my request to the true reason &mdash; the desire to serve my country and to do all in my power to insure the success of her righteous cause.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>I have no complaints to make of any <num value="1">one</num> but myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>I admit the propriety of your conclusions that an officer who loses the confidence of his troops should have his position changed, whatever may be his ability, but when I read the sentence I was not at all prepared for the application you were about to make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>Were you capable of stooping to it, you could easily surround yourself with those who would fill the press with your laudations, and seek to exalt you for what you had not done, rather than detract from the achievements which will make you and your army the subject of history and object of the world's admiration for generations to come.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>I am truly sorry to know that you still feel the effects of the illness you suffered last spring, and can readily understand the embarrassments you experience in using the eyes of others, having been so much accustomed to make your own reconnoissances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>Practice will, however, do much to relieve that embarrassment, and the minute knowledge of the country which you had acquired will render you less dependent for topographical information.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>But suppose, my dear friend, that I were to admit, with all their implications, the points which you present, where am I to find that new commander who is to possess the greater ability which <pb id="p.56" n="56"/>you believe to be required?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>I do not doubt the readiness with which you would give way to <num value="1">one</num> who could accomplish all that you have wished, and you will do me the justice to believe that if <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> should kindly offer such a person for our use I would not hesitate to avail [myself] of his services.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>My sight is not sufficiently penetrating to discover such hidden merit, if it exists, and I have but used to you the language of sober earnestness, when I have impressed upon you the propriety of avoiding all unnecessary exposure to danger, because I felt our country could not bear to lose you. To ask me to substitute you by some <num value="1">one</num> in my judgment more fit to command, or who would possess more of the confidence of the army, or of the reflecting men of the country, is to demand an impossibility.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>It only remains for me to hope that you will take all possible care of yourself, that your health and strength may be entirely restored, and that the <rs>Lord</rs> will preserve you for the important duties devolved upon you in the struggle of our suffering country for the independence which we have engaged in war to maintain.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>The history of them is as follows: When <persName n="Breckinridge,General,J.,C.,," id="n0117.0009.00056.00762" reg="expanded:Breckinridge,John,C.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName> took charge of the <orgName n="War Office" type="office">War Office</orgName> as <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, succeeding <persName n="Seddon,the Honorable,James,A.,," id="n0117.0009.00056.00763" reg="default:Seddon,James,A.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Honorable</roleName> <foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Seddon</surname></persName> on the <dateStruct value="1865-02-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> <month reg="02">February</month>, <year>1865</year>,</dateStruct> his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> steps, taken at the suggestion of <persName n="Campbell,Judge,John,A.,," id="n0117.0009.00056.00764" reg="default:Campbell,John,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Campbell</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Secretary of War">Assistant Secretary of War</rs>, was to address a circular letter to each of the <name>Chiefs</name> of Bureaus in the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, calling on them for information of the state of the service in their respective branches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>Similar letters were addressed at the same time to <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0117.0009.00056.00765" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> and <persName n="Johnston,General,J.,E.,," id="n0117.0009.00056.00766" reg="expanded:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General"></roleName><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, asking for authentic reports of the status of their armies and the prospects before them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>Responses were made, which were kept together in a bundle in the <orgName n="War Office" type="office">War Office</orgName>, of which as <rs type="role" reg="Chief">Chief</rs> of the <orgName n="War Bureau" type="bureau">Bureau of War</orgName> I had <pb id="p.57" n="57"/>charge, and these important and confidential papers <persName n="Breckinridge,General,,,," id="n0117.0009.00057.00767" reg="nearbymention:Breckinridge,J.,C.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName> requested me to keep in my personal custody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>Before complying with this order (which I greatly regret now that I complied with at all), I copied with the assistance of some friends each report.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>I have the honor to present the following general view of the operations of my department for the year ending <dateStruct value="-09-30"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="30">30</day></dateStruct>, and of its present condition and prospects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>I refer briefly to the more important branches of supply:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/><hi rend="italics">Small Arms</hi>--The chief supply has been from importations, which, since the loss of the vessels belonging to this Bureau, have been very light, not to exceed say on this side of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> <num value="30000">30,000</num> during the year, included in this report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>The number manufactured is about <num value="20000">20,000</num>, instead of <num value="50000">50</num> to <num value="60000">60,000</num>, as I anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>The reduced product is due to the interference of military operations, both of the enemy and our own. The captures have been about <num value="45000">45,000</num>, and the losses about <num value="30000">30,000</num>, leaving a gain of <num value="15000">15,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>The stock of arms in the arsenals is about the same as it was <num value="1">one</num> year ago. If we place the diminution of our military force at <num value="50000">50,000</num> men (including reserves, local forces, militia, &amp;c.), the aggregate of these figures [<num value="30000">30,000</num> imported+<num value="20000">20,000</num> made+<measure n="15000" type="captured">15,000 captured</measure>+<num value="50000">50,000</num> less troops==<num value="115000">115,000</num>] will represent the waste of arms during the year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>About <num value="20000">20,000</num> are now on the way from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and <num value="50000">50,000</num> more have been ordered purchased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>A further purchase of at least <num value="50000">50,000</num> will be necessary for the coming year, unless the operations of the armories can be placed on a permanent footing by declaring all <hi rend="italics">skilled mechanics</hi> engaged on them absolutely exempt from military duty, attaching them permanently to the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">Ordnance Department</orgName>, and encouraging in every way the growth of this class of workmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>I cannot lay too much stress on the necessity for legislative action on this point, in order to give <hi rend="italics">assurance</hi> to the workmen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/><hi rend="italics">Powder</hi>--The mechanical means of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> for the production of powder are ample for a war conducted on any scale, and are so arranged as to be almost beyond casualty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>In sending out this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> number of our <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> volume, there are several things we deem it appropriate to say:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/><num value="1">1</num>. We thank our friends and the public generally for the very kind reception they have been pleased to give our <hi rend="italics">Papers</hi>. The press throughout the <rs>South</rs>, and many of the <rs>Northern</rs> papers, have been exceedingly kind in their notices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>We have received numerous private letters from distinguished Confederates, warmly commending our enterprise, and testifying to the interest and value of our publications; and the steady increase of our subscription list attests the growing popularity of our monthly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/><num value="2">2</num>. We are exceedingly anxious to largely increase our subscription list, in order that we may extend the sphere of our usefulness, and have the means of making certain improvements in our <hi rend="italics">Papers</hi>. If each <num value="1">one</num> of our subscribers would secure us <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num> new name</hi>, we would at once double our list.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>We beg our friends to interest themselves in this matter, and to swell our list either by personal solicitation, or by sending us the names of reliable agents who will canvass for us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/><num value="3">3</num>. We think that a casual reference to the table of contents of our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volume will show that our publications thus far have possessed both popular interest and historic value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>But we may safely promise that our issues will be even more interesting and valuable in the months to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>We have scarcely touched the rich collection of Mss. already on our shelves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>and we have the promise of other papers of deep interest and great historic value from some of the ablest of the men who <hi rend="italics">made</hi> our Confederate history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/><num value="4">4</num>. We feel, then, that we do not transcend the limits of becoming editorial modesty when we cordially congratulate the <name>Society</name> on the past success and future prospects of their enterprise.

<p>During the night of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num> the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs> withdrew the main body to the ridges west of <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, and sent word to me to that effect, but his message missed me. I repaired to his headquarters during the latter part of the night, and received instructions as to the new line, and sent in compliance therewith a brigade (<persName n="Lee,,Fitzhugh,,," id="n0117.0011.00065.00795" reg="default:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><foreName n="Fitzhugh">Fitz.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s) to <placeName reg="Cash Town">Cash Town</placeName> to protect our trains congregated there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>My cavalry and artillery were somewhat jeopardized before I got back to my command, by the enemy having occupied our late ground before my command could be informed of the change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>None, however, were either lost or captured.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>During the <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>, which was quite rainy, written instructions were received from the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs> as to the order of march back to the <rs>Potomac</rs>, to be undertaken at nightfall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>In this order, <num value="1">one</num> brigade of cavalry was ordered to move, as heretofore stated, by way of <placeName reg="Cash Town">Cash Town</placeName>, guarding that flank and bringing up the rear on the road via <placeName reg="Brownsville, Franklin, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2086787">Greenwood</placeName> to <placeName reg="Williamsport, Lycoming, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2094606">Williamsport</placeName>, which was the route designated for the main portion of the wagon trains and ambulances, under the special charge of <persName n="Imboden,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n0117.0011.00065.00796" reg="mostcommon:Imboden,J.,D.,,:1"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Imboden</surname></persName>, who had a mixed command of artillery, infantry and cavalry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>Previous to these instructions, I had, at the instance of the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs>, instructed <persName n="Robertson,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n0117.0011.00065.00797" reg="mostcommon:Robertson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName>, whose <num value="2">two</num> brigades (his own and <persName n="Jones,,,,," id="n0117.0011.00065.00798" reg="mostcommon:Jones,J.,William,,:10"><surname>Jones</surname></persName>') were now on the right near <placeName reg="Fairfield, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7016248">Fairfield, Pennsylvania</placeName>, that it was essentially necessary for him to hold the <rs type="place">Jack Mountain</rs> passes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>These included two prominent roads, the <num value="1">one</num> north and the other south of <placeName key="possibilities=18" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Jack Mountain</placeName>, which is a sort of peak in the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs> chain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>In the order of march (retrogade) <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 1">one corps</orgName> (<persName n="Hill,,,,," id="n0117.0011.00065.00799" reg="mostcommon:Hill,A.,P.,,:14"><surname>Hill</surname></persName>'s) preceded everything through the mountain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>The baggage and prisoners of war, escorted by another corps (<persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n0117.0011.00065.00800" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,J.,,,:4"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s), occupied the centre, <pb id="p.66" n="66"/>and the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> (<persName n="Ewell,,,,," id="n0117.0011.00066.00801" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,nomatch:0"><surname>Ewell</surname></persName>'s) brought up the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>The cavalry was disposed of as follows: <num value="2">two</num> brigades on the <placeName reg="Cash Town">Cash Town</placeName> road, under <persName n="Lee,General,Fitzhugh,,," id="n0117.0011.00066.00802" reg="default:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName n="Fitzhugh">Fitz.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, and the remainder (<persName n="Jenkins,,,,," id="n0117.0011.00066.00803" reg="mostcommon:Jenkins,A.,G.,,:2"><surname>Jenkins</surname></persName>' and <orgName n="brigades"><persName n="Chambliss,,,,," id="n0117.0011.00066.00804" reg="mostcommon:Chambliss,nomatch:0"><surname>Chambliss</surname></persName>' brigades</orgName>) under my immediate command, was directed to proceed by way of <placeName key="tgn,2034742" n="1.000 10" reg="Emmetsburg, Palo Alto, Iowa">Emmetsburg, Maryland</placeName>, so as to guard the other flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>I dispatched <persName n="Blackford,Captain,,,," id="n0117.0011.00066.00805" reg="mostcommon:Blackford,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Blackford</surname></persName>, corps engineer, to <persName n="Robertson,General,,,," id="n0117.0011.00066.00806" reg="mostcommon:Robertson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName>, to inform him of my movement, and direct his co-operation, as <placeName key="tgn,2034742" n="1.000 10" reg="Emmetsburg, Palo Alto, Iowa">Emmetsburg</placeName> was in his immediate front, and was probably occupied by the enemy's cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>It was dark before I had passed the extreme right of our line, and, having to pass through very dense woods, taking by-roads, it soon became so dark that it was impossible to proceed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>We were in danger of losing the command as well as the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>It was raining also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>We halted for several hours, when, having secured a good guide, and it becoming more light, the march was resumed, and just at dawn we entered <placeName key="tgn,2034742" n="1.000 10" reg="Emmetsburg, Palo Alto, Iowa">Emmetsburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>We there learned that a large body of the enemy's cavalry (the citizens said <num value="15000">15,000</num>, which I knew, of course, was exaggerated) had passed that point the afternoon previous, going towards <placeName reg="Monterey, Franklin, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2090885">Monterey</placeName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the passes designated in my instructions to <persName n="Robertson,General,,,," id="n0117.0011.00066.00807" reg="mostcommon:Robertson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>I halted for a short time to procure some rations, and, examining my map, I saw that this force could either attempt to force <num value="1">one</num> of those gaps, or, foiled in that (as I supposed they would be), it would either turn to the right and bear off towards <placeName reg="Fairfield, Jefferson, Iowa" key="tgn,2034758">Fairfield</placeName>, where it would meet with like repulse from <persName n="Hill,,,,," id="n0117.0011.00066.00808" reg="mostcommon:Hill,A.,P.,,:14"><surname>Hill</surname></persName>'s or <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n0117.0011.00066.00809" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,J.,,,:4"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName>, or, turning to the left before reaching <placeName reg="Monterey, Franklin, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2090885">Monterey</placeName>, would strike across by <placeName reg="Oeiler's Gap">Oeiler's Gap</placeName> towards <placeName reg="Hagerstown, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7013681">Hagerstown</placeName>, and thus seriously threaten that portion of our trains, which, under <persName n="Imboden,,,,," id="n0117.0011.00066.00810" reg="mostcommon:Imboden,J.,D.,,:1"><surname>Imboden</surname></persName>, would be passing down the <rs type="place">Greencastle pike</rs> the next day, and interpose itself between the main body and its baggage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>I did not consider that this force could seriously annoy any other portion of our command, under the order of march prescribed, particularly as it was believed those gaps would be held by <persName n="Robertson,General,,,," id="n0117.0011.00066.00811" reg="mostcommon:Robertson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName> till he could be reinforced by the main body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>I therefore determined to adhere to my instructions, and proceed by way of <placeName reg="Cavetown, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,2046524">Cavetown</placeName>, by which I might intercept the enemy, should he pass through (<placeName reg="Eiler's Gap">Eiler's Gap</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>In and around <placeName key="tgn,2034742" n="1.000 10" reg="Emmetsburg, Palo Alto, Iowa">Emmetsburg</placeName> we <measure n="60" type="captured">captured sixty</measure> or <measure n="70" type="prisoners">seventy prisoners</measure> of war, and some valuable hospital stores en route from <placeName reg="Frederick, Frederick, Maryland" key="tgn,7016855">Frederick</placeName> to the army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>The march was resumed on the road to <placeName reg="Frederick, Frederick, Maryland" key="tgn,7016855">Frederick</placeName>, till we reached a small village called <placeName key="tgn,7013650" n="1.000 19" reg="cooperstown, otsego, new york">Cooperstown</placeName>, where our route turned short to the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>Here I halted the column to feed, as the horses were much fatigued and famished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>The column, after an hour's halt, continued through <placeName reg="Harbaugh Valley, Frederick, Maryland" key="tgn,2375980">Harbaugh valley</placeName>, by <placeName reg="Zion Church">Zion Church</placeName>, to pass the <rs type="place">Catoctin mountains</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>The road separates before debouching from the mountain, <num value="1">one</num> fork leading to the left by <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Smithtown</placeName>, and the other to the right, bearing more towards <placeName key="tgn,2047708" n="1.000 2" reg="leitersburg, washington, maryland">Leitersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>I divided my command, in order to make the passage more certain, <persName n="Ferguson,Colonel,,,," id="n0117.0011.00066.00812" reg="mostcommon:Ferguson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Ferguson</surname></persName>, commanding <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Jenkins,,,,," id="n0117.0011.00066.00813" reg="mostcommon:Jenkins,A.,G.,,:2"><surname>Jenkins</surname></persName>' brigade</orgName>, taking the left route, and <pb id="p.67" n="67"/><orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Chambliss,,,,," id="n0117.0011.00067.00814" reg="mostcommon:Chambliss,nomatch:0"><surname>Chambliss</surname></persName>' brigade</orgName>, which.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>I accompanied, the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>Before reaching the west entrance to this pass, I found it held by the enemy, and had to dismount a large portion of the command and fight from crag to crag of the mountains to dislodge the enemy, already posted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>Our passage was finally forced, and as my column emerged from the mountain it received the fire of the enemy's battery posted to the left on the road to <placeName reg="Boonsboroa">Boonsboroa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>I ascertained, too, about this time, by the firing, that the party on the other route had met with resistance, and sent at once to apprise <persName n="Ferguson,Colonel,,,," id="n0117.0011.00067.00815" reg="mostcommon:Ferguson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Ferguson</surname></persName> of our passage, and directed him, if not already through, to withdraw and come by the same route I had followed.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1258"/>Sir &mdash; In response to your circular of <dateStruct value="--7"><day reg="7">7th instant</day></dateStruct>, received yesterday, I have the honor to submit, for your consideration, the papers herewith enclosed with the following remarks:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1259"/>During the past <measure n="15months" type="date">fifteen months</measure> it has been my duty to make many and most urgent representations to the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> of the danger of want impending over the troops of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>, and also of the stringent necessity (for the safety of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 31" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, of the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>, and probably of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>), that accumulations of supplies should be made in this city.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1260"/>The obstacles in the way of this, and the plans to surmount those obstacles, have been pressed repeatedly, and the needed requirements urged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1261"/>In my communications and endorsements to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretaries of War</rs> and the <name>Treasury</name>, and to others, I have fully set forth these difficulties, as indicated by circumstances, and urged, with pertinacity, the adoption of measures to overcome them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1262"/>The arguments used by me have been, in my judgment, incontrovertible, but have had little effect, and the <orgName n="Army of Virginia" type="army">army of Virginia</orgName> has for several months suffered the consequence of their non-adoption, during which period it has been living literally <quote>from hand to mouth.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1263"/>The other armies of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> have been differently circumstanced, and do not, for the present, so much suffer from local deficiency, or insufficient means of transportation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1264"/>During the <hi rend="italics">whole</hi> of the year <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, consumption has been much more rapid than collection, and accumulations already made, instead of being increased, were consumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1265"/>During the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> of that year a larger amount of money (in <quote>old issue</quote> ) was turned into the treasury by the officers of the commissariat than was issued by it to them in the new, and since that time only a part of what was due has been paid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1266"/>As a consequence, their indebtedness has become overwhelming until everywhere credit was lost, and supplies, which might have been obtained for the subsistence of the army, passed into other hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1267"/>The same state of affairs, to even a greater extent, exists now in the period of collection, and, as a consequence of the lack of money and credit, not <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> of the hogs which could have been secured, have been or will be obtained for the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1268"/>Supplies which had been purchased at the islands to bridge over to the incoming crop of meat, have not been brought in, and are not now available.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1269"/>Repeated orders for their shipment were without effect, and plans proposed by this bureau to secure that object have not been permitted, or have been frustrated by circumstances beyond the control of the bureau.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1270"/><pb id="p.87" n="87"/></p> 
<p>The retention of many <num value="1000">thousands</num> of prisoners of war in this city caused the consumption of our reserve of flour, deficient transportation preventing their entire subsistence on corn from the <rs>South</rs> as had been intended</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1271"/>The supply of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> requires special consideration, for the ravages of the enemy in the country in which it operates have left not a full supply even for the non-combatants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1272"/>Hence its bases of supply are very remote, and that supply must be contingent on the means of collecting in those remote localities an excess over the wants of the troops there operating.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1273"/>This army is also sustained by various contrivances to draw supplies from beyond our lines by barter, and by secret arrangement, with the enemy turning on their anxiety to get cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1274"/>For both these purposes funds and credit are both necessary, hence it is obvious that the subsistence of the army rests on a most precarious foundation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1275"/>The instant passage of the amendment to the <hi rend="italics">Tythe Bill</hi>, and its active execution, the exercise of authority to impress teams along the line of roads to bring supplies forward, the <hi rend="italics">furnishing</hi> of <hi rend="italics">some coin</hi>, and sufficient funds to purchase articles of barter, and to pay for <measure n="4000barrels" type="mass">4,000 bales</measure> of cotton <hi rend="italics">immediately</hi>, and to purchase supplies throughout the land, are all indispensable at this juncture.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1276"/>It is also necessary that the management of the <rs>Danville</rs> and <orgName n="Piedmont Railroad" type="railroad">Piedmont Railroad</orgName> shall be rendered efficient, and that we shall hold the southwestern counties of <placeName reg="Virginia county">Virginia</placeName>, and those in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> lying adjacent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1277"/>In that section of country arrangements have been instituted by <persName n="Shelby,Major,,,," id="n0117.0013.00087.01022" reg="nearbymention:Shelby,Isaac,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Shelby</surname></persName>, to send forward supplies to this army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1278"/>This is especially important since the loss of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, where operations had been set on foot of a most pomising character.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1279"/>I make no suggestions here as to the alternation of impressment and uniformity of prices on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, or, on the other, of taxation so heavy as to compel the sale of supplies and prevent hoarding either by agriculturists or dealers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1280"/>I have, under existing laws, given my judgment on these points to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretaries of War</rs> and the <name>Treasury</name> heretofore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1281"/>I suppose these matters are now well matured in the minds of those whose business it is to deal with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1282"/>I, however, present my circular of <dateStruct value="1864-09-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> <month reg="09">September</month>, <year>1864</year>,</dateStruct> which could not be made effective by me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1283"/>The arrangements and organization of this bureau are believed to be complete, at least I cannot devise any more effective to glean the whole country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1284"/>I would here suggest that officers of the <quote>tax in kind</quote> be directed to report no district <quote>impracticable</quote> until after conference with the <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Quartermaster">Chief Quartermaster</rs> and <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Commissary">Chief Commissary</rs> of the <rs>State</rs> in which it lies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1285"/>The only substitute for the system of this bureau is the contract system,which is impracticable, when the only competition existing is <num value="1">one</num> between buyers anxious to convert <hi rend="italics">depreciating</hi> currency into <hi rend="italics">appreciating</hi> commodities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1286"/>Moreover, contractors, having no certainty <pb id="p.88" n="88"/>of sufficient transportation, or suitable employees, could not be relied on to fulfil their obligations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1287"/>This bureau system requires agents who are zealous, indefatigable, physically enduring, intelligent; acquainted with the laws and regulations of the bureau, and possessing tact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1288"/>They must have a personal interest in doing well, such as the alternative of serving advantageously, or being conscribed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1289"/>Cripples and feeble men cannot be made to work beyond what their feelings prompt, and exempts, with the requisite qualifications, can do much better for themselves in the employment of individuals, and, if they stay in the service, will not be controlled.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1290"/>This bureau and its officers have been harassed, and their time (and that of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>) consumed in vain in correspondence with the enrolling officers for necessary detailed employees, and in the consideration of applications of captains of companies for the return of their men so detailed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1291"/>If the chief of the bureau cannot be trusted to do all in his power to put men in the field consistently with his duty of feeding the army, then he had better be substituted by some <num value="1">one</num> who can.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1292"/>The ravages of the enemy destroying the fruits of the earth, the appliances for production and stock animals, persisted in by them in order to starve us, and to exclude us from all territory entered by them, is an impediment to subsistence, which I have (from their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> experiment to test our endurance on this point) represented to be fatal, if permitted; but which can always be stopped by that side, when the necessity to check it becomes stronger than the stimulus to the atrocity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1293"/>The worst feature of the condition here is the deficiency of bread stuff, which is due to the failure of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> to enforce firmly a suggestion often made by me, for <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> past, to stop all travel and private freight, and continue that expedient until our supplies were forwarded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1294"/>This was promised by the <rs>Secretary</rs> in <dateStruct value="1864-01-"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, but not tried until <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, when it was eminently successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1295"/>Had this been fully carried out, an accumulation of corn in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, ready for shipment, could have been stored here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1296"/>Repeatedly has this been urged in vain, until now, the connection being broke by <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0117.0013.00088.01023" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, places that supply beyond our reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1297"/>From the beginning of the war this bureau has had a policy in reference to the main principles necessary to effect the objects for which it was created.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1298"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1299"/>It has limited the number of officers to its actual needs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1300"/>As an officer of the <orgName n="Provisional Army" type="misc">Provisional Army</orgName> holds his appointment only while his services are needed, this bureau has claimed that when an officer proved to be unsuitable, he should be declared <quote>relieved from all duty,</quote> and thereby out of commission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1301"/>In this way only can so vast and complex a machinery be managed with the same economy and advantage as the business of a private individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1302"/><pb id="p.89" n="89"/>When excess of officers has occurred, it has been occasioned by appointments made independently of it and by assignments made without its knowledge.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1303"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1304"/>As this war would be necessarily conducted on and along railroad lines, these should be harmonized and kept up to their highest point of efficiency and capacity of repairs in road-bed and rolling stock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1305"/>I therefore proposed a plan and expedients for obtaining this end. This subject requires instant attention.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1306"/><num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1307"/>I have always had (and urged) general principles respecting the rapid conversion of <hi rend="italics">funds</hi> into commodities, to the full extent of appropriation, the faster the better; and that funds should be furnished, if possible, irrespective of their apportionment in the ratio of time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1308"/><num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1309"/>A policy in respect to gathering stores from <hi rend="italics">beyond our lines</hi>, and from exposed outlying districts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1310"/><num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1311"/>I have always maintained trading in cotton with the enemy, or through the enemy's ports, and the necessity of promptly meeting our engagements in cotton, with the liberty to make such contracts as the bureau should think expedient, all based on the supposition of being furnished with ample funds to procure the cotton needed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1312"/>Time, and repeated congressional investigations (on several subjects) have, in every case, vindicated the policy of this bureau.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1313"/>I therefore claim to be competent to speak with information well based, and to affirm that, unless suitable men, unembarrassed by fears of removal (except for inefficiency), ample funds, and (for the present) <hi rend="italics">coin</hi> in sufficient quantity to keep the <orgName n="Army of Virginia" type="army">army of Virginia</orgName> in reeves (which being at present driven from beyond our lines can be obtained by coin alone) are furnished, and the means of transportation from the <rs>South</rs> increased, this bureau cannot perform its functious.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1314"/>And this brings me finally to the inquiry you make as to the ability of a chief of this bureau to effect the purposes for which it was created.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1315"/>I observe, then, that, in my judgment, it cannot be done except under an administration of the other branches of service (whose operations underlie those of this bureau) different from the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1316"/>The treasury must supply <hi rend="italics">funds as needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1317"/>Transportation</hi> must be found, both wagon and rail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1318"/>Over neither of these subjects can this bureau exercise any control except by application to the treasury for the <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi>, and to the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">Quartermaster Department</orgName> for the <hi rend="italics">other</hi>. This latter has its own supplies of forage to gather, and, as controlling transportation, its officers naturally serve that department <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, especially in wagon transportation for hauling in from the country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1319"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> must be a centre of unity to all the subordinate branches of his department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1320"/>Had this been effectively acted on, it is probable that the supplies of this bureau now at the islands would have been brought in.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1321"/>Without the appliances to buy, fabricate and transport, necessary <pb id="p.90" n="90"/>results cannot be achieved, and where those appliances are not furnished in a measure commensurate with requirements the <hi rend="italics">essentials</hi> of food must be <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num></hi> sought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1322"/>And when the means to procure even these are not adequately supplied, then the distribution of that which is procurable must be proportionately restricted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1323"/>I illustrate by stating that the adherence of this bureau (under the embarrassments referred to) to the reduction of the meat ration, notwithstanding the urgent application of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0117.0013.00090.01024" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:46"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, has alone enabled it to furnish meat thus far. And, foreseeing the inevitable deficiency ahead, I asked the <rs>Secretary</rs> <measure n="8months" type="date">eight months</measure> ago to put the bread ration at <measure n="1l." type="pounds"><num value="1">one</num> pound</measure>. He refused, and I did it <hi rend="italics">on my own</hi> responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1324"/>This continued for some months, and <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0117.0013.00090.01025" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:46"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> at length urgently applied for increase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1325"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> also pressed it. I refused unless positively ordered in the face of my declaration that it was absolutely necessary to keep it at that point, without due funds and improved transportation from the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1326"/>On <dateStruct value="-12-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, I recommended the reduction by <rs n="General Order" type="misc">general order</rs>, and he then reluctantly assented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1327"/>Without this proceeding on my part, this army would absolutely have been destitute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1328"/>I mention this fact to exhibit the straits to which this bureau was driven, under the embarrassments referred to above.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1329"/>Very respectfully,</p>

<head>(copy of printed extract from printed circular.)</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1351"/>Xiv. When enacting laws for impressment Congress could not have expected impressing officers as a class to be competent to settle the meaning of the words <quote>value or just compensation,</quote> since jurists and political economists have been unable to determine on a definition or principle of ascertaining the just value of an article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1352"/>Under these circumstances, Congress enacted that commissioners jointly chosen by the <rs>Confederate</rs> and State Executives should at intervals fix the value of commodities, as the best mode of settling what was just compensation, and thus fulfilling the constitutional requirement in cases of impressment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1353"/>The schedules fixed by these boards for the respective States monthly, were objected to by certain parties, and the objection sustained on the ground that value at the time of the impressment could not be determined by rates fixed anteriorly; consequently, in any case of impressment, whether of property in the hands of speculators or producers, the appraisment by neighbors selected by both parties is required, and either party, if not satisfied with the award, can appeal to the joint commissioners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1354"/>In cases where <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of the meat, which a party had secured for the subsistence of those dependent on him, was impressed, in accordance with the law promulgated in <rs n="General Orders 39">General Orders No. 39</rs>, the necessity of promptly supplying him with an equivalent, settled the principle that just compensation required the local cost of the article; and such appraisement by neighbors, mutually selected, was made final, without appeal.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1355"/>Whenever the local appraisement of a man's surplus exceeds the price fixed by the last schedule of the commissioners in the <rs>State</rs> by an amount more than to be understood by any superiority of <pb id="p.92" n="92"/>the special articles to the ordinary standard, and no extraordinary changes in the condition of the country have occurred since the last schedule was fixed, then the impressing officer is advised to to appeal from the local appraisement to the commissioners, as the legally appointed tribunals to settle value, and as, in the order of reason, the most competent, they having been constantly studying the circumstances, which might modify conclusions on this mooted question.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1356"/>When a party refuses to give information to an impressing agent who exhibits his credentials, the officer shall apply to the officer in charge of the nearest reserve organization, who will be required to enable him to examine into the stock of supplies in the possession of the party refusing information.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1357"/>When notice of impressment has been given, and the business is only awaiting settlement, if the holder, instead of retaining it for the <rs>Government</rs>, refuses to deliver it, or disposes of it otherwise, then the same reserve force shall be invoked, and the impressed property seized, or an equal quantity taken from the party on the ground that he has not alienated what was the <rs>Government</rs>'s, but what he considered his own.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1358"/>Officers will proceed to impress all the surplus available as rapidly as they can. * * Bonded agriculturists are as much in the service as they would have been if not conditionally exempted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1359"/>Whenever <num value="1">one</num> of these is found bartering any of his supplies, or selling to any other than the <rs>Government</rs>, or the families of soldiers, or at rates other than those prescribed, or is not strictly devoting his whole attention to the production of supplies, evidence of the fact must be at once furnished to the appropriate enrolling officer, and the name of the party, and the enrolling officer, sent to the <rs type="place">Bureau of Conscription</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1360"/>The <rs type="role" reg="District Attorney">district attorney</rs> shall be furnished with the information preliminary to a prosecution of the offender on his bond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1361"/>Officers will also ascertain from the bonded farmers with whom they deal, the amount of meat they have contracted to deliver, and how much surplus subsistence they have, and see that <num value="0.5">one-half</num> goes to the <rs>Government</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1362"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> will direct that the order to the enrolling officers and commandants of reserves be given; also that directions to the district attorneys be sent to prosecute promptly all who have not fulfilled the terms of their bond.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1363"/>If any man liable to military service, who has not been detailed or exempted from such service for any purpose whatever, is found engaged in speculation in articles of army subsistence, or engaged in any other business prejudicial to the interests of the <rs>Government</rs>, it is your duty, as <num value="1">one</num> of its officers, promptly to report him.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1365"/>So far as this circular treats of impressment &amp;c., and its bearing on the treasury and on this bureau, the subject was brought by me to the attention of <persName n="Trenholm,Mister,,,," id="n0117.0013.00093.01040" reg="mostcommon:Trenholm,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Trenholm</surname></persName>, last summer, and it was urged that Government should make it a subject of instant consideration, that the alternative was then before us of unlimited exaltation of prices and destruction of the currency, or of sustaining the views set forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1366"/>To enforce these, I wrote this circular, showed it to him, and again maintained that the law of impressment being sustained by no penalty, the <rs>Government</rs>, having been entrusted with its execution, had the duty of enforcing it, there being no alternative but to call Congress to act in a matter vital to the currency and the subsistence of the army.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1373"/>Note by the C. G. S.--The very large importation <hi rend="italics">before the war</hi>, into the <rs>South</rs>, of meats, soap and candles, rendered it obvious, in view of a long war, that all of these must be scarce; hence was <pb id="p.94" n="94"/>adopted the saving of grease by every means, and dripping of lye and making soap and candles was instituted at ports and directed in camp when practicable; and in <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct> arrangements to import soap, candles, coffee and tea from abroad were made, and all the sugar possible collected on both sides the <rs>Mississippi</rs> and brought to this side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1374"/>It is due to these arrangements that there has been any supply of these commodities and that the hospitals have been supplied and that the soldiers of the army have had a small allowance of coffee and sugar to help out the diminished ration.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/>The impossibility of private individuals getting barrels excluded the collection of vinegar to any extent from household and private contractors.</p>

<p>From the foregoing you will note that the movement of corn for this department has been large and continued actively during the month of <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, yet I am compelled to announce the surprising and unaccountable fact that, notwithstanding the shipment enumerated, this department has received <hi rend="italics">na corn</hi> from the <rs>South</rs> during the last <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1490"/>This condition of affairs has left us without any supply for the daily wants of the troops in this State, to say nothing of the necessity of reserving flour to be converted into hard bread for active movements during the spring campaign, which, under existing circumstances, is impracticable, as our limited stock of flour on hand will be entirely consumed to meet immediate wants, and with little or no prospect of further accumulations this season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1491"/>Foreseeing from the shortness of the wheat crop of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, that sufficient flour could not be collected for our wants during <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, I addressed you a letter on the <dateStruct value="-09-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> last, in which the need of corn was stated, and showing that a deficiency of nearly <num value="50000">50,000</num> bushels existed between the amount <hi rend="italics">shipped</hi> by <persName n="Allen,Major,,,," id="n0117.0013.00101.01092" reg="nearbymention:Allen,A.,M.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Allen</surname></persName>, at <placeName reg="Columbus, Muscogee, Georgia" key="tgn,7013643">Columbus, Georgia</placeName>, and that <hi rend="italics">received</hi> by <persName n="Claiborne,Major,,,," id="n0117.0013.00101.01093" reg="mostcommon:Claiborne,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Claiborne</surname></persName>, at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 31" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, which up to this time has never been accounted for.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1492"/>Early in <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> I advised you that we were not receiving corn enough for the wants of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0117.0013.00101.01094" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, regardless of other and equally pressing demands upon us for subistence, and stating that there was an ample supply of corn in the country, if it were <hi rend="italics">rendered available</hi>, by reforms in the management of transportation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1493"/>On the <dateStruct value="-12-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> I again addressed you a letter, stating that the receipts of grain in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> were reduced to <hi rend="italics">nothing</hi>, and <pb id="p.102" n="102"/>that we <hi rend="italics">must rely wholy</hi> upon the <rs>South</rs> for our supplies, and recommending that <persName n="Welford,Captain,,,," id="n0117.0013.00102.01095" reg="mostcommon:Welford,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Welford</surname></persName> be sent to <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> to expedite matters, and that the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> give precedence</hi> in transportation to supplies for this department while the emergency existed.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1495"/>On the <dateStruct value="--9"><day reg="9">9th instant</day></dateStruct> I advised you that all the corn arriving here was waybilled to <persName n="Maynard,Major,,,," id="n0117.0013.00102.01097" reg="mostcommon:Maynard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Maynard</surname></persName>, and was being appropriated by the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">Quartermaster Department</orgName> without regard to the marks which indicated that it was destined for the <orgName n="Subsistence department" type="department">Subsistence Department</orgName>, there being no other method under existing regulations of distinguishing it, and on the same date (<dateStruct value="-01-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>) urging that it was of vital importance that there should be an immediate reduction in the number of passenger trains, so that the railroads could give their full capacity to the movement of freight trains, which, if not increased, it seemed to me impossible that our armies in this State could be fed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1496"/>I have been thus particular in giving a partial review of the operations of this department in relation to the collection of breadstuffs, that it might be seen that the difficulties of collecting grain were fully appreciated, and <hi rend="italics">could not be removed</hi> while our railroads failed to transport Government supplies in preference to increasing their receipts by running <num value="2">two</num> passenger trains per day.</p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1515"/>Under the orders of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, I have been charged with the purchase, repairing, compressing and shipment of cotton for the <rs>Government</rs>, the proceeds of said shipment passing into the <name>Treasury</name>, and subject to requisition of the several bureaux and departments of the <rs>Government</rs>, with the purchase and receipt of foreign supplies to be paid for in cotton, and, incidentally, with most of the foreign correspondence of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1516"/>The cotton on hand, and that which may be purchased with <measure n="15000000dollars" type="currency">$15,000,000</measure>, estimated and asked for through the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, together with the usual transfers through the <orgName n="Treasury Department" type="department">Treasury Department</orgName>, <pb id="p.104" n="104"/>and, if required, that to be procured by requisition through the several bureaux of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, will be sufficient to make all purchases of supplies for the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, and shipments for the <orgName n="Treasury Department" type="department">Treasury Department</orgName>, through the blockaded ports.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1517"/>The fall of <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>, and the loss of <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> as a port, will diminish the receipt of supplies and shipment of cotton through the blockaded ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1518"/>The quantity of these supplies and shipments cannot be approximated, because it will depend upon the number of ports held by us and the effectiveness of the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1519"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> has, upon my application, directed the attention of the <rs type="place">Engineer Bureau</rs> to <placeName reg="Georgetown, Georgetown, South Carolina" key="tgn,7014054">Georgetown, South Carolina</placeName>, to see if it can be so protected with guns and works as to secure the safety of vessels entering and departing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1521"/>The matter is of such importance now, I think, as to justify the department in assigning a good engineer officer to the special duty of examining what other ports or inlets may be made available, with power immediately to provide whatever is necessary for the protection of vessels entering them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1522"/>The introduction of supplies, and providing vessels with cotton at such ports and inlets remote from railroads, will require the hearty co-operation of the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">Quartermaster's Department</orgName> in furnishing transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1523"/>With protection to the vessels, and transportation to provide cotton and remove supplies, these ports and inlets will be availed of to the utmost extent, and will, I trust, insure considerable success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1524"/>Within the last few months the question has been much discussed whether cotton should be used across the enemy's lines to procure through their lines coin for the <name>Treasury</name> and supplies for the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1525"/>The question being settled affirmatively, <persName n="Wallis,,John,S.,," id="n0117.0013.00104.01105" reg="default:Wallis,John,S.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Wallis</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, was placed on the general duty within the department of <persName n="Taylor,Lieutenant-General,,,," id="n0117.0013.00104.01106" reg="mostcommon:Taylor,Walter,H.,,:2"><roleName n="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</roleName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>, purchasing all necessary supplies, to be paid for in cotton, and delivering the same to the officers of the various bureaux for distribution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1526"/>Intimations have been recently given of the early delivery of large supplies of meat, shoes, blankets, &amp;c., along the <rs type="place">Atlantic coast</rs>, and in <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, from <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1527"/>I think the trade should be limited to supplies indispensable to the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1528"/>In close connection with the sale of cotton for supplies, the <rs type="role" reg="the Honorable-Secretary of the Treasury">Honorable Secretary of the Treasury</rs> is selling for coin, and there is entire accord and co-operation between the <rs>War</rs> and Treasury Departments in these transactions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/>The cotton required for purchase of supplies can be provided from the sources already named.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1530"/>In conclusion, I beg leave to say that, unless the trade across the enemy's lines is prohibited, I think all general supplies, such as meat, shoes, blankets, &amp;c., can be obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1531"/>Articles specifically contraband under Federal Treasury regulations will have either to be smuggled in through the trade, or introduced by extraordinary inducements along the <rs type="place">Atlantic and Gulf coast</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1656"/>Sir &mdash; In response to your circular of the <dateStruct value="--7"><day reg="7">7th instant</day></dateStruct>, calling for a statement of the means and resources on hand for carrying on the business of this bureau, &amp;c., &amp;c., I have the honor to call your attention to the following papers:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1657"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1658"/>A statement prepared by <persName n="Cole,Major,,,," id="n0117.0017.00113.01204" reg="nearbymention:Cole,A.,H.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Cole</surname></persName>, in reference to the requirements of the service as to <hi rend="italics">field transportation</hi>, and the means necessary for meeting the demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/>This paper shows the great scarcity of horses in the country, and the difficulty of procuring them, together with the measures being adopted for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>The great obstacle at present is the want of funds.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1662"/>A statement from <persName n="Cross,Major,,,," id="n0117.0017.00113.01205" reg="nearbymention:Cross,William,B.,B.,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Cross</surname></persName>, relative to the supply of clothing, present and prospective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1663"/>The difficulties encountered in this branch of the department arise from scarcity of wool, the frequent stopping of the work by ordering away the operatives, and the want of funds.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1664"/><num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1665"/>A communication from <persName n="Sims,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0117.0017.00113.01206" reg="nearbymention:Sims,F.,W.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>Sims</surname></persName>, as to the condition of railroad transportation, the wants of the railroads, &amp;c. The chief difficulties encountered there arise from defective machinery, and the impossibility of supplying new, the want of legislation giving the <rs>Government</rs> proper control over railroads and their employees, and the want of funds to pay the roads so as to keep them in as good condition as the blockade and the limited resources of the country will permit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1666"/>Several special communications on this subject have been addressed by this bureau to the <name>Hon</name>. Secretary of War. At present this department has no <hi rend="italics">control</hi> over railroads except so much as has been yielded by contract or courtesy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>The supply of grain and long forage <hi rend="italics">in the country</hi> is believed to be quite enough to supply the public animals, but no distinct opinion can be hazarded as to the ability of this bureau to supply it <hi rend="italics">to the armies</hi> during the coming campaign, as so much will depend on the relative positions of the different armies, and the preservation or destruction of our lines of transportation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>To sum up, I venture to state that this bureau can conduct its operations with success enough to sustain our armies, if labor is <pb id="p.114" n="114"/>allowed to the various work shops on which it depends, without interruption, if the privilege of detailing contractors under certain circumstances be continued, and the necessary funds are promptly furnished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1669"/>Without these this department is powerless, and the want of them is fast paralyzing its efforts.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1673"/>Sir &mdash; The urgent request of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0117.0017.00114.01209" reg="nearbymention:Lee,G.,W.,C.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, made to me in person, and that of his <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Quartermaster">Chief Quartermaster</rs>, to be prepared to equip his artillery and transportation with horses, added to the calls made upon me for the same supplies for armies South, induces me to address you this communication, in which I desire to recapitulate what I have before at different times, in writing and verbally, had the honor to submit to you, on the subject of the number of animals needed to equip our armies for the spring campaign, and the source from which such supplies are to be obtained.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1674"/>As the officer charged with the providing of horses and mules for the armies of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, I feel it to be due to myself for the record to show, that I have taken all necessary steps to a proper discharge of my duty, to ascertain the resources of the country, and to suggest plans by which deficiencies may be supplied, and that, should the demand made on me not be met, and any damage result from such failure, I may be exculpated from blame, by reference to my official communications.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/>The inability of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> east of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> to sustain the draft which would be made for horses and mules for the coming campaign, was discussed and announced by me in <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> last, when I was procuring such supplies for <orgName n="army"><persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0117.0017.00114.01210" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1676"/>The number estimated by me at that time to be necessary must be largely increased, by reason of the losses sustained in <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n0117.0017.00114.01211" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s campaign in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1677"/>In <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> last I dispatched an officer to <persName n="Smith,General,E.,K.,," id="n0117.0017.00114.01212" reg="default:Smith,E.,K.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>K.</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, Commanding Department of the <name>Trans</name>-<placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, with letters to him announcing our necessities, and urging him to send us a portion of the animals which he was reported to have captured from the <rs>Federal</rs> army, and asking that funds might be furnished, and permission granted to my officer, charged with the business, to go into <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, and procure animals, to be sent over this side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1678"/>In both I was disappointed, and in <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> following I suggested the plan, since adopted and sought to be executed, of procuring a large number of animals from <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1679"/>Owing to the delays in procuring the funds, and from the fact that no <num value="1">one</num> has yet been selected to proceed to <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> in charge of the operations to be undertaken, we <pb id="p.115" n="115"/>cannot expect to receive a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instalment from <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> under <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure>, and even should <persName n="Smith,General,,,," id="n0117.0017.00115.01213" reg="nearbymention:Smith,E.,K.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> consent to furnish us any out of his supply (which I have again asked him for) we cannot receive them before about the middle of <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, and to obtain any at all now within the period named, a proper officer must be in <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> to conduct business.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1680"/>I have also proposed that I shall be provided with means and authority to procure supplies and animals from the enemy's lines, which I have every reason to feel assured can be done to a large extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1681"/>I am informed by my officers, certainly reliable, that horses and mules can be obtained deliverable in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, payable in cotton on the following terms, viz: <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class artillery horses for <measure n="600l." type="pounds"><num value="600">600</num> pounds</measure> of cotton; <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> class artillery for <measure n="500l." type="pounds"><num value="500">500</num> pounds</measure>; and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> class for <measure n="400l." type="pounds"><num value="400">400</num> pounds</measure>; but to do this, my officers must have the cotton in hand so as to receive the animals and deliver the cotton at such times and places as opportunity offers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1682"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> the prices asked, payable in gold, are for <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class <measure n="60dollars" type="currency">$60</measure>, and it is thought that <num value="2000">two thousand</num> can be obtained in that way. The number that can be obtained in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> in a space of <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> is put down at (<num value="2000">2,000</num>) <num value="2000">two thousand</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1683"/>I have before informed you, that according to my information, there will be needed for the armies of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> at least <num value="6000">six thousand</num> horses, and <num value="4500">four thousand five hundred</num> mules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1684"/>The number to be procured in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> east of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> by impressment depends on the decision which may be made, as to the quantity of animals the farmers will be allowed to keep, as essential to their operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1685"/>I estimate the supply to be obtained from all sources (provided I am furnished means) not to exceed (<num value="5000">5,000</num>) <num value="5000">five thousand</num> animals on this side of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1686"/>This leaves a deficit of (<num value="5500">5,500</num>) <num value="5500">five thousand five hundred</num> to fill my estimate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1687"/>If the horses are not supplied, the military operations are checked and may be frustrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1688"/>If the farmers are stripped of a portion of the animals essential to the conduct of their agricultural operations, there must be a corresponding reduction of supplies of food for man and horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1689"/>Convinced, as I am, that the best and only means of procuring the needed supply of animals are those that I have indicated, feeling deeply the pressure of the demands made and to be made on me to furnish such supplies, dreading the consequences of a failure to meet such calls, and fearing that I may be exposed to censure for such failure, I respectfully urge that I may be immediately put in possession of the necessary means to carry into effect the plans for providing the necessary animals, than which I confess myself unable to suggest any other; or that, in case it shall be decided that my plans are impracticable, and the means I ask for cannot be furnished, that I may be relieved from the duty I am now performing, and some <num value="1">one</num> be appointed in my stead, who can dispense with what I consider, and have stated to be indispensable, to enable me to successfully perform the duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1690"/><pb id="p.116" n="116"/></p> 
<p>I think it proper to again repeat what I have before asked to have done, in order to secure the needed supplies:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1691"/><hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num></hi>. With respect to the operations in <placeName reg="Mexico" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> and <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, I estimated that the sum of <measure n="350000l." type="pounds">&pound; <num value="350000">350,000</num></measure> in sterling or gold turned over to me, say at the rate of <measure n="100000l." type="pounds">&pound; <num value="100000">100,000</num></measure> per quarter, would enabled me to obtain about (<num value="15000">15,000</num>) <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> animals at the rate of about <measure n="60dollars" type="currency">$60</measure> per head.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1692"/>I was informed by you that this amount would be furnished by the <name>Treasury</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1693"/>I received letters of credit for <measure n="50000l." type="pounds">&pound; <num value="50000">50,000</num></measure>, and sent it to <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> by <persName n="Harris,Major,W.,S.,," id="n0117.0017.00116.01214" reg="default:Harris,W.,S.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Harris</surname></persName>, and further amounts are now required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1694"/>An officer to control and manage the business is wanted, <num value="1">one</num> possessing the qualifications which I had the honor to state I deemed requisite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1695"/>No <num value="1">one</num> has been yet assigned to the duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1696"/>Nothing can be done until such officer arrives in <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1697"/><hi rend="italics"><num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num></hi>. The purchase of horses and mules to be delivered in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> from the enemy's lines to be successful, must be conducted on this simple plan: The officer who receives the horses must have in his hands the cotton to make instant payment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1698"/>It must be at suitable points for being carried off easily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1699"/>He must not be trammelled by officers of other branches of the service, and so situated as to be able to fulfill his engagements promptly and surely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1700"/>If he is to get his cotton paid through treasury agents (and not allowed to purchase it himself), and be governed by them as to the price he is to pay for horses, I fear he will fail to carry out the object.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1701"/><hi rend="italics"><num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num></hi>. To obtain horses in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, gold or Federal money is essential.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1702"/>They can be purchased for gold at rates below those prevailing before the war. This is not the case with other articles of military supply in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> obtained from abroad by the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1703"/>I am induced to believe that <num value="2000">two thousand</num> horses can be had in a short space of time along the lines of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> from the enemy's lines, if money can be supplied, and at prices, perhaps, not greater than we expect to pay in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1704"/>I beg leave respectfully to request that I may be officialy informed as soon as practicable of the decision in reference to the beforementioned subjects, in order that I may be enabled to give <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0117.0017.00116.01215" reg="nearbymention:Lee,G.,W.,C.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> an exact statement, showing to what extent he can rely on this office for the animals deemed necessary to place his army on a footing for active service in the spring.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1709"/>Sir &mdash; I submit herewith, in response to your recent call, a report which shows the issues within the past <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> to the armies in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1710"/>A little delay has occurred, awaiting the receipt of reports of issues, due from distant points in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1711"/>The report shows the issues to <orgName n="command"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0117.0017.00117.01219" reg="nearbymention:Lee,G.,W.,C.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s command</orgName> from <dateStruct value="-07-1"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="1">1st</day></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="-01-21"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg="21">21st</day></dateStruct>, and to other commands from <dateStruct value="-07-1"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="1">1st</day></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="-01-21"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg="21">21st</day></dateStruct>, except that the report of issues for the <name>Departments</name> of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> and <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Louisiana</placeName> are still due for the month of <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1712"/>I was gratified that information now given was asked, for the impression is so common that our armies are poorly provided for, that I gladly avail of an opportunity to show what has been done.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1713"/>I enclose also a copy of <rs n="General Orders 100">General Orders No. 100</rs>, which regulates the allowance of clothing yearly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1714"/>This table of supply, adopted from the old service, was made with reference to abundant resources, and doubtless shows what will answer the necessities of a soldier with fair economy and management.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1715"/>This Department has never aimed to limit its issues to this standard, especially in regard to jackets and pants, but has endeavored to provide a suit of clothing every <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> for each man. When it is considered that the issues now reported are field issues proper, and exclusive of issues to men in hospitals, of issues to men on furlough, of issues to detailed men at posts, of issues to paroled and exchanged men, of issues to retired men, and of all last issues whatever, it will be found, I think, that with the exception of overcoats, which have not been made up, owing to the great consumption of woolen material for jackets and pants, and the item of flannel undershirts, but partially supplied, the armies have been fully supplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1716"/>I do not hesitate to say that in some instances there has been extravagance, and moreover, that much of the individual want that strikes the eye is due to the improvidence of the soldiers, who too often dispose, by sale and barter, of what they have received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1717"/>It is proper to add that this report includes but a portion of the issues made by the <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">State of North Carolina</placeName> to her troops, and no other State issues whatever, although it is known that other States have contributed liberally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1718"/><placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, for instance, has issued within the past year as follows: <num value="26795">26,795</num> jackets, <num value="28808">28,808</num> pairs of pants, <num value="37657">37,657</num> pairs of shoes, <num value="7504">7,504</num> blankets, <num value="24952">24,952</num> shirts, <num value="24168">24,168</num> pairs of drawers and <num value="23024">23,024</num> pairs of socks, but as the apportionment thereof between the various armies does not appear, these issues are not noted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1719"/>Add to all the issues made by numerous relief associations and through individual contributions, and it will show that in the past we have at least needed an economical expenditure and proper distribution of supplies, more than anything else, to secure the comfort and efficiency of our armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1720"/>The issues of shirts, drawers, socks and caps may in some instances appear light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1721"/>This is due to the fact that in previous quarters, through the abundance of these articles, the troops have been fully supplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1722"/>It has always been understood that all calls for these articles could be <pb id="p.118" n="118"/>responded to, and of some there is still a large supply on hand; for instance, in the depot at this point, over <num value="100000">100,000</num> pairs of socks and <num value="25000">25,000</num> pairs of drawers, besides excesses elsewhere.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1723"/>In connection n with the table of supply referred to, I will remark that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year is reckoned to commence from <dateStruct value="1862-10-"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, when communication was abolished, so that now we are in the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> year.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1724"/>I will also add, as supplemental to the report recently made in regard to the sale of cloth, that the <rs>Department Officer</rs> at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1725"/><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, has disposed of <measure n="7000yards" type="distance">7,000 yards</measure> single width, and that <num value="1000">1,000</num> suits are now being made up here for the officers of <orgName n="command"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0117.0017.00118.01220" reg="nearbymention:Lee,G.,W.,C.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1726"/>This, with what has already been reported, shows that provision has been made for <num value="6000">six thousand</num> officers within the past <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>.</p>

<head>Memorandum of resources of Department &mdash; clothing, camp equipment, and miscellaneous stores.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1730"/><num value="1">1</num>. The enclosed report will show what has been furnished the armies of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> in the way of clothing within the past <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>. The issues show a fair provision in all articles save overcoats and flannel jackets, and in some instances an extravagant consumption of supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1731"/>The condition of the troops in connection with the issues made suggests, either an imperfect distribution of supplies, or waste on the part of the individual soldier, or it may be both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1732"/>The latter is known to prevail to an extent that makes it a great abuse.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1733"/><num value="2">2</num>. As to the future, the greatest difficulty will be to provide the raw material &mdash; wool and leather, the former especially.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1734"/>The manufacturing facilities are ample.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1735"/>Efforts are being made to supply the deficiency of wool from the <placeName reg="Trans-Mississippi">Trans-Mississippi</placeName> region, where it is abundant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1736"/>Some deliveries have recently been made on this side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1737"/>The wool is worked up as rapidly as had. By using cotton clothing during the <rs type="season">summer</rs> and <rs type="season">spring</rs>, and reserving the <rs n="woolen goods" type="product">woolen goods</rs> for <rs type="season">fall</rs> and <rs type="season">winter</rs>, it is hoped and believed that enough may be had to prevent suffering next winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1738"/>We will get through this season without much trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1739"/>There is a fair supply of leather, or hides in the vats, and a moderate supply of shoes on hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1740"/>The <hi rend="italics">blankets</hi> now in the hands of the men must-be turned in in the spring for reissue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1741"/>As there is not in the entire Confederacy a single establishment that makes them, machinery has been ordered from abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1742"/>The supply of cotton clothing has heretofore been abundant, and is now ample.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1743"/>There will be no difficulty hereafter on this head, at least so long as the railroad connections can be relied on to make the raw material of <num value="1">one</num> section available in another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1744"/>It is now very hard to keep the factories in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> even partially supplied with cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1745"/><pb id="p.119" n="119"/></p> 
<p>To accomplish anything, however, it is really indispensable that some relief be extended, and that promptly, as follows:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1746"/><num value="1">1</num>. <hi rend="italics">Money</hi> or some equivalent must be had to keep the machinery of the department going.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1747"/>Arrearages especially should be provided for. For instance, over <measure n="5000000dollars" type="currency">$5,000,000</measure> is now due to the factory interest alone for goods long since delivered and expended, and that, too, after a liberal use of call certificates, non-taxable bonds, and even the raw material, cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1748"/>All the factories are under contract to deliver at fair prices <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of their production.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1749"/>They all work under a uniform system, <num value="1">one</num> built up with care and labor, and with a result perfectly satisfactory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1750"/>The whole, unfortunately, is about to crumble in for want of funds; the factories being without the means to meet current expenditures, even at times to pay taxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/>Their only relief is, to put their production upon the market, and the department is in no position to complain of the loss of material.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1752"/><num value="2">2</num>. If money can be supplied, then the system of barter, now almost universal, should be checked, or at least placed under restrictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1753"/>The necessities of the <rs type="place">Subsistence Bureau</rs> have compelled with it a free resort to barter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1754"/>The <rs type="place">Mining and Nitre Bureau</rs> has also gone largely into it. In <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, especially, this has been done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1755"/>Material necessary for the manufacture of clothing for the army has been directed from its legitimate use. Thus cotton is expended here when the factories have stopped work for the want of same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1756"/><rs n="cotton yarns" type="product">Cotton yarns</rs> are made way with, when wanted for army socks, and also shirtings and osnaburgs needed for clothing and forage sacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1757"/>The <rs type="place">Subsistence Bureau</rs> has now some <measure n="150barrels" type="mass">150 bales</measure> of osnaburgs stored here to be used in barter, and this Department is without a single yard of material to make into shirts or drawers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0117.0017.00119.01223" reg="nearbymention:Lee,G.,W.,C.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> represents his army to be in want of underclothing, and a call has recently been made for <num value="12000">12,000</num> shirts, which, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, could not be sent forward promptly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>That illustrates strongly the drawbacks resulting from an attempt to relieve the necessities of <num value="1">one</num> branch of the service by diverting irregularly material due to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>If barter must continue, cannot it be restricted, and as far as possible articles like tobacco used in lieu of what goes to make up essential military supplies?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>The Department has struggled on successfully in the past, notwithstanding this serious difficulty, but some relief is needed for the future.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/>In the same way hides of beeves slaughtered by commissaries are made way with, though due to this Department under general orders, and absolutely essential to the continued supply of shoes to the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/>The practice of purchasing beeves with the obligation to return the hides to the seller should be discontinued.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/><num value="3">3</num>. Some protection similar to that given to the factory operatives by <rs n="Special Order 310">Special Order No. 310</rs>, paragraph <num value="32">XXXII</num>, should be extended to the detailed men of mechanical skill employed in the established work-shops of the <name>Department</name>, so as to guard against unnecessary interruptions, and cause great loss of supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1765"/>With some relief <pb id="p.120" n="120"/>in these particulars, to develop home resources, and such aid as may be looked for from abroad, through contracts encouraging individual enterprize, a reasonable confidence is felt that a sufficiency of army clothing can be provided, at least for the present year.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>These remarks apply equally to camp equipage and miscellaneous stores.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1770"/>General &mdash; In making the report you ordered, upon the condition and wants in regard to transportation by railroad, it may not be improper to call your attention to the cause of the difficulties which have always attended it with increasing force as this city is approached.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1771"/>In <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, where transportation bears the most heavily because of its increasing volume as you approach <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 31" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, the roads are the least able to bear it. They were constructed and equipped to transport that great stream of travel between the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>; and with no expectation of a heavy freighting business, prepared themselves with such machinery as was adapted to carrying a light train very rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1772"/>So long as the army could draw supplies from any quarter, and the lines running south as far as <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7013584" n="1.000 5" reg="charlotte, mecklenburg, north carolina">Charlotte</placeName>, were called on only to transport men, the work was performed promptly and well, but when supplies failed in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> had to furnish them, an immense business was at once created upon those lines, which they were unprepared to meet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1773"/>Their engines were light and few in number, and their cars the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1774"/>Had the gauge of the tracks south suited, machinery might have been drawn from there; but this not being so, we have had to struggle against a heavy business with inadequate means of performing it. Under these circumstances any machinery will depreciate; it is overworked and not well attended to, and must inevitably grow less reliable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1775"/>New cars are being built, though the difficulties encountered retard the progress very much, but new engines cannot be manufactured in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1776"/>It becomes all important, then, that those we have should be preserved in good repair, and here we meet the really great difficulties arising from the scarcity of mechanics and materials.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1777"/>The hardships of the war, and the fear of conscription, have induced many of this class to leave the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; most of them were natives of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1778"/>Feeling but little or no interest in our country or cause, they are generally of a roving and reckless character, forming attachments to places but rarely, and impatient of restraint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1779"/>Many of them enlisted and have been killed, so that the number in the country has been constantly decreasing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1780"/>This deficiency cannot be supplied as in ordinary times by the instruction of apprentices, because the conscript law takes them for the army just at the period when they are learning to be useful, nor can they be induced to come from abroad at the present pay, and with the fear of the army before them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1781"/>To the want of mechanics is to be added the want of materials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1782"/>Not a single bar of <rs n="railroad iron" type="product">railroad iron</rs> has been rolled in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> since the war, nor can we hope to do any better during its continuance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1783"/>The main lines will be kept up by despoiling the side lines, but if our lines should expand and the rails and machinery be taken away by the enemy, we could not replace them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1784"/>But <pb id="p.122" n="122"/>without discussing the supply of rails, which is in the hands of a special commission, there are many articles of iron which cannot be had because of its scarcity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1785"/>Aside from iron there are copper, pig tin, <rs n="steam gauges" type="product">steam gauges</rs>, <rs n="cast steel" type="product">cast steel</rs>, files, &amp;c., &amp;c., without which it is impossible to maintain engines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1786"/>They are as necessary as iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1787"/>Heretofore a small supply has been had through <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>, but with that port closed, we are cut off entirely, except by trading with the enemy, and paying in cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1788"/>With plenty of mechanics and material, the machinery now in use could be improved, and there would be a corresponding improvement in transportation; but it should be borne in mind, that as machinery grows older it takes more work to keep it in efficient condition, and therefore the same men and material now do not accomplish so much as at the commencement of the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1789"/>Your earnest attention is called to the entire absence of responsibility of railroad officers to any military authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1790"/>It is true, there is a kind of moral influence exercised over them, rather from some undefined idea that the hand of Government can reach them, than from any other cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1791"/>The public, and indeed most of the officers, are under the impression that your bureau has supreme power over all the railroads and trains in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and had but to order them at your will to any point you desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1792"/>As to the men, they are exempt and enjoy almost entire immunity from the ordinary means of punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1793"/>The only attempt yet made to render the railroads amenable to some authority, has resulted in a law so full of loop-holes that it is inoperative.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1794"/>These are the main reasons why our railroad transportation is already deficient, and daily depreciating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1795"/>Efforts are being made to purchase material, but success is quite uncertain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1796"/>At present the want is not so serious as the want of mechanics, though it may become so if the materials are not obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1797"/>It may not be out of place to mention that notwithstanding the scarcity and value of this kind of transportation, it receives but little protection or security from our armies, which seems strange when not only their comfort but their safety depends on its efficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/>As cases in point, and of recent date, is the loss of cars and engines at <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,2023070" n="1.000 14" reg="griswoldville, jones, georgia">Griswoldville</placeName>, <persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n0117.0017.00122.01228" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,John,B.,,:2"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, footing up probably <num value="25">twenty-five</num> engines and <num value="400">four hundred</num> cars, or an equipment greater than we now have to work the <orgName n="Richmond and Danville Railroad" type="railroad">Richmond and Danville Railroad</orgName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>Sir &mdash; In reply to the circular of the <dateStruct value="--7"><day reg="7">7th instant</day></dateStruct>, from your office, I have the honor to submit the following report:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>By recent instructions, the <rs>Superintendent</rs> of Conscription has (on the authority of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>) directed that all disabled men detailed from the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>, should be returned for such duty as they may be able to perform in the field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>Objections cannot reasonably be made to this, provided the men not found equal to any duty in the field be returned to the same hospital from which they have been taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1849"/>But by <rs n="Circular 35">Circular No. 35</rs>, <pb id="p.126" n="126"/>of <dateStruct value="1864-12-02"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="2">2</day>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, from the <rs type="place">Bureau of Conscription</rs>, generals of reserves are directed (on the authority of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>) to organize for certain local service <quote>all men found for light duty and not otherwise assigned and actually employed,</quote> which deprives the <orgName n="Medical Department" type="department">Medical Department</orgName> of the opportunity to replace with conscripts found for light duty the detailed men relieved in the manner above stated, or to fill the requirements arising from time to time for hospital attendants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1850"/>The hospitals cannot be properly conducted without a liberal allowance of white male attendants, and it is recommended that <rs n="Circular 35">Circular No. 35</rs>, of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, from the <rs type="place">Bureau of Conscription</rs>, be modified so as to permit either conscripts found for light duty, or reserves over <measure n="45years" type="date">forty-five years</measure> of age, to be assigned as hospital attendants.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1851"/>Under the authority of law (embodied in <rs n="General Orders 69">General Orders No. 69</rs>, of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, and <num value="25">No. 25</num>, of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>), soldiers sick or wounded, and likely to remain unfit for military duty for <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure>, are furloughed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1852"/>It is undoubtedly humane to furlough these men, but the practice is wholly inconsistent with preserving and maintaining an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1853"/>Many of the men are lost sight of, and never return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1854"/>It is recommended that the law be repealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/>Furloughs should only be authorized by orders to be granted as circumstances may demand.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>Foreseeing the many and great difficulties to be encountered in procuring medical supplies from foreign countries through the blockade, attention was given at an early day to the establishment of medical laboratories, and the manufacture of medicines at <placeName reg="Lincolnton, Lincoln, North Carolina" key="tgn,2075467">Lincolnton, North Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Charlotte, Mecklenburg, North Carolina" key="tgn,7013584">Charlotte, North Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia, South Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName> and <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta, Georgia</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> and <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery, Alabama</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/>While these laboratories have been engaged more especially in the manufacture of medicines, heretofore universally procured from abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1858"/>great attention has been given to the manufacture of indigenous remedies, which are now administered by medical officers, in lieu of medicines of foreign origin, with favorable results.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/>In the beginning of the war, the <name>Department</name> was compelled to depend entirely upon purchasing agents, and contracts awarded to individuals for a supply of hospital furniture, bedding, &amp;c., and which contracts in a majority of cases were never filled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>It was then determined to assume direct control of the manufacture of these articles, and artisans were detailed from the ranks of the army, and, when practicable, disabled soldiers were employed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1861"/>These employees of the laboratories, purveying depots and distilleries, are in a great measure expert chemists, druggists and distillers and men of professional skill, whose services are absolutely indispensable for the manufacture of medicines, hospital furniture and alcoholic stimulants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1862"/>It is therefore hoped that the <rs type="role" reg="the Honorable-Secretary">Honorable Secretary</rs> will see the necessity of these men being permanently attached to the <orgName n="Medical Department" type="department">Medical Department</orgName>, as the practice of constantly changing these employees is productive of delay and embarrassment to the <name>Department</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1863"/>It is also important that they should be <pb id="p.127" n="127"/>exempt from all military duty, for if called out in an emergency, when the <name>Purveyor</name> is called on to fill requisitions for the wounded, it is evident that suffering must ensue in consequence of their absence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1864"/>Medical supplies can only be prepared and put up by skilled druggists.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1865"/>For the supply of alcoholic stimulants, the <name>Department</name> has been until recently dependent upon contracts with individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1866"/>It. was ascertained that this mode of supply was susceptible of gross fraud, for although expressly forbidden by the terms of. the contract, the contractors not only manufactured an excess over the quantity called for by the contract, but frequently manufactured so indifferent and spurious an article that the <name>Department</name> was obliged to reject it, thus leaving large quantities of whisky in their hands, which they readily disposed of at prices largely in advance of Government rates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1867"/>At the suggestion of this bureau.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/>Congress at its last session granted authority to the <rs type="role" reg="Surgeon General">Surgeon-General</rs> to establish distilleries for the manufacture of alcoholic stimulants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>Accordingly they have been established at <placeName reg="Salisbury, Rowan, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076487">Salisbury, North Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia, South Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon, Georgia</placeName>, and in <placeName reg="Wilcox, Alabama, United States" key="tgn,2000065">Wilcox county, Alabama</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1870"/>The distilleries at <placeName reg="Salisbury, Rowan, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076487">Salisbury</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7013641" n="1.000 6" reg="columbia, richland, south carolina">Columbia</placeName> are manufacturing from <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="500">five hundred</num> gallons each of whisky and alcohol per day.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>A large portion of the grain consumed by these distilleries is rendered useless for other purposes, being damaged in transportation or from insecure storage, and turned over by the <name>Quartermasters</name> to this Department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1872"/><num value="1000">Thousands</num> of bushels of grain are thus saved to the <rs>Government</rs> and made available for army purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1874"/>It is contemplated to make similar arrangements with the <rs type="role" reg="Quartermaster-General">Quartermaster-General</rs> to supply the distilleries in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, so soon as they are ready to commence operations, and it is recommended that instructions be given that officer to furnish the necessary grain when notified by the <rs type="role" reg="Surgeon General">Surgeon-General</rs> that he is ready to receive it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1875"/>The late <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> gave orders to the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">Quartermaster's department</orgName> to furnish all the bureaux of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> with cotton goods sufficient to supply their wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1876"/>Estimates were accordingly forwarded to the <rs type="role" reg="Quartermaster-General">Quartermaster-General</rs> by this bureau, but as yet not a yard has been furnished, and there seems to be no probability of obtaining a supply from this source.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1877"/>Arrangements are now being perfected with a company in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> to sell to the <orgName n="Medical Department" type="department">Medical Department</orgName>, on liberal terms, the entire product of their factory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1878"/>There is another subject of great importance, to which the attention <pb id="p.128" n="128"/>of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> is earnestly invited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1879"/>The sick and wounded in the large hospitals in or about the city, and at certain other places, are now subjected to intense suffering, in consequence of the failure of the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">Quartermaster's Department</orgName> to furnish fuel.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1881"/>The Quartermaster declined to permit this arrangement to continue, and each winter since this hospital has been inadequately supplied.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1882"/>The surgeon in charge of <placeName reg="Jackson hospital">Jackson hospital</placeName> has the offer of a contract for wood to be supplied the hospital; the <rs>Quartermaster</rs> refused to make the contract, stating that he had made ample provision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1883"/>At <placeName reg="Winder hospital">Winder hospital</placeName> the surgeon in charge during the past <rs type="season">summer</rs> or <rs type="season">fall</rs> offered, if he was provided with a small number of teams (<num value="2">two</num>), to supply his own fuel; the <rs>Quartermaster</rs> refused, asserting that he could supply the hospital with the wood required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1884"/>These cases are mentioned to show that the fuel could have been provided.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1885"/>A serious difficulty in conducting the hospitals arises from the failure of the <orgName n="Commissary Department" type="department">Commissary Department</orgName> to furnish the hospital funds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1886"/>Very general complaint has been made on this subject-<num value="1">one</num> of importance, as without the hospital fund, it is impossible to supply the sick and wounded with the necessary supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1887"/>The hospitals have also been embarrassed by the non-payment of the hospital attendants by the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">Quartermaster's Department</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1888"/>Attention has been given recently to the importation of supplies through our lines on the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName>, and the gulf border of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> and <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1889"/>Cotton is exchanged for medical supplies, and in consequence of the recent disaster at <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>, it is believed that this trade will constitute the chief source of supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1890"/>This Department has obtained medicines in this manner through the energy of <persName n="Potts,Surgeon,Richard,,," id="n0117.0017.00128.01234" reg="default:Potts,Richard,,,"><roleName n="Surgeon">Surgeon</roleName> <foreName>Richard</foreName> <surname>Potts</surname></persName>, who has had exclusive control of the importation of such articles as are most needed, until recent orders from the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, taking entire control of transactions of this nature, has impaired his usefulness, and put a stop in a measure to the supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1891"/>The <rs type="role" reg="the Honorable-Secretary">Honorable Secretary</rs>'s attention is earnestly invited to the necessity of allowing <persName n="Potts,Surgeon,,,," id="n0117.0017.00128.01235" reg="nearbymention:Potts,Richard,,,"><roleName n="Surgeon">Surgeon</roleName> <surname>Potts</surname></persName> (located at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery, Alabama</placeName>), ample means for obtaining medical supplies in the manner indicated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/>The department has on hand, of some articles, a <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> supply, of others a limited supply, but if allowed to retain its skilled employees at the various laboratories, purveying depots and distilleries, and to import medicines freely through our lines in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> and <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, no fear need be entertained that the sick and wounded of the army will suffer for the want of any of the essential articles of the supply table.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1899"/>The volunteer of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> made extensive preparations for the field.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1904"/>Then over all was a huge overcoat, long and heavy, with a cape reaching nearly to the waist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1931"/>They were heavy and irksome, and when the heels were worn a little onesided, the wearer would find his ankle twisted nearly out of joint by every unevenness of the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1932"/>When thoroughly wet, it was a laborious undertaking to get them off, and worse to get them on in time to answer the morning roll-call.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1933"/>And so good, strong, broad-bottomed and big flat heeled brogues or brogans succeeded the boots, and were found much more comfortable and agreeable, easier put on and off, and altogether the most sensible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1934"/>A short waisted, single breasted jacket usurped the place of the long tail coat, and became universal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1935"/>The enemy noticed this peculiarity, and called the <rs>Confederates</rs> gray jackets, which name was immediately transferred to those lively creatures, which were the constant admirers and inseparable companions of the <name>Boys</name> in <persName n="Gray,,,,," id="n0117.0018.00131.01241" reg="mostcommon:Gray,nomatch:0"><surname>Gray</surname></persName> and Blue.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1936"/>Caps were destined to hold out longer than some other uncomfortable things, but they finally yielded to the demands of comfort and common sense, and a good soft felt hat was worn instead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1937"/>A man who has never been a soldier does not know, nor indeed can know, the amount of comfort there is in a good soft hat in camp, and now utterly useless is a <quote>soldier hat</quote> as they are generally made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1938"/>Why the <name>Prussians</name>, with all their experience, <pb id="p.132" n="132"/>wear their heavy, unyielding helmets, and the <rs>French</rs> their little caps, is a mystery to a Confederate who has enjoyed the comfort of an old slouch.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1939"/>Overcoats an inexperienced man would think an absolute necessity for men exposed to the rigors of a <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Virginia</placeName> winter, but they grew scarcer and scarcer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1940"/>They were found a great inconvenience and burden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1941"/>The men came to the conclusion that the trouble of carrying them hot days outweighed the comfort of having them when the cold day arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1942"/>Besides they found that life in the open air hardened them to such an extent, that the changes in the temperature were not felt to any degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1943"/>Some clung to their overcoats to the last, but the majority got tired lugging them around, and either discarded them altogether, or trusted to capturing <num value="1">one</num> about the time it would be needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1944"/>Nearly every overcoat in the army in the latter years was <num value="1">one</num> of <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Sam</foreName></persName>'s, captured from his boys.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1945"/>The knapsack vanished early in the struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1946"/>It was found that it was inconvenient to <quote>change</quote> the underwear too often, and the disposition not to change grew, as the knapsack was found to gall the back and shoulders, and weary the man before half the march was accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1947"/>It was found that the better way was to dress out and out, and wear that outfit until the enemy's knapsacks or the folks at home supplied a change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1948"/>Certainly it did not pay to carry around clean clothes while waiting for the time to use them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1949"/>Very little washing was done, as a matter of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1950"/>Clothes once given up were parted with forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1951"/>There were good reasons for this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1952"/>Cold water would not cleanse them or destroy the vermin, and hot water was not always to be had. <num value="1">One</num> blanket to each man was found to be as much as could be carried, and amply sufficient for the severest weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1953"/>This was carried generally by rolling it lengthwise, with the rubber cloth outside, tying the ends of the roll together, and throwing the loop thus made over the left shoulder with the ends fastened together hanging under the right arm.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1954"/>The haversack held its own to the last, and was found practical and useful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1955"/>It very seldom, however, contained rations, but was used to carry all the articles generally carried in the knapsack; of course the stock was small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1956"/>Somehow or other, many men managed to do without the haversack, and carried absolutely nothing but what they wore and had in their pockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1957"/>The infantry threw away their heavy cap-boxes and cartridge-boxes, and carried <pb id="p.133" n="133"/>their caps and cartridges in their pockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1958"/>Canteens were very useful at times, but they were as a general thing discarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1959"/>They were not much used to carry water, but were found useful when the men were driven to the necessity of foraging, for conveying buttermilk, cider, sorghum, &amp;c., to camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1960"/>A good strong tin cup was found better than a canteen, as it was easier to fill at a well or spring, and was serviceable as a boiler for making coffee when the column halted for the night.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1961"/>Revolvers were found to be about as useless and heavy lumber as a private soldier could carry, and early in the war were sent home to be used by the women and children in protecting themselves from insult and violence at the hands of the ruffians who prowled about the country shirking duty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1962"/>Strong cotton was adopted in place of flannel and merino, for <num value="2">two</num> reasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1963"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, because easier to wash, and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, because the vermin did not propagate so rapidly in cotton as in wool.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1964"/>Common white cotton shirts and drawers proved the best that could be used by the private soldier.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1965"/>Gloves to any but a mounted man were found useless, worse than useless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1966"/>With the gloves on, it was impossible to handle an axe well, or buckle harness, or load a musket, or handle a rammer at the piece.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1967"/>Wearing them was found to be simply a habit, and so, on the principle that the less luggage the less labor, <hi rend="italics">they</hi> were discarded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1968"/>The camp-chest soon vanished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1969"/>The Brigadiers and <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-Generals</rs> even found them too troublesome, and soon they were left entirely to the quartermasters and commissaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1970"/><num value="1">One</num> skillet and a couple of frying pans, a bag for flour or meal, another bag for salt, sugar and coffee, divided by a knot tied between, served the purpose as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1971"/>The skillet passed from mess to mess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1972"/>Each mess generally owned a frying pan, but often <num value="1">one</num> served a company.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1973"/>The oilcloth was found to be as good as the wooden tray for making up the dough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1974"/>The water bucket held its own to the last!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1975"/>Tents were <hi rend="italics">rarely seen</hi>. All the poetry about the <quote><hi rend="italics">tented field</hi></quote> died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1976"/><num value="2">Two</num> men slept together, each had a blanket and an oilcloth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1977"/><num value="1">One</num> oilcloth went next to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1978"/>The <num value="2">two</num> laid on this, covered themselves with <num value="2">two</num> blankets, protected from the rain with the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> oilcloth on top, and slept very comfortably through rain, snow or hail, as it might be.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1979"/>Very little money was seen in camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1980"/>The men did not expect, did not care for, or get often any pay, and they were not willing to <pb id="p.134" n="134"/>deprive the old folks at home of their little supply; so they learned to do without any money.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1981"/>When rations got short and were getting shorter, it became necessary to dismiss the darkey servants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1982"/>Some, however, became company servants, instead of private institutons, and held out faithfully to the end, cooking the rations away in the rear, and at the risk of life carrying them to the line of battle to be devoured with voracity by their <quote>young mahsters.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/>Reduced to the minimum, the private soldier consisted of <num value="1">one</num> man, <num value="1">one</num> hat, <num value="1">one</num> jacket, <num value="1">one</num> shirt, <num value="1">one</num> pair of pants, <num value="1">one</num> pair of drawers, <num value="1">one</num> pair of shoes, and <num value="1">one</num> pair of socks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1984"/>His baggage was <num value="1">one</num> blanket, <num value="1">one</num> rubber blanket, and <num value="1">one</num> haversack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1985"/>The haversack generally contained <rs n="smoking tobacco" type="product">smoking tobacco</rs> and a pipe and generlly a small piece of soap, with temporary additions of apples, persimmons, blackberries, and such other commodities as he could pick up on the march.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1986"/>The company property consisted of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> skillets and frying pans, which were sometimes carried in the wagon, but oftener in tile hands of the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1987"/>The infantrymen generally preferred to stick the handle of the frying pan in the barrel of a musket, and so carry it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1988"/>The wagon trains were devoted entirely to the transportation of ammunition and commissary and quartermaster's stores, which had not been issued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1989"/>Rations which had become company property, and the baggage of the men, when they had any, was carried by the men themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1990"/>If, as was sometimes the case, <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> rations were issued at <num value="1">one</num> time and the troops ordered to cook them, and be prepared to march, they did cook them, <hi rend="italics">and eat them if possible</hi>, so as to avoid the labor of carrying them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1991"/>It was not such an undertaking either, to eat <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> rations in <num value="1">one</num>, as frequently none lad been issued for more than a day, and when issued were cut down <num value="0.5">one-half</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1992"/>The infantry found out that bayonets were not of much use, and did not hesitate to throw them, with the scabbard, away.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1993"/>The artillerymen, who started out with heavy sabers hanging to their belts, stuck them up in the mud as they marched, and left them for the ordinance officers to pick up and turn over to the cavalry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1994"/>The cavalrymen found sabres very tiresome when swung to the belt, and adopted the plan of fastening them to the saddle on the left side, with the hilt in front and in reach of the hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1995"/>Finally <pb id="p.135" n="135"/>sabres got very scarce even among the cavalrymen, who relied more and more on their short rifles.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1996"/>No soldiers ever marched with less to encumber them, and none marched faster or held out longer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1997"/>The courage and devotion of the men rose equal to every hardship and privation, and the very intensity of their sufferings became a source of merriment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1998"/>Instead of growling and deserting, they laughed at their own bare feet, ragged clothes and pinched faces, and weak, hungry, cold, wet, worried with vermin and itch, dirty, with no hope of reward or rest, but each fighting on his own personal account, needing not the voice of any to urge them on, marched cheerfully to meet the well fed and warmly clad hosts of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2827"/>Leganville and other points on <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>'s island were occupied, troops debarked, and it seemed apparent that the design of the enemy was to occupy <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>'s island, to erect batteries to enfilade our lines, to reduce <orgName n="Battery Pringle" type="battery">Battery Pringle</orgName>, and secure the <rs>Stono</rs> for a base of operations against <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 5" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2959"/>At this point we find ourselves seriously embarrassed and impeded by the very variety and wealth of our materials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2960"/>The text absolutely swarms with blunders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2961"/>Errors, misconceptions, misstatements, confront as on every page, not to mention the arrogant prejudice and elaborate <num value="1">one</num>-sidedness that pervade the whole, as instanced in such samples of judicially impartial historical narrative as the following: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>In short, the mere fact that a simple <orgName n="Kansas Farmer" type="newspaper">Kansas farmer</orgName> named <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0117.0027.00210.02255" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, who had been ruined and persecuted by the slave-holders, sought to wreak his revenge upon them in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and had gathered together a dozen of fugitive slaves at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, was sufficient to arouse a terrible sensation in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2963"/>It was thought that a civil war had broken out, preparations were made for a great uprising, and it was found necessary to send regular troops from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to seize this man, who expiated upon the gallows the crime of having frightened the proud <rs>Virginians</rs>.</p></quote> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2966"/>Comment would be superflous; and it is necessary, moreover, that we should hasten to a more important part of our subject than the taste and temper of the historian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2967"/>The task of selection, as we have said, is difficult amid such distracting abundance, but a beginning must be made, and we will take as our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance a blunder neither more nor less gross than the swarm of others which give the work perhaps a chance of surviving as <num value="1">one</num> of the curiosities of literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2968"/>On <ref n="page 84">page 84</ref> of the volume before us we meet with this truly remarkable statement: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2969"/></p> 
<p>The <rs>North</rs>, through an imprudent exercise of the spirit of conciliation, had allowed the <rs>Constitution</rs> to be violated by shameful compromises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2970"/>The barriers of the free States had been lowered <pb id="p.211" n="211"/>that the fugitive slave might be restored to the planter.</p></quote> Now, from these sentences it is really very hard to extract any meaning whatever, and we would be inclined to throw the blame upon the translator, and suppose that he had, through haste and inadvertence, done his author a grievous wrong, but for the number of similar passages that keep it in countenance in the course of the following pages.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2971"/>To what <quote>shameful compromises</quote> does the <rs>Count</rs> of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n0117.0027.00211.02257" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName> refer?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2972"/>If to those by which slavery was excluded from or admitted into the territories of the <rs>Union</rs> according to a certain geographical line, whatever he may think of the propriety of such enactments, it is absurd, and self-contradictory from his point of view, to call them unconstitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2973"/>Nothing can be clearer than that if Congress had a right to legislate slavery out of the territories, it had also a right to legislate it into them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2974"/>If it had power over the subject at all, that power could only have been limited by its own discretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2975"/>Or is it the fugitive slave law itself that he considers a shameful compromise violative of the <rs>Constitution</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2976"/>If so, this is indeed an instance of being wounded in the house of <num value="1">one</num>'s friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2977"/>Whatever the sins of the <rs>North</rs> against the <rs>Constitution</rs>, she is perfectly clear of this, nor have we ever heard her charged with it before by her bitterest enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2978"/>Has the <rs>Count</rs> of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n0117.0027.00211.02258" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName> ever read the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2979"/>Is he aware of the provision contained in article <num value="4">4</num>, section <num value="2">2</num>, paragraph <num value="3">3</num>, of that instrument?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2980"/>Does he recollect the language held, not by Southern leaders, the favorite objects of his denunciation, but by the foremost jurists and statesmen of the <rs>North</rs>, by Story and <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0117.0027.00211.02259" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>, indeed by all men of all parties, whatever their opinions upon the subject of slavery and the propriety of the provision in question, who have undertaken to discuss the point, with the single exception of himself?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2981"/>Is he acquainted with the <quote>higher law</quote> literature?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2982"/>Does he know by whom and upon what grounds the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself was denounced as <quote>a covenant with death and an agreement with hell</quote> ?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2983"/>The provision referred to is as plain as language can make it; so plain that it could neither be denied nor explained away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2984"/>The only resource left was to acknowledge the obligation imposed by it in words, but to evade and nullify it in act; and for this triumph of astute and conscientious statesmanship the leaders of the so-called <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> were entitled to the meed of the author's discriminating and judicious praise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2985"/>That he should have lost the <pb id="p.212" n="212"/>opportunity, and actually bestowed instead a severe blow upon the heads of his allies, is a mournful example of the peril of fighting entirely in the dark.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2986"/>This we would have supposed at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sight to be absolutely without a parallel, but a few sentences lower down we meet with an assertion that may well be allowed to contest the palm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2987"/><quote>It (the slave power) could permit neither the territorial extension of the <rs>North</rs> nor the criticism of a free press beyond its boundaries.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2988"/>The last clause of this sentence contains such a flagrant absurdity that we can hardly suppose that even this author intended to say what his language actually conveys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2989"/>If he did not, the wording of the sentence should he so altered as to show us what he really did mean; if he did, the statement is too utterly baseless and preposterous to need or deserve contradiction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2990"/>The assertion in regard to the extension of Northern territory, if not so utterly and ludicrously absurd, is quite as much at variance with the facts, as the most cursory glance at the history of the country will suffice to demonstrate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2991"/>Indeed, the ignorance that can alone explain or palliate such a misrepresentation would be inexcusable in a school boy. What must be thought of it, then, in a man gravely assuming the functions of an accurate and impartial historian?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2992"/>Has the <rs>Count</rs> of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n0117.0027.00212.02260" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName> never heard of the ordinance by which <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> bestowed upon the <rs>Union</rs>, in the direct interest of the territorial extension of the <rs>North</rs>, an empire not far inferior in extent to the <name>France</name> of our own time?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2993"/>Is he aware that from that period up to the beginning of the late war a territory nearly <num value="3">three</num> times as great in extent had been added to the area of the <rs>Northern</rs> section of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> as to that of the <rs>Southern</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2994"/>Does he know that at the period of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Confederation the area of the <rs>Northern</rs> colonies was to that of the <rs>Southern</rs> in the proportion of only about <num value="1">one</num> to <num value="4">four</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2995"/>If the <rs>South</rs> could not, and did not, permit <quote>the territorial extension of the <rs>North</rs>,</quote> how was this proportion so essentially altered as to give to the <rs>Northern</rs> section of the <rs>Union</rs> an overwhelming preponderance?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2996"/>But we beg pardon for wasting time upon so perfectly obvious a point, especially as the author has done us the favor to contradict himself flatly a few pages further on. It is really unfortunate for him that he cannot determine which view of the matter is on the whole most favorable to the side he has espoused and abide by it. He would at least avoid by this means the necessity of attempting to maintain grossly inconsistent positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2997"/><pb id="p.213" n="213"/></p> 
<p>Our author, however, is by no means contented with the humble merits of painstaking research and accurate recital of facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2998"/>He is determined to show us that he can also reason, and accordingly, a little further on, favors us with his views upon the origin and structure of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, in which he deals very summarily with the doctrine of States-rights and <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0117.0027.00213.02261" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,J.,M.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>, <quote>the foremost statesman of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, who,</quote> he tells us, <quote>soon came to be considered the palladium of the peculiar institutions of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2999"/><quote>It is sufficient,</quote> we are informed, <quote>to sum up this doctrine in a few words, to show how specious and dangerous it was.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3000"/>Then follows a long passage, which we are sorry we have not space to quote, or at least to make copious extracts from, for the entertainment of such of our readers as may have time and patience to devote to their perusal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3001"/>Certainly, in the sense in which <persName><foreName>Frederick</foreName></persName> the <rs>Great</rs>'s verses were said to be <quote>royal verses,</quote> this reasoning may be called princely reasoning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3002"/>The great Southern political philosopher has little to dread from opponents like this.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3003"/>We desire to call attention to but a single remark in the course of this argument, if indeed it can, by any stretch of courtesy, be so denominated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3004"/><quote>The States themselves,</quote> says the author in commenting upon the results of the States-rights theory, <quote>would soon have been broken up by the claims of the counties of which they were composed to separate from them.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3005"/>In these few words is contained the root of the whole matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3006"/>Here is the pernicious fallacy which lies at the basis of the entire system of consolidation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3007"/>Unquestionably it would appear to be a doctrine too utterly groundless, too palpably at variance with the plainest and most familiar facts, to require refutation or even to be worthy of serious notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3008"/>And if it stood alone we might be inclined to pass it over, as merely another instance added to the long list of ludicrous mistakes with which ignorant and superficial travelers have adorned their works upon foreign countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3009"/>But the <rs>Count</rs> of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n0117.0027.00213.02262" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName> is here kept in countenance, not indeed by his own illustrious countryman, to whom he is most infelicitously and absurdly compared by his editor, but by <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0117.0027.00213.02263" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> themselves, in whom this ignorant or willful misrepresentation is far more disgraceful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3010"/>Exactly the same position, it will be remembered, was assumed by the late <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0117.0027.00213.02264" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abe,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3011"/>Incredible as it seems that this should impose for a moment upon any human understanding, yet, as it has been made use of again and again by men whose station gave a certain weight and <pb id="p.214" n="214"/>currency to their words, our readers will perhaps pardon us for devoting a brief space to this oft-repeated and oft-exposed fallacy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3012"/>Whatever difference of view may possible exist among candid and well informed men as to the relation of the <name>States</name> to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, these are facts concerning which we presume there can be no controversy between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3013"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, that counties are mere local subdivisions of the territory of a State created for purposes of convenience by the legislative power thereof, and liable to be altered or abolished altogether at the will and pleasure of the same authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3014"/>Secondly, that the <name>States</name> of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName> were originally colonies of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, entirely separate from and independent of each other; that for the purposes of mutual support and assistance, they entered voluntarily into an union with each other, and that they subsequently saw fit to alter and modify the articles of union, and to ordain and establish a new Constitution, which each separate State adopted for itself, and which the adoption by <num value="12">twelve</num> would have made in no way binding on the <dateStruct value="--13"><day reg="2">thirteenth</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3015"/>Here we pause, for this is a mere statement of facts, upon which all are agreed who know anything of the matter, and this is abundantly sufficient to prove that there is not the faintest analogy between the relation of counties to States and that of States to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3016"/>We might well go further, and remind the author that the doctrine of which he disposes so easily was held not only by the selfish leaders and deluded masses of the <rs>South</rs>, but by eminent Northern politicians, notably those of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> in the days of a certain memorable convention at <placeName reg="Hartford, Hartford, Connecticut" key="tgn,7013695">Hartford</placeName>, as well as by able, thoughtful and disinterested foreigners.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3017"/>We will make but a single quotation from <num value="1">one</num> of the most distinguished of these latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3018"/>Will he hear <persName n="Tocqueville,,De,,," id="n0117.0027.00214.02265" reg="default:Tocqueville,De,,,"><foreName>De</foreName> <surname>Tocqueville</surname></persName> on the point?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3019"/><quote>The Union,</quote> says that eminent writer, despite his manifest leaning towards the <rs>North</rs>, and more especially towards <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, <quote>was formed by the voluntary agreement of the <name>States</name>; and in uniting together, they have not forfeited their nationality, nor have they been reduced to the condition of <num value="1">one</num> and the same people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3020"/>If <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>States</name> choose to withdraw from the compact, it would be difficult to disprove its right of doing so, and the <rs>Federal Government</rs> would have no means of maintaining its claims directly, either by force or right.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3021"/>It would be a waste of time to dwell any longer upon so plain a point, or even to cite, as might easily be done, other eminent authorities, both Northern and <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3022"/>We prefer to leave the <pb id="p.215" n="215"/><rs type="role" reg="Comte">Count</rs> of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n0117.0027.00215.02266" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName> in the hands of his distinguished countryman, with this advice however, which we commend to his serious consideration, that before he again undertakes to write upon American constitutional questions, he will devote half an hour to the perusal of the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself, and an equal space of time to the history of the events immediately preceding its adoption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3023"/>This will not indeed make him an able constitutional lawyer, but it may avail to save him from such gross and palpable blunders as those we have just been exposing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3024"/>A moderate degree of research into the events of the period of which he professes to write the history, would also have been advisable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3025"/>For example, a glance at the report of the committee appointed by a Republican <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, with a Republican at its head, to investigate the subject, would have saved him from the discredit of repeating, as he does more than once with all the unrestrained exultation of a violent partisan, the stale and groundless story of <persName n="Floyd,Secretary,,,," id="n0117.0027.00215.02267" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>'s having used his official position to arm the <rs>South</rs> and disarm the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3026"/>The report of this committee, which will hardly be suspected of undue partiality for <persName n="Floyd,General,,,," id="n0117.0027.00215.02268" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>, exonerated him fully from the charge, and to this we refer the <rs>Count</rs> at his leisure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3027"/>It is hardly wise to be <quote><hi rend="italics">plus rogaliste que le roi</hi>.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3028"/>Again, what idea would any reader unacquainted with the real course of events derive from this writer's account of the efforts at compromise made at the last session of Congress previous to the commencement of the war?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3029"/><quote>With the exception of the secession leaders,</quote> says he, <quote>all parties were working sincerely to devise means for maintaining the <rs>Union</rs></quote> (<ref n="page 120">page 120</ref>). And again: <quote>Congress was the arena where the antagonistic passions which developed themselves on every side struggled for the mastery, and attempts at conciliation were only brought forward to be defeated through the absolute pretension of the <rs>Southern</rs> leaders</quote> (<ref n="page 128">page 128</ref>). All this in the teeth of the fact that every proposition looking to a compromise came from the <rs>South</rs>; that the <name>Crittenden</name> resolutions were distinctly accepted by <quote>the <rs>Southern</rs> leaders,</quote> received the vote of every Southern <rs type="role2">Senator</rs> except those from <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, who had already vacated their seats, and were rejected by a united Republican vote, by which also <persName n="Clark,Mister,,,," id="n0117.0027.00215.02269" reg="mostcommon:Clark,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clark</surname></persName>'s substitute, peremptorily closing the door to anything in the nature of a compromise, was adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3030"/><quote>The vote of the <rs>Republican</rs> members of the <name>Senate</name>,</quote> says a Massachusetts <pb id="p.216" n="216"/>historian of the conflict, <quote>was a blank denial of the necessity of compromise, and showed of course that they had deliberately made up their minds to refuse any negotiation.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3031"/>In like manner the project of the <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName>, which had been inaugurated by <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, was summarily and even contemptuously rejected by the same party.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3032"/>Now, these are the unquestionable facts of the case, and it is against perversions of these that we enter our protest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3033"/>We are not now dealing with matters of opinion at all. The <rs>Count</rs> of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n0117.0027.00216.02270" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName> may think this rejection of all overtures for compromise an eminently wise and commendable proceeding on the part of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>--an opinion, indeed, which, with that reckless disregard of self-contradiction that is so striking a feature of his book, he soon afterwards expresses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3034"/>He has an indisputable right to form, and to maintain after his fashion, any opinions that may please him on the questions at issue between the <num value="2">two</num> sections; nor do we conceive the <rs>Southern</rs> cause in the slightest danger from the power of his logic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3035"/>What we do object to is the persistent misrepresentation of facts, which cannot of course impose upon any <num value="1">one</num> tolerably acquainted with the history of the times, but which may be productive of considerable harm by misleading and prejudicing that astonishingly large class of Europeans which is profoundly ignorant of our history and our institutions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3036"/>Another instance, of a character similar to that which we have just been examining, is the light in which the relations between the <rs>Southern Commissioners</rs> and the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> are presented.</p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3038"/>Now, it so happens that upon this very interesting episode of the late contest, the public is in possession of particularly clear and ample information, entirely at variance with the representation given in this volume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3039"/>If its author was in the habit of rendering a reason for his belief, or adducing evidence in support of his assertions, it might be worth while to inquire for what reason and upon what evidence he here applies the epithet <quote>perfidious</quote> to the opponents of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0117.0027.00216.02272" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abe,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3040"/>But in the case of a writer who evidently considers this quite unnecessary, and distributes praise and abuse not only without scruple, but without the art and <pb id="p.217" n="217"/>apparent candor, which are requisite to make them effective, any inquiry of the kind would be thrown away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3041"/>The idea of perfidy may indeed have been uppermost in his mind while engaged in the consideration of this matter, and have been thus strangely misapplied by a lapse of memory or of pen. This, however, is merely a suggestion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3042"/>Should he still be really in darkness on the point, we would refer him, for his own enlightenment, to the various publications bearing upon it that have issued from Northern sources, and also to the singularly clear, cool and dispassionate statement of <persName n="Campbell,Judge,,,," id="n0117.0027.00217.02273" reg="mostcommon:Campbell,John,A.,,:1"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Campbell</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3043"/>How will he reconcile the position he assumes for <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0117.0027.00217.02274" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abe,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> with the course pursued, as is proven on unimpeachable testimony by <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0117.0027.00217.02275" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abe,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s official representative, <persName n="Seward,Secretary,,,," id="n0117.0027.00217.02276" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3056"/>When, for instance, he speaks of the <rs>Southern</rs> army and navy officers who designed their commissions in order to take part with their native States as traitors and deserters, we have no reply to make, for the remark deserves none.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3061"/>This also has been contradicted by the writer above referred to.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3084"/>In the case before us, for instance, he has himself stated the <rs>Confederate</rs> force at <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3091"/>Nor was there afterwards, in spite of this writer's confident assertion to that effect, any force detached from that point to reinforce him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3169"/>To offer a man promotion in the early part of the war was equivalent to an insult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3170"/>The higher the social position, the greater the wealth, the more patriotic it would be to serve in the humble position of a private; and many men of education and ability in the various professions, refusing promotion, served under the command of men greatly their inferiors, mentally, morally, and as soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3171"/>It soon became apparent that the country wanted knowledge and ability, as well as muscle and endurance, and those who had capacity to serve in higher positions were promoted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3172"/>Still it remained true, that inferior men commanded their superiors in every respect, save <num value="1">one</num>--Rank; and leaving out the <num value="1">one</num> difference of rank, the officers and men were about on a par.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3173"/>It took years to teach the educated privates in the army that it was their duty to give unquestioning obedience to officers, because they were such, who were awhile ago their playmates and associates in business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3174"/>It frequently happened that the private, feeling hurt by the stern authority of the officer, would ask him to <num value="1">one</num> side, challenge him to personal combat, and thrash him well.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3175"/>After awhile these rambuctious privates learned all about extra duty, half rations and courts martial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3176"/><pb id="p.227" n="227"/></p> 
<p>It was only to conquer this independent resistance of discipline that punishment or force was necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3177"/>The privates were as willing and anxious to fight and serve as the officers, and needed no pushing up to their duty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3178"/>It is amusing to recall the disgust with which the men would hear of their assignment to the rear as reserves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3179"/>They regarded the order as a deliberate insult, planned by some officer who had a grudge against their regiment or battery, who had adopted this plan to prevent their presence in battle, and thus humiliate them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3180"/>How soon did they learn the sweetness of a day's repose in the rear!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3181"/>Another romantic notion, which for awhile possessed the boys, was that soldiers should not try to be comfortable, but glory in getting wet, being cold, hungry and tired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3182"/>So they refused shelter in houses or barns, and, <quote>like true soldiers,</quote> paddled about in the mud and rain, thinking thereby to serve their country better.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3183"/>The real troubles had not come, and they were in a hurry to suffer some.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3184"/>They had not long thus impatiently to wait, nor could they latterly complain of the want of a chance to <quote>do or die.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3185"/>Volunteering for perilous or very onerous duty was popular at the outset, but as duties of this kind thickened it began to be thought time enough when the <quote>orders</quote> were peremptory or the orderly read the <quote>detail.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3186"/>Another fancy idea was that the principal occupation of a soldier should be actual conflict with the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3187"/>They didn't dream of such a thing as camping for <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> at a time without firing a gun, or marching and countermarching to mislead the enemy, or driving wagons and ambulances, building bridges, currying horses, and the <num value="1000">thousand</num> common-place duties of the soldier.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3188"/>On the other hand, great importance was attached to some duties which soon became mere drudgery.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3190"/>Of course they soon learned how sweet it was, after <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> walking of the beat, to turn in for <hi rend="italics"><measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure></hi>! which seemed to the sleepy man an eternity in anticipation, but only a brief time in retrospect, when <pb id="p.228" n="228"/>the corporal gave him a <quote>chunk,</quote> and remarked, <quote>Time to go on guard.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3192"/>Literally true sometimes, but, generally speaking, <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="1">one</num> made hard work for the boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3193"/>They didn't know at the beginning anything about the advantage the enemy had in being able to present man for man in front and then send as many more to worry the flanks and rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3194"/>They learned something about this very soon, and had to contend against it on almost every field they won.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3195"/>Wounds were in great demand after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> wounded hero made his appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3196"/>His wound was the envy of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of unfortunates who had not so much as a scratch to boast, and who felt <quote>small</quote> and of little consequence before the man with a bloody bandage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3197"/>Many became despondent and groaned as they thought that perchance after all they were doomed to go home safe and sound, and hear, for all time, the praises of the fellow who had lost his arm by a cannon shot, or had his face ripped by a sabre, or his head smashed with a fragment of shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3198"/>After awhile the wound was regarded as a practical benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3199"/>It secured a furlough of indefinite length, good eating, the attention and admiration of the fair, and, if permanently disabling, a discharge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3200"/>Wisdom, born of experience, soon taught all hands better sense, and the fences and trees and ditches and rocks became valuable and eagerly sought after when <quote>the music</quote> of <quote>minnie</quote> and the roar of the <quote><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0117.0029.00228.02439" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName></quote> <num value="12">twelve</num>-pounders was heard.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3202"/>Only the wisest men, those who had seen war before, imagined that the war would last more than a few months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3203"/>The young volunteers thought <num value="1">one</num> good battle would settle the whole matter; and, indeed, after <quote><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Mannassas</quote> many thought they might as well go home!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3224"/>As discipline improved and the men began to feel no longer simply volunteers, but <hi rend="italics">enlisted volunteers</hi>, the romantic devotion which they had felt was succeeded by a feeling of constraint and necessity, and while the army was in reality very much improved and strengthened by the change, the soldiers imagined the contrary to be the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3225"/>And if discipline had been pushed to too great an extent, the army would have been deprived of the very essence of its life and power.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3226"/>When the officers began to assert superiority by withdrawing from the messes and organizing <quote>officer's messes,</quote> the bond of brotherhood was weakened; and who will say that the dignity which was thus maintained was compensation for the loss of personal devotion as between comrades?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3227"/>At the outset the fact that men were in the same company put them somewhat on the same level and produced an almost perfect bond of sympathy, but as time wore on the various peculiarities and weaknesses of the men would show themselves, and each company, as a community, would seperate into distinct circles as indifferent to each other, save in the common cause, as though they had never met as friends.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3228"/>The pride of the volunteers was sorely tried by the incoming of conscripts &mdash; the most despised class in the army &mdash; and their devotion to company and regiment was visibly lessened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3229"/>They could not bear the thought of having these men for comrades, and felt the flag insulted when claimed by <num value="1">one</num> of them as <quote>his flag.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3230"/>It was a great source of annoyance to the true men, but was a necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3231"/>Conscripts crowded together in companies, regiments and brigades would have been useless &mdash; but scattered here and and there among the good men, were utilized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3232"/>And so, gradually, the pleasure that men had in being associated with others whom they respected as equals, was taken away and the social aspect of army life seriously marred.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3233"/>The next serious blow to romance was the abolishment of election and the appointment of officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3234"/>Instead of the privilege and pleasure of picking out some good-hearted, brave comrade and <pb id="p.231" n="231"/>making him captain, the lieutenant was promoted without the consent of the men, or, what was harder to bear, some officer hitherto unknown was sent to take command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3235"/>This was no doubt better for the service, but it had a serious effect on the minds of volunteer patriot soldiers, and looked to them too much like arbitrary power exercised over men who were fighting that very principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3236"/>They frequently had to acknowledge, however, that the officers were all they could ask, and in many instances became devotedly attached to them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3237"/>As the companies became decimated by disease, wounds, desertions and death, it became necessary to consolidate them, and so the social pleasures received another blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3238"/>Men from the same neighborhoods and villages, who had been schoolmates together, were no longer in companies, but mingled indiscriminately with all sorts of men from anywhere and everywhere.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3240"/>Men who when surrounded by their old companions were brave and daring soldiers, full of spirit and hope, when thrust among strangers for whom they cared not and who cared not for them, became dull and listless, lost their courage and were slowly but surely <quote>demoralized.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3241"/>They did, it is true, in many cases, stand up to the last, but they did it on dry principle &mdash; having none of that enthusiasm and delight in duty which once characterized them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3242"/>The Confederate soldier was peculiar in that he was ever ready to fight, but never ready to submit to the routine duty and discipline of the camp or the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3243"/>The soldiers were determined to be soldiers after their own notions, and do their duty for the love of it as they thought best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3244"/>The officers saw the necessity for doing otherwise, and so the conflict was commenced and maintained to the end.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3245"/>It is doubtful whether the <rs>Southern</rs> soldier would have submitted to any hardships which were purely the result of discipline, and, on the other hand, no amount of hardship clearly of necessity could cool his ardor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3364"/>It was my purpose to write a chapter on the subsequent defence of the coast, in which I intended to record faithfully the operations of <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0117.0031.00239.02523" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> and others, but the article of <persName n="Jordan,General,,,," id="n0117.0031.00239.02524" reg="nearbymention:Jordan,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jordan</surname></persName> will probably render this unnecessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3365"/>I will, however, in this connection, venture the assertion that the article of <persName n="Jordan,General,,,," id="n0117.0031.00239.02525" reg="nearbymention:Jordan,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jordan</surname></persName> would have been more valuable as an historical production, if he had more clearly stated in what important points <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0117.0031.00239.02526" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s plan of seacoast defence was changed by his successor.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3367"/>Doubtless in those instances the original lines were more or less modified to meet the varying phases of war, but I am yet to learn in what material particular <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0117.0031.00239.02528" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s original system of seacoast defence was departed from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3428"/>Our Society has steadily grown in public favor, our membership has largely increased, and there have been continuous additions of most valuable material to our collection.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3430"/>But we may say that our collection is now generally recognized as <num value="1">one</num> of very great value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3431"/>We have received frequent letters from <name>North</name>, <name>South</name>, <name>East</name> and <name>West</name>, and from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, asking for information on various points of historical interest, and in nearly every instance our archives afforded the information sought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3432"/>Several gentlemen engaged in writing important parts of the history of our struggle for constitutional freedom, have acknowledged valuable assistance received from us, and have signified their purpose of consulting our archives more freely in the future.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3433"/>Indeed we have already on our shelves ample material for a true history of the <quote>war between the <name>States</name>,</quote> with the exception of the year <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, and the early part of <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>.

<head>Publications.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3438"/>The Committee indicated in their last report their earnest desire to make a monthly publication, which should at the same time keep up interest in our work, preserve valuable Mss. from the risk of being lost, and aid students of our history in their researches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3439"/>We had fully decided that it would be better for us to do our own publishing, than to form an alliance with any existing magazine, but the condition of our treasury made us hesitate to assume liabilities which we might not be able to discharge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3440"/>Just after our annual meeting, however, our <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice-President</rs> for the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, <persName n="Corcoran,,W.,W.,," id="n0117.0033.00246.02580" reg="default:Corcoran,W.,W.,,"><foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Corcoran</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, whose princely liberality to every good work has given him a world-wide reputation, made us a donation which determined us to try the experiment of a monthly publication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3441"/>Accordingly we issued in <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> last the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> number of our <quote><hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Southern Historical Society" type="society">Southern Historical Society</orgName> Papers</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3442"/>This publication has proved <hi rend="italics">a decided success</hi>. Although the depressed condition of the country, the excitement of a heated Presidential canvass, and other causes have combined to make this an exceedingly unfavorably year for such an enterprise, our monthly has fully met the cost of its publication, and would have more than done so but for the extra expense of our numbers on the <quote>Treatment of prisoners</quote> (which we scattered broadcast in this country and in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>), the cost of reissuing several of the numbers which ran out, and the cost of stereotyping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3443"/>These <num value="3">three</num> items alone amount to <measure n="1568dollars" type="currency">$1,568</measure>. Our present experience woud have enabled us to avoid the whole of this extra expense.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3444"/>As to the interest and value of these <quote><hi rend="italics">Papers</hi>,</quote> we have testimony from every quarter, as well as the steady increase of our subscription <pb id="p.247" n="247"/>list, which has now run up to <num value="1560">1,560</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3445"/>We have as regular subscribers, not only leading Confederates, but a number of distinguished Federal officers, some of the more important public libraries of this country, and a number of prominent gentlemen and public libraries in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3446"/>We sent our discussion of the <quote><hi rend="italics">Treatment of Prisoners</hi></quote> to a large number of the principal newspapers and libraries at the <rs>North</rs>, and about <num value="300">300</num> copies to different parts of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3447"/>We have reason to believe that these have already produced valuable fruit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3448"/>Several <name>English</name> gentlemen have written their warm appreciation of the importance and value of our <hi rend="italics">Papers</hi>. A distinguished officer and able military critic of the <name>Prussian</name> army has written that they <quote>give him great pleasure and create great interest in the historical world,</quote> and a distinguished <name>French</name> historian writes that he is highly gratified at receiving them, and promises to give them, especially the numbers on the prison question, <quote>a careful study.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3449"/>We have had the <num value="2">two</num> numbers (<dateStruct><month>March</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>April</month></dateStruct>) which discuss the <quote>Treatment of prisoners,</quote> bound into a beautiful volume, which our friends should help us to place in every public library.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3450"/>We have also very beautifully bound copies of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volume of our <hi rend="italics">Papers</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3451"/>In regard to <hi rend="italics">the character</hi> of the <hi rend="italics">Papers</hi> which we publish, the committee have had frequent and earnest consultation, and have agreed upon <hi rend="italics">a general policy</hi> which, we trust, will meet the approbation of the <name>Society</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3452"/>If we had a source of revenue which rendered us independent of any popular interest attaching to our publications, it might be the best policy to publish occasional volumes of <quote>transactions,</quote> carefully collated, and containing nothing but what would be of high historic value; but as we have found by past experience that we must make <hi rend="italics">frequent</hi> publications in order to keep up an interest which will secure the means of carrying on our work, it seems clearly best that we should issue a monthly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3453"/>We might confine this monthly publication to official reports, discussions of military movements by our ablest military critics, and such like papers, and this course would be doubtless most agreeable to many of our honored friends, but we must have also a <hi rend="italics">popular</hi> element to please the masses, who read and pay for the monthly, or the enterprise will soon break down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3454"/>Our policy, therefore, is that while preserving the strictly historical character <pb id="p.248" n="248"/>of the magazine, and never sending out a number which is not of real historic value, we shall at the same time intersperse narratives which tell of the camp, the march, the bivouack, the battle-field, the hospital, or the prison, and give vivid pictures of the every day inner life of the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldier.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3455"/>The extent to which the <orgName n="Southern Historical Society" type="society">Southern Historical Society</orgName> is to be held as <hi rend="italics">endorsing</hi> everything contained in the papers we publish, is a question so often raised that we allude to it here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3456"/>Of course the <name>Society</name>, whose members are scattered all through the country, cannot meet to pass upon each paper, and cannot endorse what is published further than as it is done by its <orgName n="Executive Committee" type="committee">Executive Committee</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3457"/>The members of the <rs>Committee</rs> are accustomed to give very careful consideration to the propriety of each publication, but even they are not to be considered as <hi rend="italics">endorsing</hi> everything they publish.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3458"/>In the mass of Mss. on our shelves, and constantly coming in, there are many statements made by eye-witnesses, or active participants, concerning events of which we have no personal knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3459"/>Even the official reports of our most distinguished and trustworthy officers contain conflicting statements about events which they view from different stand-points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3460"/>It is obvious that it would not be proper for the <rs>Committee</rs> to assume the responsibility of deciding who is right in such cases, and we must, therefore, either publish nothing about which any difference of opinion can arise (and that course would limit us to a very narrow field), or we must publish, impartially and without comment, <hi rend="italics">both</hi> sides, being careful to admit nothing which has not a responsible name attached to it. It has seemed to the <rs>Committee</rs> far better to publish these papers now, while living witnesses can sift them, than that they should be allowed to sleep in our archives, and be produced in years to come, when, perhaps, no competent witness of the events recorded will be alive to attest their accuracy or refute their errors.</p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3555"/>I am here in obedience to your orders and give you a soldier's greeting.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3556"/>It has fallen to me, at your behest, to attempt the story of a defence more masterly in happy reaches of generalship than that of <placeName reg="Sebastopol, Luzerne, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2650582">Sebastopol</placeName>, and not less memorable than that of Zaragoza in a constancy which rose superior to accumulating disaster, and a stern valor ever reckoned highest by the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3557"/>It is a great task, nor do I take shame to myself that I am not equal to it, for, speaking soberly, it is a story so fraught with true though mournful glory &mdash; a story so high and noble in its persistent lesson of how great things may be wrested by human skill and valor from the malice of Fortune &mdash; that even a Thucydides or a Napier might suffer his nervous pencil to droop, lost, perchance, in wonder at the surprising issues which genius, with matchless spring, extorted time and again from cruel odds, or stirred too deeply for utterance by that which ever kindles the hearts of brave men &mdash; the spectacle of human endurance meeting with unshaken front the very stroke of Fate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3558"/>And if intensity of sorrowful admiration might not unnaturally paralyze the hand of the historian, who should undertake to transmit to <hi rend="italics">posterity</hi> a truthful record of the unequal contest, what mortal among men could stand forth undismayed, when bidden to trace even the outlines of the story in presence of the survivors of that <pb id="p.258" n="258"/>incomparable army, the followers of that matchless leader &mdash; veterans, to whom it has been given to see its every episode emblazoned in crimson letters by the very <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Battles.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3559"/>And yet it is because of this presence, that I stand here not unwillingly to-night &mdash; for when I look down upon these bronzed and bearded faces, I cannot but remember that we have shared together the rough delights, the toils, the dangers of field of battle, and march and bivouac, and feel sure of indulgence in advance from those who are knit to even the humblest comrade by a companionship born of common devotion to that Cause which is yet <quote>strong with the strength</quote> of Truth, and <quote>immortal with the immortality</quote> of Right &mdash; born of such common devotion, nurtured in the fire of battle, strengthened and sanctified by a common reverence for the valiant souls who have fallen on sleep.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3560"/>It is not mine, comrades, to dazzle you with the tricks of rhetoric, nor charm your ear with smooth flowing periods; but even were such mastery given to me, it would scarce befit my theme &mdash; for we have now to trace the history of the army to which we belonged, not in its full blaze of triumph, as when it wrote <persName n="Richmond,,,,," id="n0117.0035.00258.02659" reg="mostcommon:Richmond,nomatch:0"><surname>Richmond</surname></persName> and <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName> upon its standards, but in those last eventful days when its strength was well nigh <quote>too slender to support the weight of victory</quote> ; we have now to mark the conduct of its leader, not as when, the favored child of <persName n="Mars,,,,," id="n0117.0035.00258.02660" reg="mostcommon:Mars,nomatch:0"><surname>Mars</surname></persName>, the clangor of his trumpets from the heights of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> haughtily challenged the admiration of astonished nations, but in that severer glory which shines round about him as he stands at bay, girt with a handful of devoted soldiery, staying the arm of Fate with an incredible vigor of action and a consummate mastery of his art, and, still unsubdued in mind, delivers his last battle as fiercely as his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3561"/>And in the prosecution of the task confided to me &mdash; in my attempts to reconcile the conflicting testimony of eye-witnesses, in sifting hostile reports, and in testing by official data the statements of writers who have essayed the story of this final campaign &mdash; although at times it has seemed well-nigh a hopeless labor, and more than once recalled the scene in <persName n="Sterne,,,,," id="n0117.0035.00258.02661" reg="mostcommon:Sterne,nomatch:0"><surname>Sterne</surname></persName>'s inimitable masterpiece, in which <persName n="Shandy,Mister,,,," id="n0117.0035.00258.02662" reg="mostcommon:Shandy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Shandy</surname></persName>, taking My <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Toby</foreName></persName> kindly by the hand, cries out, <quote>Believe me, dear <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Toby</foreName></persName>, these military operations of yours are far above your strength,</quote> yet, remembering the spirited reply of My <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Toby</foreName></persName>, <quote>What care I, brother, so it be for the good of the nation,</quote> --even so have I been upheld, reflecting that if it should be my good fortune to restore to its true light and bearing <pb id="p.259" n="259"/>even <num value="1">one</num> of the many actions of this vigorous campaign, which may have been heretofore misrepresented through ignorance or through passion, it would be counted as a service, however humble, to that army, whose just renown can never be too jealously guarded by the men who were steadfast to their colors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3562"/>That I should attempt a critical examination of that defence in detail, is manifestly impossible within the limits of an address, when it is remembered that, south of the <rs>Appomattox</rs> alone, <num value="13">thirteen</num> pitched fights were delivered outside the works, beside numberless <quote>affairs</quote> on the part of the cavalry and small bodies of infantry, while each day was attended by a number of minor events, which, taken separately, appear to be of little historical importance, but, when combined, exerted no mean influence on the conduct of the campaign.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3563"/>Nor, on the other hand, has the time yet come, in the opinion of many officers of sound and sober judment, for that larger treatment of my theme which would necessitate an impartial examination of the measure to which the military operations were shaped by considerations of a political character &mdash; in other words, the time has not yet come when <num value="1">one</num> may use the fearless frankness of <persName n="Napier,,,,," id="n0117.0035.00259.02663" reg="mostcommon:Napier,nomatch:0"><surname>Napier</surname></persName>, who justly reckons it the crowing proof of the genius of <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n0117.0035.00259.02664" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName>, that while resisting with gigantic vigor the fierceness of the <rs>French</rs>, he had at the same time to <quote>sustain the weakness of <num value="3">three</num> inefficient cabinets.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3564"/>I propose, therefore, to notice some of the leading events of the campaign in its unity, which will indicate the general conception of the defence of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, animated by no other feeling towards the many brave men and officers of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> than <num value="1">one</num> of hearty admiration for their courage and endurance, desirous, above all, that truth, so far as we can attain it now, shall be spoken with soldierly bluntness, and error be not perpetuated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3565"/>And at the very outset, it is not only pertinent, but essential to a proper appreciation of the conduct of affairs, that we should consider the <hi rend="italics">morale</hi> of the <num value="2">two</num> armies as they prepared to move into those vast lines of circumvallation and contravallation, destined to become more famous than Torres Vedras or those drawn by the genius of <persName n="Turenne,,,,," id="n0117.0035.00259.02665" reg="mostcommon:Turenne,nomatch:0"><surname>Turenne</surname></persName> in the great wars of the <name>Palatinate</name>.
