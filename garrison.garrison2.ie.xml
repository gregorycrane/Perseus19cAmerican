<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>Everything is at present tranquil, and we hope will remain so. No injury has been done to us at the office, except the splitting down half the door and destroying the sign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>We feel confident that the mob will be an advantage to our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>Assurances come in to us from the country that it is benefiting us there; and even in the city, I think we have reason to believe it has made us friends.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>The affairs of the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> are somewhat crippled, indeed, for on account of the excitement, and from apprehensions for their property, the owners of the building have notified <persName n="Knapp,,,,," id="n0186.0001.00039.00471" reg="nearbymention:Knapp,Isaac,,,"><surname>Knapp</surname></persName> to quit; and as he has no lease he must do so. He is somewhat perplexed to know what to do, or where to get another office, but perhaps he will give all necessary information respecting the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> affairs.</p>

I kept myself at and about the office a considerable part of the evening, taking care not to be where I should attract notice to the office, but still keeping an eye to it myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>I removed the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> books and office books, and what little money we had, that night and the next; but since that time the city has worn so tranquil an aspect that I have not thought it worth while to take the trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>They <hi rend="italics">know</hi> that, so long as they confine their plunder and violence to the property and persons of antislavery men, they can act with perfect impunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>I say this in the fullest belief of its truth, and after having had an interview with the <rs>Mayor</rs>, <persName n="Parkman,Sheriff,,,," id="n0186.0001.00040.00485" reg="mostcommon:Parkman,Daniel,,,:4"><roleName n="Sheriff">Sheriff</roleName> <surname>Parkman</surname></persName>, and other civil officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>I most firmly believe it to be the determination of the authorities to use all their efforts to put down anti-slavery presses and anti-slavery discussions, rather than mobs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>To effect their object, they magnify every danger and represent it to be impossible, should another disturbance occur, for them to have any power to prevent the mob from working their will in any way they may elect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>As this fact becomes known to the public, now and then, there are individuals who boldly avow their determination to attend the next anti-slavery meeting fully equipped for military duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>These are not generally anti-slavery men, but men who cannot sacrifice their dearest rights without striking a blow.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>Every demand against the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi>, of course, is now rushing in. It is now in arrears to me <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure>, most of which I have borrowed from friends to meet current expenses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>I am compelled to move this day, yet not a shelter can I obtain for love <pb id="p.41" n="41"/> to me, to the cause, or for money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>The only alternative I have is to store the materials for a while, and get the paper set up in driblets, as I can, in other offices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>This plan is very expensive, and I cannot stand under it long unless the friends will advance money.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>Your landlord is apprehensive that his house will be destroyed, and wishes you would give it up. This I think is the best way you can do; and it should be done immediately, while he is in the mood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>Ms.</note> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>I received your letter yesterday morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>I have very little time which I can well spare to answer it. I see no objection to your remaining at <placeName reg="Brooklyn, Windham, Connecticut" key="tgn,2016663">Brooklyn</placeName> for the present, except that your friends here will be sorry not to see you. You will certainly have less interruption there in preparing matter for the paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>I believe you would be perfectly safe in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> now, and might appear here in open daylight without molestation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>Yet as <persName n="Garrison,Mrs.,,,," id="n0186.0001.00042.00500" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,W.,L.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName> could not fail to be perpetually anxious on your account, if you should take up your residence here just now, it seems to me you had better stay where you are. Your life was undoubtedly in imminent peril last <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, and your escape under all the circumstances was almost miraculous; yet I do not believe even then that the mob <hi rend="italics">intended</hi> to murder you, though heaven only knows what would have been the consequences if you had remained in the hands of an exasperated and phrensied populace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>They might have committed a crime which they would abhor in cooler moments, and of which a few hours before they would have felt themselves incapable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/><pb id="p.43" n="43"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>He was in fine spirits then, and nothing daunted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>I should not think it safe for him to appear in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> now. I still continue of the opinion I expressed when we had the meeting at my office, that <persName n="Thompson,,,,," id="n0186.0001.00043.00507" reg="nearbymention:Thompson,H.,B.,,"><surname>Thompson</surname></persName> ought to publish a statement of the material circumstances in relation to the charge brought<note anchored="yes" type="marg">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>The state of things here is lamentable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>The <hi rend="italics">most respectable</hi> people either openly justify or coldly disapprove the riot, while they are loud in their condemnation and abuse of the abolitionists, and especially of <persName n="Thompson,,,,," id="n0186.0001.00043.00508" reg="nearbymention:Thompson,H.,B.,,"><surname>Thompson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0186.0001.00043.00509" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,W.,L.,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, and the ladies who dared to hold a meeting in defiance of public opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>The city authorities have not yet done anything in relation to the riot.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/> 
<p>This indifference and inaction, like the part played by <persName n="Stevens,Mister,,,," id="n0186.0001.00043.00510" reg="mostcommon:Stevens,Isaac,,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Stevens</surname></persName> and <persName n="Means,Mister,,,," id="n0186.0001.00043.00511" reg="mostcommon:Means,Isaac,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Means</surname></persName> in instigating the mob (<hi rend="italics">ante</hi>, <ref n="page 10">p. 10</ref>), was the measure of the sincerity of the <placeName reg="Faneuil Hall">Faneuil Hall</placeName> resolutions deprecating violence.</p></note> The general opinion of the abolitionists is, that some of the gentlemen who were most active in the mob ought to be prosecuted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>This is my own opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>I think nothing will do so much to prevent a repetition of these disgraceful proceedings as punishing a few reputable citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>If such punishment can be inflicted, it will bring to their senses not only those who are punished, but many more who may feel that they deserve the same fate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>A public meeting such as you suggest would have a good effect if called by any persons but abolitionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>The editor of the <hi rend="italics">Advocate</hi> has taken a manly stand on this subject, but I<note anchored="yes" type="marg">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1532"/>Whether I shall give my criticisms to the public through the medium of the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> exclusively, or whether they will appear in another form, I have not yet determined, for they remain to be written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1533"/>At the longest, I shall make only a small pamphlet&mdash;not <q direct="unspecified">a book.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/>Nor is it my design to taunt the Dr. on the ground of <q direct="unspecified">plagiarism,</q> because many of his thoughts are like our thoughts, and much of his language is like our language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/>It would partake too much of the ridiculous, and savor too strongly of vanity or churlishness, for any abolition writer to plume himself upon having anticipated other writers in vindicating certain fundamental doctrines, appertaining to governments and the rights of man. Be assured, such a course is foreign both to my disposition and purpose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/>It is true, I mean to draw some parallel resemblances between <persName n="Channing,Doctor,,,," id="n0186.0002.00091.01085" reg="nearbymention:Channing,W.,E.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Channing</surname></persName> and certain <q direct="unspecified">ultra</q> abolition writers, <hi rend="italics">i. e</hi>., from their disquisitions&mdash;and for several reasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>&mdash;To show <pb id="p.92" n="92"/> that the Dr. has not made any new moral discoveries, which his admirers would fain make a great doctorof-divinity-worship-ping public believe is the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>Secondly&mdash;To show that the Dr. endorses those very principles which peculiarly characterize the abolitionists as a party, and for the dissemination of which they have been scorned, traduced, injured, and mobbed, as fanatics, madmen and traitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>Thirdly&mdash;To show that the Dr. has acted disingenuously, and evinced a want of magnanimity, in not even slightly intimating that the abolitionists, with all their zeal and fanaticism, have uniformly and consistently maintained the great essential doctrines upon which human rights find an immovable basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>My object, in this last particular, is not so much to bring honor to any particular individuals, (though the rule is a good <num value="1">one</num>&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">Honor to whom honor is due</q>), as it is to vindicate <hi rend="italics">the anti-slavery cause</hi>, as such, from the misrepresentations which have been cast upon it, even by some of the very men who are now lauding Dr. C.'s book to the skies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1541"/>They who have been maligned ought to possess their souls in patience; but they certainly have a right modestly to acquit themselves, if they can.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1542"/>I think that you and I will agree as to the propriety and utility of such a presentation of the case.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/>Some other parallelisms will be drawn, which will be quite as afflicting to the Dr. and his admirers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1544"/>These will show that his book abounds with inconsistencies, and neutralizes every useful truth contained in it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2386"/>Dear Br. Garrison: In addressing you, I use the liberty which ought to exist between every member of a race which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> made of <num value="1">one</num> blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2387"/>Moreover, the fact that I was once most heartily engaged in the cause you advocate, and am now separated from it only by devotion to a kindred object, entitles me to call you brother, with peculiar emphasis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2388"/>When I saw you in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, we spoke of the kingdom of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, in its relations to the kingdoms of this world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2389"/>I rejoiced to find in you a fellowship of views and feelings on this subject which has long been a rarity to me. I proposed to show you a written declaration of my principles, but was prevented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2390"/>I write now to fulfil that proposal.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2391"/>I am willing that all men should know that I have subscribed my name to an instrument similar to the <name>Declaration</name> of &lsquo;<num value="76">76</num>, renouncing all allegiance to the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and asserting the title of <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n0186.0003.00145.01654" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName> to the throne of the world. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2392"/>When I wish to form a conception of the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> (using a personified representation), I picture to myself a bloated, swaggering libertine, trampling on the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> &mdash;its own Constitution&mdash;its treaties with the <name>Indians</name>&mdash;the petitions of its citizens: with <num value="1">one</num> hand whipping a negro tied to a liberty-pole, and with the other dashing an emaciated <name>Indian</name> to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2393"/>On <num value="1">one</num> side stand the despots of <pb id="p.146" n="146"/> <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, laughing and mocking at the boasted liberty of their neighbor; on the other stands the <name>Devil</name>, saying, <q direct="unspecified">Esto perpetua.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2394"/>In view of such a representation, the question urges itself upon me&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">What have I, as a Christian, to do with such a villain?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2395"/>I live on the territory which he claims&mdash;under the protection, to some extent, of the laws which he promulgates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2396"/>Must I therefore profess to be his friend?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2397"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> forbid! I will rather flee my country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2398"/>But every other country is under the same reprobate authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2399"/>I must, then, either go out of the world, or find some way to live where I am, without being a hypocrite or a partaker in the sins of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2400"/>I grant that <q direct="unspecified">the powers that be are ordained of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>,</q> and this is not less true of individual than of national slaveholders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2401"/>I am hereby justified in remaining a slave&mdash;but not in remaining a slaveholder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2402"/>Every person who is, in the usual sense of the expression, a citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, <hi rend="italics">i.e</hi>., a voter, politician, etc., is at once a slave and a slaveholder&mdash;in other words, a subject and a ruler in a slaveholding government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2403"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> will justify me in the <num value="1">one</num> character, but not in the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2404"/>I must therefore separate them and renounce the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2405"/>Holding simply the station of a subject, as a Christian I may respect the powers that be, for the <rs>Lord</rs>'s sake, but I cannot make myself a partaker of their ungodly deeds by mingling in their counsels or assisting their operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2406"/><q direct="unspecified">Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2407"/></p> 
<p>Thus I find a way to <q direct="unspecified">cease to do evil</q>&mdash;now I would <q direct="unspecified">learn to do well.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2408"/>I have renounced active co-operation with the oppressor on whose territories I live; now I would find a way to put an end to his oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2409"/>But he is manifestly a reprobate: reproof and instruction only aggravate his sins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2410"/>I cannot attempt to reform him, because I am forbidden to <q direct="unspecified">cast pearls before swine.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2411"/>I must therefore either consent to remain a slave till <name n="God" type="God">God</name> removes the tyrant, or I must commence war upon him, by a <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">declaration of independence</rs> and other weapons suitable to the character of a son of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2412"/>I have chosen the latter course for the following reasons:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2413"/><num value="1">1</num>. As a believer in the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> I know that the territory of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> belongs to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and is promised, together with the dominion under the whole heaven, to <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n0186.0003.00146.01655" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName> and his followers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2414"/><num value="2">2</num>. I therefore know that the charter of every government now existing is limited by the will and prediction of him who ordained it; and every nation that expects or hopes for perpetual <pb id="p.147" n="147"/> existence outside of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0186.0003.00147.01656" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>'s kingdom is thereby proved guilty of infidelity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2415"/><num value="3">3</num>. By the same authority I know that the nations are to be dashed in pieces before the <name>Kingdom</name> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> can come and his will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2416"/>The present governments stand in the way of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> kingdom, just as Colonization once stood in the way of Abolition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2417"/>They occupy the ground, without effecting the object.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2418"/><num value="4">4</num>. I regard the existing governments as bearing the same relation to a dispensation that is to come, as that which the <name>Jewish</name> dispensation bore to the <rs>Christian</rs>&mdash;that is, they are preparatory forms of discipline, fitted to the childhood of the race&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">shadows of good things to come,</q> which are to be taken away when the substance appears.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2419"/><num value="5">5</num>. By the foregoing considerations I am authorized not only to hope for the overthrow of the nations, but to stand in readiness actively to assist in the execution of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> purposes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2420"/><num value="6">6</num>. The Son of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has manifestly, to me, chosen this country for the theatre of such an assault&mdash;a country which, by its boasting hypocrisy, has become the laughing-stock of the world, and by its lawlessness has fully proved the incapacity of man for self-government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2421"/><hi rend="italics">My hope of the millennium begins where Dr</hi>. <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Beecher,,,,," id="n0186.0003.00147.01657" reg="mostcommon:Beecher,Lyman,,,:7"><surname>Beecher</surname></persName>'s expires</hi>&mdash;viz., at the overthrow of this nation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2422"/><num value="7">7</num>. The signs of the times clearly indicate the purpose of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to do his strange work speedily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2423"/>The country is ripe for a convulsion like that of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>; rather, I should say, for the <rs>French Revolution</rs> reversed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2424"/>Infidelity roused the whirlwind in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2425"/>The <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, by anti-slavery and other similar movements, is doing the same work in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2426"/>So, in the end, <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n0186.0003.00147.01658" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName>, instead of a bloodthirsty <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0186.0003.00147.01659" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, will ascend the throne of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2427"/>The convulsion which is coming will be, not the struggle of death, but the travail of childbirth&mdash;the birth of a ransomed world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2428"/>I have stated to you only in the letter the principal things which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has urged upon me by his Spirit, and by which he has moved me to nominate <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n0186.0003.00147.01660" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName> for the <name>Presidency</name>, not only of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, but of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2429"/>Is it not high time for abolitionists to abandon a government whose <rs type="role2">President</rs> has declared war upon them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2430"/>I cannot but think that many of them hear the same great voice out of heaven which has waked me, saying, <q direct="unspecified">Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins and of her plagues.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2431"/>You said your mind was heaving on certain momentous subjects, and you only waited to set Anti-slavery in the sunshine before you turned <pb id="p.148" n="148"/> your mind to those subjects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2432"/>Allow me to suggest that you will set Anti-slavery in the sunshine only by making it tributary to Holiness; and you will most assuredly throw it into the shade which now covers Colonization if you suffer it to occupy the ground, in your own mind or in others, which ought to be occupied by Universal emancipation from sin. All the abhorrence which now falls upon slavery, intemperance, lewdness, and every other specific vice, will in due time be gathered into <num value="1">one</num> volume of victorious wrath against <hi rend="italics">unbelief</hi>. I wait for that time as for the day of battle, regarding all the previous movements as only fencing-schools and manoeuvres of military discipline&mdash;or at best as the preliminary skirmishes which precede a general engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2433"/>I counsel you, and the people that are with you, if you love the post of honor&mdash;the forefront of the hottest battle of righteousness&mdash;to set your face toward <hi rend="italics">perfect</hi> holiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2434"/>Your station is <num value="1">one</num> that gives you power over the nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2435"/>Your city is on a high hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2436"/>If you plant the standard of perfect holiness where you stand, many will see and flow to it. I judge from my own experience that you will be deserted by many of your present friends; but you will be deserted as <persName><foreName>Jonah</foreName></persName> was by the whale&mdash;the world, in vomiting you up, will heave you upon the dry land. . . .</p></body></text></p></quote> </p>

<p>As to the doctrine of <q direct="unspecified">perfect holiness,</q> I have not much to say. My observation of men concurs with the little study I have been able to bestow on the <rs>Old</rs> and New Testaments, in convincing me that men are not completely freed from sin by the grace of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, in this life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2918"/>That a marvellous change does take place, by the blessing of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> upon Gospel truth, I joyfully believe; but that a man, while in the body, is placed by it beyond the power of temptation, I must be allowed to doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2919"/>The history of Christianity is far from furnishing any proof to this effect, and the passages of Scripture you quote, when taken in their connection, and with the allowances, exceptions and reservations to which all general propositions, <hi rend="italics">not founded on strict definitions</hi>, are subject, do not seem to me to prove that a man cannot be holy in his <orgName n="General Character" type="misc">general character</orgName> without being altogether sinless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2920"/>He cannot of course be holy and sinful in the same act, and how many times and how far he may sin and yet repent and be forgiven, I shall not undertake to decide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2921"/>There are a great many things that I don't know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2922"/>But I must believe the testimony of my own senses in preference to anybody's interpretation of Scripture&mdash;for Scripture itself, after all, rests on the testimony of sense; and according to that testimony I have never yet met with a man who was free from sin. I am obliged to reject your own claim to sinlessness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2923"/>Your very letter refutes it. Hence I am obliged to reject your theory, or to believe that the gospel has never done its appropriate work within the range of my observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2924"/>If your theory could be established from Scripture, it would only make me an infidel, for I cannot receive a revelation which asserts that which my senses pronounce to be false, nor <num value="1">one</num> which visibly fails to accomplish its object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2925"/>On your theory, I must either believe that the gospel has been in the world <measure n="1800years" type="date">eighteen hundred years</measure> for nothing, or I must believe that pride and vanity, flattery and slander, are holy affections and righteous acts!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2926"/>To be sure, I may be saved from the dilemma by more evidence, but so far as what I have goes, I am transfixed on <num value="1">one</num> horn or the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2927"/>Still, therefore, am I obliged to mourn over your theological position as <q direct="unspecified">downright fanaticism,</q> and I pronounce it so with about the same confidence that I pronounce slaveholding a sin, but with far different feelings towards the subject of it.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2928"/>Your theory of <hi rend="italics">perfection</hi>, of course, takes away my hopes of salvation, which are not founded, as you intimate, on the <hi rend="italics">law</hi>, but on <hi rend="italics"><name n="God" type="God">God's</name> free grace to</hi> Sinners who, believing in <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0186.0003.00180.01888" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:11"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, <pb id="p.181" n="181"/> <hi rend="italics">desire</hi> to be <hi rend="italics">saved from sin</hi>.&mdash;But I have said more than I intended&mdash;more than I shall ever say again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3122"/>My <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impulse was, after thanking you for the favorable opinion which it implied, absolutely to decline it, as most repugnant to all my tastes and habits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3123"/>And I confess that, after well weighing the matter, I can hardly conceive that <q direct="unspecified">the early and toil-worn friends of the cause,</q> as you well describe them, can derive any support or encouragement from the approbation of their course expressed by <num value="1">one</num> of whose existence, from the retired habits of his life, they have probably never heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3124"/>Upon this point, however, you are much more competent to judge than I am; and if the publication of my letter, or anything else that I can say or do, can give the least pleasure to those admirable men, or the smallest assistance to the cause, I should hold myself inexcusable should I withhold it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3729"/>Hence, as a measure of sound policy&mdash;of safety to property, life, and liberty&mdash;of public quietude and private enjoyment&mdash;as well as on the ground of allegiance to him who is <rs type="role" reg="King">King</rs> of kings and <rs type="role">Lord</rs> of lords, we cordially adopt the non-resistance principle; being confident that it provides for all possible consequences, will ensure all things needful to us, is armed with omnipotent power, and must ultimately triumph over every assailing force.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3735"/>It appears to us a self-evident truth, that, whatever the gospel is designed to destroy at any period of the world, being contrary to it, ought now to be abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3736"/>If, then, the time is predicted when swords shall be beaten into ploughshares, and spears into pruning-hooks, and men shall not learn the art of war any more, it follows that all who manufacture, sell or wield those deadly weapons, do thus array themselves against the peaceful dominion of the son of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> on earth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3737"/>Having thus briefly, but frankly, stated our principles and purposes, we proceed to specify the measures we propose to adopt, in carrying our object into effect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3738"/>We expect to prevail through the <name>Foolishness</name> of preach-Ing&mdash;striving to commend ourselves unto every man's conscience, in the sight of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3739"/>From the press, we shall promulgate our sentiments as widely as practicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3740"/>We shall endeavor to secure the co-operation of all persons, of whatever name or sect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3741"/>The triumphant progress of the cause of temperance and of abolition in our land, through the instrumentality of benevolent and voluntary associations, encourages us to combine our own means and efforts for the promotion of a still greater cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3742"/>Hence, we shall employ lecturers, circulate tracts and publications, form societies, and petition our State and national governments, in relation to the subject of Uni-Versal Peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3743"/>It will be our leading object to devise ways and means for effecting a radical change in the views, feelings, and practices of society, respecting the sinfulness of war and the treatment of enemies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3744"/>In entering upon the great work before us, we are not unmindful that, in its prosecution, we may be called to test our sincerity, even as in a fiery ordeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3745"/>It may subject us to insult, outrage, suffering, yea, even death itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3746"/>We anticipate no <pb id="p.234" n="234"/> small amount of misconception, misrepresentation, calumny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3747"/>Tumults may arise against us. The ungodly and violent, the proud and pharisaical, the ambitious and tyrannical, principalities and powers, and spiritual wickedness in high places, may combine to crush us. So they treated the <name>Messiah</name>, whose example we are humbly striving to imitate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3748"/>If we suffer with him, we know that we shall reign with him. We shall not be afraid of their terror, neither be troubled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3749"/>Our confidence is in the <name n="God" type="God">Lord Almighty</name>, not in man. Having withdrawn from human protection, what can sustain us but that faith which overcomes the world?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3750"/>We shall not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try us, as though some strange thing had happened unto us; but rejoice, inasmuch as we are partakers of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0186.0004.00234.02466" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>'s sufferings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3751"/>Wherefore, we commit the keeping of our souls to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, in well-doing, as unto a faithful Creator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3752"/>For every <num value="1">one</num> that Forsakes Houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0186.0004.00234.02467" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>'s sake, shall receive A <num value="100">hundred</num> fold, and shall Inherit Everlasting Life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3753"/>Firmly relying upon the certain and universal triumph of the sentiments contained in this Declaration, however formidable may be the opposition arrayed against them&mdash;in solemn testimony of our faith in their divine origin&mdash;we hereby affix our signatures to it; commending it to the reason and conscience of mankind, giving ourselves no anxiety as to what may befall us, and resolving in the strength of the <name n="God" type="God">Lord God</name> calmly and meekly to abide the issue.</p></body></text></p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3756"/>Ms.</note> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3757"/>my dear <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0186.0004.00234.02471" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,W.,L.,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>: My unwillingness to be left out of the band of generous spirits who are joined with you in the holy work of disseminating what I hold to be true Christianity, makes me submit to you these brief considerations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3758"/>My chief present objection to signing the <name>Declaration</name> of Sentiments and Constitution is, that I conceive them to amount not only to a renunciation of civil government and the false principles on which it rests, but of everything connected with it and sanctioned <pb id="p.235" n="235"/> by it. Now I utterly repudiate the whole of the mankilling, <name n="God" type="God">God</name>-defying rights of power and bloodshed which that system assumes to have; but there are certain things originating in Government, and sanctioned by it, which I think are innocent, and may be innocently used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3759"/>For example, I do not see how <num value="1">one</num> who assents to the principles laid down in their unqualified extent can receive or pass a bank-bill, which is a promise of a corporation created by Government, depending upon it, and enforced by it by physical power in the last resort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3760"/>So with coined money: it bears the image and superscription of human government, and is guarded by severe laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3761"/>Now I cannot think it sinful to recognize government so far as to take or give away money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3762"/>So an <orgName n="Insurance Company" type="company">insurance company</orgName> is a creature of Government, and he who takes out a policy of insurance may call in the strong arm of the <rs>Law</rs> if his due be not accorded to him; but I cannot think it wrong to pay a premium of insurance, and receive the money in case of loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3763"/>To sue for it and compel payment is another thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3764"/>So the various instruments by which property is transferred or arranged involve the ultimate resort to force; but I cannot believe that every mortgage, deed, lease, contract, bond, etc., etc., is necessarily a sinful recognition of the man-killing, injury-resisting principle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3765"/>I grant that the resort to force is never to be had, but the injury to be submitted to and forgiven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3766"/>But the ordinary and innocent business of life can no more be carried on without these contrivances than it can without money; and I hold that a man giving or taking them without the intention of appealing to force at the inception, and without actual resort to it at the conclusion, of such contracts, no more recognizes the vicious principles of government than he does who takes or passes money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3767"/>Again, a monied or a benevolent corporation is a creature of Government; but I cannot think that I should sin in owning stock in a bank, <orgName n="Insurance Company" type="company">insurance company</orgName>, or railroad, or in becoming a trustee of a benevolent corporation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3768"/>I might mention a variety of other things, if I had time to think of them, which, though recognized by, originating in, and sustained by Government, I must think indifferent, and to involve no sacrifice of the non-resistant principle in him that has to do with them&mdash;provided he never actually resorts to the force provided for him, and never intends to do so. I take [it] the sinfulness of connexion with any of these things consists in the thought of violence, and in the act of violence; and that he <pb id="p.236" n="236"/> who never harbors the <num value="1">one</num> nor executes the other, is innocent of an undue compliance with the law of force.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3769"/>Now, my dear friend, I felt that by signing those instruments &mdash;<hi rend="italics">i. e</hi>., the <name>Declaration</name> and Constitution&mdash;cordially agreeing as I did with their spirit, I might lay a snare for my conscience, and find on consideration that the sentiments and principles to which I should subscribe were not my sentiments, and were principles by which I could not live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3770"/>Now you may see so clearly through these matters that you may feel no scruple about these things, and may not hold that these are legitimate inferences from the principles laid down&mdash;but so do not I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3771"/></p> 
<p>Now if the <name>Declaration</name> and Constitution can be so altered in phraseology as to say to this effect, that no man can innocently sue or defend a suit at law, or enter into any contract sanctioned by Government which rests ultimately on physical force, with the thought of violence in his heart, and can never resort to the power provided for him, I can sign them both with all my heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3772"/>Whether this can be consistently done or not, you will have my heart and prayers with you, and all that I can do by word or deed to assist you in your heavenly work.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3776"/>I need not say how anxious I feel, in common with many others, that you should join the <rs>Non-Resistance Society</rs>, and affix your name to the <name>Declaration</name> of Sentiments; but not, of course, until every scruple has been removed from your mind&mdash; for how can even <num value="2">two</num> walk together except they be agreed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3777"/>But I am certain that there is no difference in sentiment between us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3783"/>This instrument contemplates nothing, repudiates nothing, but the spirit of violence in thought, word and deed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3784"/>Whatever, therefore, may be done without provoking that spirit, and in accordance with the spirit of disinterested benevolence, is not touched or alluded to in the instrument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3785"/>The sum total of affirmation is this&mdash;that, the <rs>Lord</rs> helping us, we are resolved, come what may, as Christians, to have long-suffering toward those who may despitefully use and persecute us&mdash;to pray for them&mdash;to forgive them, in all cases.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3837"/>I feel as though the interest I take both in the cause of peace and that of abolition, will be a sufficient apology for the suggestion I am about to make; and though it may not, perhaps, meet with your approbation, I am sure that you will be aware that my earnest solicitude for the entire success of both these causes prompts me. I am desirous that the <rs>Non-Resistance Society</rs> should possess an organ of communication with the public other than the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi>, and this as well on account of the <num value="1">one</num> cause as the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3838"/>I fear that the introduction of non-resistance articles into the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> will ultimately prove a source of vexation and discord to the abolitionists, and that we shall spend more time in conflict upon this point among ourselves than is desirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3839"/>Upon anything that is part and parcel of abolition, I am willing,&mdash;yes, I am earnestly desirous, &mdash;that the anti-slavery party should divide, and divide again, if by that means their principles and measures may be maintained in their pristine purity; but, it is admitted by all, the doctrines of non-resistance are not identical with those of abolition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3840"/>I know that <hi rend="italics">these</hi> bear collaterally upon <hi rend="italics">those</hi>, and thus <pb id="p.241" n="241"/> far, of course, would I have them discussed together, but not farther unless the majority of real abolitionists wished it so to be. I know that if <hi rend="italics">half</hi> the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> were devoted to peace and non-resistance, you could, with the most perfect accuracy, assert that you were not connecting the <num value="2">two</num> causes; but a great number of the abolitionists are not candid enough or clear-minded enough to see this, and many others are so opposed to ultra peace views that they are unwilling to do anything that may, even indirectly, tend to their support.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3849"/>Not less do I think this arrangement expedient on account of its influence on the non-resistance cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3850"/>This subject cannot fully be gone into, justice cannot be done it, while the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> is the only organ it possesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3851"/>The non-resistance people feel as though it were a sort of sufferance, only, by which they have a place in the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi>, and do not therefore feel perfectly at liberty to bring forward their views there.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4074"/>dear friend: Accept my thanks for your kind and affectionate letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4075"/>I am truly grateful for your recollections of the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4076"/>Although I never doubt your affection for me, yet, as time passes and circumstances alter, it is refreshing and encouraging to have, now and then, a renewal of your continued regard for me, however unworthy of such regard I may esteem myself. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4077"/>During the past summer I have had a very good degree of health; but, as far as pecuniary matters are concerned, it has been the most anxious and wearisome season I ever experienced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4078"/>The truth is, that, according to my means and ability, I have undertaken too much business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4079"/>The bookstore, although profitable, has embarrassed me, for the want of capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4080"/>You, I think, will believe me when I say, that I assumed the responsibility of keeping a book establishment mainly for the purpose of having a place open for the general resort of the friends of the cause, and supplying our friends from the country with such tracts, etc., as they might [wish]. Profit I never anticipated: to make both ends meet was all I ever desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4081"/>You know, too, that of monied capital I was utterly destitute, and, also, that I possess but a very little of that cent per cent principle which I find to be absolutely more necessary for continued success in a large business than money itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4082"/>But I cannot acquire it: I had rather a <num value="1000">thousand</num> times, that my property be sacrificed, and be myself imprisoned, than that any debtor of mine suffer through my agency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4083"/>My creditors, I think, will not suffer, for, I believe, I have enough to satisfy them all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4084"/>My business has, imperceptibly almost, become quite extensive, and, for the lack of the several kinds of the foregoing capital, it is embarrassing, although I am sure it has been profitable, and is daily becoming more so. My stock, exclusive of printing apparatus, has accumulated to <measure n="4000dollars" type="currency">$4000</measure>, wholesale prices, and I cannot turn it fast enough to meet my <pb id="p.256" n="256"/> payments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4085"/>I should have met every payment, however, had I not, in various ways, during the past year, been deprived of about <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">$1000</measure>, which I allotted upon to meet payments which are now becoming due, and which I have not the means to meet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4086"/>So that, I must either fail, obtain an extension from my creditors, or sell out my stock at a fair valuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4087"/>The latter, of course, would be most agreeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4088"/>The bookstore has done the cause good service, I am sure, and ought not to be abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4089"/>With a small capital it can be made profitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4090"/>All things considered, I cannot but think that justice&mdash;not <hi rend="italics">legal</hi>, but moral, justice&mdash;upon a fair representation of my concerns to the <name>Board</name> of the <name>Mass</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4091"/>A. S. S., would induce them to take the stock, appoint an agent, and continue the store as usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4092"/>This would enable me to pay off my debts and hold up my head, and, in the end, be a pecuniary benefit to the <name>Society</name>, as I firmly believe.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4093"/>The <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> I still desire to hold on to, as printer, and want but a fair price for the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4094"/>For the past <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> I have labored under many disadvantages in printing it, and have been subject to several expenses in relation to it, which the changes in public sentiment would enable me to avoid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4095"/>Still, I think <measure n="40cents" type="currency">40 cents</measure> per <dateStruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></dateStruct> ems and <measure n="80cents" type="currency">80 cents</measure> per token is nothing more than a fair price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4096"/>But if it is thought best, I am willing to leave the concern entirely, provided the <name>Society</name> or individuals will take my stock and materials and pay my creditors as their demands become due, I guaranteeing that the stock and materials, at a fair valuation, shall amount to a sufficient sum to meet all demands.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4097"/>Knowing the interest you take in my welfare, I have thus given you a candid though not a detailed statement of my affairs, hoping for your advice. . . .</p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4205"/>The real cause of this opposition, in my opinion, is the fundamental principle upon which the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> has been conducted:&mdash;that rights are more valuable than forms; that truth is a better guide than prescription; that no matter how much truth a sect embodies, no matter how useful a profession may be, no matter how much benefit any form of government may confer, still they are all but dust in the balance when weighed against the protection of human rights, the discussion and publication of great truths; that all forms of human device are worse than useless when they stand in Truth's way. These are its principles; frank, fearless singleheartedness, the utmost freedom of thought and speech, its characteristics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4930"/>The proposition was finally laid on the table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4931"/>My main reason for voting for this disposition of it was this:&mdash;To have nominated candidates would have been a surprise on the great mass of our friends.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4932"/>Nothing of the kind was indicated in the call.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4933"/>It was a local meeting, called for special objects at the <rs>West</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4934"/>It was local in its representation, being confined chiefly to <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4935"/>The measure was as extraordinary as would have been a dissolution of the <name>Society</name>, and therefore our auxiliary societies would have been aggrieved by it, greatly.

It would have been thought a trick, getting away out here and doing what we knew we could not do at the centre.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4938"/>No; so extraordinary a move as the nomination of national candidates, in my opinion, should not be made by the <rs>Am. Society</rs> without due notice to that effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4939"/>Give due notice, and then all are bound to take notice and be present, or forever after hold their peace.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4940"/>This is my plan.

<p>Dear Sir: Herewith I attempt the discharge of a duty to which I doubt not that I am led by the dictates of an enlightened conscience, and by the influences of the <name>Spirit</name> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5290"/>I have been led, of late, to look over my past life, and to inquire what I would think of past feelings and actions, were I to behold <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n0186.0006.00335.03557" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName> in the clouds of heaven, coming to judge the world, and to establish His reign of holiness and righteousness and blessedness over the pure in heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5291"/>From such an <pb id="p.336" n="336"/> examination of my past life, I find very much, even in what I have regarded as my best actions, deeply to deplore; but especially do I find occasion for shame and self-loathing and deep humiliation before <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and man, when I see in what multiplied instances the ruling motive of my conduct has been a desire to please men, for the sake of their good opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5292"/>In seeking the promotion of good objects, I have often acted with this in view; but I feel bound in duty to say to you, sir, that to gain the good &mdash; will of man was the only object I had in view, in everything which I did relative to certain writings called <q direct="unspecified">Clerical Appeal.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5293"/>I cannot say that I was conscious at the time, certainly not as fully as I am now, that this was the motive by which I was actuated; but as I now look back upon it, in the light in which it has of late been spread before my own mind, as I doubt not by the <name>Spirit</name> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, I can clearly see that, in all that matter, I had no true regard for the glory of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> or the good of man. I can see nothing better in it than a selfish and most wicked desire to gain thereby the good opinion of such men as I supposed would be pleased by such movements; while I can clearly see that I did not consult the will of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> or the good of my fellow-men, in the least, and did indulge toward yourself and others, and toward principles which I now see to be according to truth, feelings which both my conscience and my heart now condemn, which I know a holy <name n="God" type="God">God</name> never can approve, and which I <hi rend="italics">rejoice</hi> to think He never will approve.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5294"/>I send you this communication because my conscience and my heart lead me to do it; because I think the truth and the <name>Spirit</name> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> approve it, and influence me to do it; and not because I expect or wish thereby to secure the applause of man, or even to regain any good &mdash; will of man which I may have lost by actions which I now wholly disapprove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5295"/>I trust I have learned higher principles of action; at least, I know I must learn them, or be in fearful circumstances in that day when <q direct="unspecified">every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit must be hewn down and cast into the fire.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5928"/>Why, which of the delegates had the right to reject the rest?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5929"/>As well might the women have conspired to vote out the men, as the men have undertaken to exclude the women. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5930"/>It was said that the <rs>London</rs> meeting resolved, from the beginning, to keep out other questions &mdash; to discuss nothing but Anti-slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5931"/>Then I turn to that Convention and tell them that, in excluding women, they <hi rend="italics">did</hi> undertake to settle another great question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5932"/>I say that, in that act, they swerved from their abolition integrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5933"/>If our credentials were true, <pb id="p.374" n="374"/> there should have been an end of the matter.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5935"/>I heard . . . an apology for the <rs>London</rs> meeting, in that it had not opened its sessions with vocal prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5936"/>It was said that, as the <rs>Convention</rs> was composed of men entertaining every variety of religious belief, it was judged best to save the feelings of those who were conscientiously opposed to formal observances,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5939"/>Once more, as to our refusal to join the meeting.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6290"/>esteemed friend: At your request, I sit down to give you my opinion as to the prospect of the speedy and peaceable overthrow of slavery in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6291"/>Let me say, then&mdash;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6292"/><num value="1">1</num>. That Christianity sanctions the use of nothing but moral and religious means and measures for the suppression of any sin, or the overthrow of any system of iniquity&mdash;in other words, it forbids the doing of evil that good may come, however vast the good to be achieved, or small the evil to be resorted to for its accomplishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6293"/>To bring the products of free labor into competition with those of slave labor, and thus secure the abolition of slavery and the slave trade throughout the world, is a peaceable, legitimate, and <name>Christian</name> measure, which commends itself to the approval of all good men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6294"/><num value="2">2</num>. That there is not any instance recorded, either in sacred or profane history, in which the oppressors and enslavers of mankind, except in individual cases, have been induced, by mere moral suasion, to surrender their despotic power, and let the oppressed go free; but, in nearly every instance, from the time that <persName><foreName>Pharaoh</foreName></persName> and his hosts were drowned in the <placeName reg="Red Sea" key="tgn,7016791">Red Sea</placeName>, down to <pb id="p.392" n="392"/> the present day, they have persisted in their evil course until sudden destruction came upon them, or they were compelled to surrender their ill-gotten power in some other manner.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6295"/><num value="3">3</num>. That the emancipation of the <num value="800000">eight hundred thousand</num> bondmen in the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">British West India</placeName> Colonies forms no exception to this lamentable truth&mdash;as it was effected by the colossal power of the mother country, and in opposition to the feelings and wishes of the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West India</placeName> planters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6296"/>That power, it is true, was stirred up by the moral and religious action of the people of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>; but, had the liberation of the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West India</placeName> slaves depended upon the triumph of moral suasion <hi rend="italics">in the colonies</hi> over the depravity of the planters, there is not the slightest probability that it would have taken place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6297"/>Indeed, it is certain that the planters would never have allowed any antislavery agitation among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6298"/>The mere suspicion, a few years since, that the <rs>Wesleyan</rs> and <rs>Baptist</rs> missionaries sympathized with the slave population, and were hostile to slavery, raised such a tempest of fury against them that their chapels were ruthlessly destroyed, and they were either cast into prison or compelled to flee for their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6299"/>The slaveholding power, wherever it holds absolute sway, will never tolerate any movement for its overthrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6300"/>There is, therefore, no liberty of speech or of the press in the slave States of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, and, consequently, no chance for the exercise of moral influence against slavery in that section of the country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6301"/><num value="4">4</num>. That, of all oppressors and tyrants who have cursed and afflicted mankind, none have ever equalled the enslavers of the colored race,&mdash;<hi rend="italics">especially <orgName n="American Republican" type="newspaper">American republican</orgName> slaveholders</hi>,&mdash;in ferociousness of spirit, moral turpitude of character, and desperate depravity of heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6302"/>I regard their conversion, as a body, to the side of bleeding humanity, by appeals to their understandings, consciences, and hearts, about as hopeless as any attempt to transform wolves and hyenas into lambs and doves, by the same process.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6303"/>Their understandings have become brutish, their consciences seared as with a hot iron, and their hearts harder than adamant.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6304"/><num value="5">5</num>. That nothing will induce them to manumit their slaves but an utter inability to compete with the labor of freemen, in raising those productions which now give life and sustenance to the slave system; in connection with a rectified public sentiment, that shall everywhere regard them as the deadliest enemies of the human race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6305"/><pb id="p.393" n="393"/></p> 
<p><num value="6">6</num>. That it is by the cultivation of cotton alone, and the purchase of that article by <name>British</name> manufacturers, that American slavery puts at defiance the opinions of the civilized world, baffles the efforts of the abolitionists of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> for its speedy overthrow, and raises an impenetrable wall of defence against the attacks of its enemies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6306"/><num value="7">7</num>. That if <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> would supply herself with free cotton from some other part of the world, to the exclusion of all slave-grown cotton, it is quite certain that, within <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure>, American slavery would be peaceably abolished, from absolute necessity, as well as from the moral change which will by that time have been wrought in the free States of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, in opposition to that hideous system of plunder and outrage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6307"/><num value="8">8</num>. That it now seems to be placed beyond all doubt that cotton can be grown by free labor, at a much less expense, and in far greater abundance, in <placeName reg="Bharat" key="tgn,7000198">British India</placeName>, than it is now done by slave labor in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>: hence, that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, as a matter of self-interest, as well as on the score of humanity, should without delay redress the wrongs of <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName>, give protection and encouragement to its oppressed and suffering population, and thus obtain a cheap, permanent and abundant supply of free cotton from her own vast and fertile possessions in the <rs>East</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6308"/>I am sure that your <placeName reg="Bharat" key="tgn,7000198">British India</placeName> movement will fill the hearts of American slaveholders with dismay.<note anchored="yes">
