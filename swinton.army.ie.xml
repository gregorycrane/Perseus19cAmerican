<head>I. The <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> in history.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>So soon as the passionate rushing to arms that succeeded the bombardment and fall of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> had indicated that a great war was upon the sundered sections of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>, it became manifest that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> was marked out as the principal theatre of the impending conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>The tidings of what had happened in the harbor of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> found that State assembled at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> in high debate on the question of Secession; and then whatever there was in its councils of what men called <q direct="unspecified">Unionism</q> or conservatism was hushed, and in wild tumult <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> was voted out of the <rs>Union</rs> and into the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>This, <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> voted on the <dateStruct value="1861-04-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>; but from her eyes was hid what else she voted&mdash;to wit, a War destined to redden all her streams, to desolate her fertile fields, to cut off the flower of her young men, and to leave her at its close a wreck and waif of fortune.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>When <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> linked her destiny with the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, those who controlled the <rs>Secession Revolution</rs> signified their appreciation of the accession of that ancient and powerful Commonwealth by transferring to her chief city the capital of <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>; and whereas that Government had borne the prefix <q direct="unspecified">provisional</q> at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>, at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> it assumed to itself the style and title of <q direct="unspecified">permanent.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Thus marked out as a seat of war by virtue of being the administrative centre of the insurgent power, <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> was furthermore marked out as the main seat of war by her geographical relations as a frontier State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>For upon her secession the <rs>Potomac</rs>, her northern boundary, became, for all the region between the <rs>Atlantic</rs> and <placeName reg="Allegheny Mountains" key="tgn,7020004" type="mountainrange">the Alleghanies</placeName>, the dividing line betwixt those <q direct="unspecified">points of mighty opposites,</q> the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>,&mdash;names which, hitherto of no more than political import, now assumed the new and dread significance of belligerent Powers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Thus, by her will and by fate, <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> became the <name>Flanders</name> of the war. And already, from the moment the events in <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName> made war flagrant, armed men, in troops and battalions, hurried forward, from the <rs>North</rs> and from the <rs>South</rs>, to her borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>An equal fire animated both sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/><persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0227.0001.00014.00001" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:4"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> called for <num value="75000">seventy-five thousand</num> men; <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0227.0001.00014.00002" reg="mostcommon:Davis,B.,F.,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, for a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num>,&mdash;armies of a proportion never before seen on the <rs>Western</rs> continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Yet such was the spontaneous alacrity with which on each side the summons was obeyed, that within the space of a few weeks, these limits were greatly overpassed, and an additional call for <num value="0.5">a half</num> <num value="1000000">million</num> men on the part of the <rs>North</rs>, and a levy <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> on the part of the <rs>South</rs>, met a like response.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Then by that new agent of transport that has wrought a revolution in military operations no less than in the movement of commerce, the volunteers were quickly conveyed to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> from points so distant and divergent as to strike the imagination with wonder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>It is estimated that for many weeks after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> call for troops, armed men arrived in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, from all parts of the <rs>South</rs>, at the rate of from <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> to <num value="2000">two thousand</num> daily; and the multitude poured forth from the populous <rs>North</rs> was not less, but greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>From the loyal States, the point of concentration was <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0227.0001.00014.00003" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, where for a time the gathering force held a simply defensive attitude: then bursting the <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> barrier of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, it launched itself upon that soil which the men of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> fondly named <q direct="unspecified">sacred,</q> and the history of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> began.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>I design in this volume to record, as far as may now be done, what that Army did and suffered in <num value="10">ten</num> campaigns and twoscore battles, in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>This history, if adequately made, must be the history also of much the larger part of that gigantic war that, originating in the secession of <num value="11">eleven</num> States from the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, ended, after <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, in the establishment of that Union on a lasting basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>For though this conflict assumed continental proportions and raged around a circumference of many <measure n="1000miles" type="distance">thousand miles</measure>, it was observed that its head and front remained alway in that stretch of territory between the <rs>Potomac</rs> and the <rs>James</rs>, and between the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs> and the <rs>Chesapeake</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Here, from the start, each belligerent, as by common consent, concentrated its richest resources; here, throughout the struggle, each continued to sustain its greatest armies, under its ablest commanders: and never for a day did it lose its military primacy in the eyes of either party to the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It is estimated that out of the half <num value="1000000">million</num> men who met death, and the <num value="2000000">two million</num> who suffered wound in the war&mdash;the losses of both sides, and the casualties of all the battles and sieges over the whole continental field of action, being included&mdash; above <num value="0.5">one-half</num> this appalling aggregate belongs to the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> and its adversary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>These losses are the summing up of a series of campaigns and battles as grand in their proportions as any on record, waged with a remorseless energy, wrought out with all the resources that modern art has devised to make war deadly, and fought upon a theatre peculiar in its character and the conditions of warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>That theatre is <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>&mdash;a colossal canvas whereon moving masses and the forms of wrestling armies appear.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The history of the <rs>War</rs> for the <rs>Union</rs> would set forth that majestic exhibition of power by which a free People, without military traditions, created great armies, waged a national <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> war, and subdued an internal revolt of a magnitude without parallel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>But my present province is more restricted, and embraces the story of <num value="1">one</num> alone of these armies, though the main <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>I shall have to trace how this force arose, and its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> essays and failures; how it grew into the shape and substance of an army; and how it then entered upon campaigns, bloody, indecisive, and protracted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>I shall have to show how this army, losing again and again the component parts of its structure,&mdash;thinned by death, and wounds, and wasting disease, and filled up again and again by the unquenched patriotism of the <name>People</name>,&mdash;never lost its individual being, but remained the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> still; and I shall have to follow those changing phases that the life of an army, not less than the life of an individual, undergoes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>I shall have to celebrate the unswerving loyalty of this army, that, ofttimes when the bond of military cohesion failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>held it, unshaken of fortune, to a duty self-imposed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>I shall have to follow it through a checkered experience, in a tale commingled of great misfortunes, great follies, and great glories; but from <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to last it will appear, that amid many buffets of fortune, through <q direct="unspecified">winter and rough weather,</q> the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> never gave up, but made a good fight, and finally reached the goal.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Nor can there fail to arise the image of that other Army that was the adversary of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>&mdash;and which, who can ever forget that once looked upon it?&mdash;that array of <q direct="unspecified">tattered uniforms and bright muskets</q>&mdash;that body of incomparable infantry, the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>&mdash; which for <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> carried the <name>Revolt</name> on its bayonets, opposing a constant front to the mighty concentration of power brought against it; which, receiving terrible blows, did not fail to give the like; and which, vital in all its parts, died only with its annihilation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Of this drama there will be no other hero than the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> itself; for it would seem that in this war of the <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> People it was decreed there should arise no imperial presence to become the central figure and cynosure of men's eyes <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0227.0001.00017.00004" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, in an outburst of haughty eloquence, exclaims that in the great armies of history the <rs>Commander</rs> was every thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/><q direct="unspecified">It was not,</q> says he, <q direct="unspecified">the <rs>Roman</rs> army that conquered <persName n="Gaul,,,,," id="n0227.0001.00017.00005" reg="mostcommon:Gaul,nomatch:0"><surname>Gaul</surname></persName>, but <persName n="Caesar,,,,," id="n0227.0001.00017.00006" reg="mostcommon:Caesar,nomatch:0"><surname>Caesar</surname></persName>; it was not the <name>Carthaginian</name> army that made <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> tremble at her gates, but <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n0227.0001.00017.00007" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName>; it was not the <rs>Macedonian</rs> army that marched to the <name>Indus</name>, but <persName n="Alexander,,,,," id="n0227.0001.00017.00008" reg="mostcommon:Alexander,nomatch:0"><surname>Alexander</surname></persName>; it was not the <name>Prussian</name> army that defended <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName> for <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> against the <num value="3">three</num> most powerful States of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, but <persName><foreName>Frederick</foreName></persName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>This proud apotheosis has no application for the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>And <num value="1">one</num> must think &mdash;seeing it never had a great, and generally had mediocre commanders&mdash;it was that it might be said, that whatever it won it owed not to genius, but bought with its blood.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>I must now add, that it would be to fail to draw some of the most important lessons furnished by the history of the army whose deeds form the subject-matter of this volume, if I should fail to set forth the relations of that army with the central authority at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The conduct of a war under a popular government introduces new conditions into the established military system and traditions, and greatly complicates the duties of the commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Now the history of the <rs>American</rs> war affords a new and enlarged exhibition of the behavior of a democratical Executive, suddenly plunged into the governance of great military affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>While a sense of justice will suggest the exercise of much lenience in the judgment of an Administration called to a difficult task, it is none the less incumbent on the historian to point out errors and follies that cost much.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>In the campaigns of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> there is presented a remarkable unity, both as regards the theatre of operations and the objective of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The theatre was <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>; the objective, <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> military aspiration of the <rs>North</rs> expressed itself in the vehement cry, <q direct="unspecified">On to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>:</q> and when, after many battles and campaigns, <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> &mdash;more than any man then dreamed,&mdash;Richmond fell, the structure of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> fell with it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>But though the sphere of action is in the main bounded by the geographical figure of the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>, it resulted from the fact of the war assuming twice on the part of the insurgent force an aggressive character, that its area must be extended so as to include a part of the territory of the contiguous States of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>This circumstance does not destroy, however, the unity of the zone within which the <name>Armies</name> of the <rs>Potomac</rs> and of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Virginia</placeName> operated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The battles of <placeName key="tgn,7016218" n="1.000 581" reg="antietam, washington, maryland">Antietam</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 4" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName>&mdash;the <num value="2">two</num> actions out of the limits of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>&mdash;were fought in the narrow salient of a great triangle, having the southern boundary line of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> as its base, the <placeName reg="Shenandoah Valley, Carroll, Ohio" key="tgn,2658284">Shenandoah</placeName> and <placeName reg="Cumberland Valley, Bedford, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2271538">Cumberland valleys</placeName> as its western side, and the <placeName reg="West Branch Susquehanna River, Pennsylvania, United States" key="tgn,2758145">Susquehanna River</placeName> and <placeName reg="Chesapeake Bay, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7013592">Chesapeake Bay</placeName> as its eastern side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>From its apex, this triangle measures <measure n="750miles" type="distance">seven hundred and fifty miles</measure> on its mountainside, and about <measure n="300miles" type="distance">three hundred miles</measure> on its western side, with <measure n="500miles" type="distance">five hundred miles</measure> on its base line.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Now if it be considered that within this comparatively restricted space, <num value="2">two</num> great armies manoeuvred and fought during the protracted period of <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, and that for all that time, though surging backwards and forwards, each maintained its essential vantage-ground, there will arise the inference, either that the operations were conducted with little vigor, or else that there must have been some peculiar conditions that shut out victory from sooner declaring itself on the <num value="1">one</num> side or the other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>But the former supposition is excluded by the palpable evidence, notorious to all the world, of a long bead-roll of bloody battles, and the terrible aggregate of losses sustained, in this conflict of <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0227.0001.00018.00009" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> with <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0227.0001.00018.00010" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It results therefore that we must seek in the alternative the explanation of a historic fact seemingly so unaccountable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>I shall briefly set forth some of the leading elements that enter into this problem as it stands related to the theatre of operations in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and the conditions of warfare upon that <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> theatre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>A proper appreciation of these conditions will help to explain the many bloody but indecisive battles that characterized the <rs>Virginia</rs> campaigns, and must modify the conclusions of those who, from a distance, vainly seek to apply the principles and precedents of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> warfare to a region having hardly <num value="1">one</num> mentionable element in common.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>From the <rs>Potomac</rs>, as base, to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, on the left bank of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James</placeName>, as objective, the distance is <measure n="110miles" type="distance">one hundred and ten miles</measure>; and it is to be noted, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of all, that in this zone an army upon the defensive has its operations facilitated, while an army assuming the offensive has its operations rendered difficult, from the fact that the water-shed being towards the coast, all the rivers cross any line of manoeuvre against <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>These rivers are: the <rs>Occoquan</rs>, formed by the union of <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2229381" n="1.000 6" reg="cedar mountain, culpeper, virginia">Cedar Run</placeName>; the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, swelled by the converging tides of the <placeName reg="Rapidan, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1129009">Rapidan</placeName> and <placeName reg="Hedgman river">Hedgman rivers</placeName>; the <rs>Mattapony</rs>, which results from the confluence of <num value="4">four</num> streams, named the <rs>Mat</rs>, the <rs>Ta</rs>, the <rs>Po</rs>, and the <rs>Ny</rs>; the <rs>Pamunkey</rs>, formed by the <orgName n="North Union" type="union">union of the North</orgName> and <placeName key="tgn,1130215" n="1.000 30" reg="south anna, virginia, united states">South Anna</placeName>; and the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, which has its embouchure in the <rs>James</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The Confederates found eligible lines of defence along these rivers, which they used to great advantage, from the time when, at the opening of the war, <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0227.0001.00019.00011" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> formed his array along <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, to when, almost <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> thereafter, <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0227.0001.00019.00012" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> disputed with <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0227.0001.00019.00013" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:7"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> the passage of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, and compelled the <rs>Union</rs> commander to seek a new base south of the <rs>James</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The mountain system of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is thrown off on the western flank of the theatre of operations, where the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs> forms, with that parallel ridge called successively the <rs>Clinch</rs>, Middle, and <placeName reg="Shenandoah Mountains, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2658273">Shenandoah mountains</placeName>, the picturesque and fertile <placeName reg="Shenandoah Valley, Carroll, Ohio" key="tgn,2658284">Valley of the Shenandoah</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>This valley, from its direction <name>north</name> and <name>south</name>, and its peculiar topographical relations, is an eminently aggressive line for a hostile force moving northward to cross the <rs>Potomac</rs> into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, either with the view of penetrating <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> or of manoeuvring <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> towards <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>It was by this line that <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0227.0001.00020.00014" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> issued upon the soil of the loyal States on the occasion of both the <rs>Confederate</rs> invasions&mdash;to wit, the <rs>Maryland</rs> invasion of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, and the <rs>Pennsylvania</rs> invasion of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>This circumstance compelled, throughout the war, the constant presence of a considerable army to guard the <hi rend="italics">debotuche</hi> of this great valley and the passes of the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs>; and the <placeName reg="Shenandoah, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002190">Shenandoah</placeName> region was the scene of a series of operations having an intimate relation with those of the main theatre, which in general terms may be defined as the territory between the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs> and the <rs>Chesapeake</rs>, and between the <rs>Potomac</rs> and the <rs>James</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>This region has, as its characteristic feature, a dense forest of oak and pine, with occasional clearings&mdash;rarely extensive enough, however, to prevent the riflemen concealed in their margins from covering the whole opening with their fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The roads are few, bad, and form so many defiles; and it was, throughout the war, commonly necessary for the axeman to precede the artillerist, to hew for him a path.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>It is rare, in all this tract of country, to find a field in which cavalry can have any legitimate play; and it frequently happened that, owing to the density of the forest, not even artillery could be employed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>It is easy to see that under these circumstances military operations must assume many peculiarities; and, it is to be added, these were quite in favor of the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The abundance of wood afforded such facility for the construction of breastworks and abatis, that, during all the late years of the <rs>Virginia</rs> campaigns, actions were invariably waged behind and about hastily improvised ramparts of earth and logs, with which every <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> gained was instantly intrenched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Under cover of these rude yet strong <q direct="unspecified">coigns of vantage,</q>&mdash; with the infantry protected by a parapet, and equipped with the improved arms&mdash;with rifled artillery sweeping a front of <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3000yards" type="distance">three thousand yards</measure>, and this front obstructed by <q direct="unspecified">slashings,</q> &mdash;the army on the defensive might await, with comparative security, the approach of lines of battle that were almost foredoomed <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> to repulse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>If, peradventure, driven from <num value="1">one</num> line, the enemy could, with the greatest ease, take up another, and another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>A campaign thus became a kind of rough siege; and in this state of facts, even victory was generally fruitless, because pursuit was impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The task of the commander increased in difficulty in the same proportion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Shut out from sight, and often even from hearing, the general on the field of battle was constrained to work in a manner blindfold, and compelled to rely on the firmness of his troops till couriers should arrive to bring tidings of the fight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>But the obstructions that beset American warfare are not confined to these distinguishing features of the <hi rend="italics">terrain;</hi> for the difficulty of any extended operation became greatly enhanced by the question of subsistence, on which the mobility of an army so largely depends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>There are <num value="2">two</num> maxims that forcibly set forth the bearing of the commissariat on wars of invasion: the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is the saying of <persName><foreName>Frederick</foreName></persName> the <rs>Great</rs>, that <q direct="unspecified">an army, like a serpent, moves on its belly;</q> the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> is the declaration of <persName n="Caesar,,,,," id="n0227.0001.00021.00015" reg="mostcommon:Caesar,nomatch:0"><surname>Caesar</surname></persName>, that <q direct="unspecified">war must support war.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The former of these maxims asserts the absolute dependence of military operations on the means of feeding the operating army; the latter, that this dependence should be simplified by drawing supplies from the country in which the troops act. But while it is no less true in <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName> than elsewhere that <q direct="unspecified">an army, like a serpent, moves on its belly,</q> the actual condition did not permit of carrying out the admonition to <q direct="unspecified">make war support war.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>In the densely populated countries of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, it is easy, from the resources of the country, to subsist an army of a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> men; and <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0227.0001.00021.00016" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, while operating in the basins of the <rs>Rhine</rs> and <rs>Danube</rs>, and in the rich granaries of <placeName reg="Belgie" key="tgn,1000063">Belgium</placeName>, <placeName reg="Italia" key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and Swabia, constantly supported by requisitions much greater numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>But in proportion as the population becomes thin, the productive forces decrease, and local sources of supply for an army decline or disappear altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>What is possible in <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, therefore, is impracticable in <placeName reg="Polska" key="tgn,7006366">Poland</placeName>, <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName>, or <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>In <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, no dependence whatever could be placed on procuring <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> local subsistence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The area of manoeuvre was, therefore, circumscribed by the amount of rations that could be carried on the persons of the soldiers and in wagons, which in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> was not more than sufficient for from <num value="10">ten</num> to <measure n="16days" type="date">sixteen days</measure>; while its transport necessitated immense trains of <num value="2">two</num>, <num value="3">three</num>, and <num value="4000">four thousand</num> wagons&mdash;an overgrown mass of <hi rend="italics">impedimenta</hi> that made rapidity of movement almost impossible, and constantly bound in the commander to saucy doubts and fears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Indeed, what alone made operations over the immense tracts of country overrun by the <rs>Union</rs> armies practicable were, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that new element in warfare, the railroad; and, secondly, the command of the seaboard by the <rs>North</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Now taking into account this cardinal maxim of American warfare, that an army operating over a large tract of country must pivot either on a railroad or a river, it appears that from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> as a base, a force advancing against <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> by the overland route, and having at the same time to cover <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, is restricted to <num value="2">two</num> lines of manoeuvre: <num value="1">1</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The line of the <orgName n="Orange and Alexandria Railroad" type="railroad">Orange and Alexandria Railroad</orgName>; <num value="2">2</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>The line of the <orgName n="Fredericksburg and Richmond Railroad" type="railroad">Fredericksburg and Richmond Railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Each of these lines was repeatedly essayed during the <rs>Virginia</rs> campaigns&mdash; the former by <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n0227.0001.00022.00017" reg="mostcommon:Pope,V.,Exit,,:1"><surname>Pope</surname></persName> and <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n0227.0001.00022.00018" reg="mostcommon:Meade,G.,G.,,:1"><surname>Meade</surname></persName>; the latter by <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n0227.0001.00022.00019" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,A.,E.,,:1"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n0227.0001.00022.00020" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,A.,,,:1"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Touching the merits of these lines, experience confirmed what theory would have postulated: that the line of the <orgName n="Orange and Alexandria Railroad" type="railroad">Orange and Alexandria Railroad</orgName>, though an eminently defensive line as regards <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, is hardly aggressive; and beyond the <rs>Rapidan</rs> involves so many complex considerations that no commander was ever able, on this line, to push an advance south of that river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> route is an aggressive line as regards <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, though it is surrounded with many difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>It is not, however, a good defensive line as regards <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>; and experience has shown that an army operating by that line, and having also to cover <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, may readily be dislodged from it and forced to attempt to regain the <placeName reg="Orange, Orange, Virginia" key="tgn,7014299">Orange</placeName> and <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> line by a simple menace against the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>And this fact suggests the reflection that railroads in war, though affording great facilities for <pb id="p.23" n="23"/> transport, and permitting the execution of operations that, without this resource, would be impracticable, have their own peculiar drawbacks, and require the detachment of a considerable part of the active force for their protection against hostile raids.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>But it may be said that the possession by the <rs>North</rs> of the whole <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> seaboard gave many other secondary bases and lines of operation, free from the objections above mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>This is undoubtedly true; yet the statement must be taken with the limitations that belong to it. The most important of these lines are the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs> between the <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York</placeName> and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James rivers</placeName>, and the route by the south side of the <rs>James</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The former was adopted by <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0227.0001.00023.00021" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> in the spring of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, and the latter was eventually taken up by <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0227.0001.00023.00022" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:7"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> in the summer of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, after having, in a remarkable campaign, crossed every possible line of operation against <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>But it is manifest that <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> could be operated against from the coast only by an army that was in condition to leave <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> out of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>The secession of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> made the <rs>Potomac</rs> the dividing line between <num value="2">two</num> warring powers; and the unfortunate location of the national capital on the banks of that river, and on an exposed frontier, profoundly affected the character of military operations in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and, during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of the war, caused a subordination of all strategic combinations to the protection of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Now, in the former case, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> menace by <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0227.0001.00023.00025" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> foreshadowing a northward movement caused the withdrawal of the army from the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>; and, in the latter instance, a small raiding column, detached by way of the <orgName n="Shenandoah Valley" type="newspaper">Shenandoah Valley</orgName> into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, compelled <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0227.0001.00023.00026" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:7"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> to part with <num value="2">two</num> of his corps to protect the national capital, and, for the time, almost suspended active operations before <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>It remains now to add that the gigantic war whose principal <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> field was <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> was <num value="1">one</num> that, from its very nature, threw the burden of the offensive on the side of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>For, as the <rs>National Government</rs> undertook to subdue the insurrection of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, it rested with it to strike, and with the <rs>South</rs> to parry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>But it soon became apparent that the task was very different from that involved in the quelling of an ordinary rebellion, and that the conflict had, from the unanimity of hostile sentiment at the <rs>South</rs>, the vast extent of territory in insurrection, and the mighty force in arms, all the character of a war waged between <num value="2">two</num> powerful nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Now, of all the forms that war may assume, that is the most formidable which is denominated a <q direct="unspecified">National War,</q> the nature of which is thus powerfully depicted by the greatest of military theorists: <q direct="unspecified">The difficulties in the path of an army in National wars are very great, and render the mission of the general conducting them very arduous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>The invader has only an army; his adversaries have an army and a people wholly, or almost wholly, in arms&mdash;a people making means of resistance out of every thing, each individual of whom conspires against the common enemy; so that even the non-combatants have an interest in his ruin, and accelerate it by every means in their power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>He holds scarcely any ground but that upon which he encamps; and, outside the limits of his camp, every thing is hostile, and multiplies a thousandfold the difficulties he meets at every step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Each armed inhabitant knows the smallest paths and their connections; he finds everywhere a relative or friend who aids him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/></p> 
<p>It needs not to tell any <num value="1">one</num> who has followed the history of the <rs>Virginia</rs> campaigns, that every sling and arrow thus graphically shown to assail an army penetrating a hostile country in which the population as well as the army enters into the belligerency, did harass the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Yet it is not possible that any, save such as have had actual experience of command, can measure aright the obstructions of every nature that hedged military operations in a country unknown and unmapped, filled with a population ready to convey to the enemy information of every movement, and eager to cut a telegraph-wire or throw a railroad-train from its track.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>The Confederates, waging war on that theory that is named the <q direct="unspecified">defensive with offensive returns,</q> attempted, in <num value="2">two</num> memorable campaigns, an operation of invasion; but the decisive failure that attended both, may stand as an exemplar of the difficulties that constantly beset the <rs>Union</rs> army.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>The railroads all lead to the enemy's position; by acting upon them in force, besieging his strongholds if necessary, or getting between them if possible, or making the attempt to do so and pressing his left, I thought we should in the first place cause him to bring up all his forces and mass them on the flank most pressed, the left; and possibly, I thought probably, we should again get them out of their works and bring on a general engagement on favorable terms to us; at all events keeping him fully occupied and harrowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>The <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 4">Fourth Corps</orgName>, in connection with a force of heavy guns afloat, would operate on his right flank beyond the <rs>Occoquan</rs>, get behind the batteries on the <rs>Potomac</rs>; take Aquia, which being supported by the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 3">Third Corps</orgName> over the <rs>Occoquan</rs> it could safely attempt, and then move on the railroad from <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> to the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, having a large cavalry force to destroy bridges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>I thought by the use of <num value="130000">one hundred and thirty thousand</num> men thus employed, and the great facilities which the railroads gave us, and the compact position we should occupy, we must succeed by repeated blows in crushing out the force in our front, even if it were equal in numbers and strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>The road by the <rs type="place">Fairfax Courthouse</rs> to <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName> would give us the means to bring up siege-mortars and siege materials; and even if we could not accomplish the object immediately, by making the campaign <num value="1">one</num> of positions instead of <num value="1">one</num> of manoeuvre., to do so eventually and without risk.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1232"/>Yet the situation was not <num value="1">one</num> that permitted inaction; for the position of the army astride a fickle river, and the experience already had of the danger to which that division of its strength exposed it, should have been a sufficient admonition of the necessity of a change.

<p>I speak here of the opinion of the army; for what is called <hi rend="italics">public</hi> opinion was much divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3867"/>The fact, however, that the views of those at home were mainly influenced by extrinsic and political considerations (the supporters of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0227.0011.00407.04515" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,B.,,:1"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> condemning and his opponents favoring the overland route), makes public opinion hardly worth discussion.</p></note> The distance to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> by this route, from any front held along the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> or <rs>Rapidan</rs>, is between <num value="60">sixty</num> and <measure n="70miles" type="distance">seventy miles</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3869"/>But assuming these to be severally overpassed, the successful execution of the long march only results in bringing the army abreast the fortifications of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, within which the defending force, with its communications <name>south</name> and <name>west</name> all open and intact, might stand an indefinite siege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3870"/>In other words, the aggressive army is brought to a dead-lock; and if it be attempted to undo this by shifting to the south side of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName>, with the view of operating against <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>'s communications, the transfer is made at the expense of the <num value="1">one</num> advantage of the overland route (namely, that it covers the national capital), and the same line of operations is taken up, after enormous cost, that might have been assumed at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, without any sacrifice whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4836"/>From the <rs>Rapidan</rs> to the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> the face of the country was covered with the intrenched lines, within which these <q direct="unspecified">points of mighty opposites,</q> the <name>Armies</name> of the <rs>Potomac</rs> and of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, had waged a succession of deadly conflicts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4837"/>At every advance, <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0227.0011.00489.05577" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Grant,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> was able to meet his adversary with a front of opposition, and within his improvised strongholds exact a heavy price in blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4838"/>And although the illustrious valor of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> more than once plucked victors from the jaws of hell, and bayoneted an unyielding enemy in the very <hi rend="italics">enceinte</hi> of his citadel, the <rs>Union</rs> commander was never able to crush his opponent, who, thrown again and again in the mighty wrestle, each time rose quickly to his feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4839"/>Foiled in the effort to force a direct issue, <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0227.0011.00489.05578" reg="nearbymention:Grant,L.,A.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, at the end of each combat, initiated a movement to turn the hostile front; and these flanking operations were executed with much address&mdash;throwing the <rs>Confederates</rs> successively <pb id="p.490" n="490"/> out of the positions at the <rs>Wilderness</rs>, before <placeName key="tgn,2114316" n="1.000 8" reg="spotsylvania, spotsylvania, virginia">Spottsylvania</placeName>, on the <rs>North Anna</rs>, and along the <rs>Pamunkey</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4840"/>Thus, by battles and marches, the army, in <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure> and <num value="30">thirty</num> nights, reached the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4841"/>Now, it will be observed that each of these turning movements, up to the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, brought the army nearer at each leap to the objective of all its efforts, <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4842"/>But, once before the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, the series of flanking operations was exhausted; for any additional move by the left would throw the army not towards, but away from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4843"/>If, therefore, it was designed to push the advance by the line on which the army was now acting, and on which <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0227.0011.00490.05579" reg="nearbymention:Grant,L.,A.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> had declared he would <q direct="unspecified">fight it out, if it took all summer,</q> <note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4845"/>The result of the <rs n="Battle of Cold Harbor" type="battle">battle of Cold Harbor</rs>, fought on the <dateStruct value="-05-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, was to show that this line could not be carried by a <hi rend="italics">coup de main</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4846"/>But as the alternative was either to force a crossing of this stream or abandon that line of operations altogether, <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0227.0011.00490.05580" reg="nearbymention:Grant,L.,A.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impulse after the disastrous upshot of the action at <placeName reg="Cold Harbor">Cold Harbor</placeName>, was to order the initiation of siege operations, with the view to carry the position by regular approaches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4847"/>It was not long, however, before the unpromising aspect of the result that would follow even a successful issue on the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> gave pause to this purpose, and finally led to the adoption of an altogether new line of manoeuvre.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4848"/>In the discussion of the <q direct="unspecified">overland route,</q> with which the recital of this campaign opened, I have shown that any advance on that line ends in the siege of the uninvested fortifications of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, within which the defending army, with all its lines of communication open, might remain indefinitely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4849"/>It was no doubt from the perception of the altogether indecisive nature of this result that <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0227.0011.00490.05581" reg="nearbymention:Grant,L.,A.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, after <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> passed along the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, resolved to execute another <pb id="p.491" n="491"/> flank movement, which should throw the army to the south side of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4850"/>Now, as this change of base ended the operations on the <q direct="unspecified">overland route,</q> it would seem also to challenge a judgment on the merits of that enterprise, considered as a whole.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4851"/>It has been seen that <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0227.0011.00491.05582" reg="nearbymention:Grant,L.,A.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> himself originally preferred to the overland march an operation against the communications of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> by a transfer of the army to a point on the coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4852"/>The results thus far accomplished on the former line would appear to justify his primal choice.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4853"/>As the overland campaign was unsuccessful either in the destruction of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0227.0011.00491.05583" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Grant,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> or the capture of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and as that line of operations was at length abandoned, the gross result would seem to be confined to whatever loss, material and moral, had been caused the opposing army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4854"/>But it is not possible to measure aright this loss, unless it be considered in its relations with the cost at which it was purchased.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4855"/>In this regard, it must be considered, the balance was very much in favor of the enemy.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5154"/>It will have appeared, from the outline already given of the proposed assault, that it was an operation essentially of the nature of a <hi rend="italics">coup de main</hi>. It involved the explosion of the mine, through the breach formed by which an assaulting column would then push forward to sweep the hostile line right and left, and crown the crest of the ridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5155"/>Thus the whole momentum of the action and the entire promise of the result centred in the corps to which the duty of assault was assigned.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5156"/>In this state of facts, it would seem to be the dictate of prudence, and certainly has been the invariable practice of the great commanders, to select for the storming column the <hi rend="italics">&eacute;lite</hi> of the army&mdash;a rule that does not seem to have been followed in this case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5157"/>It happened that the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 9">Ninth Army Corps</orgName>, under <persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n0227.0012.00520.05855" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,A.,E.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName>, held the front from which the assault was to be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5158"/>With no purpose of undertaking the <pb id="p.521" n="521"/> ungracious task of comparison, but with the simple desire of stating a matter of fact essential to the correct appreciation of the action and its result, it is due to say that that corps could not be considered the <hi rend="italics">&eacute;lite</hi> corps of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5159"/>The old <num value="9" type="ordinal">Ninth</num>, than which there never was better, had been reduced by long and varied service to a mere nucleus, with which had been agglomerated (not fused) a mass of new, heterogeneous, and inferior material.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5160"/>The <orgName type="division" n="division 1">first division</orgName> was largely made up of foot-artillerists and dismounted cavalry, and the <orgName type="division" n="division 4">fourth division</orgName> was composed exclusively of Blacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5161"/>To such an extent had the <hi rend="italics">morale</hi> of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 9">Ninth Corps</orgName> become impaired, that its inspecting officer a short time before the assault declared the <num value="3">three</num> <persName n="White,,,,," id="n0227.0012.00521.05856" reg="mostcommon:White,nomatch:0"><surname>White</surname></persName> divisions to be in so bad a condition that the division of Blacks was to be preferred for the duty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5162"/>If, in view of this circumstance, it be asked why another selection was not made, an answer does not readily present itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5163"/>There is, however, in <persName n="Carnot,,,,," id="n0227.0012.00521.05857" reg="mostcommon:Carnot,nomatch:0"><surname>Carnot</surname></persName>'s work, <hi rend="italics">De la Defence des Places Fortes</hi>, a remarkable passage that closely touches this matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5164"/><q direct="unspecified">The reasons why our assaults occasionally fail,</q> says he, <q direct="unspecified">are, in my opinion, various.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5165"/>In the first place, it is a rule that the troops immediately on duty, or near the spot, generally storm or do whatever service may be required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5166"/>These troops may be most unfit for it, and by this mode the good old custom is done away of employing grenadiers or chosen men for occasions of difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5167"/>There are no troops in the world that can be taken indiscriminately for brilliant services, and undoubtedly none more so than for storming works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5168"/>Besides, the officer to whom the command falls may be very unfit for the particular service.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5539"/>From the extent of time they cover, the energy with which they were prosecuted, and the skilful manner <pb id="p.551" n="551"/> in which they were met by the defending army, they are remarkable in the history of modern warfare.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5540"/>The characteristic of these operations is the progressive development of the intrenched Union line to the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5541"/>Starting from the position directly east of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> taken up by the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> on its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> arrival in <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>, the lines of contravallation were gradually extended <name>south</name> and <name>south</name>west of the town, till at last they stretched from the <rs>Appomattox</rs> to <placeName reg="Hatchers Run, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,2380059">Hatcher's Run</placeName>, a distance of <measure n="15miles" type="distance">fifteen miles</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5542"/>This extension was less designed than accidental.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5543"/>It grew out of a series of manoeuvres by the left, of which manoeuvres the original purpose was in each case to turn the right of the <rs>Confederate</rs> system of defences, and lay hold of the <orgName n="Southside Railroad" type="railroad">Southside Railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5544"/>Criticism should, therefore, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> be directed to these operations regarded in the light of their original intent, rather than from the point of view of the incidental result arising therefrom.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5545"/>In their most general relations, these operations are to be looked upon as a swinging movement of the left pivoting on the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5546"/>The intrenched lines before <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> always strongly held, and on these as a <hi rend="italics">point d'appui</hi>, it was attempted to throw the left against and around the <rs>Confederate</rs> right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5547"/>But these manoeuvres had several characteristics that invariably robbed them of the success hoped from them: the pivotal force was generally stronger than the body to which was assigned the turning movement, and by reducing the garrison of his defences to the minimum, <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0227.0012.00551.06230" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> was able to accumulate on the menaced point a force sufficient to meet, and almost always to repulse, the body threatening his communications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5548"/>Moreover, these movements were invariably made in extended lines, which had the inevitable result to expose a flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5549"/>This system the enemy soon learnt so well, that his invariable plan was to attack the flank as soon as it was exposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5550"/>The region of country southwest of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> in which these operations were conducted was highly favorable to the <rs>Confederates</rs>, being densely wooded, intersected with swamps, and possessing few roads; and they had a great advantage <pb id="p.552" n="552"/> in their minute knowledge of the topography of the country, which was nearly terra incognita to the <rs>Union</rs> commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5551"/>The success of the <rs>Confederate</rs> tactics was wonderful; each movement, saving that to the <orgName n="Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Weldon Railroad</orgName>, which was conducted on a different principle, ending in a check, generally accompanied by <num value="1">one</num> or more <measure n="1000" type="prisoners">thousand prisoners</measure>. The aggregate of captures made by the enemy in these successive swoops is astonishing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5552"/>But notwithstanding the many costly proofs received of the fatality attending these unlimited extensions, the type of operation was adhered to with a constancy only accountable on the supposition that the <rs>Union</rs> commander was enamored of it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5553"/>These turning movements, though in each foiled as regards their primal object, always resulted in a further prolongation of the intrenched line to the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5554"/>It remains to ask, was this extension of front a real gain?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5555"/>The answer will depend on whether it was a front of offence or defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5556"/>If of the latter, it cannot be considered a gain, for in the part assigned the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> it was nothing if not offensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5557"/>But beyond the <orgName n="Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Weldon Railroad</orgName> the extension to the left carried <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0227.0012.00552.06231" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:7"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> no nearer <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0227.0012.00552.06232" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s line of communications, the <rs>Southside Railroad</rs>&mdash;in fact, rather away from it, for <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0227.0012.00552.06233" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, by thrusting his right southward along the <rs>Boydton</rs> plankroad, caused the <rs>Union</rs> intrenched line to run in the contrary direction to that of the <orgName n="Southside Railroad" type="railroad">Southside Railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5558"/>It may indeed be said that the prolongation of the <rs>Union</rs> line caused <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0227.0012.00552.06234" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> to extend also, which was, <hi rend="italics">pari passu</hi>, to weaken himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5577"/>From the peculiar geographical relations of that Valley in a military point of view, it was always open to a detached force to make incursions across the frontier of the loyal States, whether for the purpose of plunder or of a diversion in favor of the main <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>, by a menace against <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5754"/>But this statement overshot the reality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5755"/>The South did not so much lack men as the men lacked interest in the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5759"/>And here, again, it was not that the <rs>South</rs> lacked resources, for the granaries of that vast and fertile territory bulged with great store of corn; but maladministra-tion rendered these riches as vain as if the <rs>South</rs> had been a Sahara.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5760"/>That great department of administrative service charged with the feeding of the troops, was presided over by <pb id="p.572" n="572"/> a man of such notorious ignorance and incompetence, that authentic records show the armies in the field to have been half the time bordering on starvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5764"/>I shall here record a few of his pregnant observations on both these subjects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5765"/><q direct="unspecified">In regard to the raising of troops,</q> said he, <q direct="unspecified">that was done in the worst possible manner&mdash;namely, by <hi rend="italics">conscription</hi>, by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5766"/>Instead of determining the number of troops wanted, and apportioning to each State its proper quota, wholesale impressments were made by the machinery of a central government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5767"/>Each State had its own officers with which it could have raised the troops; and being of the localities, they, of course, knew every man and boy in the place, and avoidance or evasion would have been difficult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5768"/>But by the system adopted, this perfect agency was not called into play at all. Finally, it resulted that it required as many men to enforce the conscription as it was expected to raise by its operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5769"/>Then ensued evasion: those who wished to shrink service, or aid others to do so, opened their ranks, allowed them to slip through and close up behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5770"/>Supplies, also, instead of being honestly raised, were impressed by a band of commissaries and quartermasters, who only paid <num value="0.5">one-half</num> the market value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5771"/>As might have been expected, this was enough to prevent their getting any thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5772"/>These they took by force, and did it with the greatest injustice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5773"/>You can imagine what disorganization of labor and what discontent this produced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5774"/>The mismanagement of the <rs>Confederate</rs> executive in these <num value="2">two</num> regards was enough to ruin the cause.</q></p></note> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5775"/>If the moral spring of the insurrection had become thus relaxed, it is not wonderful that the armies also had sunk in energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5776"/>The glory of arms at length ceased to support men against sufferings, privations, and fatigues that, while hard to bear in themselves, were unmitigated by any hope of a successful issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5777"/>The consequence of this was soon seen in such an increase of desertion that the <num value="2">two</num> main armies of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> showed <num value="4">four</num> men on their rolls to <num value="1">one</num> in the ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5778"/>At the opening of the spring campaign, <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0227.0013.00572.06411" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,Hugh,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> had, on <pb id="p.573" n="573"/> paper, <num value="160000">one hundred and sixty thousand</num> men, but in reality less than <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num>, from which, if there be deducted the troops on detached duty, it will appear that he had <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> men wherewithal to defend <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure> of intrenchments.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5779"/>These were the forlorn hope of the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6356"/>In the course of the afternoon, the result of this momentous interview became known to both armies, and then all the intense, <pb id="p.621" n="621"/> yet strangely diverse emotions which the intelligence was calculated to evoke, broke out in manifestations that pass all words of description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6357"/>On the <rs>Union</rs> side there was joy unmixed and unrestrained&mdash;the joy of men that had gone through great tribulation, the joy of an army that, often unfortunate and ever unappreciated, saw at length unparalleled labors crowned by illustrious success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6358"/>On the <rs>Confederate</rs> side there was a kind of joy, too&mdash;such sad joy as men feel when a long agony is over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6359"/>Yet there could not fail to be deep anguish in their hearts; and this burst forth when <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0227.0013.00621.06933" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> rode through the ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6361"/>Men who had fought throughout the war, and knew what the agony and humiliation of that moment must be to him, strove with a refinement of unselfishness and tenderness which he alone could fully appreciate, to lighten his burden and mitigate his pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6362"/>With tears pouring down both cheeks, <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0227.0013.00621.06934" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> at length commanded voice enough to say: <quote>Men, we have fought through the war together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6364"/>Not an eye that looked on that scene was dry.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6365"/></p> 
<p>As the armies were enemies no longer, there was no need of martial array that night, nor fear of surprise, nor call to arms; but hostile devisement gave place to mutual helpfulness, and the victors shared their rations with the famished vanquished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6366"/>In that supreme moment these men knew and respected each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6367"/>If the <num value="1">one</num> army drank the joy of victory, and the other the bitter draught of defeat, it was a joy moderated by the recollection of the cost at which it had been purchased, and a defeat mollified by the consciousness of many triumphs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6369"/>If at length the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">army of Northern Virginia</orgName> fell before the massive power of the <rs>North</rs>, yet what vitality had it shown!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6370"/>How terrible had been the struggle!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6371"/>How many <pb id="p.622" n="622"/> hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of brave men had fallen before that result could be achieved!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6372"/>And this is the glory of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>, that it brought to the ground the adversary which had ever been the head and front of the revolt, and that in crushing it, it quelled the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6376"/>Paroles were then distributed to the men, and the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> passed out of existence.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6379"/>When the pageant was ended, the troops were mustered out of service, and the men, doffing the <rs>Union</rs> blue, were quietly reabsorbed into the body of society.</p>
