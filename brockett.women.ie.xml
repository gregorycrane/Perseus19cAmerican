<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>The preparation of this work, or rather the collection of material for it, was commenced in the autumn of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>While engaged in the compilation of a little book on <quote>The philanthropic results of the war</quote> for circulation abroad, in the summer of that year, the writer became so deeply impressed with the extraordinary sacrifices and devotion of loyal women, in the national cause, that he determined to make a record of them for the honor of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>A voluminous correspondence then commenced and continued to the present time, soon demonstrated how general were the acts of patriotic devotion, and an extensive tour, undertaken the following summer, to obtain by personal observation and intercourse with these heroic women, a more clear and comprehensive idea of what they had done and were doing, only served to increase his admiration for their zeal, patience, and self-denying effort.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Never had the gentle and patient ministrations of woman been so needful as in the last year of the war; and never had they been so abundantly bestowed, and with such zeal and self-forgetfulness.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>These poor fellows, starved to the last degree of emaciation, crippled and dying from frost and gangrene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>many of <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> them idiotic from their sufferings, or with the fierce fever of typhus, more deadly than sword or minie bullet, raging in their veins, were brought to <placeName key="tgn,7013303" n="1.000 493" reg="annapolis, anne arundel, maryland">Annapolis</placeName> and to <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>, and unmindful of the deadly infection, gentle and tender women ministered to them as faithfully and lovingly, as if they were their own brothers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Ever and anon, in these works of mercy, <num value="1">one</num> of these fair ministrants died a martyr to her faithfulness, asking, often only, to be buried beside her <quote>boys,</quote> but the work never ceased while there was a soldier to be nursed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Nor were these the only fields in which noble service was rendered to humanity by the women of our time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>In the larger associations of our cities, day after day, and year after year, women served in summer's heat and winter's cold, at their desks, corresponding with auxiliary aid societies, taking account of goods received for sanitary supplies, re-packing and shipping them to the points where they were needed, inditing and sending out circulars appealing for aid, in work more prosaic but equally needful and patriotic with that performed in the hospitals; and throughout every village and hamlet in the country, women were toiling, contriving, submitting to privation, performing unusual and severe labors, all for the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>In the general hospitals of the cities and larger towns, the labors of the special diet kitchen, and of the hospital nurse were performed steadily, faithfully, and uncomplainingly, though there also, ever and anon, some fair toiler laid down her life in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>There were many too in still other fields of labor, who showed their love for their country; the faithful women who, in the <rs>Philadelphia Refreshment Saloons</rs>, fed the hungry soldier on his way to or from the battle-field, till in the aggregate, they had dispensed nearly <num value="800000">eight hundred thousand</num> meals, and had cared for <num value="1000">thousands</num> of sick and wounded; the matrons of the <name>Soldiers</name>' Homes, Lodges, and Rests; the heroic souls who devoted themselves to the noble work of raising a nation of bondmen to intelligence and freedom; those who attempted the still more hopeless task of rousing the blunted intellect and cultivating the moral nature of the degraded and abject poor whites; and those who in circumstances of the greatest peril, manifested their fearless and undying attachment to their country and its flag; all these were entitled to a place in such a record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>What wonder, then, that, pursuing his self-appointed task assiduously, the writer found it growing upon him; till the question came, not, who should be inscribed in this roll, but who could be omitted, since it was evident no single volume could do justice to all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>In the autumn of <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Vaughan,Mrs.,Mary,C.,," id="n0167.0002.00012.00010" reg="default:Vaughan,Mary,C.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>Mary</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Vaughan</surname></persName>, a skilful and practiced writer, whose tastes and sympathies led her to take an interest in the work, became associated with the writer <num value="2">II</num> its preparation, and to her zeal in collecting, <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> and skill in arranging the materials obtained, many of the interesting sketches of the volume are due. We have in the prosecution of our work been constantly embarrassed, by the reluctance of some who deserved a prominent place, to suffer anything to be communicated concerning their labors; by the promises, often repeated but never fulfilled, of others to furnish facts and incidents which they alone could supply, and by the forwardness of a few, whose services were of the least moment, in presenting their claims.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>We have endeavored to exercise a wise and careful discrimination both in avoiding the introduction of any name unworthy of a place in such a record, and in giving the due meed of honor to those who have wrought most earnestly and acceptably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>We cannot hope that we have been completely successful; the letters even now, daily received, render it probable that there are some, as faithful and self-sacrificing as any of those whose services we have recorded, of whom we have failed to obtain information; and that some of those who entered upon their work of mercy in the closing campaigns of the war, by their zeal and earnestness, have won the right to a place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We have not knowingly, however, omitted the name of any faithful worker, of whom we could obtain information, and we feel assured that our record is far more full and complete, than any other which has been, or is likely to be prepare;l, and that the number of prominent and active laborers in the national cause who have escaped our notice is comparatively small.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>A record of the personal services of our American women in the late <rs>Civil War</rs>, however painful to the modesty of those whom it brings conspicuously before the world, is due to the honor of the country, to the proper understanding of our social life, and to the general interests of a sex whose rights, duties and capacities are now under serious discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Most of the women commemorated in this work inevitably lost the benefits of privacy, by the largeness and length of their public services, and their names and history are to a certain extent the property of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>At any rate they must suffer the penalty which conspicuous merit entails upon its possessors, especially when won in fields of universal interest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Notwithstanding the pains taken to collect from all parts of the country, the names and history of the women who in any way distinguished themselves in the <rs>War</rs>, and in spite of the utmost impartiality of purpose, there is no pretence that all who served the country best, are named in this record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Doubtless <num value="1000">thousands</num> of women, obscure in their homes, and humble in their fortunes, without official position even in their local society, and all human trace of whose labors is forever lost, contributed as generously of their substance, and as freely of their time and strength, and gave as unreservedly their hearts and their prayers to the cause, as the most conspicuous on the shining list here unrolled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Unrewarded by praise, unsullied by self-complacency, there is a character <quote>of no reputation,</quote> which formed in strictest retirement, and in the patient exercise of unobserved sacrifices, is dearer and holier in the eye of Heaven, than the most illustrious name won by the most splendid services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Women there were in this war, who without a single relative in the army, denied themselves for the whole <num value="4">four</num> <pb id="p.30" n="30"/> years, the comforts to which they had been always accustomed; went thinly clad, took the extra blanket from their bed, never tasted tea, or sugar, or flesh, that they might wind another bandage round some unknown soldier's wound, or give some parched lips in the hospital another sip of wine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Others never let <num value="1">one</num> leisure moment, saved from lives of pledged labor which barely earned their bread, go unemployed in the service of the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> Himself keeps this record!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>It is too sacred to be trusted to men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>But it is not such humble, yet exalted souls that will complain of the praise which to their neglect, is allotted to any of their sisters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The ranks always contain some heroes braver and better than the most fortunate and conspicuous officers of staff or line-but they feel themselves best praised when their regiment, their corps, or their general is gazetted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>And the true-hearted workers for the soldiers among the women of this country will gladly accept the recognition given to the noble band of their sisters whom peculiar circumstances lifted into distinct view, as a tribute offered to the whole company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Indeed, if the lives set forth in this work, were regarded as exceptional in their temper and spirit, as they certainly were in their incidents and largeness of sphere, the whole lesson of the <name>Record</name> would be misread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>These women in their sacrifices, their patriotism, and their persistency, are only fair representatives of the spirit of their whole sex. As a rule, American women exhibited not only an intense feeling for the soldiers in their exposures and their sufferings, but an intelligent sympathy with the national cause, equal to that which furnished among the men, <num value="2000000">two million</num> and <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> volunteers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>It is not unusual for women of all countries to weep and to work for those who encounter the perils of war. But the <rs>American</rs> women, after giving up, with a principled alacrity, to the ranks of the gathering and advancing army, their husbands and sons, their brothers and lovers, proceeded to organize relief for them; and they did it, not in the spasmodic and sentimental way, which has been common elsewhere, but with a self-controlled and rational consideration of the wisest and best means of accomplishing their purpose, which showed them to be in some degree the products and representatives of a new social era, and a new political development.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The distinctive features in woman's work in this war, were magnitude, system, thorough co-operativeness with the other sex, distinctness of purpose, business-like thoroughness in details, sturdy persistency to the close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>There was no more general rising among the men, than among the women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Men did not take to the musket, more commonly than women took to the needle; and for every assembly where men met for mutual excitation in the <pb id="p.31" n="31"/> service of the country, there was some corresponding gathering of women, to stir each other's hearts and fingers in the same sacred cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>All the caucuses and political assemblies of every kind, in which speech and song quickened the blood of the men, did not exceed in number the meetings, in the form of Soldiers' Aid Societies, and Sewing Circles, which the women held, where they talked over the national cause, and fed the fires of sacrifice in each other's hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Probably never in any war in any country, was there so universal and so specific an acquaintance on the part of both men and women, with the principles at issue, and the interests at stake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>And of the <num value="2">two</num>, the women were clearer and more united than the men, because their moral feelings and political instincts were not so much affected by selfishness and business, or party considerations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The work which our system of popular education does for girls and boys alike, and which in the middle and upper classes practically goes further with girls than with boys, told magnificently at this crisis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Everywhere, well educated women were found fully able to understand and explain to their sisters, the public questions involved in the war. Everywhere the newspapers, crowded with interest and with discussions, found eager and appreciative readers among the gentler sex. Everywhere started up women acquainted with the order of public business; able to call, and preside over public meetings of their own sex; act as secretaries and committees, draft constitutions and bye-laws, open books, and keep accounts with adequate precision, appreciate system, and postpone private inclinations or preferences to general principles; enter into extensive correspondence with their own sex: co-operate in the largest and most rational plans proposed by men who had studied carefully the subject of soldiers' relief, and adhere through good report and through evil report, to organizations which commended themselves to their judgment, in spite of local, sectarian, or personal jealousies and detractions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>It is impossible to over-estimate the amount of consecrated work done by the loyal women of the <rs>North</rs> for the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of women probably gave all the leisure they could command, and all the money they could save and spare, to the soldiers for the whole <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> and more, of the <rs>War</rs>. Amid discouragements and fearful delays they never flagged, but to the last increased in zeal and devotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>And their work was as systematic as it was universal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>A generous emulation among the <rs>Branches</rs> of the <orgName n="U. S. Sanitary Commission" type="org">United States Sanitary Commission</orgName>, managed generally by women, usually, however, with some aid from men, brought their business habits and methods to an almost perfect finish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Nothing that men commonly think peculiar to their own methods was wanting in the plans of the women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/><pb id="p.32" n="32"/> They acknowledged and answered, endorsed and filed their letters; they sorted their stores, and kept an accurate account of stock; they had their books and reports kept in the most approved forms; they balanced their cash accounts with the most pains-taking precision; they exacted of each other regularity of attendance and punctiliousness of official etiquette.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>They showed in short, a perfect aptitude for business, and proved by their own experience that men can devise nothing too precise, too systematic or too complicated for women to understand, apply and improve upon, where there is any sufficient motive for it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>It was another feature of the case that there was no jealousy between women and men in the work, and no disposition to discourage, underrate, or dissociate from each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>It seemed to be conceded that men had more invention, comprehensiveness and power of generalization, and that their business habits, the fruits of ages of experience, were at least worth studying and copying by women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>On the other hand, men, usually jealous of woman's extending the sphere of her life and labors, welcomed in this case her assistance in a public work, and felt how vain men's toil and sacrifices would be without woman's steady sympathy and patient ministry of mercy, her more delicate and persistent pity, her willingness to endure monotonous details of labor for the sake of charity, her power to open the heart of her husband, and to keep alive and flowing the fountains of compassion and love.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>No words are adequate to describe the systematic, persistent faithfulness of the women who organized and led the <rs>Branches</rs> of the <orgName n="U. S. Sanitary Commission" type="org">United States Sanitary Commission</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Their volunteer labor had all the regularity of paid service, and a heartiness and earnestness which no paid services can ever have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Hundreds of women evinced talents there, which, in other spheres and in the other sex, would have made them merchant-princes, or great administrators of public affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Storms nor heats could keep them from their posts, and they wore on their faces, and finally evinced in their breaking constitutions, the marks of the cruel strain put upon their minds and hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>They engaged in a correspondence of the most trying kind, requiring the utmost address to meet the searching questions asked by intelligent jealousy, and to answer the rigorous objections raised by impatience or ignorance in the rural districts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>They became instructors of whole townships in the methods of government business, the constitution of the <rs>Commissary</rs> and <rs>Quartermaster</rs>'s Departments, and the forms of the <rs type="place">Medical Bureau</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>They had steadily to contend with the natural desire of the <rs>Aid Societies</rs> for local independence, and to reconcile neighborhoods to the idea of being merged and lost in large generalizations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>They kept up the spirit of the <pb id="p.33" n="33"/> people distant from the war and the camps,by a steady fire of letters full of touching incidents; and they were repaid not only by the most generous returns of stores, but by letters from humble homes and lonely hearts, so full of truth and tenderness, of wisdom and pity, of self-sacrifice and patriotic consecration, that the most gifted and educated women in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, many of them at the head of the <rs type="place">Branches</rs> or among their Directors, felt constantly reproved by the nobleness, the sweetness, the depth of sentiment that welled from the hidden and obscure springs in the hearts of farmers' wives and factory-girls.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Nor were the talents and the sacrifices of those at the larger Depots or Centres, more worthy of notice than the skill and pains evinced in arousing, maintaining and managing the zeal and work of county or town societies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Indeed, sometimes larger works are more readily controlled than smaller ones; and jealousies and individual caprices obstruct the cooperation of villages more than of towns and cities.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>In the <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> Soldiers' Aid Societies which at <num value="1">one</num> time or another probably existed in the country, there was in each some master-spirit, whose consecrated purpose was the staple in the wall, from which the chain of service hung and on whose strength and firmness it steadily drew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>I never visited a single town however obscure, that I did not hear some woman's name which stood in that community for <quote>Army service;</quote> a name round which the rest of the women gladly rallied; the name of some woman whose heart was felt to beat louder and more firmly than any of the rest for the boys in blue.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Of the practical talent, the personal worth, the aptitude for public service, the love of self-sacrificing duty thus developed and nursed into power, and brought to the knowledge of its possessors and their communities, it is difficult to speak too warmly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/><num value="1000">Thousands</num> of women learned in this work to despise frivolity, gossip, fashion and idleness; learned to think soberly and without prejudice of the capacities of their own sex; and thus, did more to advance the rights of woman by proving her gifts and her fitness for public duties, than a whole library of arguments and protests.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The prodigious exertions put forth by the women who founded and conducted the great Fairs for the soldiers in a dozen principal cities, and in many large towns, were only surpassed by the planning skill and administrative ability which accompanied their progress, and the marvellous success in which they terminated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Months of anxious preparation, where hundreds of committees vied with each other in long-headed schemes for securing the co-operation of the several trades or industries allotted to each, and during which laborious days and anxious nights were unintermittingly given <pb id="p.34" n="34"/> to the wearing work,were followed by weeks of personal service in the fairs themselves, where the strongest women found their vigor inadequate to the task, and hundreds laid the foundations of long illness and some of sudden death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>These sacrifices and far-seeing provisions were justly repaid by almost fabulous returns of money, which to the extent of nearly <num value="3000000">three millions</num> of dollars, flowed into the treasury of the <orgName n="U. S. Sanitary Commission" type="org">United States Sanitary Commission</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The chief women who inaugurated the several great Fairs at New York, <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Brooklyn, New York, Kings" key="tgn,7015822">Brooklyn</placeName>, <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>, <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>, <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, and administered these vast movements, were not behind the ablest men in the land in their grasp and comprehension of the business in hand, and often in comparison with the men associated with them, exhibited a finer scope, a better spirit and a more victorious faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>But for the women of <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>, the great Fairs would never have been born, or would have died ignominiously in their gilded cradles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Their vastness of conception and their splendid results are to be set as an everlasting crown on woman's capacity for large and money-yielding enterprises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The women who led them can never sink back into obscurity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>But I must pass from this inviting theme, where indeed I feel more at home than in what is to follow, to the consideration of what naturally occupies a larger space in this work-however much smaller it was in reality, i. <hi rend="italics">e</hi>., to the labors of the women who actually went to the war, and worked in the hospitals and camps.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Of the labors of women in the hospitals and in the field, this book gives a far fuller history than is likely to be got from any other source, as this sort of service cannot be recorded in the histories of organized work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>For, far the largest part of this work was done by persons of exceptional energy and some fine natural aptitude for the service, which was independent of organizations, and hardly submitted itself to any rules except the impulses of devoted love for the work-supplying tact, patience and resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>The women who did hospital service continuously, or who kept themselves near the base of armies in the field, or who moved among the camps, and travelled with the corps, were an exceptional class &mdash; as rare as heroines always are &mdash; a class, representing no social grade, but coming from all-belonging to no rank or age of life in particular; sometimes young and sometimes old, sometimes refined and sometimes rude; now of fragile physical aspect and then of extraordinary robustness-but in all cases, women with a mighty love and earnestness in their hearts &mdash; a love and pity, and an ability to show it forth and to labor in behalf of it, equal to that which in other departments of life, distinguishes poets, philosophers, sages and saints, from ordinary or average men. <pb id="p.35" n="35"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Moved by an indomitable desire to serve in person the victims of wounds and sickness, a few <num value="100">hundred</num> women, impelled by instincts which assured them of their ability to endure the hardship, overcome the obstacles, and adjust themselves to the unusual and unfeminine circumstances in which they would be placed-made their way through all obstructions at home, and at the seat of war, or in the hospitals, to the bed-sides of the sick and wounded men. Many of these women scandalized their friends at home by what seemed their Quixotic resolution; or, they left their families under circumstances which involved a romantic oblivion of the recognized and usual duties of domestic life; they forsook their own children, to make children of a whole <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>; they risked their lives in fevered hospitals; they lived in tents or slept in ambulance wagons, for months together; they fell sick of fevers themselves, and after long illness, returned to the old business of hospital and field service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>They carried into their work their womanly tenderness, their copious sympathies, their great-hearted devotion-and had to face and contend with the cold routine, the semi-savage professional indifference, which by the necessities of the case, makes ordinary medical supervision, in time of actual war, impersonal, official, unsympathetic and abrupt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>The honest, natural jealousy felt by surgeons-in-charge, and their ward masters, of all outside assistance, made it necessary for every woman, who was to succeed in her purpose of holding her place, and really serving the men, to study and practice an address, an adaptation and a patience, of which not <num value="1">one</num> candidate in <num value="10">ten</num> was capable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Doubtless <num value="9">nine</num>-<num value=".1">tenths</num> of all who wished to offer and thought themselves capable of this service, failed in their practical efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>As many women fancied themselves capable of enduring hospital life, as there are always in every college, youth who believe they can become distinguished authors, poets and statesmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>But only the few who had a <hi rend="italics">genius</hi> for the work, continued in it, and succeeded in elbowing room for themselves through the never-ending obstacles, jealousies and chagrins that beset the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Every woman who keeps her place in a general hospital, or a corps hospital, has to prove her title to be trusted; her tact, discretion, endurance and strength of nerve and fibre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>No <num value="1">one</num> woman succeeded in rendering years of hospital service, who was not an exceptional person &mdash; a woman of larger heart, clearer head, finer enthusiasm, and more mingled tact, courage, firmness and holy will-than <num value="1">one</num> in a <num value="1000">thousand</num> of her sex. A grander collection of women-whether considered in their intellectual or their moral qualities, their heads or their hearts, I have not had the happiness of knowing, than the women I saw in the hospitals; they were the flower of their sex. Great as were the labors of those who superintended the operations at home---of collecting <pb id="p.36" n="36"/> and preparing supplies for the hospitals and the field, I cannot but think that the women who lived in the hospitals, or among the soldiers, required a force of character and a glow of devotion and self-sacrifice, of a rarer kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>They were really heroines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>They conquered their feminine sensibility at the sight of blood and wounds; their native antipathy to disorder, confusion and violence; subdued the rebellious delicacy of their more exquisite senses; lived coarsely, and dressed and slept rudely; they studied the caprices of men to whom their ties were simply human-men often ignorant, feeble-minded-out of their senses-raving with pain and fever; they had a still harder service to bear with the pride, the official arrogance, the hardness or the folly-perhaps the impertinence and presumption of half-trained medical men, whom the urgencies of the case had fastened on the service.* Their position was always critical, equivocal, suspected, and to be justified only by their undeniable and conspicuous merits;--their wisdom, patience and proven efficiency; justified by the love and reverence they exacted from the soldiers themselves!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>True, the rewards of these women were equal to their sacrifices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>They drew their pay from a richer treasury than that of the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>I never knew <num value="1">one</num> of them who had had a long service, whose memory of the grateful looks of the dying, of the few awkward words that fell from the lips of thankful convalescents, or the speechless eye-following of the dependent soldier, or the pressure of a rough hand, softened to womanly gentleness by long illness,--was not the sweetest treasure of all their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Nothing in the power of the <name>Nation</name> to give or to say, can ever compare for a moment with the proud satisfaction which every brave soldier who risked his life for his country, always carries in his heart of hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>And no public recognition, no thanks from a saved Nation, can ever add anything of much importance to the rewards of those who tasted the actual joy of ministering with their own hands and hearts to the wants of <measure n="1" type="sick">one sick</measure> and dying man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>It remains only to say a word about the influence of the work of the women in the <rs>War</rs> upon the strength and unanimity of the public sentiment, and on the courage and fortitude of the army itself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>The participation by actual work and service in the labors of the <rs>War</rs>,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>* A large number of the <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">United States Army</orgName> and volunteer surgeons were indeed men of the highest and most humane character, and treated the women who came to the hospitals, with careful and scrupulous consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>Some women were able to say that they never encountered opposition or hindrance from any officials; but this was not the rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/><pb id="p.37" n="37"/> not only took out of women's hearts the soreness which unemployed energies or incongruous pursuits would have left there, but it took out of their mouths the murmurs and moans which their deserted, husbandless, childless condition would so naturally have provoked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>The women by their call to work, and the opportunity of pouring their energies, sympathies and affections into an ever open and practical channel, were quieted, reconciled, upheld.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>The weak were borne upon the bosoms of the strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>Banded together, and working together, their solicitude and uneasiness were alleviated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Following in imagination the work of their own hands, they seemed to be present on the field and in the ranks; they studied the course of the armies; they watched the policy of the <rs>Government</rs>; they learned the character of the <rs>Generals</rs>; they threw themselves into the war!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>And so they helped wonderfully to keep up the enthusiasm, or to rebuke the lukewarmness, or to check the despondency and apathy which at times settled over the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>Men were ashamed to doubt where women trusted, or to murmur where they submitted, or to do little where they did so much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>If during the war, home life had gone on as usual; women engrossed in their domestic or social cares; shrinking from public questions; deferring to what their husbands or brothers told them, or seeking to amuse themselves with social pleasures and striving to forget the painful strife in frivolous caprices, it would have had a fearful effect on public sentiment, deepening the gloom of every reverse, adding to the discouragements which an embarrassed commerce and trade brought to men's hearts, by domestic echoes of weariness of the strife, and favoring the growth of a disaffected, compromising, unpatriotic feeling, which always stood ready to break out with any offered encouragement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>A sense of nearness of the people to the <rs>Government</rs> which the organization of the women effected, enlarged their sympathies with its movements and disposed them to patience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Their own direct experience of the difficulties of all co-operative undertakings, broadened their views and rendered intelligible the delays and reverses which our national cause suffered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>In short the women of the country were through the whole conflict, not only not softening the fibres of war, but they were actually strengthening its sinews by keeping up their own courage and that of their households, under the inspiration of the larger and more public life, the broader work and greater field for enterprise and self-sacrifice afforded them by their direct labors for the benefit of the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>They drew <num value="1000">thousands</num> of lukewarm, or calculating, or self-saving men into the support of the national cause by their practical enthusiasm and devotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>They proved what has again and again been demonstrated, that what the women of a country resolve shall be done, will and must be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>They shamed recruits into the ranks, <pb id="p.38" n="38"/> and made it almost impossible for deserters, or cowards, or malingerers to come home; they emptied the pockets of social idlers, or wealthy drones, into the treasuries of the <rs>Aid Societies</rs>; and they compelled the shops and domestic trade of all cities to be favorable to the war. The American women were nearer right and more thoroughly united by this means, and their own healthier instincts, than the <rs>American</rs> men. The Army, whose bayonets were glittering needles, advanced with more unbroken ranks, and exerted almost a greater moral force than the army that carried loaded muskets.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>The Aid Societies and the direct oversight the women sought to give the men in the field, very much increased the reason for correspondence between the homes and the tents.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>The women were proud to write what those at the hearth-stone were doing for those who tended the camp-fires, and the men were happy and cheery to acknowledge the support they received from this home sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>The immense correspondence between the army and the homes, prodigious beyond belief as it was, some regiments sending home a <num value="1000">thousand</num> letters a week, and receiving as many more back; the constant transmission to the men of newspapers, full of the records of home work and army news, produced a homogeneousness of feeling between the soldiers and the citizens, which kept the men in the field, civilians, and made the people at home, of both sexes, half-soldiers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>Thus there never grew up in the army any purely military and anti-social or anti-civil sentiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>The soldiers studied and appreciated all the time the moral causes of the <rs>War</rs>, and were acquainted with the political as well as military complications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>They felt all the impulses of home strengthening their arms and encouraging their hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>And their letters home, as a rule, were designed to put the best face upon things, and to encourage their wives and sweet-hearts, their sisters and parents, to bear their absence with fortitude, and even with cheerfulness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>The influence on the tone of their correspondence, exerted by the fact that the women were always working for the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName>, and that the soldiers always knew they were working, and were always receiving evidence of their care, may be better imagined than described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>It largely ministered to that sympathetic unity between the soldiers and the country, which made our army always a corrective and an inspiration to our Governmental policy, and kept up that fine reciprocal influence between civil and military life, which gave an heroic fibre to all souls at home, and finally restored us our soldiers with their citizen hearts beating regularly under their uniforms, as they dropped them off at the last drum-tap.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>An intense and passionate love of country, holding, for the time, all other ties in abeyance, has been a not uncommon trait of character among women of all countries and climes, throughout the ages of human history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>In the nomadic races it assumed the form of attachment to the patriarchal rules and chiefs of the tribe; in the more savage of the localized nations, it was reverence for the ruler, coupled with a filial regard for the resting-places and graves of their ancestors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/><pb id="p.40" n="40"/></p> 
<p>But in the more highly organized and civilized countries, it was the institutions of the nation, its religion, its sacred traditions, its history, as well as its kings, its military leaders, and its priests, that were the objects of the deep and intense patriotic devotion of its noblest and most gifted women.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>The manifestations of this patriotic zeal were diverse in different countries, and at different periods in the same country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>At <num value="1">one</num> time it contented itself with triumphal paeans and dances over victories won by the nation's armies, as in the case of <persName><foreName>Miriam</foreName></persName> and the maidens of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName> at the destruction of the <name>Egyptians</name> at the <placeName reg="Red Sea" key="tgn,7016791">Red Sea</placeName>, or the victories of the armies led by <persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName> against the <name>Philistines</name>; or in the most heart-rending lamentations over the fall of the nation's heroes on the field of battle, as in the mourning of the <name>Trojan</name> maidens over the death of <persName n="Hector,,,,," id="n0167.0005.00040.00045" reg="mostcommon:Hector,nomatch:0"><surname>Hector</surname></persName>; at other times, some brave and heroic spirit, goaded with the sense of her country's wrongs, girds upon her own fair and tender form, the armor of proof, and goes forth, the self-constituted but eagerly welcomed leader of its mailed hosts, to overthrow the nation's foes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>We need only recall <persName n="Deborah,,,,," id="n0167.0005.00040.00046" reg="mostcommon:Deborah,nomatch:0"><surname>Deborah</surname></persName>, the avenger of the <name>Israelites</name> against the oppressions of the <rs>King</rs> of <placeName reg="Canaan, Grafton, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2063278">Canaan</placeName>; <persName n="Boadicea,,,,," id="n0167.0005.00040.00047" reg="mostcommon:Boadicea,nomatch:0"><surname>Boadicea</surname></persName>, the daring <rs>Queen</rs> of the <name>Britons</name>, and in later times, the heroic but hapless maid of <placeName reg="Orleans, Barnstable, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050361">Orleans</placeName>, <persName><foreName>Jeanne</foreName></persName> d'arc; and in the <rs>Hungarian</rs> war of <dateStruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></dateStruct>, the brave but unfortunate <persName n="Teleki,Comte,,,," id="n0167.0005.00040.00048" reg="mostcommon:Teleki,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Comte">Countess</roleName> <surname>Teleki</surname></persName>, as examples of these female patriots.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>In rare instances, this sense of the nation's sufferings from a tyrant's oppression, have so wrought upon the sensitive spirit, as to stimulate it to the determination to achieve the country's freedom by the assassination of the oppressor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>It was thus that <persName><foreName>Jael</foreName></persName> brought deliverance to her country by the murder of Sisera; <persName><foreName>Judith</foreName></persName>, by the assassination of <persName><foreName>Holofernes</foreName></persName>; and in modern times, <persName n="Corday,,Charlotte,,," id="n0167.0005.00040.00049" reg="default:Corday,Charlotte,,,"><foreName>Charlotte</foreName> <surname>Corday</surname></persName> sought the rescue of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> from the grasp of the murderous despot, Marat, by plunging the poniard to his heart.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>A far nobler, though less demonstrative manifestation of patriotic <pb id="p.41" n="41"/> devotion than either of these, is that which has prompted women in all ages to become ministering angels to the sick, the suffering, and the wounded among their countrymen who have periled life and health in the nation's cause.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Occasionally, even in the earliest recorded wars of antiquity, we find high-born maidens administering solace to the wounded heroes on the field of battle, and attempting to heal their wounds by the appliances of their rude and simple surgery; but it was only the favorite leaders, never the common soldier, or the subordinate officer, who received these gentle attentions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>The influence of Christianity, in its earlier development, tended to expand the sympathies and open the heart of woman to all gentle and holy influences, and it is recorded that the wounded <name>Christian</name> soldiers were, where it was possible, nursed and cared for by those of the same faith, both men and women.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>In the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> century, the <rs>Empress Helena</rs> established hospitals for the sick and wounded soldiers of the empire, on the routes between <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002473" n="1.000 10" reg="Istanbul,Istanbul,Marmara,Turkiye,Asia">Constantinople</placeName>, and caused them to be carefully nursed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>In the dark ages that followed, and amid the downfall of the <rs>Roman Empire</rs>, and the uprearing of the <name>Gothic</name> kingdoms that succeeded, there was little room or thought of mercy; but the fair-haired women of the <rs>North</rs> encouraged their heroes to deeds of valor, and at times, ministered in their rude way to their wounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>The monks, at their monasteries, rendered some care and aid to the wounded in return for their exemption from plunder and rapine, and in the <num value="9" type="ordinal">ninth</num> century, an order of women consecrated to the work, the <name>Beguines</name>, predecessors of the modern Sisters of Charity, was established <quote>to minister to the sick and wounded of the armies which then, and for centuries afterward, scarred the face of continental <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> with battle-fields.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>With the <name>Beguines</name>, however, and their successors, patriotism was not so much the controlling motive of action, as the attainment of merit by those deeds of charity and self-sacrifice.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>In the wars of the <num value="17" type="ordinal">seventeenth</num>, <num value="18" type="ordinal">eighteenth</num>, and the early part <pb id="p.42" n="42"/> of the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century, while the hospitals had a moderate share of fair ministrants, chiefly of the religious orders, the only female service on the battle-field or in the camp, often the scene of fatal epidemics, was that of the <foreign lang="fr">cantinieres</foreign>, <foreign lang="fr">vivandieres</foreign>, <foreign lang="fr">filles du regiment</foreign>, and other camp followers, who, at some risk of reputation, accompanied the armies in their march, and brought to the wounded and often dying soldier, on the field of battle, the draught of water which quenched his raging thirst, or the cordial, which sustained his fast ebbing strength till relief could come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Humble of origin, and little circumspect in morals as many of these women were, they are yet deserving of credit for the courage and patriotism which led them to brave all the horrors of death, to relieve the suffering of the wounded of the regiments to which they were attached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Up to the period of the <name>Crimean</name> war in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, though there had been much that was praiseworthy in the manifestations of female patriotism in connection with the movements of great armies, there had never been any systematic ministration, prompted by patriotic devotion, to the relief of the suffering sick and wounded of those armies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>There were yet other modes, however, in which the women of ancient and modern times manifested their love of their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>The Spartan mother, who, without a tear, presented her sons with their shields, with :the stern injunction to return with them, or upon them, that is, with honor untarnished, or dead,--the fair dames and maidens of <placeName reg="Carthage, Jasper, Missouri" key="tgn,2058276">Carthage</placeName>, who divested themselves of their beautiful tresses, to furnish bowstrings for their soldiers,--the <name>Jewish</name> women who preferred a death of torture, to the acknowledgment of the power of the tyrant over their country's rulers, and their faith &mdash; the women of the <name>Pays</name>-<persName n="Vaud,,de,,," id="n0167.0005.00042.00050" reg="mostcommon:Vaud,de,,,:1"><foreName>de</foreName> <surname>Vaud</surname></persName>, whose mountain fastnesses and churches were dearer to them than life-the <num value="1000">thousands</num> of wives and mothers, who in our revolutionary struggle, and in our recent war, gave up freely at their country's call, their best beloved, regretting only that they had no more to give; knowing full well, that in giving them up they condemned <pb id="p.43" n="43"/> themselves to penury and want, to hard, grinding toil, and privations such as they had never before experienced, and not improbably to the rending, by the rude vicissitudes of war, of those ties, dearer than life itself-those who in the presence of ruffians, capable of any atrocity dared, and in many cases suffered, a violent death, and indignities worse than death, by their fearless defense of the cause and flag of their country-and yet again, those who, in peril of their lives, for the love they bore to their country, guided hundreds of escaped prisoners, through the regions haunted by foes, to safety and freedom-all these and many others, whose deeds of heroism we have not space so much as to name, have shown their love of country as fully and worthily, as those who in hospital, in camp or on battle-field have ministered to the battle-scarred hero, or those who, in all the panoply of war, have led their hosts to the deadly charge, or the fierce affray of contending armies.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>She had voluntarily passed through the course of training, required of the hospital nurses and assistants, in Pastor Fliedner's Deaconess' Institution, at Kaiserswerth on the <rs>Rhine</rs>, before she entered upon her great mission in the hospitals at <placeName key="tgn,7010752" n="1.000 10" reg="Shkoder,Shkoder,Shqiperia,Europe">Scutari</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>But though the transition was sudden from the arts of peace to the din and tumult of war, and the blunders, both from inexperience and dogged adherence to routine, were innumerable, the hearts of the people, and especially the hearts of the gentler sex, were resolutely set upon <num value="1">one</num> thing; that the citizen soldiers of the nation should be cared for, in sickness or in health, as the soldiers of no nation had ever been before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Soldiers' Aid Societies, Sewing Circles for the soldiers, and Societies for Relief, sprang up simultaneously with the organization of regiments, in every village, town, and city throughout the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>Individual benevolence kept pace with organized charity, and the managers of the freight trains and expresses, running toward <placeName key="tgn,7013962;tgn,2035845" n="0.119 000000.4773	placename;tgn,7013962;washington, district of columbia,District of Columbia,United States,North and Central America;0.040 000000.1591	placename;tgn,2035845;washington, washington, iowa,Washington,Iowa,United States,North and Central America" reg="washington, district of columbia,District of Columbia,United States,North and Central America;washington, washington, iowa,Washington,Iowa,United States,North and Central America">Washington</placeName>, were in despair at the fearful accumulation of freight for the soldiers, demanding instant transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>It was inevitable that there should be waste and loss in this lavish outpouring; but it was a manifestation of the patriotic feeling which throbbed in the hearts of the people, and which, through <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of war, never ceased or diminished aught of its zeal, or its abundant liberality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>It was felt instinctively, that there would soon be a demand for nurses for the sick and wounded, and fired by the noble example of <persName n="Nightingale,,Florence,,," id="n0167.0005.00044.00053" reg="default:Nightingale,Florence,,,"><foreName>Florence</foreName> <surname>Nightingale</surname></persName>, though too often without her practical training, <num value="1000">thousands</num> of young, fair, and highly educated women offered themselves for the work, and strove for opportunities for their gentle ministry, as in other days they might have striven for the prizes of fortune.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>Soon order emerged from the chaos of benevolent impulse; the <orgName n="Sanitary Commission" type="commission">Sanitary Commission</orgName> and its affiliated Societies organized and wisely directed much of the philanthropic effort, which would otherwise have failed of accomplishing its intended work through <pb id="p.45" n="45"/> misdirection; while other Commissions, Associations, and skilfully managed personal labors, supplemented what was lacking in its earlier movements, and ere long the <orgName n="Christian Commission" type="commission">Christian Commission</orgName> added intellectual and religious aliment to its supplies for the wants of the physical man.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>The ground of rejection was usually the youthfulness of the applicants; a sufficient reason, doubtless, in most cases, since the enthusiasm, mingled in some instances, perhaps, with romance, which had prompted the offer, would often falter before the extremely unpoetic realities of a nurse's duties, and the youth and often frail health of the applicants would soon cause them to give way under labors which required a mature strength, a firm will, and skill in all household duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>The rejection of so many of these volunteer nurses necessitated the appointment of many from another class,--young women of culture and education, but generally from the humbler walks of life, in whose hearts the fire of patriotism was not less ardent and glowing than in those of their wealthier sisters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>Many of these, though they would have preferred to perform their labors without fee or reward, were compelled, from the necessities of those at home, to accept the wholly inadequate pittance (<measure n="12dollars" type="currency">twelve dollars</measure> a month <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> and their food) which was offered them by the <rs>Government</rs>, but they served in their several stations with a fidelity, intelligence, and patient devotion which no money could purchase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Great and noble as were the sacrifices made by these women, and fitted as they were to call forth our admiration, were they after all, equal to those of the mothers, sisters, and daughters, who, though not without tears, yet calmly, and with hearts burning with the fire of patriotism, willingly, gave up their best beloved to fight for the cause of their country and their <name n="God" type="God">God</name>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>A sister might give up an only brother, the playmate of her childhood, her pride, and her hope; a daughter might bid adieu to a father dearly beloved, whose care and guidance she still needs and will continue to need.

But the wife, who, fully worthy of that holy name, gave the parting hand to a husband who was dearer, infinitely dearer to her than father, son, or brother, and saw him go forth to the battle-field, where severe wounds or sudden and terrible death, were almost certainly to be his portion, sacrificed in that <num value="1">one</num> act all but life, for she relinquished all that made life blissful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Yet even in this holocaust there were degrees, gradations of sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>The wife of the officer might, perchance, have occasion to see how her husband was honored and advanced for his bravery and good conduct, and while he was spared, she was not likely to suffer the pangs of poverty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>In these particulars, how much more, sad was the condition of the wife of the private soldier, especially in the earlier years of the war. To her, except the letters often long delayed or captured on their route, there were no tidings of her husband, except in the lists of the wounded or the slain; and her home, often <num value="1">one</num> of refinement and taste, was not only saddened by the absence of him who was its chief joy, but often stripped of its best belongings, to help out the scanty pittance which rewarded her own severe toil, in furnishing food and clothing for herself and her little ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Cruel, grinding poverty, was too often the portion of these poor women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>At the <rs>West</rs>, women tenderly and carefully reared, were compelled to undertake the rude labors of the field, to provide bread for their families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>And when, to so many of these poor women who had thus struggled with poverty, and the depressing influences of loneliness and weariness, there came the sad intelligence, that the husband so dearly loved, was among the slain, or that he had been captured and consigned to death by starvation and slow torture at <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.343 000000.6859	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.343 000000.6859	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName>, where even now he might be filling an unknown grave, what wonder is it that in numerous cases the burden was too heavy for the wearied spirit, <pb id="p.64" n="64"/> and insanity supervened, or the broken heart found rest and reunion with the loved and lost in the grave.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Yet in many instances, the heart that seemed nigh to breaking, found solace in its sorrow, in ministering directly or indirectly to the wounded soldier, and forgetting its own misery, brought to other hearts and homes consolation and peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>This seems to us the loftiest and most divine of all the manifestations of the heroic spirit; it is nearest akin in its character to the conduct of Him, who while <quote>he was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief,</quote> yet found the opportunity, with his infinite tenderness and compassion, to assuage every sorrow and soothe every grief but his own.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>The effect of this patriotic zeal and fervor on the part of the wives, mothers, sisters, and daughters of the loyal <rs>North</rs>, in stimulating and encouraging the soldiers to heroic deeds, was remarkable.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>The loyal soldier felt that he was fighting, so to speak, under the very eyes of his countrywomen, and he was prompted to higher deeds of daring and valor by the thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>In the smoke and flame of battle, he bore, or followed the flag, made and consecrated by female hands to his country's service; many of the articles which contributed to his comfort, and strengthened his good right arm, and inspirited his heart for the day of battle <pb id="p.65" n="65"/> were the products of the toil and the gifts of his countrywomen; and he knew right well, that if he should fall in the fierce conflict, the gentle ministrations of woman would be called in requisition, to bind up his wounds, to cool his fevered brow, to minister to his fickle or failing appetite, to soothe his sorrows, to communicate with his friends, and if death came to close his eyes, and comfort, so far as might be those who had loved him. This knowledge strengthened him in the conflict, and enabled him to strike more boldly and vigorously for freedom, until the time came when the foe, dispirited and exhausted, yielded up his last vantage ground, and the war was over.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The complaint was doubtless exaggerated, for in their hospitals there were some women of high station who did minister to the wounded, but after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year, the gifts and sacrifices of Southern women to their army and hospitals, were not the <num value="100" type="ordinal">hundredth</num>, hardly the thousandth part of those of the women of the <rs>North</rs> to their countrymen.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>Authority had been bestowed upon her, but not the power to enforce obedience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>There was no penalty for disobedience, and persons disaffected, forgetful, or idle, might refuse or neglect to obey with impunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>It will at once be seen that this fact must have resulted disastrously upon her efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>She doubtless had enemies (as who has not)? and some were jealous of the power and prominence of her position, while many might even feel unwilling, under any circumstances, to acknowledge, and yield to the authority of a woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>Added to this she had, in some cases, and probably without any fault on her part, failed to secure the confidence and respect of the surgeons in charge of hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>In these facts lay the sources of trials, discouragements, and difficulties, all to be met, struggled with, and, if possible, triumphed over by a woman, standing quite alone in a most responsible, laborious, and exceptional position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>It indeed seems most wonderful-almost miraculous &mdash; that under such circumstances, such a vast amount of good was accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>She does not apparently desire fame, she does not enjoy being talked about, even in praise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>The approval of her own conscience, the consciousness of performing an unique and useful work, seems quite to suffice her. Few women are so self-reliant, self-sustained, self-centered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>And in saying this we but echo the sentiments, if not the words, of an eminent divine who, like herself, was during the whole war devoted to a work similar in its purpose, and alike responsible and arduous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>Her nature is large and generous, yet with no room for narrow grudges, or mean reservations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>As a proof of this, her stores were as readily dispensed for the use of a hospital in which the surgeon refused and rejected her nurses, as for those who employed them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>She had the kindest care and oversight over the women she had commissioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>She wished them to embrace every opportunity for the rest and refreshment rendered necessary by their arduous labors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>She is far from realizing the popular idea of the strong-minded woman-loud, boisterous and uncouth, claiming as a right, what might, perhaps, be more readily obtained as a courteous concession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>No tree, shrub, or weed grew there; and the only shelter was light tents without floors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>The light sand that yielded to the tread, the walker sinking to the ankles at almost every step, glistened in the sun, and burned the feet like particles of fire, and as the ocean winds swept it, it darkened the air and filled the eyes and nostrils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>By this time, of course, she was very generally known, and the circle of her correspondence was wide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>Her influence in high <pb id="p.128" n="128"/> official quarters was supposed to be considerable, and she was in the daily receipt of inquiries and applications of various kinds, in particular in regard to the fate of men believed to have been confined in Southern prisons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>Without rank, rights or authority credited by law, the officials there were at a loss how to receive her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/>When the sinking sufferer was lying with closed eyes, too feeble to make moan or sigh, the hospital spoon was put between his lips, with the mouthful of strong broth or hot wine, which rallied him till the watchful nurse came round again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/><num value="1">One</num> thing that came out of it was the lesson on the saving of good cookery.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1051"/>This colored hospital service was <num value="1">one</num> of those extraordinary tasks, out of the ordinary course of army hospital discipline, that none but a woman could execute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1052"/>It required more than a man's power of endurance, for men fainted and fell under the burden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1053"/>It required a woman's discernment, a woman's tenderness, a woman's delicacy and tact; it required such nerve and moral force, and such executive power, as are rarely united in any woman's character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1054"/>The simple grace with which she moved about the hospital camps, the gentle dignity with which she ministered to the suffering about her, won all hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1055"/>As she passed through the wards, the men would follow her with their eyes, attracted by the grave sweetness of her manner; and when she stopped by some bed-side, and laid her hand upon the forehead and smoothed the hair of a soldier, speaking some cheering, pleasant word, I have seen the tears gather in his eyes, and his lips quiver, as he tried to speak or to touch the fold of her dress, as if appealing to her to listen, while he opened his heart about the mother, wife, or sister far away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1056"/>I have seen her in her sober gray flannel gown, sitting motionless by the dim candle-light,--which was all our camp could afford,--with her eyes open and watchful, and her hands ever ready for all those endless wants of sickness at night, especially sickness that may be tended unto death, or unto the awful struggle between life and death, which it was the lot of <pb id="p.146" n="146"/> nearly all of us at some time to keep watch over until the danger had gone by. And in sadder trials, when the life of a soldier whom she had watched and ministered to was trembling in the balance between earth and heaven, waiting for Him to make all things new, she has seemed, by some special grace of the <name>Spirit</name>, to reach the living <rs>Christ</rs>, and draw a blessing down as the shining way was opened to the tomb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/>And I have seen such looks of gratitude from weary eyes, now brightened by visions of heavenly glory, the last of many recognitions of her ministry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1058"/>Absorbed in her work, unconscious of the spiritual beauty which invested her daily life,--whether in her kitchen, in the heat and overcrowding incident to the issues of a large special diet list, or sitting at the cot of some poor lonely soldier, whispering of the higher realities of another world,--she was always the same presence of grace and love, of peace and benediction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1059"/>I have been with her in the wards when the men have craved some simple religious services,--the reading of Scripture, the repetition of a psalm, the singing of a hymn, or the offering of a prayer,--and invariably the men were melted to tears by the touching simplicity of her eloquence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1060"/> These were the tokens of her ministry among the sickest men; but it was not here alone that her influence was felt in the hospital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1061"/>Was there jealousy in the kitchen, her quick penetration detected the cause, and in her gentle way harmony was restored; was there profanity among the convalescents, her daily presence and kindly admonition or reproof, with an occasional glance which spoke her sorrow for such sin, were enough to check the evil; or was there hardship or discontent, the knowledge that she was sharing the discomfort too, was enough to compel patient endurance until a remedy could be provided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1062"/>And so, through all the war, from the <measure n="7days" type="date">seven days</measure> conflict upon the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>, in those early <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> days of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, through the campaigns of <placeName key="tgn,7016218" n="1.000 581" reg="antietam, washington, maryland">Antietam</placeName> and <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, of <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName> and <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, and after the conflicts of the <rs>Wilderness</rs>, and the fierce and undecided <pb id="p.147" n="147"/> battles which were fought for the possession of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, she labored steadfastly on until the end. Through scorching heat and pinching cold, in the tent or upon the open field, in the ambulance or on the saddle, through rain and snow, amid unseen perils of the enemy, under fire upon the field, or in the more insidious dangers of contagion, she worked quietly on, doing her simple part with all womanly tact and skill, until now the hospital dress is laid aside, and she rests, with the sense of a noble work done, and with the blessings and prayers of the <num value="1000">thousands</num> whose sufferings she has relieved, or whose lives she has saved.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1064"/>Finding that they were suffering from overcrowding, privation, neglect, and sickness, she procured the erection of comfortable huts for them, obtained clothing from the <rs>North</rs> for the more destitute, and by example and precept encouraged them in habits of neatness and order, while she also inculcated practical godliness in all their life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1076"/>A pale, quiet, delicate woman, often an invalid for months, and almost always a sufferer; the wife of a somewhat eminent physician, in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, and in circumstances which did not require constant activity for her livelihood, refined, educated, and shrinking from all rough or brutal sights or sounds, she seemed <num value="1">one</num> of those who were least fitted to endure the hardships, and encounter the roughnesses of a life in the camp or field hospitals.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/>But beneath that quiet and frail exterior, there dwelt a firm and dauntless spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1078"/>She had been known by her neighbors, and especially in the church of which she was an honored member, as a woman of remarkable piety and devotion, and as an excellent and skilful attendant upon the sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1079"/>When the war commenced, she was <num value="1">one</num> of the ladies who assembled to form the <rs>Ladies</rs>' <orgName n="Aid Society" type="society">Aid Society of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName></orgName>, and was chosen, we believe unanimously, Corresponding <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/>She seems to have entered upon the work from the feeling that it was a part of her duty, a sacrifice she was called to make, a burden which she ought to bear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/>And through the war, mainly from her temperament, which inclined her to look on the dark side, she never seemed stimulated or strengthened in her work by that abiding <pb id="p.150" n="150"/> conviction of the final success of our arms, which was to so many of the patient workers, the day-star of hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/>We speak of this not to depreciate her work or zeal, but rather to do the more honor to both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/>The despondent temperament and the intense sympathy with sorrow were constitutional, or the result of years of ill-health, and that under their depressing influence, with no step of her way lighted with the sunshine of joy, she should have not only continued faithful to her work, but have undergone more hardships and accomplished more, for the soldiers than most others, reflects the highest credit upon her patience, perseverance and devotion to the cause.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>This division of labor seems to have satisfied her associates, who forwarded to her order their hospital stores and money with the most perfect confidence in her judicious disposition of both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1128"/>His mind wandered; and as we approached him he exclaimed: <q direct="unspecified">Is it not cruel to keep me here when my mother and sister, whom I have not seen for a year, are in the next room; they might let me go in?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1129"/>His mind continued to wander; only for an instant did he seem to have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1130"/>a glimpse of the reality, when he drew <num value="2">two</num> rings from his finger, placed there by a loving mother and sister, handed them to an attendant, saying: <q direct="unspecified">Carry them home,</q> and then he was amid battle scenes, calling out, <q direct="unspecified">Deploy to the left;</q> <q direct="unspecified"> Keep out of that ambuscade ;</q> <q direct="unspecified">Now go, my braves, double quick, and strike for your flag I On, on,</q> and he threw up his arms as if cheering them, <q direct="unspecified">you'll win the day;</q> and so he continued to talk, whilst death was doing its terrible work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1131"/>As we looked upon the beautiful face and manly form, and thought of the mother and sister in their distant home, surrounded by every luxury wealth could purchase, worlds seemed all too cheap to give to have him with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1132"/>But this could not be. The soldier of <num value="3">three</num> battles, he was not willing to admit that he was sick until his strength failed, and he was actually dying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/>He was carried to this cheerless room, a rude table the only furniture; no door, no window-shutters; the western sun threw its hot rays in upon him,--no cooling shade for his fevered brow: and so he lay unconscious of the monster's grasp, which would not relax until he had done his work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1300"/>We found that what we brought in the ambulance was giving untold comfort to our poor exhausted wounded men, whose rough hospital couches were made by pine boughs with the stems cut out, spread upon the ground over which their blankets were thrown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1331"/>She is a widow, somewhat above <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> of age, of humble origin, and of but moderate education, with a robust frame and great powers of endurance, and possessing a rough stirring eloquence, a stern, determined will and extraordinary executive ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1335"/>It has been <num value="1">one</num> of her peculiarities that she devoted her attention almost exclusively to the care of the <pb id="p.173" n="173"/> private soldiers; the officers, she said, had enough to look after them; but it was the men, poor fellows, with but a private's pay, a private's fare, and a private's dangers, to whom she was particularly called.
