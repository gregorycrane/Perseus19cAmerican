<head>Preface.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>For several years my friends among Confederate soldiers have been urging me to <quote>write up</quote> and publish what I know of the war. By personal solicitation and by letter this subject has been brought before me and placed in the light of a duty which I owe to posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Taking this view of it, I willingly comply, glad that I am permitted to stand among the many <quote>witnesses</quote> who shall establish <quote>the truth,</quote> proud to write myself as <num value="1">one</num> who faithfully served the defenders of the <name>Cause</name> which had and has my heart's devotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>I have tried to give a faithful record of my experiences, to <quote>nothing extenuate nor aught set down in malice,</quote> and I have told the truth, <hi rend="italics">but not always the whole truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>A</hi> few of these <quote>Memories</quote> were originally written for the <hi rend="italics">Southern Bivouac</hi>, and are here republished because my book would have been incomplete without them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>I am very inexperienced in the business of making books, but relying with confidence upon the leniency of my friends, and feeling sure that I have no enemy who will savagely rejoice that I have written a book, I make the venture.</p></div1> 
<div1 id="c.2" type="chapter" n="2"> 
<head>Introductury</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>among those who early espoused the <rs>Southern Cause</rs>, few, perhaps, were more in earnest than my husband and myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Our patriotism was at the very outset put to a crucial test.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>The duties of a soldier and a civilian became incompatible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Being in ill health, it was thought best that I should go to my mother at the <rs>North</rs> for awhile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>My husband, after preliminary service with the <q direct="unspecified">Minute Men</q> and the <rs>State</rs> troops, as a member of <orgName type="company" n="Company A">Company A</orgName>, <orgName n="Crescent Rifles" type="rifles">Crescent Rifles</orgName>, was, with this company, regularly mustered into the <rs>Confederate</rs> service in <dateStruct value="1861-04-"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, and left for <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola, Florida</placeName>, where the <orgName n="Crescent Rifles" type="rifles">Crescent Rifles</orgName>, with the <orgName type="division" n="Louisiana Guard">Louisiana Guard</orgName>s, Orleans Cadets, Shreveport Guards, Terrebonne Rifles, and <orgName n="Grivot Guards" type="guards">Grivot Guards</orgName>, were organized into the <rs>Dreux Battalion</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>It was then supposed that <q direct="unspecified">the affair</q> would be <q direct="unspecified">settled in <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/></p> 
<p>From my house of refuge I watched eagerly the course of events, until at last all mail facilities were cut off, and I was left to endure the horrors of suspense as well as the irritating consciousness that, although sojourning in the home of my childhood, I was an alien, an acknowledged <q direct="unspecified">Rebel,</q> and as such an object of suspicion and dislike to all save my immediate family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Even these, with the exception of my precious mother, were bitterly opposed to the <rs>South</rs> and Secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>From mother I received unceasing care, thorough sympathy, surpassing love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>During this troubled time a <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> little babe was born to me,&mdash;a tiny babe,&mdash;who only just opened its dark eyes upon the troubled face of its mother to close them forever.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The guns of <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>, reverberating throughout the <rs>North</rs>, <q direct="unspecified">stirred a fever in the blood of age</q> and youth alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Fanatics raved more wildly than ever, while those who had hitherto been lukewarm hastened to swell the cry of horror and fury which everywhere arose at this <q direct="unspecified">insult to our flag.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>This feeling found vent in acts of oppression, met by prompt and determined resistance, and thus was inaugurated the fratricidal strife which was for <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> to desolate the land.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Rumors of an engagement in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> intensified my suspense until it seemed unbearable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/><num value="1">One</num> day I received a kindly warning from an old friend concerning a small Confederate flag which had been sent to me by my husband.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It was a tiny silken affair, which I kept in my prayer&mdash;book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>This harmless possession was magnified by the people of the town into an immense rebel banner, which would eventually float over my mother's house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>I had still a few friends whose temperate counsel had hitherto protected me. The note referred to warned me that while I retained possession of the flag I might at any time expect the presence of a mob. I would not have destroyed my treasure for worlds, and how to conceal it became a subject of constant thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The discovery <num value="1">one</num> day of a jar of <q direct="unspecified">perpetual paste</q> in mother's secretary suggested an idea which was at once carried out. Applying this strongly adhesive mixture to <num value="1">one</num> side of the flag, I pasted it upon the naked flesh just over my heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/><num value="1">One</num> morning the mail brought certain news of a Confederate victory at Big Bethel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>This so exasperated the people that on their way from the <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName> an excited crowd halted under my window, crying out, <q direct="unspecified">Where's that rebel woman?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/><q direct="unspecified">Let's have <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> that flag,</q> <q direct="unspecified">Show your colors,</q> etc. Carried away by intense excitement, I threw open the blinds, and, waving the newspaper above my head, shouted, <q direct="unspecified">Hurrah I Hurrah for Big Bethel!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Hurrah for the brave rebels</q> A perfect howl of rage arose from below, and greater evil might have befallen but for the timely appearance of the venerable village doctor, who now rode hastily in among the excited men, and, standing up in his buggy, cried out, <q direct="unspecified">Friends, she is but a frail, defenceless woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Be thankful if your morning's work be not her death.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Slowly and sullenly the crowd dispersed, while the good doctor hastily ascended to my chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>I lay with fevered cheeks and burning eyes among the pillows where my mother had placed me. The terrible excitement under which I labored forbade all blame or any allusion to my act of imprudence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>I was soothed and tenderly cared for until, under the influence of a sedative, I fell asleep.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Early next morning the doctor appeared at my bedside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Meantime a change had come over me. I seemed to have lost the nervous excitability of a girl and to have become a <hi rend="italics">woman</hi>, full of courage and hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/><rs type="role">Dr.</rs>&mdash;&mdash; regarded me steadily for a moment; then,&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">Ah I better this morning?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>That's my brave girl.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Meeting his gaze fully, I replied, <q direct="unspecified">I shall try henceforth to be brave, as befits the wife of a soldier.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>A frown appeared upon the doctor's brow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Tenderly placing his hand upon my head, he said, <q direct="unspecified">My child, I fear your courage will soon be put to the test.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Your own imprudence has greatly incensed the town people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Danger menaces you, and through you, your mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Fortunately, the friends of your childhood still desire to protect you; but your only safety lies in giving up the rebel flag which it is said you possess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Give it to me, <persName><foreName>Fannie</foreName></persName>, and I will destroy it before their eyes, and thus avert the threatened <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> danger.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>I only smiled, as I replied: <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role">Dr.</rs>&mdash;&mdash;, since the rebel flag has existed, I have cherished it in my heart of hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>You may search the house over; you will find no flag but the <num value="1">one</num> I have here,</q> placing my hand on my heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The good man had known me from childhood, and he could not doubt me. He questioned no further, but took his leave, promising to use his influence with the incensed villagers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>They, however, were not so easily convinced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>They had been wrought up to a state of frenzied patriotism, and declared they would search the house where the obnoxious flag was supposed to be. Dire threats of vengeance were heard on every side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>At last a committee was appointed to wait upon <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">the traitress</hi></q> and again demand the surrender of the flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>It was composed of gentlemen who, though thorough and uncompromising <q direct="unspecified">Union men,</q> were yet well known to me, and were anxious, if possible, to shield me. They were admitted to the room, where I calmly awaited them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>I reiterated the assertion made to the doctor, so calmly, and with such apparent truth, that they were staggered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>But they had come to perform a duty, and they meant to succeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>They convinced me that the danger to myself and to the house of my mother was real and imminent, but I only repeated my assertions, though my heart throbbed painfully as I saw the anxiety and trouble in mother's face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Suddenly I remembered that I had in my possession a paper which, just before all mail communication had ceased between the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, had been sent to me for the purpose of protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>It was simply a certificate of my husband's membership and good standing in a Masonic lodge, and had a seal affixed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>As I called for the portfolio, all eyes brightened with expectation of seeing at last the <q direct="unspecified">rebel flag.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Drawing forth from its envelope the fateful document, I said, <q direct="unspecified">I was told to <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> use this only in dire extremity; it seems to me that such a time is at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>If there be any virtue in Masonry, let it now protect me and the roof which is at present my only shelter!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/></p> 
<p>Thus speaking, I handed the paper to <num value="1">one</num> whom I knew to be a prominent <persName n="Mason,,,,," id="n0242.0002.00013.00001" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><surname>Mason</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The certificate was duly examined and, after a short conference, returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/><q direct="unspecified">We will do our best,</q> said the spokesman of the party, and all withdrew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The day passed without further trouble, and as I sank to sleep that night there came to me a feeling of safety and protection, which was indeed comforting.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Weeks passed, during which I slowly but surely gathered the strength and health necessary to carry out the resolution lately formed, to join my husband, and, if might be, to labor for the cause so loved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The unceasing ministrations of my mother strengthened alike soul and body, but as I read in that dear face a love and devotion which could never fail, my heart felt many a bitter pang at the thought of the parting that must be.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/><num value="1">One</num> evening, having found the courage necessary to tell mother of my plans and hopes, to my surprise the noble woman heard me calmly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/><q direct="unspecified">I had expected this,</q> she said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/><q direct="unspecified">It is right&mdash;you must go; but, oh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>not now &mdash;not soon,</q> and in uncontrollable agitation she left the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/><measure n="2days" type="date">Two days</measure> later the subject was resumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Ways and means were discussed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The mother's face grew paler as that of her child brightened and glowed with returning health and hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>She pleaded to keep my little boy, but fearing lest his young heart might receive, among the enemies of Southern liberty, impressions which could not be effaced, I decided that he must not be left.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Upon the eve of the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs> we started on our hazardous journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The utmost secrecy had been observed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>No baggage could be allowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>My <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> thoughtful mother converted quite a large sum into gold, which, stitched into a broad belt, was sewed around my waist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/><num value="1">One</num> bright morning mother and I, with my boy, seated ourselves in the carriage as if for our usual drive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>There was no leave-taking, no appearance of anything unusual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Once on the road, we were rapidly driven to a railroad depot in a distant town; there I took the train, while my poor mother returned homeward alone.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Arrived in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, we found ourselves among those whose hearts were filled with ardent love of <q direct="unspecified">the <name>Cause</name>,</q> and bitter hatred for the soldiers who had, in spite of their heroic resistance, so lately passed through the streets of the city on their way to subjugate the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/><q direct="unspecified">The rebel</q> was enthusiastically received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>All were ready to assist her, but at this juncture it seemed impossible to pass the <rs>Federal</rs> lines.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The great <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs> had been decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The wildest excitement prevailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Flying soldiers were everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Almost every hour the sound of fife and drum was heard, as shattered regiments and decimated battalions marched through the streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Although all expression of feeling, among the citizens, was sternly repressed, the mask of sullen indifference was known to be <hi rend="italics">but</hi> a mask.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Hearts beneath were bounding with pride and joy and hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Almost without exception, houses were closed and devoid of all appearance of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Yet behind those closely-shut blinds women embraced each other with tempestuous joy, or paced the floor in uncontrollable agitation, or knelt in earnest prayer, mingling thanksgivings with agonized petitions for those whose fate was yet unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Mothers, sisters, wives, strove, with trembling lips, to comfort each other, bidding the voice of patriotism be heard above the <q direct="unspecified">tempest of the heart.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>In the midst of all this excitement <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> my interests were never lost sight of. Secret meetings were held, and various plans discussed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>At last, <num value="1">one</num> day a note was received inviting me to spend a social evening at the house of <q direct="unspecified"><num value="1">one</num> of the faithful.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>A casual observer would have discovered nothing more than a few lines of invitation, still the paper bore a private mark which made my heart beat with hope.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Arrived at the house indicated, where seemed to be only an ordinary gathering of friends, I found it difficult to appear at ease, and watched eagerly for developments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Not a sign or a word was given, however, until after supper, when the ladies repaired (as usual) to the dressing-room up-stairs to rearrange their toilets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Instead of entering with the rest, the hostess, by a slight pressure of the hand, indicated to me that I was desired to pass on and up a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> flight of stairs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>We did so unnoticed, and soon entered a small room in the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> story, where were found waiting a few friends, among them a captain and clerk of a steamboat which was expected to leave in <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> for <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName> with <orgName n="U. S. Troops" type="org">United States troops</orgName> to reinforce <persName n="Phelps,Colonel,,,," id="n0242.0002.00015.00002" reg="mostcommon:Phelps,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phelps</surname></persName> at that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Here appeared to be a chance, but a hazardous <num value="1">one</num>, since the officers of the boat must not evince any interest in their passenger, and could afford no assistance or protection among the rough soldiers who would crowd every available foot of room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>They must appear as good Union men, engaged in transporting troops to assist in quelling <q direct="unspecified">the rebellion.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>In case of any rough treatment of the <q direct="unspecified">rebel woman,</q> they could only appeal to the officers in charge of the troops, and the result of such an appeal, in the present state of feeling, would be doubtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>The boat was not a passenger steamer, and had only <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> small staterooms, occupied by its officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>These might be required by the <rs type="role" reg="military-Commander">military commanders</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Instantly, and unhesitatingly, <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> I decided to make the trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>We ladies then descended to the parlor, while <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> our friends were conveyed out of the house.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>A new difficulty at once arose; a friend had applied to <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n0242.0002.00016.00003" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> for a pass&mdash;unsuccessfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>The precious hours were passing, and failure seemed imminent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>This difficulty was increased by the fact that I had undertaken the charge of Jemmy Little, a boy of <num value="10">ten</num>, who, having lingered too long at school in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, had been cut off from his family in <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>, and being desperately unhappy, had implored to be included in the plans formed for me. He was to pass as my brother, and, having once promised, I could not disappoint him, especially as his waking hours were spent by my side, his hand often nestling into my own, his large wistful eyes questioning my face, as if dreading to find there some evidence of hesitation or change of purpose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/><num value="1">One</num> day passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>At evening, as I was anxiously pacing my room, my hostess hurriedly entered, exclaiming, in agitation, <quote>Your brother awaits you in the drawing-room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>I <hi rend="italics">could</hi> not welcome him. I <hi rend="italics">will not</hi> see him. Only for your sake would I allow a Federal soldier to cross my threshold; but he is your brother; go to him.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Trembling with excitement, I descended to the parlor, where I found my brother,&mdash;a mere boy yet,&mdash;wearing the uniform of a Federal officer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/><q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role2">Sister</rs></q> <q direct="unspecified"><persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName>!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>each cried, and no further greeting passed between us. The boy stood with folded arms, looking proudly, yet tenderly, at me, his only sister, all the brave ardor of a soldier who believes in the cause he serves revealed in his handsome young face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>I sank into a chair and covered my face, that I might shut out the sight which so pained me. The interview that followed was long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Finding that my brother not only approved the determination to join my husband, <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> but was able and willing to assist in obtaining the necessary pass, I told him of my wish to have it in possession by the next day, and received his promise to send it, if possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>He was going to <q direct="unspecified">the front,</q> and overcome by the thought that I might never see him again, I threw my arms around his neck, while tears fell fast upon the blue uniform, and so, with a last embrace, we parted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>The pass, embracing <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Beers,Mrs.,,,," id="n0242.0002.00017.00004" reg="mostcommon:Beers,Fannie,A.,,:2"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Beers</surname></persName>, <hi rend="italics">brother</hi>, and child,</q> was forthcoming next day, and the same afternoon I, with my boys, set forth unattended for the boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>No sign of recognition passed between the captain and ourselves as we were conducted to the upper deck, and seated under the awning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Soon the sound of drum and fife announced the approach of the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>A regiment of blue-coated soldiers appeared on the wharf, and directly they marched on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Witnessing their embarkation, I could not repress a feeling of extreme uneasiness, which increased as officers and men appeared on every side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>They were so many: I was the only woman on the boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>Sitting motionless, with veil closely drawn, holding my boy on my lap, while poor Jemmy nestled close to my side (valiant in feeling, but of boyish appearance, and looking even smaller beside the tall soldiers), I hoped to pass unobserved, but soon after the boat left the wharf found myself subjected to rude stares and ruder remarks, and at last was forced to seek the clerk to beg that I might find shelter in <num value="1">one</num> of the little state-rooms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>All were taken by the officers, who seemed utterly indifferent to the forlorn condition of <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Reb,Madame,,,," id="n0242.0002.00017.00005" reg="mostcommon:Reb,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Madame">Madam</roleName> <surname>Reb</surname></persName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>At last the clerk (after a short consultation with <num value="1">one</num> kindly-looking officer, who, however, seemed half ashamed of the kindness of heart which contrasted so finely with the rudeness of his comrades) led the way to a room below,&mdash;small, and close, <hi rend="italics">but a shelter</hi>. Here <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> he placed us, having locked us in to prevent intrusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>The boys soon fell asleep, but I passed the night in listening to the ceaseless noises outside.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Morning found the boat at <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, whence, after a short delay, she proceeded to <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>Under pretence of guarding well the <q direct="unspecified">female rebel,</q> the good clerk escorted us to the officers' quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>Here my pass was examined closely; many questions were asked and answered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>Still, the result seemed doubtful; means of transportation were wanting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>The colonel in command was inclined to be suspicious and sternly unsympathetic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>While standing tremblingly before those whose adverse decision would, I knew, crush all my hopes, <num value="1">one</num> of the officers espied around my neck a slender black chain, and demanded to know what it held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>Instantly hope returned: I drew from my bosom a small case enclosing the <name>Masonic</name> document before mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>As at my mother's house, it was examined and returned without comment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>An hour later, however, a plentiful repast was set before us, after which a covered ambulance appeared, in which was placed for my comfort the only arm-chair the camp contained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Soon, attended by an officer and a guard of Federal soldiers, our little party entered upon the last stage of our journey to the <rs>Confederate</rs> lines.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>The route lay amid scenes of desolation sadder than anything I had ever dreamed of. Fields, which a few short weeks before had given promise of a rich harvest, were laid waste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>Here and there tiny columns of smoke arose from the smouldering ruins of once happy homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>The heat and dust were almost insufferable, but as the sun declined a cool breeze sprang up, and later a flood of moonlight clothed the landscape with a mystical beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>It shone coldly on the few deserted homes which the hand of the destroyer had spared, and to me <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> it seemed that its silvery rays were like the pale fingers of a mourner who places white wreaths upon the grave of love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>In the soft wind I heard only&mdash;moans and sighs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>The children slept soundly in the straw at the bottom of the ambulance, and soon the steady, monotonous tramp of the guard lulled me also to rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>We approached the <rs>Confederate</rs> lines just at sunrise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>A flag of truce was unfurled, and at once answered by an officer on picket-duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>A short parley ensued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>At a word of command the <orgName n="Federal guard" type="guard">Federal guard</orgName> fell back and were replaced by Confederates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>A moment later, I, with my charges, descended, to be greeted with enthusiasm, tempered with the most chivalrous respect, by the <q direct="unspecified">boys in gray,</q> who proved to be members of the battalion to which my husband was attached, and who at once relieved my fears by assurances of his safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>It was a supreme moment, such as comes seldom in a lifetime, and yet a time for stern self-repression.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>The emotions of a heart at rest, after trials so sore, were too sacred to find expression.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>I gazed around me in silent ecstasy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>It seemed to me that the sun had never shone so brightly, or on a scene so lovely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>Noting the manly faces and noble bearing of those who wore the gray, I felt that the purple and ermine of kings could not have clothed them half so magnificently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>And, oh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>how delicious and appetizing seemed <q direct="unspecified">the rations,</q> which, though simple, were served under those green trees with the earnest, genuine hospitality which is so well described by the term <q direct="unspecified">Southern.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/></p> 
<p>The camp being several miles distant, nothing remained but to wait patiently for some means of transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>It was near sunset when the loud singing of a negro driver was heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Soon he appeared upon a <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> novel conveyance,&mdash;a rough, unplaned board or <num value="2">two</num> on wheels and drawn by a single ox. Unpromising as this <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">turnout</hi></q> appeared, we were informed that it was a <q direct="unspecified">Godsend,</q> so we joyfully mounted the cart, a soldier being detailed to accompany us. My little son was made supremely happy by being invited to sit upon the lap of the driver, whose characteristic songs beguiled the way through the shadowy woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>Within a few miles of camp the challenge of a sentry was heard; half an hour later we found ourselves among the tents of the <rs>Dreux Battalion</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>My husband was <q direct="unspecified">on guard,</q> perhaps thinking sadly of his absent wife and boy, certainly never dreaming they were so near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>As the ambulance drove into camp it was at once surrounded by soldiers, both officers and privates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>As soon as my name was known, some <num value="1">one</num> who evidently appreciated the situation rushed off in hot haste to notify and relieve the soldier most interested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>Meantime a dozen hands clasped mine in kindly greeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>To whom they belonged I could not tell, for the dense shade shut out the moonlight, and seen by the light of the camp-fires, disguised as each <num value="1">one</num> was in the rough garb of a soldier, my quondam city friends were quite unrecognizable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>I will leave to the imagination of the reader the happy meeting between long-parted ones and the many caresses showered upon our child.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>I had expected nothing better than to spend the night in the ambulance or under a tent, and would have taken great pride in <q direct="unspecified">camping out,</q> but the chivalrous officers in command would not hear of such a plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Their quarters (<num value="2">two</num> rooms in a little log house) were instantly vacated, and I had scarcely descended from the vehicle when a negro man appeared, to bring a message.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/><pb id="p.21" n="21"/> I could not have been bidden to a luxurious apartment with more ceremony.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>The next morning the shrill sound of the fife and the drum beating the <q direct="unspecified">reveille</q> aroused us, and we were up with the sun.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>The scene was entrancing; to me particularly so, for the white tents gleaming among the trees reminded me that I was among <hi rend="italics">Southern soldiers</hi>. As they strode to and fro with martial air, fully armed and equipped to answer roll-call, or bent over the camp-fires preparing breakfast, it seemed to me that no such splendid soldiers were ever before seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>Several invitations to breakfast were received; that of the officers' mess, having been <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, was accepted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/><rs type="role2">Major</rs>&mdash;&mdash;came in person to escort his guests to a lovely spot near the cabin, where, under a large shady oak, upon a table of rough boards covered with a nice white cloth, a delicious meal was set, consisting of broiled chickens, omelet, fragrant coffee, buttermilk, corn bread, and <rs n="batter cakes" type="product">batter-cakes</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>A likely young negro boy attended at table, industriously flourishing a green branch to keep away the flies, and seemingly delighted to show off his company manners.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>After breakfast I sat long upon the little gallery of the log cabin entertaining soldier visitors and enjoying the situation with all my heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>I soon discovered, however, an air of sadness and restraint which was unaccountable until my husband told me of the death of the gallant <rs>Dreux</rs>, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> martyr of the war. Ah!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>then I <hi rend="italics">knew</hi>. Struggle as they might, their brave hearts were wrung with anguish, for their gallant leader had succumbed to the only conqueror he ever knew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>The impassioned oratory that had never failed to fire the hearts of men was hushed forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>The ardent patriotism ever prompting to deeds of daring was now only a <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>The brilliant intellect and administrative ability so early recognized, so highly valued, were lost to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>I no longer wondered that manly brows were clouded, or that the eyes of soldiers moistened, as, even amidst pleasant conversation, a sudden remembrance of their loss overcame them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>For them the memory of that death-scene was fresh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>The echo of his last brave words had not yet died away: <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">Steady, boys</hi>, steady,</q> as if he would have said, <q direct="unspecified">Let not my fate appall; <hi rend="italics">still</hi> do your duty.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/></p> 
<p>Before the sun was high the ambulance reappeared to convey our party as far as <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, where young Little was to remain until he could hear from his father; I and my boy were to go on to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>My husband was granted a furlough of <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> that he might escort his family as far as <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>As may be imagined, the ride was most delightful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>Although often oppressed by thoughts of the parting hour so rapidly approaching, we were at times charmed into forgetfulness, and keen enjoyment of the beautiful scenery and the incidents of the journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>I now, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, began to use from my little store of <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>, and it proved the <q direct="unspecified">open sesame</q> to much enjoyment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Watermelons and other fruit, roasting ears, buttermilk, etc., were purchased without stint, also a chicken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>At <time value="12pm">noon</time> the little party camped in a grove by the roadside, where my soldier-husband proudly showed off his new attainments in the way of cooking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>The dinner was pronounced <q direct="unspecified">just splendid</q> by the appreciative guests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Our boy having gorged himself, fell asleep upon the grass; the negro driver was sent off to buy a few dainties to send back to friends in camp, and the <num value="2">two</num> so lately reunited&mdash;so soon to part&mdash;enjoyed for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time an uninterrupted talk relating to the adventures <pb id="p.23" n="23"/> that each had met with since our parting in New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>I unfolded my plans for the future, receiving the full permission and sympathy of my husband.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>Soon after the journey was resumed <num value="2">two</num> horsemen appeared on the road coming from the direction of <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>I was quite unprepared to recognize a <orgName n="Confederate Officer" type="org">Confederate officer</orgName> of high rank in either of the riders who now approached, as neither were very handsomely uniformed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The <num value="1">one</num> who most attracted my attention appeared of middle age, was rather stout, of florid complexion, and (as I thought) looked very cross.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>He wore a sort of fancy jacket or roundabout, profusely trimmed with gold lace.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/><q direct="unspecified">There is <persName n="Magruder,General,,,," id="n0242.0002.00023.00007" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Magruder</surname></persName>!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>exclaimed my husband, and, as the officers came near, saluted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>Bringing the ambulance to a halt with an imperious gesture, the general sharply questioned him as to his absence from camp, his name, command, destination, length of time he expected to be absent, etc. I was then introduced, and began to express my pleasure at the meeting, etc. The grim visage of the general did not relax.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>My pleasant talk was cut short by another question, this time, of importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>I then found myself subjected to a series of questions so searching that all I had seen or heard while passing through the enemy's lines was imparted to <persName n="Magruder,General,,,," id="n0242.0002.00023.00008" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Magruder</surname></persName> before I quite realized the situation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>What woman, denied the pleasure of talking, would not have felt and expressed, as did my discomfited self, great indignation in view of a deprivation so severe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>But upon being reminded of the heavy responsibility resting upon the mind and heart of the patriot who could not withdraw his attention from the great and all absorbing interests committed to his guidance long <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> enough to think of, much less to practise, the amenities of life, I felt ashamed of my hasty anger, and remembered only that I had been permitted to see and converse with the hero of the <rs n="Battle of Bethel" type="battle">battle of Bethel</rs>, the <orgName type="regiment" key="Confed1">first Confederate</orgName> victory of the war.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>A few hours of happiness was all that could be accorded to us. A battle seemed imminent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>My husband must return to his post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Arrived in front of the monument, we paused involuntarily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>The hum of conversation, the sound of careless, happy <pb id="p.33" n="33"/> laughter, the music of a band playing outside, soon brought us down from the heights of enthusiasm to the delightful realities of the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>There, in deep converse, stood a group equally regardless of their surroundings, whose grave faces and earnest questions showed the importance of the subject under discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>She could not nurse the sick or wounded personally, for her whole time was necessarily devoted to executive duties, but her smile was the sweetest, I believe, that ever lit up a human face, and standing by <pb id="p.35" n="35"/> the bedside of some poor Alabamian, away from home, and wretched as well as sick, she must have seemed to him like an angel visitant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/><num value="1">One</num> lady generally had direction of the affairs of <num value="1">one</num> particular hospital, assisted by others whose duties lay just there, and who-devoted each in turn on successive days their entire care and attention <pb id="p.39" n="39"/> to this labor of love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>For instance, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> certain ladies sent in all the cooked food needed by the patients.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Others personally nursed the sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>Still others attended to the distribution of the food or superintended the servants, and so with all duties required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>On Tuesday another set of ladies were on duty, and so on.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>My whole heart and soul went out toward the sick soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>My days were mostly spent in visiting the hospitals.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the larger ones attracted me, because there seemed to be so many sufferers and more need of nurses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>My timid advances (never amounting to a direct application, but only a suggestion as to my qualifications as a nurse) were condescendingly smiled down by the surgeons in charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>My youthful appearance was against me. Besides, there really was no need for other nursing in many of the <rs>State</rs> hospitals, notably that of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, than the angelic ministrations of the <rs>Sisters</rs> of Charity, whose tireless vigils knew no end, whose skill and efficiency, as well as their constant devotion, environed the patients committed to their care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>Occasionally I was allowed the blessed privilege of fanning a sick hero or of moistening parched lips or bathing fevered brows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>But somebody always came whose <hi rend="italics">business</hi> it was to do these things, and I was set aside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/><num value="1">One</num> day, however, by a happy chance, I found in a ward of <num value="1">one</num> of the hospitals a poor fellow who seemed to have been left to die.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>He had, like many other soldiers, been unwilling to go to a hospital, and remaining in camp while broken out with measles, tool cold and provoked an attack of pneumonia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>In addition to this, terrible abscesses had formed under each ear, and his eyes were swollen and suppurating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>His <pb id="p.40" n="40"/> surgeon said there was little hope of his recovery; none at all unless he could be removed to some more quiet place, and receive unremitting care and watchfulness as well as excellent nursing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/><q direct="unspecified">Can he be removed if I promise to fulfil all these conditions?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>said I. <q direct="unspecified">It is a risk, but his only chance,</q> replied Dr.&mdash;&mdash; <q direct="unspecified">Then I will go at once and prepare a place.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>As I spoke, the suffering boy grasped my hand with all his feeble strength, as if afraid to let me leave him. Reassuring him as well as I could, I rushed off to the <q direct="unspecified">Soldiers' Rest,</q> where I knew I should find friends ready and willing to help me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/><num value="1">One</num> vacant cot temptingly clean and white was moved into a secluded corner and assigned to me for the use of my <q direct="unspecified">sick boy.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>The loan of an ambulance, readily obtained, facilitated his removal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>That same evening I had the satisfaction of seeing him laid carefully upon the comfortable bed so kindly prepared by the ladies of the <name>Soldiers</name>' Rest, exhausted, but evidently not worse for the change.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>Right here began my career as a nurse of Confederate soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>This was my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> patient,&mdash;<hi rend="italics">my very own</hi>,&mdash;to have and to hold until the issues of life and death should be decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>I may as well state that I came off with flying colors, earning the precious privilege, so ardently desired, of being, enrolled among those ready for duty and <hi rend="italics">to be trusted</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/></p> 
<p>Finding that my desultory wanderings among the larger hospitals were likely to result in little real usefulness, and that the ladies attached to the <name>Soldiers</name>' Rest would be glad of my help, I became a regular attendant there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>This delightful place of refuge for the sick and wounded was situated high up on <address><street n="Clay Street">Clay Street</street></address>, not very far from <num value="1">one</num> of the camps and parade-grounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>A rough little school-house, it had been transformed into a bower of beauty and comfort by loving hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>The walls, freshly whitewashed, were adorned with attractive pictures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>The windows were draped with snowy curtains tastefully looped back to admit the summer breeze or carefully drawn to shade the patient, as circumstances required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>The beds were miracles of whiteness, and clean linen sheets, in almost every case, draped and covered them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>Softest pillows in slips of odorous linen supported the restless heads of the sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>By the side of each cot stood a small table (<num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> old-fashioned stands of solid mahogany among them). Upon these were spread fine napkins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>Fruit, drinks, etc., were set upon them, not in coarse, common crockery, but in delicate china and glass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/><hi rend="italics">Nothing was too good for the soldiers</hi>. The school-house contained <num value="3">three</num> rooms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/><num value="1">One</num> of the recitation-rooms was set apart for patients who might need special attention or seclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>The other was occupied by the ladies whose duty it was to receive and distribute the delicate and nutritious supplies of food which unfailingly arrived at stated hours, borne by aristocratic-looking colored servants, on silver waiters or in baskets covered with snowy <pb id="p.42" n="42"/> damask.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>During every hour of the day, gentle women ministered untiringly to the sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>They woke from fevered dreams to behold kindly faces bending above them, to feel the touch of soft hands, to receive the cooling draught or welcome food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>Every evening brought carriage-loads of matrons and young girls laden with flowers or fruit, bringing books, and, better than all, smiles and pleasant words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>The sick soldiers were objects of interest to all. All hearts yearned over them, all hands were ready to serve them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>As night came on, the ladies who had served during the day were replaced by others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>No <num value="1">one</num> ever failed to meet her self-imposed duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>A few steps below, between <address><street n="9 Street">Ninth</street></address> and <address><street n="10 Street">Tenth Streets</street></address>, was another private hospital, similar in almost every respect to the <num value="1">one</num> just described, organized and presided over by <persName n="Mayo,Mrs.,Caroline,,," id="n0242.0003.00042.00043" reg="default:Mayo,Caroline,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>Caroline</foreName> <surname>Mayo</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>She also was assisted by several ladies, but had entire direction, and threw herself into the work with all her soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>Her patriotism was boundless, her courage and endurance unfailing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>Not only at that time, but for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, every hour of her time, every thought of her heart, was given to the sick and wounded Confederates.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>Sometimes, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>the care and nursing lavished upon the sick was unavailing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>Death often invaded the <q direct="unspecified">Rest.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>In every case the rites of burial were accorded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>Women remembered tenderly the far-distant mother or wife, and therefore honored their dead.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>Arrived here, a pitiful sight met our eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>Meantime immense boxes arrived from the depot, sent by the people of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>These contained pillows, comforts, sheets, as well as wines, cordials, and every delicacy for the sick, also quantities of shirts, drawers, and socks, old and new.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>There was no lack of food, bath substantial and of a kind proper for the very sick.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>I do not believe that a squad of sick soldiers arrived in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, at least during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year of the war, who were not discovered and bountifully fed shortly after their arrival.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>Hospital supplies having been ordered as soon as it was known the sick men were expected, all necessaries were soon at hand, while the boxes referred to supplied many luxuries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>The large room into which all these were huddled presented for days a scene of <q direct="unspecified">confusion worse confounded.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>Carpenters were set at work; but of course shelves, etc., could not be magically produced, so we placed boards across barrels, arranging in piles the contents of the boxes for ready use. <pb id="p.45" n="45"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>A female servant was specially assigned to me, who slept on a mattress on the floor of the sitting-room, and whose duty it was to accompany me through the wards and render any special or personal service required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>A long hall ran along this wing, connecting the offices with the main building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>The long, broad room opening out of this hall was fitted up as a ward specially mine, for the reception of my own friends and very ill patients who needed my special attention day and night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>This favor was granted me because I had shown some unwillingness to place myself in any position where I could not nurse any <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> soldier friends or others who might desire or be permitted to come to me. As soon as matters were somewhat settled, my little son joined me in my new quarters, and thus the <orgName type="regiment" key="AL3">Third Alabama</orgName> Hospital became our home for many a month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>Having the care and responsibility of so many sick, my time was fully occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/><num value="1">One</num> day there appeared in the <rs>Selma</rs> paper a letter from <persName n="McAllister,Surgeon,W.,T.,," id="n0242.0003.00058.00067" reg="default:McAllister,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="Surgeon">Surgeon</roleName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>McAllister</surname></persName>, <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Army of Tennessee</orgName>, describing the dreadful condition of hundreds of sick and wounded men, who, after the terrible <rs n="Battle of Shiloh" type="battle">battle of Shiloh</rs> and the subsequent evacuation of <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>, had been huddled into hospital-quarters at <placeName reg="Gainesville, Sumter, Alabama" key="tgn,2003626">Gainesville, Alabama</placeName>, and inquiring for a <q direct="unspecified">lady</q> to assist him in organizing, and in caring for the sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>Here was a chance for me.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>Had I yielded to the almost irresistible impulse which tempted me to fly from the painful scenes and fearful discouragements which met me at <placeName reg="Gainesville, Sumter, Alabama" key="tgn,2003626">Gainesville, Alabama</placeName>, these <q direct="unspecified">Memories</q> would have remained unwritten.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>I had stipulated that while I would not receive compensation for nursing sick Confederates, and was quite willing to live on the government rations, I must always be provided with a sleeping-room in some respectable private family, apart from the hospital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>This was promised; and this arrangement continued as long as I remained at the <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Buckner,,,,," id="n0242.0003.00059.00068" reg="mostcommon:Buckner,nomatch:0"><surname>Buckner</surname></persName>.</q>

<p><persName n="McAllister,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00059.00069" reg="nearbymention:McAllister,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>McAllister</surname></persName>, surgeon in charge, being unavoidably absent, I was met at the depot by <persName n="Minor,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00059.00070" reg="mostcommon:Minor,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Minor</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" n="assistant-Surgeon">assistant surgeon</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>His look of surprise, almost consternation, when I appeared gave me an uneasy sensation; but, assuming an extra amount of dignity, I calmly accompanied him to a most comfortable-looking house, where my room had been engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>The hostess was unmistakably a lady.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>I met with a pleasant reception, and was soon seated at supper with several officers and their wives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>During the meal I had an uneasy consciousness that curious glances were bent upon me from all sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>The evening, however, was spent agreeably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>After I had gone to my room, a kind old lady came to me to beg that I would reconsider my determination to accept the position of matron, but, finding me firm and somewhat dignified, left me to my fate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>The next morning, escorted by <persName n="Minor,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00059.00071" reg="mostcommon:Minor,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Minor</surname></persName>, I went through the hospital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/><pb id="p.60" n="60"/></p> 
<p>For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time my heart utterly misgave me, and I felt that my courage was inadequate to the task before me. I must premise that this was not a <hi rend="italics">State</hi> hospital, but under the direction of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, which, at that time, was full of perplexity and trouble, yet, like all new governments, exceedingly tenacious of forms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/><persName n="Minor,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00060.00072" reg="mostcommon:Minor,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Minor</surname></persName> told me that the time and attention of <persName n="McAllister,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00060.00073" reg="nearbymention:McAllister,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>McAllister</surname></persName> had been fully occupied in untying, <num value="1">one</num> after another, <hi rend="italics">knots of red tape</hi>, and that, so far, perfect organization had been impossible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>I entered the wards expecting to find something of the neatness and order which in the <rs type="place">Richmond hospitals</rs> had charmed every visitor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>Alas! Alas! were <hi rend="italics">these</hi> the brave men who had made forever glorious the name of <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName>?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>Hospital supplies were scarce; beds and bedding could not be often changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>Here were rooms crowded with uncomfortable-looking beds, on which lay men whose gangrened wounds gave forth foul odors, which, mingled with the terrible effluvia from the mouths of patients ill of scurvy, sent a shuddering sickness through my frame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>In <num value="1">one</num> room were <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> patients with faces discolored and swollen out of all semblance of humanity by erysipelas,&mdash;raging with fever, shouting in delirious agony.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>The hospital had formerly been a large hotel, and was divided into many rooms, all crowded with sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>The wounded men who were not gangrened were carefully kept apart from those who were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>Some of these were frightfully disfigured in the face or head, and presented a ghastly appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>In rooms filled with fever-patients old men and mere boys lay helpless, struggling with various forms and stages of disease, hoarsely raving, babbling sweetly of home, vainly calling remembered names, or lying in the fatal stupor which precedes death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/><pb id="p.61" n="61"/></p> 
<p>Although many convalescents paced gloomily up and down the halls, or lounged upon the spacious galleries, I noticed few male nurses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>Perhaps half a dozen women met us at the doors of different wards, jauntily dressed, airily <q direct="unspecified">showing off</q> their patients, and discoursing of their condition and probable chances of life, in a manner utterly revolting to me. I caught many a glance of disgust bent upon them by the poor fellows who were thus treated as if they were stocks or stones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>These women were, while under the eye of the surgeon, obsequious and eager to please, but I thought I saw the <q direct="unspecified">lurking devil in their eyes,</q> and felt sure they meant mischief.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/><persName n="McAllister,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00061.00074" reg="nearbymention:McAllister,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>McAllister</surname></persName> arrived that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>The next morning I was regularly installed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>But I could not help feeling that there was a reservation of power and authority, a doubt of my capacity, due to my youthful appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>Very helpless and friendless I felt, as, escorted by the <q direct="unspecified">surgeon in charge,</q> I once more made the rounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>He left me at the door of <num value="1">one</num> of the fever-wards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>This I entered, and stood for a moment looking upon the scene of suffering humanity, wondering how and where to begin the work of alleviation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>Suddenly a faint voice called <q direct="unspecified"><persName><foreName>Milly</foreName></persName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/><hi rend="italics">Oh</hi>, <persName><foreName>Milly</foreName></persName>!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>I turned to meet a pair of blue eyes regarding me with a look of pleased recognition, although it was at once evident that I had been mistaken for some <q direct="unspecified">loved <num value="1">one</num> at home</q> through the delirium of fever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>Humoring the fancy, I stepped to his bedside and gave my hand to the hot clasp of the poor fellow, a man of middle age, whose eyes, fever-bright, still devoured my face with a happy look.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/><q direct="unspecified">Howdy, <persName><foreName>Milly</foreName></persName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>I've been looking for you every day. I'm mighty glad you've come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>The roar of the guns has hurt my head <hi rend="italics">powerful</hi>. Get some water from the far spring and bathe my head, <persName><foreName>Milly</foreName></persName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/><pb id="p.62" n="62"/></p> 
<p>It so happened that <num value="1">one</num> of his own company, of some <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> regiment, a convalescent, had by his own request been detailed to nurse the sick man. He soon brought me water, and I bathed the hot head, face, and hands, until the patient fell asleep.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>This little incident encouraged me greatly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>Passing on among the sick, I found no lack of work, but sadly missed the facilities, comforts, and luxuries which in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> had been always at my command.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>Lest it seem strange that such a state of things should have existed, I will here ask the reader to remember that military movements of tremendous importance were then taking place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>An immense army was executing, <q direct="unspecified">with admirable skill and precision,</q> a change of base.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>Upon this army depended the destinies of a large portion of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>Means of transportation for the troops and their military supplies, including, as an important precautionary measure, medical stores, became an imperative necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>The wounded and sick had also been moved, and at least placed under shelter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>Surgeons, however, were unable to obtain either suitable diet or needed medicines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>Requisitions failed to be promptly filled, and hence the state of things I have tried to describe.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/><persName n="McAllister,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00062.00075" reg="nearbymention:McAllister,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>McAllister</surname></persName> was absent most of the time in the interests of the unfortunates under his charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>Meantime, I struggled to perform my duties among the sick, and to exert authority, of which, as I soon discovered, I possessed but the semblance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>Nothing was left undone by the women before referred to to thwart and annoy me. They had evidently determined I should not remain there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>I had ample evidence that they were neglectful and unscrupulous in their dealings with the patients.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>In <num value="1">one</num> of the rooms, separated from the other patients, <pb id="p.63" n="63"/> I found a man who had been brought in several days before, suffering from excessive drinking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>Not being able to obtain whiskey, he had managed to get hold of a bottle of turpentine emulsion from a table in the hall, and had drank the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/><persName n="Minor,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00063.00076" reg="mostcommon:Minor,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Minor</surname></persName> and I worked for hours with this unfortunate and hoped he would recover, but other patients required looking after, and during my absence whiskey was smuggled in to him, of which he partook freely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>After that, nothing could save his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>A patient suffering agonies from gastritis was also placed under my special charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>I was to feed him myself, and avoid giving water, except in the smallest quantities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>I did my best, but he grew worse, and just in time I found under his pillow a canteen full of Water, which had been procured for him by the woman who attended in his ward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>If I called for a basin of water to wash the face and hands of neglected men, <num value="1">one</num> of these women would laugh insultingly and say, <q direct="unspecified">Perhaps ye'll wait till I get a nagur to bring it to you, or a silver waiter.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>They would insist that the surgeon had ordered them to do this or that, and stop to argue against my directions, until I was fain to save the sick further noise and clamor by leaving the ward.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>Not wishing to begin my work by complaining, or reporting to the surgeons these daily-recurring annoyances, I struggled to hold my own and to break down opposition by patient endurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>But <num value="1">one</num> morning the <q direct="unspecified">last straw</q> was added to my burden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>I found my <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> soldier apparently dying,&mdash;breathing heavily, and as cold as death already.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>His comrade was in great distress, but ready to do all in his power, and together we went to work in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>I sent for brandy and a box of mustard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>Pouring through the white lips spoonful after spoonful of the stimulant, rubbing hands, arms, and legs with mustard, applying plasters of the <pb id="p.64" n="64"/> same, as well as bottles of water, to restore warmth to the body, I soon had the satisfaction of seeing a faint color tinge the cheeks and lips,&mdash;the clammy sweat superseded by returning warmth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>Working earnestly, thinking of nothing but the human life that hung in the balance, I failed to observe the presence of the most disagreeable of the female nurses, who was standing, with <q direct="unspecified">arms akimbo,</q> looking on, until, with an insulting leer, she remarked, <q direct="unspecified">It seems to me ye're taking great liberties <hi rend="italics">for an honest woman</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>Paralyzed with surprise and indignation, I knew not how to act. Just then the surgeon in charge of the ward, who had been summoned, appeared.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>After a hasty examination, <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role2">Madam</rs>,</q> said he, <q direct="unspecified">you have saved your patient.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/></p> 
<p>Leaving the case in his hands, I fled to my room, resolving never to enter the hospital again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>Forthwith I wrote my resignation, and demanded transportation back to <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>Meantime, the comrade of the sick man had reported to the surgeon the whole matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>The next morning I received a visit from <persName n="McAllister,Surgeon,,,," id="n0242.0003.00064.00077" reg="nearbymention:McAllister,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="Surgeon">Surgeons</roleName> <surname>McAllister</surname></persName>, <persName n="Minor,Surgeon,,,," id="n0242.0003.00064.00078" reg="mostcommon:Minor,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Surgeon"></roleName><surname>Minor</surname></persName>, and &mdash;&mdash;(whose name I am sorry to have forgotten), of the ward I had fled from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>A letter had been received from <persName n="Little,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00064.00079" reg="mostcommon:Little,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Little</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, whose name I had given as reference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>The ill behavior of the nurses having come to the knowledge of the surgeon in charge, he at once acted with his usual promptness and decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>The obnoxious women had already been discharged and furnished with transportation to <placeName key="tgn,7017444" n="1.000 4" reg="mobile, mobile, alabama">Mobile</placeName>; the men who had aided and abetted them were ordered to their regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>I was urged to remain, on my own terms, and offered a position of trust, responsibility, and honor,&mdash;my authority to be <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> only to that of surgeon in charge in general matters; in the wards, to that of the ward <pb id="p.65" n="65"/> surgeons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>Under these circumstances I could not refuse to withdraw my resignation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>The next day the work of reorganization commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>Then and there I was invested with full power and authority, and received from <persName n="McAllister,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00065.00080" reg="nearbymention:McAllister,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>McAllister</surname></persName> assurances of entire confidence and thorough co-operation, which were accorded in the highest degree during the whole term of my service in the <rs type="place">Buckner Hospital</rs>, and the prestige of which gave me great advantages in other fields of labor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>Aside from profoundest love of <q direct="unspecified">the <name>Cause</name>,</q> and (as I firmly believed) the <hi rend="italics">inspiration</hi> which directed my efforts to serve it, I had nothing to offer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/><q direct="unspecified">With all my soul, with all my heart, with all my strength,</q> I was ready to serve; but this would have availed little had not my <hi rend="italics">right</hi> to do so been officially acknowledged, had I not acquired <hi rend="italics">power</hi> to follow out the dictates of reason and heart for the benefit of my patients.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>As the organization begun at <placeName key="tgn,2003626" n="1.000 9" reg="gainesville, sumter, alabama">Gainesville</placeName>, and the rules and regulations then adopted, were fully perfected soon after we reached the next <q direct="unspecified">post,</q> and remained in full force as long as the <rs type="place">Buckner Hospital</rs> existed, it may be as well to briefly describe them here.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>Convalescents were turned over to the steward, and their meals were attended to by him and his assistants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>I had only to see that their mess-room was kept in order and that their rations were cooked to the best advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>For the sick I had my own kitchen, my own cooks and other servants, my own store-room, also liberty to send out foragers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>Every morning I sent to each surgeon a list of such diet as I could command for the sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>With this in hand he was able to decide upon the proper food for each patient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>Each bed was numbered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>The head-nurse kept a small book, into which he copied each day's diet-list.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>He was also expected <pb id="p.66" n="66"/> to have ready every morning a fresh piece of paper, upon which the surgeon wrote the numbers of the beds, and opposite, F. D., H. D., L. D., V. L. D., or S. D. (full diet, half diet, light diet, very light diet, and special diet). If special directions were needed, the surgeon brought the list to my business-room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>If not, it was left with the head-nurse, and when I made my own rounds it would be my guide in consulting the tastes of the patients themselves as to the kind of food they preferred and its preparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>Of all this I made notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>I made it a point to feed the very ill patients myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>Others were served from a distributing-room, where at regular meal-times I always presided, sitting at the end of a long table, having a pile of tin numbers before me corresponding to the numbers on the beds in the wards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>There was an under-steward whose business it was to supply the plates; also <num value="2">two</num> helpers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>The head-nurse from <rs n="Ward 1">Ward No. 1</rs> having come down with his subordinates would call out, <q direct="unspecified"><num value="1">No. 1</num>, full diet,</q> or as the case might be. As the plate was filled, I handed out the corresponding number, which was put upon the plate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>The plates having been placed upon large wooden trays; were carried off to the ward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>Then came <num value="2">No. 2</num>, and so on, all the special patients having been attended to previously.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>Everything relating to the bedding, clothing, and the personal belongings of the sick and wounded I found in a fearful state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>In <num value="1">one</num> room down-stairs perhaps <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="300">three hundred</num> knapsacks, haversacks, canteens, etc., were thrown upon the floor in large piles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>No <num value="1">one</num> knew to whom they belonged, no <num value="1">one</num> seemed to care, and it appeared to me <hi rend="italics">impossible</hi> to bring any degree of order out of the chaotic mass of wet, half-dry, roughdry, in some cases mildewed clothing lying everywhere about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>Prompt measures were taken with the washerwoman, <pb id="p.67" n="67"/> which resulted, in a day or <num value="2">two</num>, in a procession of darkies, each bearing a pile of clothing embracing almost every article of men's apparel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>A <q direct="unspecified">linen master</q> having been detailed, a <q direct="unspecified">linen-room</q> set apart and shelved, the articles were placed upon large tables to be sorted and piled upon the shelves, ready for reclamation by the convalescents and others who were not too ill to identify their own. Some of these clothes were torn and buttonless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>My detailed men could not sew. The demands of the sick and the duties of general supervision left me no time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>Taught by my experience of the devoted women of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, I resolved to visit some of the ladies of <placeName key="tgn,2003626" n="1.000 9" reg="gainesville, sumter, alabama">Gainesville</placeName>, and to solicit their aid. The response was hearty and immediate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>Next day the linen-room was peopled by bright, energetic ladies, at whose hands the convalescents received their, renovated garments with words of warm sympathy and encouragement that cheered their hearts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>The lack of clean bedding being made known, these generous, patriotic women sent in soft, clean old sheets, pillow-slips, etc., also a few old shirts,&mdash;some of them even bearing with me the horrors of the scurvy and gangrene wards to assist in making the sufferers more comfortable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>Details for all purposes were made as soon as I asked for them, and as <q direct="unspecified">many hands make light work,</q> order and system began to pervade all departments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>A baggage-master, with several temporary assistants, found work for several days in disposing of the knapsacks, haversacks, blankets, etc. As fast as they were claimed, they were ticketed with the number of the ward and bed of the claimant, and piled away to await his return to his regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>Those unreclaimed and known to have belonged to the dead were labelled as far as possible with the name and date of death, company, and regiment, <pb id="p.68" n="68"/> and stored until friends should come or write for them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>The work of organization was not nearly complete, when <persName n="McAllister,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00068.00081" reg="nearbymention:McAllister,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>McAllister</surname></persName> received orders to report with his hospital staff at <placeName reg="Ringgold, Catoosa, Georgia" key="tgn,2024062">Ringgold, Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>The sick were to be removed elsewhere,&mdash;at any rate were not to accompany us. Hospital stores would be supplied at <placeName key="tgn,2024062" n="1.000 8" reg="ringgold, catoosa, georgia">Ringgold</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>The doctor and his attendants awaited transportation, which seemed difficult to obtain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>Many bodies of soldiers crowded every train,&mdash;passenger, freight, and even cattle cars.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>Fires were then kindled in both stoves to thoroughly warm the church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>There was, however, not a single bunk,&mdash;no time to make any; all the empty ticks when filled with straw and placed upon the floor fell far short of the number required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>For the rest straw was littered down as if for horses, and when the pillows gave out, head-rests were made by tearing off the backs of the pews and nailing them slantwise from the base-board to the floor, so that knapsacks, coats, etc., could be used for pillows.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>The order had reached <placeName key="tgn,2024062" n="1.000 8" reg="ringgold, catoosa, georgia">Ringgold</placeName> about noon; it was <num value="10">ten</num> at night before the rough preparations were completed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>Many were tortured with wounds which had at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> seemed slight, but by neglect and exposure had become sources of exquisite torture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>The gleaming eyes, matted hair and beard hanging about their cadaverous faces, gave to these men a wild, ghastly look utterly indescribable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>As they came in, many sunk exhausted upon the pallets, some falling at once into a <pb id="p.82" n="82"/> deep sleep, from which it was impossible to arouse them, others able only to assume a sitting posture on account of the racking, rattling cough which, when reclining, threatened to suffocate them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>Few would stop to be undressed: food and rest were all they craved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>Those who crowded to the stoves soon began to suffer from their frozen feet and hands, and even ran out into the snow to ease their pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>It seemed to me just as if these men, having previously kept up with heroic fortitude under trials almost too great for human endurance, had, as soon as the terrible tension was loosened, utterly succumbed, forgetting all but the horrible pain that racked them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>Fever running riot in the veins of some found expression in delirious shouts and cries, which added to the horror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>My courage almost failed me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>Together we labored through that long night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>Soon after daylight next morning, passing into the church porch, we stood for a few moments silently, hand in hand, for, although both hearts were too full for speech, our labor of love had drawn us very near together.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>Everywhere the snow lay white and glittering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>In the church-yard, upon some of the pews arranged for <pb id="p.83" n="83"/> the purpose, had been placed the lifeless bodies of the <num value="3">three</num> men who had died during the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>There they lay, stark and stiff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>Upon these cold, dead faces no mourners' tears would fall; no friends would bear with reverend tread these honored forms to their last resting-place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>Rough pine boxes would soon cover the faces once the light of some far-away home, careless hands would place them in their shallow graves, without a prayer, without a tear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>Only the loving hand of nature to plant flowers above them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>For months after entering the service I insisted upon attending every dead soldier to the grave and reading over him a part of the burial-service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>But it had now become impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>The dead were past help; the living <hi rend="italics">always</hi> needed succor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>The <q direct="unspecified">prayers for the sick, and those near unto death,</q> are to this day more familiar to me than any other portion of the <name>Prayer</name>-Book, and at no time can I hear unmoved the sacred old hymns so often sung beside dying beds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>Passing to my office along the path traversed last night by the incoming soldiers, I found the snow along the whole distance stained by their bare, bleeding feet, and the sight made my heart ache sorely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>I think I never in all my life felt so keen a sense of utter dependence upon a higher Power, or understood so thoroughly how <q direct="unspecified">vain is the help of man,</q> than when, in the seclusion of my own room, the events of the night passed in review before me. With a heart aching with supreme pity, ready to make any sacrifice for the noble martyrs who, for my sake as well as for that of all Southern women, had passed unshrinking through inexpressible suffering, never faltering until laid low by the hand of disease,&mdash;I could yet do nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>I could not save them <num value="1">one</num> moment of <pb id="p.84" n="84"/> agony, I could not stay the fleeting breath, nor might I intermit the unceasing care imperatively demanded by those whom timely ministrations might save, to give due honor to the dead.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>Only an hour or <num value="2">two</num> of rest (broken like the sleep of those of a household who retire from the side of beloved sufferers, leaving them to the care of others while they snatch a few moments of the repose which is needed to prepare them for fresh exertions) and I was once more on my way to the wards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>At the gate of the boardinghouse stood <num value="1">one</num> of the nurses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>Again, as often before, I was summoned to a bed of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>I had left him at <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time> the night before very ill, but sleeping under the influence of an opiate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>His agony was <hi rend="italics">now</hi> too terrible for <hi rend="italics">any</hi> alleviation; but he had sent for me; so I stood beside him, answering by every possible expressions of sympathy his imploring glances and the frantic clasp of his burning hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>Finding that my presence was a comfort, I sent for <persName n="McAllister,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00084.00130" reg="nearbymention:McAllister,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>McAllister</surname></persName>, and, requesting him to assign my duties to some <num value="1">one</num> else for a while, remained at my post, yielding to the restraining grasp which to the very last arrested every movement away from the side of the sufferer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>A companion of the sick man lay near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1055"/>A slight improvement showed itself at last, and of course his craving for food was insatiate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1056"/>As this was a special ward, the nurses had been forbidden to admit visitors without a permit, and no stranger was ever allowed to feed the patients except when some particularly nourishing and suitable food was brought, when I used to take a great delight in the mutual pleasure of patient and visitor, hardly knowing which was more happy, the giver or receiver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/>Our sick boy continually craved and talked about some <q direct="unspecified">apple <hi rend="italics">turnovers</hi>,</q> such as his mother used to make, but of course was denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1062"/>The boy had been a patient of his from his infancy, and in a piteous letter, which I afterwards read, his mother had implored the doctor to watch over him in case of sickness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1063"/>When, under the dead boy's pillow, was found a portion of the apple-pie, revealing the cause of his death, the doctor's anger knew no bounds, and he gave vent to the imprecation above mentioned.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1064"/>As the summer waned, our commissary stores began to fail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1065"/>Rations, always plain, became scant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1066"/>Our foragers met with little success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1067"/>But for the patriotic devotion of the families whose farms and plantations lay for miles around <placeName key="tgn,2024062" n="1.000 8" reg="ringgold, catoosa, georgia">Ringgold</placeName> (soon, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>to fall into the ruthless hands of the enemy), even our sickest men would have been deprived of suitable food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/>Stopping at every house and home, I told everywhere my tale of woe. There was scarcely <num value="1">one</num> where hearths were not lonely, hearts aching for dear ones long since gone forth to battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/>They had heard mischievous and false tales of the surgeons and attendants of hospitals, and really believed that the sick were starved and neglected, while the hospital staff feasted upon dainty food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1073"/>Occasionally, perhaps, they had listened to the complaint of some <q direct="unspecified">hospital rat,</q> who, at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rumor of an approaching battle, had experienced <q direct="unspecified">a powerful misery</q> in the place where a brave heart should have been, and, flying to the rear, doubled up with rheumatism and out-groaning all the victims of <hi rend="italics">real</hi> sickness or horrible wounds, had remained huddled up in bed until danger was over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1074"/>After having been deceived a few times by these cowards, I became expert at recognizing them, and paid them no attention whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1075"/>I really believe that in some cases it was a physical impossibility for men to face the guns on a battle-field, and I have known instances of soldiers who deliberately shot off their own fingers to escape a fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1076"/>These men were conscious of their own defects, and often, smarting under a knowledge that the blistering, purging, and nauseating process pursued in such cases by the surgeons was intended as a punishment, grew ugly and mischievous, seeking revenge by maligning those in authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/>I do not know what abuses may have existed in other hospitals of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; I can, however, say with entire truth that I never saw or heard of a more self-sacrificing set of men than the surgeons I met and served under during the war. With only <num value="2">two</num> exceptions, they were devoted to their patients, and as attentive as in private practice or as the immense number of sick allowed them to be. These exceptions <pb id="p.97" n="97"/> were both men who were unwilling to get up at night, and if called were fearfully cross.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1078"/>At <num value="1">one</num> time I had a fierce contest with a surgeon of this kind, and fought it out, coming off victorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1079"/>I was called up <num value="1">one</num> night to see a patient who had required and received the closest attention, but who was, we hoped, improving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/>Finding him apparently dying, I sent at once for <rs type="role2">Doctor</rs>&mdash;&mdash;, meanwhile trying, with the help of the nurse, every means to bring back warmth to his body, administering stimulants, rubbing the extremities with mustard, and applying mustard-plasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/>The poor fellow was conscious, and evidently very much frightened; he had insisted upon sending for me and seemed to be satisfied that I would do everything in my power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1082"/><rs type="role2">Doctor</rs>&mdash;&mdash; came in, looking black as a thunder-cloud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/>My temper was up, and I rushed at once into battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/><q direct="unspecified">And I, sir, will take care that the whole post shall know of this.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>He went out and I remained with the soldier until he was better (he eventually recovered).

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>He reprimanded the surgeon instead of gratifying his desire to humble me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>But to return to my expedition: Fortunately, I was able to disprove the false tales which had prejudiced the country people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>Their sympathy being thoroughly aroused, they resolved to make up for lost time; and <pb id="p.98" n="98"/> after this ladies rode in town every day, arranging among themselves for different days, and bringing for the convalescents the fresh vegetables which were so valuable as a palliative, and preventive of scurvy; for the sick, chickens, eggs, fresh butter, buttermilk, and sweet milk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>Country wagons also brought in small supplies for sale, but never in proportion to the demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/>Many of the ladies, after <num value="1">one</num> visit to a ward or <num value="2">two</num>, were utterly overcome by the ghastly sight, and wept even at the <hi rend="italics">thought</hi> of looking upon the misery they could not relieve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>Others seemed to feel only deepest pity and a desire to <q direct="unspecified">do <hi rend="italics">something</hi> for the poor soldiers.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>As there were so many, it was difficult to distribute impartially: some must be left out. The ladies, finding so many craving buttermilk, sweet milk, home-made bread, etc., did not well know how to manage; but the soldiers themselves soon settled that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/><q direct="unspecified">I ain't so <hi rend="italics">very</hi> bad off,</q> <num value="1">one</num> would say, <q direct="unspecified">but that little fellow over yonder needs it <hi rend="italics">bad;</hi> he's <hi rend="italics">powerful weak</hi>, and he's been studying about buttermilk ever since he came in.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1205"/>The <hi rend="italics">upsetness</hi> was so complete that it almost seemed to me an actual fulfilment of a mysterious prophecy or warning often uttered by old negroes to terrorize children into good behavior: <q direct="unspecified">Better mind out dar: fust thing <hi rend="italics">you</hi> knows you ain't gwine ter know nuffina.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1206"/>Everything seemed to be going on at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1207"/>The ambulance-train, with a few baggage-cars attached, was even then at the depot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1208"/>A hoarse, stifled whistle apprised us of the fact, and seemed to hurry our preparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1209"/><persName n="McAllister,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00109.00214" reg="mostcommon:McAllister,W.,T.,,:2"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>McAllister</surname></persName> was <hi rend="italics">everywhere</hi>, superintending the removal with the energy natural to him. In the court-house all was confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1210"/>Boxes were hastily filled with bedding, clothing, etc., thrown in helter-skelter, hastily nailed up, and as hastily carted down to the train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1211"/>Sick and awfully wounded men were hurriedly placed upon stretchers, and their bearers formed an endless procession to the rough cars (some of them lately used to transport cattle, and dreadfully filthy). Here they were placed upon straw mattresses, or plain straw, as it happened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1212"/>No provisions were to be had except sides of rusty bacon and cold corn-bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1213"/>These were shovelled into carts and transferred to the floor of the cars in the same manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1214"/>There was no time to cook anything, and the chances were whether we would get off at all or not. Procuring a large caldron, I dumped into it remnants of the day's dinner,&mdash;a little soup, a few vegetables, and some mule meat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1215"/>The stoves had all been taken down, but there was a little cold cornmeal coffee, some tea, and a small quantity of milk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1216"/>This I put into buckets; then, <pb id="p.110" n="110"/> importuning the surgeon in charge until he was glad to get rid of me by assigning me a cart, I mounted into it with my provisions and jolted off to the cars, where hundreds of tortured, groaning men were lying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1217"/>There I met <persName n="Gore,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00110.00215" reg="mostcommon:Gore,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Gore</surname></persName> (for both hospitals were to be moved on the same train), who helped me to hide my treasures and to administer some weak milk punch to the sufferers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1218"/>Meanwhile, the pine-wood fires kindled in the streets all around the hospitals made the town look as though it was on fire, and threw its weird light upon masses of soldiery,&mdash;cavalry, infantry, artillery,&mdash;moving in endless numbers through the town, shaking the very earth with the tramp of men and horses and the heavy rumble of wheels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1219"/>The men were silent, and looked jaded and ghastly in the lurid light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1220"/>Some had bloody rags tied about head and hands, their breasts were bare, the panting breath could be heard plainly, their eyes shone fiercely through the grime of powder and smoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1221"/>They had been fighting, and were now retreating; still they marched in solid column, nor broke ranks, nor lost step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1222"/>The faces of the officers were grave and troubled; none seemed to observe our frantic haste, but all to look forward with unseeing eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1223"/>I did so long to have them rest and refresh themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1224"/>During the whole of that eventful night my checks were wet, my heart aching sadly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1225"/>Before daylight we were off. Railroads at that time were very defective and very rough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1226"/>Ah, how terrible was the suffering of those wounded men as they were jolted and shaken from side to side!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1227"/>for haste was necessary to escape the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1228"/>About noon the train came to a full stop, nor moved again for many, many hours,&mdash;hours fraught with intense suffering to the sick and wounded, as well as to all who shared the hardships of that journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1229"/>It was reported that the enemy were passing either to the right or left, I do not <pb id="p.111" n="111"/> remember which.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1230"/>Not a wheel must move, not a column of smoke arise; so, with the engine fires extinguished, the train stood motionless in the midst of a barren pine forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1231"/>The small supply of cooked food was soon exhausted, the ladies on the train assisting to feed the wounded soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1232"/>All were parched with thirst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1233"/>The only water to be procured lay in ruts and ditches by the roadside, and was filthy and fetid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1234"/>So the day passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1235"/>All through the night every <num value="1">one</num> was on the alert, listening intently for sounds that might mean danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1236"/>No lights, no roadside fires could be allowed; but the moon shone brightly, and by its light the surgeons moved about among the suffering men, whose groans, united with the plaintive sigh of the chill wind through the pine forest, served to make night dismal indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1237"/>In the intervals of attending upon the sick we slept as we could, leaning up against boxes, tilted back in chairs against the side of the car, or lying down, with anything we could get for pillows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1238"/>Some of the surgeons and attendants bivouacked under the trees in spite of the cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1239"/>In the morning we were hungry enough to eat the stale corn-bread, and tried to like it, but even of that there was very little, for the wounded men were ravenous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1242"/>Ah, how delicious was the odor, how excellent the taste!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1243"/>Several hands were set at this work, but it was necessarily very slow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1244"/>I remained among my own patients, while my servant climbed in and out of the car, bringing as much meat as she could get, which I distributed while she returned for more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1352"/>Meantime, the wounded of several battles had filled and crowded the wards.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1356"/>Occasionally a scream of agony would arise, but more frequently suppressed groans bespoke strong men's suffering manfully borne.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1357"/>In the ward where those badly wounded were placed, there was so much to be done, that morning found the work unfinished.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1358"/>It was, therefore, later than usual when I found time to pay my usual morning visits to other wards.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1359"/>Upon entering <rs n="Ward 4">Ward No. 4</rs>, my attention was attracted by a new patient, who lay propped up on <num value="1">one</num> of the bunks near a window.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1360"/>He was a mere lad (perhaps <num value="20">twenty</num>).

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1361"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> I did not approach him, but his eyes followed me as I paused by each bed to ascertain the needs of the sick and to bestow particular care in many cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1362"/><pb id="p.123" n="123"/> At last I stood by his side, and, placing my hand upon his head, spoke to him. He moved uneasily, seemingly trying to repress the quivering of his lip and the tears that, nevertheless, would come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1363"/>Not wishing to notice his emotion just then, I called the nurse, and, by way of diversion, gave a few trifling directions, then passed on to another ward.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1364"/>Returning later, bringing some cooling drink and a bottle of Confederate bay-water (vinegar), I gave him to drink and proceeded to sponge off his head and hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1365"/>He submitted, as it seemed at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, unwillingly, but just as I turned to leave him he suddenly seized my hand, kissed it, and laid his burning cheek upon it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1366"/>When he began to mend and was allowed to talk freely, I learned his name, <persName n="Percy,,Charley,,," id="n0242.0003.00123.00263" reg="default:Percy,Charley,,,"><foreName>Charley</foreName> <surname>Percy</surname></persName>, that he was a native of <placeName reg="Bayou Sara, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,2644427">Bayou Sara, Louisiana</placeName>, and a member of the <orgName type="regiment" key="5Company">fifth company</orgName> of <orgName n="Washington Artillery" type="artillery">Washington Artillery</orgName>, <persName n="Slocomb,Captain,,,," id="n0242.0003.00123.00264" reg="mostcommon:Slocomb,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Slocomb</surname></persName> commanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1368"/>I grew to love him dearly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1369"/>As soon as he was permitted to leave his bed he became averse to remaining in the ward, and most of his waking hours were spent in the little room which was specially allotted to me.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1370"/>He became to me like a dear young brother, devoted and ever-thoughtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1371"/>The matron's room at the hospital was called very often <q direct="unspecified">Soldiers' Rest,</q> and sometimes <q direct="unspecified">The Promised Land,</q> because many soldiers came there every day, and those newly convalescent made it a goal which they aspired to reach as soon as permitted.

<p>This habit gave me an opportunity to use properly what might have been sent in boxes which arrived frequently from different quarters, filled with a variety of goodies, but in quantities entirely insufficient to supply all the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1373"/>A sangaree or any other delicacy, taken while resting after a walk which taxed the weakened energies to the utmost, or a meal served outside the fevered air of the wards, did more to build up the strength than any amount of medicine could have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/>His own great embarrassment seemed to be that he had lost all his clothes at the time he was wounded, so was compelled to wear the unbleached shirts with blue cottonade collars and cuffs, which were supplied to all patients, numbered to correspond with the bunks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1426"/>As the shaking, rickety cars passed out of sight, these raw troops walked up to the hotel and there strode up and down, assuming supreme indifference to the storm of raillery which assailed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1444"/>The mule went on to camp, creating great alarm there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1445"/>The child in some miraculous manner rolled out at the back of the ambulance, and was picked up unhurt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1456"/>He always carried an extra haversack, which contained everything that could be thought of to meet contingencies or repair the neglect of other people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1457"/>He was a devoted patriot and a contented, uncomplaining soldier; never sick, always on duty, a thorough gentleman, kindly in impulses and acts, but&mdash;&mdash;well, yes, there was <num value="1">one</num> spot upon this sun,&mdash;he was a confirmed bachelor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1459"/>Upon the day in question, however, I was not only an invited guest, but the wife of his messmate and friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1460"/>So, overcoming his diffidence, he made himself very agreeable, and meeting several times afterward during the war, under circumstances which made pleasant intercourse just as imperative, we became fast friends, and have remained so to this day. <persName n="Sharkey,,John,,," id="n0242.0003.00131.00287" reg="default:Sharkey,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Sharkey</surname></persName>, Miles <persName n="Sharkey,,,,," id="n0242.0003.00131.00288" reg="nearbymention:Sharkey,John,,,"><surname>Sharkey</surname></persName>, and <num value="1">one</num> more, whose name I have forgotten, comprised, with those mentioned above, the entire mess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1461"/>The dinner was excellent, better than many a more elegant and plentiful repast of which I have partaken since the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1463"/>From cross-sticks, arranged gypsy-fashion, swung an iron pot, in which was prepared the cornmeal coffee, which, with <q direct="unspecified">long <pb id="p.132" n="132"/> sweetening</q> (molasses) and without milk, composed the meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1464"/>In this well-arranged mess the work was so divided that each man had his day to cut all the wood, bring all the water, cook, wash dishes, and keep the cabin in order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1465"/>So, on this occasion there was no confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1466"/>All was accomplished with precision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1467"/>In due time a piece of board was placed before me with my rations arranged upon it in a bright tin plate, my coffee being served in a gorgeous mug, which, I strongly suspect, had been borrowed for the occasion, having once been a shaving-mug.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1469"/>Upon inquiry, I found the boys in camp contented and entirely unwilling to receive any benefit from the fund placed in my hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1470"/>They had taken the chances of a soldier's life, and were quite willing to abide by them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1471"/>The terrible bumping which I had experienced while riding to camp, in the ambulance drawn by the <q direct="unspecified">gaily mule,</q> disinclined me for another ride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1472"/>So, just at sunset, my husband and I, with our boy and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> friends, walked through the piny woods to the hotel, whence I returned next day to <placeName key="tgn,2023732" n="1.000 8" reg="newnan, coweta, georgia">Newnan</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1493"/>Although an exceptional soldier, he was a most troublesome patient, because his strong desire to return to his command made him restless and dissatisfied, greatly retarding his recovery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1494"/>Indeed, he would not remain in bed or in his ward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1495"/>A more splendid-looking officer I never saw. Better still, under his jacket of gray there beat a heart instinct with every virtue which belongs by nature to a Virginia gentleman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1496"/>With the ladies of the <q direct="unspecified">post</q> he became a prime favorite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1497"/>So kind and attentive were they that I gave myself little thought concerning him. He was off and away in a wonderfully short time, for duty lay <hi rend="italics">at the front</hi> and the strongest attractions could not outweigh its claims.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1499"/>He had been struck <pb id="p.135" n="135"/> full in the pit of the stomach by a spent ball, and was completely doubled up. He had been left on the field for dead, and for some time it was feared that fatal internal injuries had been received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1501"/>Speedy relief was quite impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1505"/>The officers' ward was delightfully situated on the corner of the main street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1506"/>Its many windows commanded a pleasant view of a beautiful shaded square in the midst of which stood the brick court-house (now filled with sick, and pertaining to the <rs type="place">Bragg Hospital</rs>).

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1507"/>Later these knights being permitted to join in the promenade, made the very most of their helplessness, enjoying hugely the necessary ministrations so simply and kindly given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1513"/>These had constantly to be removed, either by the use of nitric acid (I believe) or by the knife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1514"/>As may be imagined, it was horribly painful, <hi rend="italics">and there was no chloroform</hi>. Day after day I was sent for, and stood by, while this terrible thing was going on, wiping the sweat from the face that, though pale as death, never quivered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1517"/>Ah! no; in the wards outside, where lay hundreds of <hi rend="italics">private soldiers</hi>, without the pride of rank to sustain them, only their simple, noble manhood, I daily witnessed such scenes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1554"/>The following morning opened bright and lovely, bringing to the anxious watchers of the night before that sense of security which always comes with the light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1555"/>All business was resumed as usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1556"/>I had finished my early rounds, fed my special cases, and was just entering the distributing-room to send breakfast to the wards, when a volley of musketry, quickly followed by another and another, startled the morning air.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1563"/>Evidently they had expected to surprise the town, but, finding themselves opposed by a force whose numbers they were unable to estimate, they hastily retreated up the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1564"/>By that time a crowd of impetuous boys had armed themselves and were running down the hill on our side to join the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1572"/>The citizens simply stampeded, <q direct="unspecified">nor stood upon the order of their going.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1573"/>There was no time for deliberation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1575"/>Every carriage, wagon, and cart was loaded down with Human freight; every saddle-horse was in demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1576"/>All the negroes from the hospital as well as those belonging to the citizens were removed at once to a safe distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1577"/>These poor creatures were as much frightened as anybody and as glad to get away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1578"/>Droves of cattle and sheep were driven out on the run, lowing and bleating their indignant remonstrance.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1589"/>I did not for a moment pretend to withstand their entreaties that I would remain with them, having already decided to do so. Their helplessness appealed so strongly to my sympathies that I found it impossible to resist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1590"/>Besides, I had an idea and a hope that even in the event of the town being taken I might prevail with the enemy to ameliorate their condition as prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1591"/>So I promised, and quietly passed from ward to ward announcing my determination, trying to speak cheerfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1592"/>Excitement, so great that it produced outward calm, enabled <pb id="p.142" n="142"/> me to resist the angry remonstrances of the surgeon and the tearful entreaties of <persName n="McAllister,Mrs.,,,," id="n0242.0003.00142.00321" reg="mostcommon:McAllister,W.,T.,,:2"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>McAllister</surname></persName>, who was nearly beside herself with apprehension.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1597"/>Only a few men who, by reason of wounds too recently healed or from other causes, were unable to march or to fight had been left to act as nurses.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1598"/>I sat down upon the steps of my office to think it over and to gather strength for all I had to do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1599"/>Suddenly, from <num value="1">one</num> of the upper wards, I heard a hoarse cry, as if some <num value="1">one</num> had essayed to give the rebel yell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1600"/>Following it a confused murmur of voices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1601"/>Running hastily up-stairs, I met at the door of the ward a ghastly figure, clad all in white (the hospital shirt and drawers), but with a military cap on his head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1602"/>It was <num value="1">one</num> of my fever patients who had been lying at death's door for days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1603"/>The excitement of the morning having brought on an access of fever with delirium, he had arisen from his bed, put on his cap, and started, yelling, <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">to join the boys</hi>!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1604"/>Weak as I had supposed him to be, his strength almost over-mastered my own. I could hardly prevent him from going down the stairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1605"/>The only man in the ward able to assist me at all was minus an arm and just recovering after amputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1606"/>I was afraid his wound might possibly begin to bleed, besides, I knew that any <hi rend="italics">man's</hi> interference would excite the patient still more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1607"/>Relying upon the kindly, <pb id="p.143" n="143"/> chivalrous feeling which my presence always seemed to inspire in my patients, I promised to get his gun for him if he would go back and put on his clothes, and, placing my arm around the already tottering and swaying figure, by soothing and coaxing got him back to the bed. A sinking spell followed, from which he never rallied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1608"/>In a lower ward another death occurred, due also to sudden excitement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1609"/>Fearful of the effect that a knowledge of this would have upon other patients, I resorted to deception, declaring that the dead men were better and asleep, covering them, excluding light from windows near them, and even pretending at intervals to administer medicines.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1610"/>And now came another trial, from which I shrank fearfully, but which must be borne.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1611"/>In the <q direct="unspecified">wounded wards,</q> and in tents outside where men having gangrene were isolated, horrible sights awaited me,&mdash;sights which I trembled to look upon,&mdash; fearful wounds which had, so far, been attended to only by the surgeons.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1612"/>These wounds were now dry, and the men were groaning with pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1613"/>Minute directions having been left with me, I must nerve myself to uncover the dreadful places, wash them, and apply fresh cloths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1614"/>In the cases of gangrene, poultices of yeast and charcoal, or some other preparation left by the surgeons.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1615"/><rs n="Entering Ward 3">Entering Ward No. 3</rs>, where there were many badly-wounded men, I began my work upon a boy of perhaps <measure n="19years" type="date">nineteen years</measure>, belonging to a <orgName type="mil" key="NCRegiment">North Carolina regiment</orgName>, who had <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of his face shot away.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1616"/>My readers may imagine the dreadful character of the wounds in this ward, when I relate that a day or <num value="2">two</num> after a terrible battle at the front, when dozens of wounded were brought in, so badly were they mangled and so busy were the surgeons, that I was permitted to <pb id="p.144" n="144"/> dress this boy's face unaided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1617"/><hi rend="italics">Then</hi> it was bad enough, but neither so unsightly nor so painful as <hi rend="italics">now</hi> that inflammation had supervened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1618"/>The poor boy tried not to flinch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1619"/>His <num value="1">one</num> bright eye looked gratefully up at me. After I had finished, he wrote upon the paper which was always at his hand, <q direct="unspecified">You didn't hurt me like them doctors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1620"/>Don't let the <rs>Yankees</rs> get me, I want to have another chance at <hi rend="italics">them</hi> when I get well.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1621"/>Having succeeded so well, I <q direct="unspecified">took heart of grace,</q> and felt little trepidation afterward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1622"/>But&mdash;oh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1623"/>the horror of it. An <placeName key="tgn,7016172" n="1.000 4" reg="arkansas">Arkansas</placeName> soldier lay gasping out his life, a piece of shell having carried away a large portion of his breast, leaving the lungs exposed to view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1624"/>No hope, save to alleviate his pain by applying cloths wet with cold water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1625"/>Another, from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, had lost a part of his thigh, &mdash;and so on. The amputations were my greatest dread, lest I might displace bandages and set an artery bleeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1626"/>So I dared not remove the cloths, but used an instrument invented by <num value="1">one</num> of our surgeons, as may be imagined, of primitive construction, but which, wetting the tender wounds gradually by a sort of spray, gave great relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1627"/>Of course, fresh cloths were a constant necessity for suppurating wounds, but for those nearly healed, or simply inflamed, the spray was invaluable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1628"/>The tents were the last visited, and by the time I had finished the rounds, it was time to make some arrangements for the patients' supper, for wounded men are always hungry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1629"/>I remember gratefully to this day the comfort and moral support I received during this trying ordeal from a <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> soldier, who even then knew that his own hours were numbered, and was looking death in the face with a calm resignation and courage which was simply sublime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1630"/>He had been shot in the spine, and from the waist down was completely paralyzed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1631"/>After <pb id="p.145" n="145"/> he had been wounded, some <num value="1">one</num> unintentionally having laid him down too near a fire, his feet were burned in a shocking manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1632"/>He was <num value="1">one</num> of the handsomest men I ever saw, and, even in his present condition, of commanding presence and of unusual intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1633"/>I strive in vain to recall his name, but memory in this as in many other cases of patients to whom I was particularly attracted will present their faces only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1634"/>Calling me to his bedside he spoke kindly and cheerfully, praising my efforts, encouraging me to go on, drawing upon his store of general knowledge for expedients to meet the most trying cases.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1635"/>Everything that <persName n="McAllister,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00145.00322" reg="mostcommon:McAllister,W.,T.,,:2"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>McAllister</surname></persName> did was well and completely done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1636"/>He was kind-hearted, generous, ready to do or sacrifice anything for the real good of his patients; but his rules once laid down became immutable laws, not to be transgressed by any. His constant supervision and enforcement of rules affected every department of the hospital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1637"/>In my own, I had only to report a dereliction of duty, and the fate of the culprit <hi rend="italics">was</hi> sealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1638"/>If a woman, I had orders to discharge her; if a man, the next train bore him to his regiment or to the <orgName>office of the <rs type="role" reg="medical-Director">medical director</rs></orgName>, upon whose tender mercies no wrong-doer could rely.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1639"/>Consequently, I had only to go to my well-ordered kitchen to find ready the food which it had been my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> care to have prepared in view of the (as I hoped) temporary absence of the cooks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1640"/>The departing men had all taken marching rations with them, but there was still plenty of food on hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1641"/>A bakery was attached to the <rs>Buckner</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1642"/>We also owned several cows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1643"/>In the bakery was plenty of corn-bread and some loaves of flour-bread, although flour was even then becoming scarce.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1644"/>The cows, with full udders, stood lowing at the bars <pb id="p.146" n="146"/> of the pen. Among the doubts and fears that had assailed me, the idea that I might have trouble with these cows never occurred to my mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1645"/>During my childhood my mother had owned several.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1646"/>I had often seen them milked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1647"/><num value="1">One</num> had only to seize the teats firmly, pull quietly downward, and <num value="2">two</num> streams of rich milk would follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1648"/>Oh, yes!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1649"/>I could do that easily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1650"/>But when I arrived at the pen, a tin bucket in <num value="1">one</num> hand, a milking-stool in the other, and letting down the bars, crept inside, the cows eyed me with evident distrust and even shook their horns in a menacing manner which quite alarmed me. However, I marched up to the <num value="1">one</num> which appeared the mildest-looking, and sitting down by her side, seized <num value="2">two</num> of the teats, fully expecting to hear the musical sound of <num value="2">two</num> white streamlets as they fell upon the bottom of the tin bucket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1651"/><hi rend="italics">Not a drop could I get</hi>. My caressing words and gentle remonstrances had not the slightest effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1652"/>If it is possible for an animal to feel and show contempt, it was revealed in the gaze that cow cast upon me as she turned her head to observe my manoeuvres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1653"/>I had heard that some cows have a bad habit of holding back their milk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1654"/>Perhaps this was <num value="1">one</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1655"/>I would try another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1656"/>Removing the stool to the side of another meek-looking animal, I essayed to milk <hi rend="italics">her</hi>. But she switched her tail in my face, lifting a menacing, horrid hoof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1657"/><q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">Soh, bossy</hi>!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1658"/>cried I. <q direct="unspecified">Pretty, <hi rend="italics">pretty</hi> cow that makes pleasant milk to soak my bread.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/>In another moment I was seated flat upon the ground, while my pretty, pretty cow capered wildly among the rest, so agitating them that, thinking discretion the better part of valor, I hastily climbed over the fence at the point nearest to me and returned to the kitchen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>What should I do now?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/>Perhaps <num value="1">one</num> of the decrepit nurses left in the ward knew how to milk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1662"/>But no, <pb id="p.147" n="147"/> they did not, except <num value="1">one</num> poor, limping rheumatic who could only use <num value="1">one</num> hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1663"/>Just then a feeble-looking patient from the <rs type="place">Bragg Hospital</rs> came tottering along.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1664"/>He also knew how to milk, and they both volunteered to try. Much to my surprise and delight, the cows <hi rend="italics">now</hi> behaved beautifully, perhaps owing to the fact that, obeying the injunctions of my <num value="2">two</num> recruits, I provided each with a bundle of fodder to distract their attention during the milking process.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1665"/>There was more milk than I could possibly use, as nearly all the convalescents were absent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1666"/>So I set several pans of it away, little thinking how soon it would be needed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>By the time all had been fed, I felt very weary; but it was midnight before I found a minute's time to rest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>I had made frequent rounds through all the buildings of the hospital, each time finding some <num value="1">one</num> who had need of me. At last, wearied out by the excitement of the day, the sick grew quiet and inclined to sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1669"/>Released for a time, I sat down on the steps of my office to think and to listen: for I did not know anything of the whereabouts of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1670"/>The town might have been surrendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1671"/>At any moment the <rs>Federal</rs> soldiers might appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>Just then, however, the streets were utterly deserted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1673"/>The stillness was oppressive.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1674"/>If I could only discover a friendly light in <num value="1">one</num> of these deserted dwellings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/>Oh, for the sound of a kindly voice, the sight of a familiar face I</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1676"/>Doubtless there may have been some who had remained to protect their household gods, but they were women, and remained closely within doors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1677"/>Melancholy thoughts oppressed me. Through gathering tears I gazed at the pale moon, whose light seemed faded and wan. There came to me memories of the long-ago, when I had strayed among the orange-groves of my own dear home under a moonlight far more radiant, <pb id="p.148" n="148"/> happy in loved companionship, listening with delight to the voices of the night, which murmured only of love and joy and hope, inhaling the perfume of a <num value="1000">thousand</num> flowers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1678"/>To-night, as the south wind swept by in fitful gusts, it seemed to bear to my ears the sound of sorrow and mourning from homes and shrines where hope lay dead amid the ruined idols cast down and broken by that stern iconoclast&mdash;War.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1679"/>As I sat thus, buried in thought, a distant sound broke the silence, sending a thrill of terror to my heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1680"/>It was the tramp of many horses rapidly approaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1681"/><q direct="unspecified">Alas! Alas! the enemy had come upon us from the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1682"/>Our brave defenders were surrounded and their retreat cut off.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1683"/></p> 
<p>I knew not what to expect, but anxiety for my patients banished fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1684"/>Seizing a light-wood torch, I ran up the road, hoping to interview the officers at the head of the column and to intercede for my sick, perhaps to prevent intrusion into the wards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1685"/>To my almost wild delight, the torch-light revealed the dear old gray uniforms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1686"/>It was a portion of <orgName n="Cavalry"><persName n="Wheeler,,,,," id="n0242.0003.00148.00323" reg="mostcommon:Wheeler,nomatch:0"><surname>Wheeler</surname></persName>'s Cavalry</orgName> sent to reinforce <persName n="Roddy,,,,," id="n0242.0003.00148.00324" reg="mostcommon:Roddy,nomatch:0"><surname>Roddy</surname></persName>, whose meagre forces, aided by the volunteers from <placeName key="tgn,2023732" n="1.000 8" reg="newnan, coweta, georgia">Newnan</placeName>, had held the <rs>Federals</rs> in check until now, but were anxiously expecting this reinforcement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1687"/>The men had ridden far and fast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1688"/>They now came to a halt in front of the hospital, but had not time to dismount, hungry and thirsty though they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1689"/>The regimental servants, however, came in search of water with dozens of canteens hung around them, rattling in such a manner as to show that they were quite empty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1690"/>For the next half-hour, I believe, I had almost the strength of <persName n="Samson,,,,," id="n0242.0003.00148.00325" reg="mostcommon:Samson,nomatch:0"><surname>Samson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1691"/>Rushing to the bakery, I loaded baskets with bread and handed them up to the soldier-boys to be passed along until emptied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1692"/>I then poured all the milk I had into a large bucket, added a dipper, <pb id="p.149" n="149"/> and, threading in and out among the horses, ladled out dipperfuls until it was all gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1693"/>I then distributed about <num value="4">four</num> buckets of water in the same way. My excitement was so great that not a sensation of fear or of fatigue assailed me. Horses to the right of me, horses to the left of me, horses in front of me, snorted and pawed; but <name n="God" type="God">God</name> gave strength and courage: I was not afraid.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1694"/>A comparatively small number had been supplied, when a courier from <orgName n="command"><persName n="Roddy,,,,," id="n0242.0003.00149.00326" reg="mostcommon:Roddy,nomatch:0"><surname>Roddy</surname></persName>'s command</orgName> rode up to hasten the reinforcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1695"/>At once the whole column was put in motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1696"/>As the last rider disappeared, and the tramping of the horses died away in the distance, a sense of weariness and exhaustion so overpowered me that I could have slept where I stood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1697"/>So thorough was my confidence in the brave men who were sure to repel the invaders that all sense of danger passed away.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1698"/>My own sleeping-room was in a house situated at the foot of the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1699"/>I could have gone there and slept securely, but dared not leave my charges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1700"/>Sinking upon the rough lounge in my office, intending only to rest, I fell fast asleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1701"/>I was awakened by <num value="1">one</num> of the nurses, who had come to say that I was needed by a patient whom he believed to be dying, and who lay in a ward on the other side of the square.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1702"/>As we passed out into the street, another beautiful morning was dawning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1703"/>Upon entering <rs n="Ward 9">Ward No. 9</rs>, we found most of the patients asleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1704"/>But in <num value="1">one</num> corner, between <num value="2">two</num> windows which let in the fastincreas-ing light, lay an elderly man, calmly breathing his life away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1705"/>The morning breeze stirred the thin gray hair upon his hollow temples, rustling the leaves of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> which lay upon his pillow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1706"/>Stooping over him to feel the fluttering pulse, and to wipe the clammy sweat from brow and hands, I saw that he was indeed <pb id="p.150" n="150"/> dying, a victim of that dreadful scourge that decimated the ranks of the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> more surely than many battles,&mdash;dysentery,&mdash;which, if not cured in the earlier stages, resulted too surely, as now, in consumption of the bowels.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1707"/>He was a Kentuckian, cut off from home and friends, and dying among strangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1708"/>An almost imperceptible glance indicated that he wished me to take up his Bible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1709"/>The fast-stiffening lips whispered, <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">Read</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1710"/>I read to him the <num value="14" type="ordinal">Fourteenth</num> Chapter of <placeName key="tgn,7013172" n="1.000 13" reg="saint john,new brunswick,canada,north and central america">St. John</placeName>, stopping frequently to note if the faint breathing yet continued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1711"/>Each time he would move the cold fingers in a way that evidently meant <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">go on</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1712"/>After I had finished the reading, he whispered, so faintly that I could just catch the words, <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">Rock of Ages</hi>,</q> and I softly sang the beautiful hymn.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1713"/><measure n="2years" type="date">Two years</measure> before I could not have done this so calmly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1714"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> every death among my patients seemed to me like a personal bereavement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1715"/>Trying to read or to sing by the bedsides of the dying, uncontrollable tears and sobs would choke my voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1716"/>As I looked my last upon dead faces, I would turn away shuddering and sobbing, for a time unfit for duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1717"/><hi rend="italics">Now</hi>, my voice did not once fail or falter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1718"/>Calmly I watched the dying patient, and saw (as I had seen a <num value="100">hundred</num> times before) the gray shadow of death steal over the shrunken face, to be replaced at the last by a light so beautiful that I could well believe it came shining through <q direct="unspecified">the gates ajar.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1719"/></p> 
<p>It was sunrise when I again emerged from <rs n="Ward 9">Ward No. 9</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1720"/>Hastening to my room, I quickly bathed and redressed, returning to my office in half an hour, refreshed and ready for duty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1721"/>The necessity for breakfast sufficient to feed the hungry patients recalled to me the improvidence of my action in giving away so much bread the night before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1722"/>It had <pb id="p.151" n="151"/> gone a very little way toward supplying the needs of so large a body of soldiers, and now my own needed it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1723"/>There was no quartermaster, no <num value="1">one</num> to issue fresh rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1724"/>Again I had the cows milked, gathered up all the corn-bread that was left, with some hard-tack, and with the aid of the few decrepit nurses before mentioned made a fire, and warmed up the soup and soup-meat which had been prepared for the convalescent table the day before, but was not consumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1725"/>My patients, comprehending the situation, made the best of it. But the distribution was a tedious business, as many of the patients had to be fed by myself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1726"/>I had hardly begun when some of the men declared they <q direct="unspecified">heard guns.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1727"/>I could not then detect the sound, but soon it grew louder and more sustained, and then we <hi rend="italics">knew</hi> a battle was in progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1728"/>For hours the fight went on. We awaited the result in painful suspense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1729"/>At last the ambulances came in, bringing some of the surgeons and some wounded men, returning immediately for others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1730"/>At the same time the hospital steward with his attendants and several of our nurses arrived, also the linen-master, the <rs type="role" reg="chief-Cook">chief cook</rs>, and the baker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1731"/>With them came orders to prepare wards for a large number of wounded, both Confederate <hi rend="italics">and Federal</hi>. Presently a cloud of dust appeared up the road, and a detail of <orgName n="Confederate Cavalry" type="org">Confederate cavalry</orgName> rode into town, bringing <num value="800">eight hundred</num> Federal prisoners, who were consigned to a large cotton warehouse, situated almost midway between the hospital and the railroad depot.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1732"/>My terrible anxiety, suspense, and heavy responsibility was now at an end, but days and nights of nursing lay before all who were connected with either the <rs>Buckner</rs> or Bragg Hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1733"/>Additional buildings were at once seized and converted into wards for the reception of the wounded of both armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1734"/>The hospital <pb id="p.152" n="152"/> attendants, though weary, hungry, and some of them terribly dirty from the combined effect of perspiration, dust, and gunpowder, at once resumed their duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1735"/>The quartermaster reopened his office, requisitions were made and filled, and the work of the different departments was once more put in regular operation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1736"/>I was busy in <num value="1">one</num> of the wards, when a messenger drove up, and a note was handed me from <persName n="McAllister,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00152.00327" reg="mostcommon:McAllister,W.,T.,,:2"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>McAllister</surname></persName>,&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">Some of our men too badly wounded to be moved right away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1738"/>Bring cordials and brandy,&mdash;soup, if you have it,&mdash;also fill the enclosed requisition at the drug-store.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1739"/>Lose no time.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1740"/></p> 
<p>The battle-field was not <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1741"/>I was soon tearing along the road at breakneck speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1742"/>At an improvised field-hospital I met the doctor, who vainly tried to prepare me for the horrid spectacle I was about to witness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1743"/>From the hospital-tent distressing groans and screams came forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1744"/>The surgeons, both Confederate and Federal, were busy, with coats off, sleeves rolled up, shirtfronts and hands bloody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1745"/>But <hi rend="italics">our</hi> work lay not here.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1747"/>We then turned into a ploughed field, thickly strewn with men and horses, many stone dead, some struggling in the agonies of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1748"/>The plaintive cries and awful struggles of the horses <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impressed me. They were shot in every conceivable manner, showing shattered heads, broken and bleeding limbs, and protruding entrails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1749"/>They would not yield quietly to death, but continually raised their heads or struggled half-way to their feet, uttering cries of pain, while their distorted eyes seemed to reveal their suffering and implore relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1750"/>I saw a soldier shoot <pb id="p.153" n="153"/> <num value="1">one</num> of these poor animals, and felt truly glad to know that his agony was at an end.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/>The dead lay around us on every side, singly and in groups and <hi rend="italics">piles;</hi> men and horses, in some cases, apparently inextricably mingled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1754"/>What had passed between them could never be known; but <num value="1">one</num> was shot in the head, the throat of the other was partly torn away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1755"/>It was awful to feel the conviction that unquenched hatred had embittered the last moments of each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1756"/>They seemed mere youths, and I thought sadly of the mothers, whose hearts would throb with equal anguish in a Northern and a Southern home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1757"/>In a corner of the field, supported by a pile of broken fence-rails, a soldier sat apparently beckoning to us. On approaching him we discovered that he was quite dead, although he sat upright, with open eyes and extended arm.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/>Several badly wounded men had been laid under the shade of some bushes a little farther on; our mission lay here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>The portion of the field we crossed to reach this spot was in many places slippery with blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>The edge of my dress was red, my feet were wet with it. As we drew near the suffering men, piteous glances met our own. <q direct="unspecified">Water!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>Water!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/>was the cry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/><persName n="McAllister,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00153.00330" reg="mostcommon:McAllister,W.,T.,,:2"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>McAllister</surname></persName> had previously discovered in <num value="1">one</num> of these the son of an old friend, and although he was apparently wounded unto death, he hoped, when the ambulances returned with the stretchers sent for, to move him into town to the hospital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>He now proceeded with the aid of the instruments, bandages, lint, etc., I had brought to prepare him for removal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1765"/>Meantime, taking from my pocket a small feeding-cup, which I always <pb id="p.154" n="154"/> carried for use in the wards, I mixed some brandy and water, and, kneeling by <num value="1">one</num> of the poor fellows who seemed worse than the others, tried to raise his head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>But he was already dying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1767"/>As soon as he was moved the blood ran in a little stream from his mouth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1768"/>Wiping it off, I put the cup to his lips, but he could not swallow, and reluctantly I left him to die. He wore the blue uniform and stripes of a Federal sergeant of cavalry, and had a German face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1769"/>The next seemed anxious for water, and drank eagerly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1770"/>This <num value="1">one</num>, a man of middle age, was later transferred to our wards, but died from blood-poisoning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1772"/><num value="0.33">A <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> could only talk with his large, sad eyes, but made me clearly understand his desire for water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1773"/>As I passed my arm under his head the red blood saturated my sleeve and spread in a moment over a part of my dress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1774"/>So we went on, giving water, brandy, or soup; sometimes successful in reviving the patient, sometimes able only to whisper a few words of comfort to the dying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1775"/>There were many more left, and <persName n="McAllister,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00154.00331" reg="mostcommon:McAllister,W.,T.,,:2"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>McAllister</surname></persName> never for a moment intermitted his efforts to save them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1776"/>Later came more help, surgeons, and attendants with stretchers, etc. Soon all were moved who could bear it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1777"/>Duty now recalled me to my patients at the hospital.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1778"/>My hands and dress and feet were bloody, and I felt sick with horror.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1779"/>As I was recrossing the battle-field accompanied by <persName n="Welford,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00154.00332" reg="mostcommon:Welford,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Welford</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, the same terrible scenes were presented to the view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1780"/>The ground was littered with the accoutrements of soldiers,&mdash;carbines, pistols, canteens, haversacks, etc. <num value="2">Two</num> cannon lay overturned, near <num value="1">one</num> of which lay a dead Federal soldier still grasping the rammer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1781"/>Beneath the still struggling horses lay <pb id="p.155" n="155"/> human forms just as they had fallen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1782"/>Probably they had been dead ere they reached the ground, but I felt a shuddering dread lest perhaps some lingering spark of life had been crushed out by the rolling animals.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1783"/>We had nearly reached the road when our attention was arrested by stifled cries and groans proceeding from a little log cabin which had been nearly demolished during the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1784"/>Entering, we found it empty, but still the piteous cries continued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1785"/>Soon the doctor discovered a pair of human legs hanging down the chimney, but with all his pulling could not dislodge the man, who was fast wedged and only cried out the louder.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1786"/><q direct="unspecified">Stop your infernal noise,</q> said the doctor, <q direct="unspecified">and try to help yourself while I pull.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1787"/>By this time others had entered the cabin, and their united effort at length succeeded in dislodging from the chimney,&mdash;not a negro, but a white man, whose blue eyes, glassy with terror, shone through the soot which had begrimed his face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1788"/>He had climbed up the chimney to escape the storm of shot, and had so wedged himself in that to release himself unaided was impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1789"/>Irrepressible laughter greeted his appearance, and I&mdash;I am bitterly ashamed to say&mdash;fell into a fit of most violent hysterical laughter and weeping.

Under the influence of a sedative I soon fell into a deep sleep, awakening at daylight to find my own servant (who had returned with other negroes during the night) standing at my bedside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1791"/>The surgeons had sent a little of the precious <hi rend="italics">real coffee</hi>, of which there was only <num value="1">one</num> sack left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1792"/>Upon awakening, I was to be at once served with a cup. A warm bath followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1793"/>By <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time> I was once more at the hospital, ready for <pb id="p.156" n="156"/> duty, after <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> and nights, during which, it seemed to me, I had lived for years.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1794"/>Even at this early hour, <placeName reg="Buckner hospital">Buckner hospital</placeName> presented a scene of great activity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1795"/>Some of the surgeons had remained all night on duty, and were still busy; while others, having snatched a few hours of sleep, were now preparing for their trying work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1796"/>In almost every ward lay a few wounded Federals, but, all the spare beds having been filled, a long, low, brick building, on the corner opposite the drug-store, once used as a cotton-pickery, was fitted up as comfortably as the limited hospital-supplies at our command would allow for the <rs>Federals</rs> exclusively, and they were permitted to have the attendance of their own surgeons, although ours always responded readily, if needed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1797"/>These Federal surgeons appeared to me to be very indifferent to the comfort of their patients, and to avoid all unnecessary trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/>They were tardy in beginning their work the morning after the battle, and, when they were ready, coolly sent in <hi rend="italics">requisitions</hi> for <hi rend="italics">chloroform</hi>, which, having been (contrary to the dictates of humanity and to the customs of civilized nations) long since declared by their government <q direct="unspecified">contraband of war,</q> was almost unattainable, and used by our Confederate surgeons only in extreme cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1799"/>In all minor, and in some severe, operations the surgeons relied upon the manly fortitude of the patients, and, <hi rend="italics"><name n="God" type="God">God</name> bless our brave boys</hi>, they bore this cruel test with a courage fully as worthy to be recorded as the most brilliant action on the battle-field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1800"/>On the morning in question, as I made my early rounds, there met me everywhere ghastly reminders of the battle,&mdash;men shot and disfigured in every conceivable manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1801"/>Many, fresh from the hands of the surgeons, exhausted by suffering, looked as if already <pb id="p.157" n="157"/> Death had claimed them for his own. Attendants were constantly bearing into different wards fresh victims from the operating-rooms, where the bloody work would still go on for hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1802"/>These must have immediate attention,&mdash;must be closely watched and strongly nourished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1803"/>This was <hi rend="italics">my</hi> blessed privilege; and, thanks to the humane and excellent policy adopted by <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0242.0003.00157.00334" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Sydney,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, and continued by <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n0242.0003.00157.00335" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName>,&mdash;both of whom looked well to the <hi rend="italics">ways of quartermasters</hi> and <hi rend="italics">commissaries</hi>,&mdash;the means to provide for the sick and wounded were always at hand,&mdash;at least, up to the time of which I write.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1804"/>Some of my favorite patients, whom, previous to this battle, I had nursed into convalescence, were now thrown back upon beds of pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1805"/>In <num value="1">one</num> corner I found a boy whom I had nursed and fed through days and nights of suffering from typhoid fever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/>His name was <persName n="Hutson,,Willie,,," id="n0242.0003.00157.00336" reg="default:Hutson,Willie,,,"><foreName>Willie</foreName> <surname>Hutson</surname></persName>, and he belonged .to the&mdash;&mdash;<orgName type="mil" key="MSRegiment">Mississippi Regiment</orgName>. <measure n="2days" type="date">Two days</measure> ago he had been as bright as a lark, and pleading to be sent to the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1807"/>Now he lay, shot through the breast, so near death that he did not know me. As I bent over him with tearful eyes, a hand placed upon my arm caused me to turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1811"/>The dreadful work of the invaders had been before my eyes all the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>I felt as if I could have nothing to do with them, and did not wish to see <num value="1">one</num> of them again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1813"/>They had not only murdered my poor boy <persName><foreName>Willie</foreName></persName>, but dozens of dearer friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1814"/>They were even <pb id="p.158" n="158"/> now running riot in the home I loved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1815"/>They were invaders!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1816"/>I could <hi rend="italics">not</hi> meet them,&mdash;could not nurse them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1817"/>It is painful thus to reveal the thoughts of my wicked, unchristian heart; but thus I reasoned and felt just then.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1818"/>After a while a note from <persName n="Gore,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00158.00339" reg="mostcommon:Gore,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Gore</surname></persName> was handed me.

<p>I do not believe that ever before or since have I fought so hard a battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> helping me, I decided to do right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>The short, sharp contest ended&mdash;I acted at once.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/>On my way to the <rs>Federal</rs> wards, I met more than <num value="1">one</num> hospital-attendant carrying off a bloody leg or arm to bury it. I felt then, and saw no reason to alter my opinion afterwards, that some of their surgeons were far rougher and less merciful than ours; and I do not believe they ever gave the poor, shattered fellows the benefit of a doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/>It was easier to amputate than to attend a tedious, troublesome recovery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1826"/>So, off went legs and arms by the wholesale.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1827"/>I had not been <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> in the low, brick ward, where lay the most dangerously wounded Federals, when all animosity vanished and my woman's heart melted within me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1828"/>These were strangers and unwelcome, but far from home and friends, suffering, dying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1829"/>The surgeon said to me, <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role2">Madam</rs>, <num value="0.5">one-half</num> the attention you give to your own men will save life here.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1830"/></p> 
<p>The patients were all badly, many fatally, wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1831"/><pb id="p.159" n="159"/> They were silent, repellent, and evidently expectant of insult and abuse, but after a while received food and drink from my hands pleasantly, and I tried to be faithful in my ministrations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1832"/>I believe that most of the soldiers in this ward were from <placeName reg="Iowa" key="tgn,7007253">Iowa</placeName> and <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1833"/><num value="1">One</num> I remember particularly, a captain of cavalry, who was shot through the throat and had to receive nourishment by means of a rubber tube inserted for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1834"/>A young man in a blue and yellow uniform&mdash;an aide or orderly&mdash;remained at his side day and night until he died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1835"/>His eyes spoke to me eloquently of his gratitude, and once he wrote on a scrap of paper, <q direct="unspecified"><name n="God" type="God">God</name> bless you,</q> and handed it to me. He lived about <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1836"/>The mortality was very considerable in this ward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1837"/>I grew to feel a deep interest in the poor fellows, and treasured last words or little mementoes as faithfully for their distant loved ones as I had always done for Confederates.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1838"/>Among the personal belongings taken from me by raiders at <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon, Georgia</placeName>, was a large chest, full of articles of this kind, which I intended to return to the friends of the owners whenever the opportunity offered.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/>In another ward were several renegade <persName><foreName>Kentuckians</foreName></persName>, who constantly excited my ire by noting and ridiculing deficiencies, calling my own dear boys <q direct="unspecified">Old Jeff's ragamuffins,</q> etc. <num value="1">One</num> day <persName n="Gore,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00159.00341" reg="mostcommon:Gore,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Gore</surname></persName> happened to be visiting this ward when these men began their usual teasing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1840"/>Something caused me to eulogize <persName n="Gore,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00159.00342" reg="mostcommon:Gore,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Gore</surname></persName> and all the <name>Kentuckians</name> who had sacrificed so much for <q direct="unspecified">The Cause.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1843"/>Then walked out of the ward.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1844"/>It was rather a spiteful repartee, I must confess, but was provoked by many ill-natured remarks previously made by this renegade, and had the good effect of putting an end to them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/>We were comparatively safe once more,&mdash;for how long no <num value="1">one</num> knew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>I now became very anxious about the men in the trenches at <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> who were lying day after day, always under fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>Suffering from insufficient food, exposed to the scorching sun or equally pitiless rain, sometimes actually knee-deep in water for days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>The bombardment was heavy and incessant, ceasing only for a while at sunset, when carts were hastily loaded with musty meat and poor corn-bread, driven out to the trenches, and the rations <hi rend="italics">dumped</hi> there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1849"/>Many of my friends were lying in these trenches, among them my husband.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1850"/>In addition to other ills, the defenders of <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> were in instant danger of death from shot or shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1851"/>I <hi rend="italics">could not bear it</hi>. The desire to see my husband once more, and to carry some relief in the shape of provisions to himself and his comrades could not be quelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1852"/>Many things stood in the way of its accomplishment, for, upon giving a hint of my project to my friends at <placeName key="tgn,2023732" n="1.000 8" reg="newnan, coweta, georgia">Newnan</placeName>, a storm of protest broke upon my devoted head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/>So I was obliged to resort to deception and subterfuge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>My <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step was to request leave of absence, that I might forage for provisions to be sent to the front by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opportunity.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/><persName n="McAllister,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00160.00343" reg="mostcommon:McAllister,W.,T.,,:2"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>McAllister</surname></persName> very kindly accorded me his permission, placing at my disposal an ambulance and a driver, advising me, however, not to follow the main road or the beaten track which had already been drained <pb id="p.161" n="161"/> by foragers, but to go deep into the piny woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1858"/>Said he, <q direct="unspecified">Only <num value="1">one</num> of our foragers has ever been through that region, and his reports were not very encouraging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/>The people want to keep all they have got for home-consumption, and greatly distrust <quote>hospital people,</quote> but if success is possible, <hi rend="italics">you</hi> will succeed.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>In anticipation, this ride into deep, odorous pine woods seemed delightful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1861"/>When the ambulance with its <q direct="unspecified">captured</q> mule drove up before my door, I gayly climbed into it, and, waving merry adieux to half-disapproving friends (among them <persName n="Hughes,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00161.00344" reg="mostcommon:Hughes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Hughes</surname></persName>, with his distressed face, and <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Diogenes,,,,," id="n0242.0003.00161.00345" reg="mostcommon:Diogenes,nomatch:0"><surname>Diogenes</surname></persName></hi>, who looked daggers at me), set off in high glee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1862"/>The ride along the pleasant road was lovely; early birds sung sweetly; the dew, yet undisturbed, glistened everywhere, the morning breeze blew freshly in my face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1863"/>As the sun began to assert his power, I became eager to penetrate into the shady woods, and at last, spying a grand aisle in <q direct="unspecified">Nature's temple,</q> bade the driver enter it. For a while the result was most enjoyable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1864"/>The spicy aroma of the pines, the brilliant vines climbing everywhere, the multitude of woodland blossoms blooming in such quantities and variety as I had never imagined, charmed my senses, and elevated my spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1865"/>Among these peaceful shades <num value="1">one</num> might almost forget the horror and carnage which desolated the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1866"/>The driver was versed in wood-craft, and called my attention to many beauties which would have otherwise escaped me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1867"/>After riding about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> we came to a small clearing, and were informed that the road for <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> was <pb id="p.162" n="162"/> <q direct="unspecified">tolerbal clar</q> and pretty thickly settled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/>So after partaking of an early country dinner, also obtaining a small amount of eggs, chickens, etc., at exorbitant prices, we resumed our ride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>That expedition will never be forgotten by me. At its close, I felt that my powers of diplomacy were quite equal to <hi rend="italics">any</hi> emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1870"/>Oh, the sullen, sour-looking women that I sweetly smiled upon, and flattered into good humor, praising their homes, the cloth upon the loom, the truck-patch (often a mass of weeds), the tow-headed babies (whom I caressed and admired), never hinting at my object until the innocent victims offered of their own accord to <q direct="unspecified">show me round.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>At the spring-house I praised the new country butter, which <q direct="unspecified">looked so very good that I must have a pound or <num value="2">two</num>,</q> and then skilfully leading the conversation to the subject of chickens and eggs, carelessly displaying a few crisp Confederate bills, I at least became the happy possessor of a few dozens of eggs and a chicken or <num value="2">two</num>, at a price which only their destination reconciled me to.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1872"/>At <num value="1">one</num> house, approached by a road so tortuous and full of stumps that we were some time before reaching it, I distinctly heard a dreadful squawking among the fowls, but when we arrived at the gate, not <num value="1">one</num> was to be seen, and the mistress declared she hadn't <hi rend="italics">a</hi> <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi>: hadn't saw a chicken for a <hi rend="italics">coon's</hi> age.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1873"/>Pleading excessive fatigue, I begged the privilege of resting within the cabin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1876"/>Every once in a while the faces of children, either <rs type="color">black</rs> or <rs type="color">white</rs>, would peer at me round the corner of the house, then the sound of scampering <pb id="p.163" n="163"/> bare feet would betray their sudden flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1877"/>Suddenly I caught sight of a pair of bare, black feet protruding from under the bed. Presently an unmistakable squawk arose, instantly smothered, but followed by a fluttering of wings and a <hi rend="italics">chorus</hi> of squawks.

<p>Stopping at every house, meeting with varied success, we at last, just at night, arrived at a farm-house more orderly than any we had passed, where I was glad to discover the familiar face of an old lady who had sometimes brought buttermilk and eggs to the sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1884"/>At once recognizing me, she appeared delighted, and insisted upon my <q direct="unspecified">lighting</q> and having my team put up until morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1885"/>This I was glad to do, for it was quite out of the question to start on my homeward journey that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1886"/>Greatly I enjoyed the hospitality so ungrudgingly given, the appetizing supper, the state bed in the best room, with its <q direct="unspecified">sunrise</q> quilt of patch-work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1887"/>Here was a Confederate household.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1888"/>The son was a soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1889"/>His wife and his little children were living <q direct="unspecified">with ma</q> at the old homestead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1890"/>The evening was spent in talking of the late battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1891"/>Here these women were, living <pb id="p.164" n="164"/> in the depths of the woods, consumed with anxiety, seldom hearing any news, yet quietly performing the monotonous round of duty with a patience which would have added lustre to the crown of a saint.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/>I talked until (wonderful to relate) my tongue was tired: my audience being the old, white-haired father, the mother, the wife, and the eager children, who were shy at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, but by degrees nestled closer, with bright eyes from which sleep seemed banished forever.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>The next morning when, after a substantial breakfast, I was once more ready to start, every member of the family made some addition to my stores, notably, a few pounds of really good country butter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/>This was always highly prized by the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1895"/>As a general thing, when the cows were fed upon cotton-seed the butter was white and <q direct="unspecified">waxy,</q> this was yellow and firm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1898"/>The old gentleman, mounting his horse, offered to <q direct="unspecified">ride a piece</q> with us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1899"/>The old farmer also showed us a way by which we could avoid a repetition of the tortures of yesterday, and rode beside the ambulance to the main road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1900"/>I remember well how he looked, as he sat upon his old white mule, waiting to see the last of us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1904"/>Everything was cooked; even the eggs were hard-boiled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1905"/>There was sufficient to fill <num value="2">two</num> large boxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1906"/>Having packed and shipped to the depot my treasures, I prepared for the final step without hesitation, although not without some doubt as to success in eluding the vigilance of my friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1907"/>Announcing my determination to see the boxes off, I&mdash;accompanied by my maid&mdash;walked down to the depot just before train-time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1908"/>There was only <num value="1">one</num> rickety old passenger-car attached to the train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1909"/>This, as well as a long succession of box-and cattle-cars, were crowded with troops,&mdash;reinforcements to <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1911"/>I was in high spirits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1912"/>On the train were many soldiers whom I had nursed, and who cared for my comfort in every way possible under the circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1913"/>I was the only lady on the train, so they were thoughtful enough to stow themselves in the crowded boxes behind, that I might not be embarrassed by a large number in the passenger-car.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1914"/>At last, as we approached <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, I heard the continuous and terrific noise of the bombardment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1915"/>The whistle of the engine was a signal to the enemy, who at once began to shell the depot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1916"/>I did not realize the danger yet, but just as the train <q direct="unspecified">slowed up</q> heard a shrieking sound, and saw the soldiers begin to dodge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1917"/><pb id="p.166" n="166"/> Before I could think twice, an awful explosion followed; the windows were all shivered, and the earth seemed to me to be thrown in cart-loads into the car. <placeName key="tgn,7014367" n="1.000 1" reg="tempe, maricopa, arizona">Tempe</placeName> screamed loudly, and then began to pray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1918"/>I was paralyzed with extreme terror, and <hi rend="italics">could</hi> not scream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1919"/>Before I could speak, another shell exploded overhead, tearing off the corner of a brick store, causing again a deafening racket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1920"/>As we glided into the station, I felt safer; but soon found out that every <num value="1">one</num> around me had business to attend to, and that I must rely upon myself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1921"/>The shells still shrieked and exploded; the more treacherous and dangerous solid shot continually demolished objects within our sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1922"/>For a few hours I was so utterly demoralized that my only thought was how to escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1923"/>It seemed to me <hi rend="italics">impossible</hi> that any body of soldiers could voluntarily expose themselves to such horrible danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1924"/>I thought if <hi rend="italics">I</hi> had been a soldier I must have deserted from my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> battle-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1925"/>But at last I grew calmer; my courage returned, and, urged by the necessity of finding shelter, I ventured out. Not a place could I find.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1926"/>The houses were closed and deserted, in many cases partly demolished by shot or shell, or, having taken fire, charred, smoking, and burnt to the ground.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1927"/>All day frightened women and children cowered and trembled and hungered and thirsted in their underground places of refuge while the earth above them shook with constant explosions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1928"/>After a while I grew quite bold, and decided to stow myself and my boxes in the lower part of a house not far from the depot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1929"/>The upper story had been torn off by shells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1930"/>I could look through large holes in the ceiling up to the blue sky. The next move was to find means of notifying my husband and his friends of my arrival.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1931"/>I crept along <pb id="p.167" n="167"/> the streets back to the depot, <placeName key="tgn,7014367" n="1.000 1" reg="tempe, maricopa, arizona">Tempe</placeName> creeping by my side, holding fast to my dress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1932"/>Then I found an officer just going out to the trenches, and sent by him a pencilled note to <persName n="Cluverius,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0242.0003.00167.00347" reg="mostcommon:Cluverius,Tyler,,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Cluverius</surname></persName>, thinking an officer would be likely to receive a communication, when a private might not. Soon after sunset, my husband joined me, and soon after many friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1933"/>They were all ragged, mud-stained, and altogether unlovely, but seemed to me most desirable and welcome visitors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1934"/><num value="1">One</num> of my boxes being opened, I proceeded to do the honors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1935"/>My guests having eaten very heartily, filled their haversacks, and, putting <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">a sup</hi></q> in their canteens, returned to camp to send out a fresh squad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1936"/>The next that came brought in extra haversacks and canteens <q direct="unspecified">for some of the boys who couldn't get off,</q> and these also were provided for.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1937"/>With the last squad my husband was compelled to go back to camp, as just then military rules were severe, and very strictly enforced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1938"/>I passed the night in an old, broken arm-chair, <placeName key="tgn,7014367" n="1.000 1" reg="tempe, maricopa, arizona">Tempe</placeName> lying at my feet, and slept so soundly that I heard not a sound of shot or shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1939"/>Very early next morning, however, we were awakened by a terrible explosion near us, and directly afterwards heard that within a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> of our place of refuge a shell had exploded, tearing away the upper part of a house, killing a man and his <num value="3">three</num> children, who were sleeping in <num value="1">one</num> of the rooms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1940"/>This made me very uneasy, and increased <placeName key="tgn,7014367" n="1.000 1" reg="tempe, maricopa, arizona">Tempe</placeName>'s terror to such an extent that she became almost unmanageable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1941"/>During the next day I actually became accustomed to the noise and danger, and <q direct="unspecified">with a heart for any fate</q> passed the day. At night my levee was larger than before; among them I had the satisfaction of seeing and supplying some <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1942"/>That night the bombardment was <pb id="p.168" n="168"/> terrific.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1943"/>Anxiety for my husband, combined with a shuddering terror, made sleep impossible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1944"/>The next morning, my husband having obtained a few hours' leave of absence, joined me in my shattered retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1945"/>The day was darkened by the agony of parting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1946"/>It seemed to me <hi rend="italics">impossible</hi> to leave him under such circumstances, and really required more courage than to face the shot and shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1947"/>But I could easily see that anxiety for me interfered with his duty as a soldier, so&mdash;we must part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1948"/>On the same evening I returned to <placeName key="tgn,2023732" n="1.000 8" reg="newnan, coweta, georgia">Newnan</placeName>, where my friends were so overjoyed at my safe return that they forbore to upbraid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1949"/>Soon afterward the battle of <placeName key="tgn,2028512;tgn,2008610" n="0.130 000000.2603	placename;tgn,2028512;jonesboro, union, illinois,Union,Illinois,United States,North and Central America;0.130 000000.2603	placename;tgn,2008610;jonesboro, craighead, arkansas,Craighead,Arkansas,United States,North and Central America" reg="jonesboro, union, illinois,Union,Illinois,United States,North and Central America;jonesboro, craighead, arkansas,Craighead,Arkansas,United States,North and Central America">Jonesboroa</placeName> again filled our wards with shattered wrecks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1950"/>As I have already stated, my husband then came for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time to claim my care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1951"/>Before he was quite able to return to duty, the post was ordered to <placeName reg="Fort Valley, Peach, Georgia" key="tgn,2022934">Fort Valley, Georgia</placeName>, a pleasant and very hospitable town, where new and excellent hospital buildings had been erected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1952"/>From here <persName n="Beers,Mister,,,," id="n0242.0003.00168.00348" reg="mostcommon:Beers,Fannie,A.,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Beers</surname></persName> returned to his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1953"/>The day of his departure was marked by hours of intense anguish which I yet shudder to recall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1954"/>The train which stopped at the hospital camp to take up men returning to the front was crowded with soldiers,&mdash;reinforcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1955"/>I had scarcely recovered from the fit of bitter weeping which followed the parting, when, noticing an unusual commotion outside, I went to the door to discover the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1956"/>Men were running up the railroad track in the direction taken by the train which had just left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1957"/>A crowd had collected near the surgeon's office, in the midst of which stood an almost breathless messenger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1958"/>His tidings seemed to have the effect of sending off succeeding groups of men in the direction taken by those I had <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> seen running up the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1959"/>Among them I discovered several surgeons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1960"/>Something <pb id="p.169" n="169"/> was wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1961"/>Wild with apprehension, I sped over to the office, and there learned that the train of cars loaded and crowded with soldiers had been thrown down a steep embankment, about <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> up the road, and that many lives were lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1962"/>Waiting for nothing, I ran bareheaded and frantic up the track, for more than a mile never stopping, then hearing the slow approach of an engine, sunk down by the side of the track to await its coming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1963"/>Soon the engine appeared, drawing very slowly a few platform-and baggage-cars loaded with groaning, shrieking men, carrying, also, many silent forms which would never again feel pain or sorrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1964"/>The surgeons upon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> car upon descrying me crouching by the roadside, halted the train and lifted me upon the last car, where, among the <q direct="unspecified">slightly hurt,</q> I found my husband, terribly bruised and shaken, but in no danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1965"/>Arrived at camp, where tents had been hastily pitched, the wounded and dying were laid out side by side in some of the largest, while others received the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1966"/>The sights and sounds were awful in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1967"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> I could not muster courage (shaken as I had been) to go among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1968"/>But it was necessary for purposes of identification, so I examined every <num value="1">one</num>, dying and dead, feeling that <hi rend="italics">certainty, how</hi>-ever dreadful, might be better borne by loving hearts than prolonged suspense.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1969"/>Among these dreadful scenes came a minister of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, whose youthful face, pale and horror-stricken, yet all alight with heavenly pity and love, I can never forget.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1970"/>Tenderly he bent above these dying men, his trembling lips touched by divine inspiration, whispering words precious to parting souls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1971"/>Unshrinkingly he performed his mission to those who yet lived, then, passing among the dead, lovingly composed and prepared for decent burial the mutilated bodies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1980"/>The light from a little fire of pine knots, built on the ground outside, while illuminating the rough depot and platform, left the country beyond in deeper darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1981"/>It was bitterly cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1982"/>The driver of the ambulance informed me, we had <q direct="unspecified">quite a piece to ride yet.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1984"/>The ride to camp was dismal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1985"/>I continued to shiver with cold; my heart grew heavy as lead, and yearned sadly for a sight of the pleasant faces, the sound of the kindly voices, to which I had been so long accustomed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1986"/>At last a turn in the road brought us in sight of the numberless fires of a large camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1987"/>It was a bright scene, though far from gay. The few men who crouched by the fires were not roistering, rollicking soldiers, but pale shadows, holding their thin hands over the blaze which scorched their faces, while their thinly-covered backs were exposed to a cold so intense that it congealed the sap in the farthest end of the log on which they sat. Driving in among these, up an <q direct="unspecified">avenue</q> bordered on either side by rows of white tents, the ambulance drew up at last before the door of my <q direct="unspecified">quarters,</q>&mdash;a rough cabin built of logs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1988"/>Through the open door streamed the cheery light of a wood-fire, upon which pine knots had been freshly thrown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1997"/>I did not even feel the cold, although <placeName key="tgn,7014367" n="1.000 1" reg="tempe, maricopa, arizona">Tempe</placeName> declared she was <q direct="unspecified">dun froze stiff.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1998"/></p> 
<p>Very early I was astir, gazing from the door of my cabin at my new sphere of labor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1999"/>Snow had fallen during the night, and still came down steadily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2000"/>The path was hidden, the camp-fires appeared as through a mist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2001"/>A confused, steady sound of chopping echoed through the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2002"/>I heard mysterious words, dimly saw figures moving about the fires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2003"/>Everything looked unpromising,&mdash;dismal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2004"/>Chilled to <pb id="p.173" n="173"/> the heart, I turned back to my only comfort, the splendid fire <placeName key="tgn,7014367" n="1.000 1" reg="tempe, maricopa, arizona">Tempe</placeName> had built.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2005"/>My breakfast was exactly as supper had been, and was brought by the cook, a detailed soldier, who looked as if he ought to have been at the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2006"/>He apologized for the scanty rations, promising some beef for dinner.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2007"/>Soon <persName n="Beatty,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00173.00354" reg="mostcommon:Beatty,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Beatty</surname></persName>, accompanied by <num value="2">two</num> assistantsur-geons, appeared to escort me to the tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2008"/>I went gladly, for I was anxious to begin my work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2009"/>What I saw during that hour of inspection convinced me, not only that my services were needed, but that my work must be begun and carried on under almost insurmountable difficulties and disadvantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2010"/>I found no comforts, no hospital stores, insufficient nourishment, a scarcity of blankets and comforts, even of pillows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2011"/>Of the small number of the latter few had cases; all were soiled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2012"/>The sick men had spit over them and the bedclothes, which could not be changed because there were no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2013"/>As I have said, there were no comforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2014"/>The patients looked as if they did not expect any, and seemed sullen and discontented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2015"/>The tents were not new, nor were they all good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2016"/>They seemed to me without number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2017"/>Passing in and out among them, I felt bewildered and doubtful whether I should ever learn to know <num value="1">one</num> from another, or to find my patients.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2018"/>Part of the camp was set apart for convalescents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2019"/>Here were dozens of Irishmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2020"/>They were so maimed and shattered that every <num value="1">one</num> should have been entitled to a discharge, but the poor fellows had no homes to go to, and were quite unable to provide for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2021"/>There were the remnants of companies, regiments, and brigades, many of them <persName><foreName>Louisianians</foreName></persName>, and from other States outside the <rs>Confederate</rs> lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2022"/>Had there been any fighting to do, they would still have <q direct="unspecified">taken a hand,</q> maimed as they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2023"/>The monotony of hospital <pb id="p.174" n="174"/> camp-life made them restless; the rules they found irksome, and constantly evaded; they growled, complained, were always <q direct="unspecified">in hot water,</q> and almost unmanageable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2024"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time I passed among them they eyed me askance, seeming, I feared, to resent the presence of a woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2025"/>But I made it my daily custom to visit their part of the camp, standing by their camp-fires to listen to their <q direct="unspecified">yarns,</q> or to relate some of my own experiences, trying to make their hardships seem less, listening to their complaints, meaning in earnest to speak to <persName n="Beatty,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00174.00355" reg="mostcommon:Beatty,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Beatty</surname></persName> regarding palpable wrongs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2026"/>This I did not fail to do, and whenever the doctor's sense of justice was aroused, he promptly acted on the right side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2027"/>I do not wish to convey to my readers the idea that there were men always sullen and disagreeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2028"/>Far from it, they were a jolly set of men when in a good humor, and, like all Irishmen, full of wit and humor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2029"/>After I became known to them their gentle, courteous treatment of me never varied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2030"/>They were very fond of playing cards, but whenever I appeared upon <num value="1">one</num> of the avenues, every card would disappear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2031"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> ever failed to salute me, often adding a <q direct="unspecified"><name n="God" type="God">God</name> bless you, ma'am, may the heavens be your bed,</q> etc.-Disliking to interfere with their only amusement, I let them know that I did not dislike to see them playing cards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2032"/>At this they were very pleased, saying, <q direct="unspecified">Sure, it's no harrum; it's not gambling we are; divil a cint have <hi rend="italics">we</hi> to win or lose.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2033"/><num value="1">One</num> day I stopped to look on a moment at a game of euchre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2034"/><num value="1">One</num> of the players had lost an arm (close to the shoulder). Said he, <q direct="unspecified">Sure, ma'am, it's baking the b'ys intirely, I am.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2035"/>I did not understand, so he explained, with a comic leer at the others,&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">Sure, haven't I always the <hi rend="italics"><quote>lone hand</quote> </hi> on thim?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2036"/>At once I recalled a similar remark made by an Irish soldier lying in the <pb id="p.175" n="175"/> hospital at <placeName key="tgn,2023732" n="1.000 8" reg="newnan, coweta, georgia">Newnan</placeName>, who had just lost <num value="1">one</num> of his legs; when I condoled with him, he looked up brightly, and, pointing at his remaining foot, explained, <q direct="unspecified">Niver mind, this feller <hi rend="italics">will go it alone and make it</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2037"/></p> 
<p>Among the surgeons in camp was <num value="1">one</num> who had highly offended these convalescents by retiring to his cabin, <hi rend="italics">pulling the latch-string inside</hi> and remaining deaf to all calls and appeals from outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2038"/>Mutterings of discontent were heard for a while, but at last as there was no further mention of the matter, I believed it was ended.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2039"/>About this time the actions of the convalescents began to appear mysterious: they remained in their tents or absented themselves, as I supposed, upon foraging expeditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2040"/>Frequently, I found them working upon cow-horns, making ornaments as I thought (at this business Confederate soldiers were very expert). <num value="1">One</num> day I caught sight of a large pile of horns and bones just brought in, but still thought nothing of it. Shortly, however, a small deputation from the convalescent camp appeared at the door of my cabin just as I was eating my dinner: all saluted; the spokesman then explained that the <q direct="unspecified">b'ys</q> were prepared to give the obnoxious surgeon a <q direct="unspecified">siranade</q> that same night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2041"/>They had been working for weeks to produce the instruments of torture which were then all ready.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2042"/><q direct="unspecified">We don't mane to scare <hi rend="italics">ye</hi>, ma'am, and if it'll be displazina to ye, sure we'll give it up.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2043"/>I told them that I did not want to know about it, and was sorry they had told me, but I would not be frightened at any noise I night hear in the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2044"/><q direct="unspecified">All right, ma'am,</q> said the spokesman, winking at the others to show that he comprehended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2045"/>The party then withdrew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2046"/>About midnight such a startling racket suddenly broke the stillness that in spite of my previous knowledge, I <hi rend="italics">was</hi> frightened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2047"/>Horns of all grades of sound, from deep and hoarse to shrill, tin cups and pans clashed <pb id="p.176" n="176"/> together or beaten with bones, yells, whistling, and in short every conceivable and inconceivable noise.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2048"/>After the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blast, utter stillness; the startled officers, meanwhile, listening to discover the source of the unearthly noise, then, as if Bedlam had broken loose, the concert began once more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2049"/>It was concentrated around the cabin of the surgeon so disliked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2050"/>As the quarters of the officers were somewhat removed from the hospital proper, and very near my own, I got the full benefit of the noise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2051"/>I cannot now say why the racket was not put a stop to. Perhaps because the serenaders numbered over <num value="100">one hundred</num> and the surgeons despaired of restoring order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2052"/>At all events, during the whole night we were allowed to sink into slumber, to be aroused again and again by the same hideous burst of sound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2053"/>I only remember that the next day the horns, etc., were collected and carried away from camp, while the offenders were refused permission to leave their quarters for a while.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2054"/>In the sick camp there lay over <measure n="200" type="sick">two hundred sick</measure> and wounded men, faithfully attended and prescribed for by the physicians, but lacking every comfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2055"/><persName n="Beatty,Doctor,,,," id="n0242.0003.00176.00356" reg="mostcommon:Beatty,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Beatty</surname></persName> was worried about the sick, but under the circumstances what could he do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2056"/>Soon after occurred the terrible <rs n="Battle of Franklin" type="battle">battle of Franklin</rs>, when our tents were again filled with wounded men. These men were unlike any I have ever nursed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2057"/>Their shattered forms sufficiently attested courage and devotion to duty, but the enthusiasm and pride which had hitherto seemed to me so grand and noble when lighting up the tortured faces of wounded soldiers, appearing like a reflection of great glory, I now missed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2058"/>It seemed as if they were yet revengeful and unsatisfied; their countenances not yet relaxed from the tension of the fierce struggle, their eyes yet gleaming with the fires of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2059"/>The tales they told made me shudder: Of men, maddened by the horrible butchery <pb id="p.177" n="177"/> going on around them, mounting the horrible barricade (trampling out in many instances the little sparks of life which might have been rekindled),.only to add their own bodies to the horrid pile, and to be trampled in their turn by comrades who sought to avenge them; of soldiers on both sides, grappling hand to hand, tearing open each other's wound, drenched with each other's blood, <hi rend="italics">dying</hi> locked in a fierce embrace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2060"/>It turns me sick even now when I remember the terrible things I then heard, the awful wounds I then saw. During the whole period of my service, I never had a harder task than when striving to pour oil upon these troubled waters, to soothe and reconcile these men who talked incessantly of <q direct="unspecified">sacrifice</q> and useless butchery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2061"/>This was particularly the case with <persName n="Clebourne,General,,,," id="n0242.0003.00177.00357" reg="mostcommon:Clebourne,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Clebourne</surname></persName>'s men, who so loved their gallant leader that, at his death, revenge had almost replaced patriotism in their hearts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2062"/>I do not consider myself competent, nor do I wish to criticise the generals who led our armies and who, since the war, have, with few exceptions, labored assiduously to throw the blame of failure upon each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2063"/>I have read their books with feelings of intense sorrow and regret,&mdash;looking for a reproduction of the glories of the past,&mdash;finding whole pages of recrimination and full of <q direct="unspecified">all uncharitableness.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2064"/>For my own part, I retain an unchanged, unchangeable respect and reverence for <hi rend="italics">all</hi> alike, <hi rend="italics">believing each to have been a pure and honest patriot</hi>, <hi rend="italics">who, try as he might, could not surmount the difficulties which each <num value="1">one</num> in turn encountered</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2065"/>A brave, <hi rend="italics">vindictive</hi> foe, whose superiority in numbers, in arms, and equipment, and, more than all, <hi rend="italics">rations, they</hi> could maintain indefinitely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2066"/>And to oppose them, an utterly inadequate force, whose bravery and unparalleled endurance held out to the end, although hunger gnawed at their vitals, disease and death daily decimated <pb id="p.178" n="178"/> their ranks, intense anxiety for dear ones exposed to dangers, privations, all the horrors which everywhere attended the presence of the invaders, torturing them every hour.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2067"/>While yielding to none in my appreciation of the gallant <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n0242.0003.00178.00358" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName>, there is <num value="1">one</num> page in his book which always arouses my indignation and which I can never reconcile with what <hi rend="italics">I know</hi> of the history of the <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Army of Tennessee</orgName>, from the time <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n0242.0003.00178.00359" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName> took command to the surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2068"/>Truly, they were far from being like <q direct="unspecified">dumb driven cattle,</q> for <hi rend="italics">every man</hi> was <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">a hero</hi> in the strife.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2069"/>It seems to me that the memory of the <rs n="Battle of Franklin" type="battle">battle of Franklin</rs> alone should have returned to <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n0242.0003.00178.00360" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName> to <q direct="unspecified">give him pause</q> before he gave to the public the page referred to:</p>

<p>My failure on the <num value="20" type="ordinal">20th</num> and the <num value="22" type="ordinal">22d</num> to bring about a general pitched battle arose from the unfortunate policy pursued from <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton</placeName> to <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, and which had wrought <quote>such</quote> demoralization amid rank and file as to render the men unreliable in battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2072"/>I cannot give a more forcible, though homely, exemplification of the morale of the troops at that period than <hi rend="italics">by comparing the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> to a team</hi> which has been allowed to balk at every hill, <num value="1">one</num> portion will make strenuous efforts to advance, whilst the other will refuse to move, and thus paralyze the exertions of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2074"/>No reliance can be placed upon it at any stated time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2075"/>Thus it was with the army when ordered into a general engagement, <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 1">one corps</orgName> strugged nobly, whilst the neighboring corps frustrated its efforts by simple inactivity; and whilst the entire Army might fight desperately <num value="1">one</num> day, it would fail in action the following day. <persName n="Stewart,,,,," id="n0242.0003.00178.00361" reg="mostcommon:Stewart,nomatch:0"><surname>Stewart</surname></persName>'s gallant attack <pb id="p.179" n="179"/> on the <num value="20" type="ordinal">20th</num> was neutralized by <persName n="Hardee,,,,," id="n0242.0003.00179.00362" reg="mostcommon:Hardee,nomatch:0"><surname>Hardee</surname></persName>'s inertness on the right; and the failure in the battle of the <num value="22" type="ordinal">22d</num> is to be attributed also to the effect of the <quote>timid defensive</quote> policy of this officer, who, although a brave and gallant soldier, neglected to obey orders, and swung away, totally independent of the main-body of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName>.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2076"/>Time softens and alleviates all troubles, and this was no exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2077"/>But the winter was a very gloomy <num value="1">one</num>: my heart was constantly oppressed by witnessing suffering I could not relieve, needs which could not be met.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2078"/>I hit upon an expedient to vary the rations a little, which found favor with the whole camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2079"/>The beef was simply atrocious.

<text><body> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2084"/>For some time previous I had been revolving in my mind various plans for the celebration of <persName n="Christmas,,,,," id="n0242.0003.00179.00365" reg="mostcommon:Christmas,nomatch:0"><surname>Christmas</surname></persName> by making some addition to the diet of the sick and wounded soldiers then under my charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2085"/>But, plan as I would, the stubborn facts in the case rose up to confront me, and I failed to see just how to accomplish my <pb id="p.180" n="180"/> wishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2086"/>We were then located at <placeName reg="Lauderdale, Lauderdale, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056789">Lauderdale Springs, Mississippi</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2087"/>I, with my servant, <placeName key="tgn,7014367" n="1.000 1" reg="tempe, maricopa, arizona">Tempe</placeName>, occupied <num value="1">one</num> room of a small, double house, built of rough-hewn logs, and raised a few feet from the ground; a sort of hall, open at both ends, separated my room from <num value="1">one</num> on the opposite side occupied by <rs type="role">Dr.</rs> &mdash;&mdash; and his wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2088"/>All around, as far as <num value="1">one</num> could see, amid the white snow and with lofty pine-trees towering above them, extended the hospital-tents, and in these lay the sick, the wounded, the dying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2089"/>Hospital-supplies were scarce, our rations of the plainest articles, which, during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> years of the war, were considered absolute necessaries, had become priceless luxuries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2090"/>Eggs, butter, chickens came in such small quantities that they must be reserved for the very sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2091"/>The cheerfulness, self-denial, and fellow-feeling shown by those who were even partly convalescent, seemed to me to be scarcely less admirable than the bravery which had distinguished them on the battle-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2092"/>But this is a digression: let me hasten to relate how I was helped to a decision as to <dateStruct value="-12-25"><occasion>Christmas</occasion></dateStruct> <q direct="unspecified">goodies.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2093"/><num value="1">One</num> morning, going early to visit some wounded soldiers who had come in during the night, I found in <num value="1">one</num> tent a newcomer, lying in <num value="1">one</num> of the bunks, his head and face bandaged and bloody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2094"/>By his side sat his comrade,&mdash; wounded also, but less severely,&mdash;trying to soften for the other some corn-bread, which he was soaking and beating with a stick in a tin cup of cold water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2095"/>He explained that the soldier with the bandaged head had been shot in the mouth, and could take only soft food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2096"/>I said, <q direct="unspecified">Don't give him that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2097"/>I will bring him some mush and milk, or some chicken soup.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2098"/>He set down the cup, looked at me with queer, half-shut eyes, then remarked, <q direct="unspecified">Yer ga-assina now, ain't ye?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2099"/></p> 
<p>Having finally convinced him that I was not, I retired <pb id="p.181" n="181"/> for a moment to send the nurse for some food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2100"/>When it came, and while I was slowly putting spoonfuls of broth into the poor, shattered mouth of his friend, he stood looking on complacently, though with his lip quivering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2101"/>I said to him, <q direct="unspecified">Now, what would <hi rend="italics">you</hi> like?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2102"/>After a moment's hesitation he replied, <q direct="unspecified">Well, lady, I've been sort of hankerina after a sweet-potato pone, but I s'pose ye couldn't noways get that?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2104"/></p> 
<p>Hastening to interview the surgeon in charge, I easily obtained permission to go on the next day among the farmers to collect materials for my feast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2105"/>An ambulance was placed at my disposal.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2106"/>My foraging expedition was tolerably successful, and I returned next evening with a quantity of sweet potatoes, several dozen eggs, and some country butter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2107"/>Driving directly to the door of my cabin, I had my treasures securely placed within; for, although holding my soldier-friends in high estimation, I agreed with the driver of the ambulance,&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">Them &apos;taturs has to be taken in out of the cold.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2108"/>My neighbor's wife, <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> <rs type="role">Dr.</rs> &mdash;&mdash;, entered heartily into my plans for the morrow, promising her assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2109"/>My night-round of visits to the sick having been completed, I was soon seated by my own fireside, watching the operation of making and baking a corn hoecake, which, with some smoked beef of my own preparation and a cup of corn-coffee, made my supper on this <dateStruct value="-12-24"><occasion>Christmas eve</occasion></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2110"/>It was so bitterly cold that I did not undress; but, wrapping a blanket around me, lay down on my bunk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2111"/>Tempo also rolled herself up, and lay down before the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2112"/>In order to explain what followed, I must here say that the boards of my floor were only laid, not fastened, as nails were not to be had.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2113"/>Sitting up, I was horrified to see the boards of the floor rising and falling with a terrible noise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2114"/>A moment later I realized the situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2115"/>A party of hogs had organized a raid, having for its object my precious potatoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2119"/>Her angry cries, and the piercing squeals of the hog, roused all in the vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2120"/>Help soon came, our enemies were routed, quiet was restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2121"/>My pones were a great success.

<p>The next few hours were for me fraught with fearful anxiety and uncertainty,&mdash;yes, <hi rend="italics">uncertainty</hi>,&mdash;for (to my shame, let it be recorded) I actually debated in my own mind whether or not to desert these unfortunate boys of <pb id="p.184" n="184"/> mine, who could not themselves escape the threatened danger.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2147"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> helping me, I was able to resist this terrible temptation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2153"/>When not on duty, the loneliness of my cabin was almost insupportable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2154"/>Sometimes I longed to flee away from the dismal monotony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2155"/>Often I sat upon my doorstep almost ready to scream loudly enough to drown the sad music of the pines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2156"/>Since the war I have seen a little poem by <persName n="Cooke,,John,Esten,," id="n0242.0003.00184.00371" reg="default:Cooke,John,Esten,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>Esten</foreName> <surname>Cooke</surname></persName>, which always reminds me of the time when the band in the pines brought such sadness to my own heart:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2214"/>Insidious disease was even then gnawing at his vitals; but, Spartan-like, he folded above the dreadful agony the robe of manly courage and dignity, which hid it from even those who knew him best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2215"/>Amid all the darkness and sorrow his pleasant smile cheered, his commanding presence inspired respect and confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2216"/>From the windows of his soul shone the steady light of the patriotism that hopeth all things, believeth all things, endureth all things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2217"/>It was not <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> will that he should go forth to battle, but with a kindly heart and generous hand he helped the soldiers to do their duty by caring for their <q direct="unspecified">loved ones at home.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2222"/>The spinning and weaving of cloth for the almost naked soldiers in the field went on; the quarters were visited, the sick were cared for. The calm, steady voice read to the old, precious promises, or instructed the young negroes as to the way of truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2270"/>Had the house been her own she might still have resisted, but as she was only a guest, and had been sheltered and most kindly treated, the watch was given up.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2271"/>Even the negro cabins were searched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2272"/>In several instances small sums of money which had been saved up were taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2279"/>His house and gin-house had been burned, his fields laid waste; he had left his young daughters without protection and without shelter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2280"/>What the ladies felt as they saw this sad cavalcade pass out of sight may not be told.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2281"/>Morning dawned upon a scene of desolation, sickening in the extreme,&mdash;ruin, waste, wreck everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2282"/>The house emptied of everything valuable, floors filthy with the prints of muddy feet, the garden ruined, furniture battered and spoiled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2283"/>Outside, broken barrels, boxes, etc., <pb id="p.195" n="195"/> strewed the earth; lard, sugar, flour, meal were mingled together and with the sandy soil; streams of molasses ran down from broken casks; guns which had belonged to the family were broken and splintered and lay where they had been hurled; fences were broken down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2284"/>Had there been any stock left, there was nothing to keep them out of garden or yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2338"/>No historian can faithfully recount the story of the war and leave untouched the record made by Southern women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2339"/>Their patriotism was not the outcome of mere sentiment, but a pure steady flame which from the beginning of the war to the end burned brightly upon the altars of sacrifice, which they set up all over the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2340"/><q direct="unspecified">The power behind the throne</q> never ceased to be felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2342"/>From quiet homes far from the maddening strife, where faithful women toiled and spun, facing and grappling with difficulties, even dangers, never complained of, came bright, cheery letters, unshadowed by the clouds which often hung dense and dark over their daily pathway but glowing with unshaken faith, undaunted patriotism; lofty courage, and more than all pride in the exceptional bravery which <hi rend="italics">they always took for granted</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2343"/>It was my daily business during the war to read and answer letters to sick soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2620"/>It fell to the lot of a non-commissioned officer of <persName n="Carter,Captain,W.,P.,," id="n0242.0003.00223.00468" reg="default:Carter,W.,P.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Carter</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="Battery">Battery</orgName> to prepare the ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2621"/>He <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> cut the fuse for <num value="1">one</num> <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>'s time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2622"/>After preparing several shells and receiving no word from his general he made ready several charges of canister, knowing the enemy to be close at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2623"/>Still nobody came for the ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2624"/>He observed next that the drivers of the limber-chest had dismounted and left their horses, and the horses being without a driver, backed the wheels of the limber over the ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2625"/>To prevent damage, he seized the off-leader by the bridle, turning them back to a front position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2626"/>While doing this, he distinctly heard the minie-balls crashing through the bones <pb id="p.224" n="224"/> of the horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2627"/>They did not fall at once, however, and he had just gotten them to a front position, when a forcible blow upon the right shoulder, made by the enemy's color-bearer with the point of his staff, showed him that they were upon him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2628"/>He had scarcely commenced to run when he felt a heavy blow about the middle of his back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2629"/>His thought was, <q direct="unspecified">Can that color-bearer have repeated his blow, or am I struck by a ball, which has deadened the sense of feeling?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2630"/>There being no flow of blood, however, he concluded he was not much hurt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2631"/>After a run of <measure n="40yards" type="distance">forty yards</measure> he came to the dry bed of a stream between <num value="2">two</num> hills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2632"/>Here he paused to reconnoitre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2633"/>The morning fog and the smoke of battle obscured the view, except close to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2634"/>Crouching on all-fours, he peered below the cloud of smoke toward the crest of the hill where the battery was. He soon saw that the case was hopeless, and the battery in possession of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2635"/>Looking to the left, he read in the anxious countenance of an aide-de-camp on horseback that matters at that point were in a desperate case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2636"/>Running up the bed of the stream, he reached the shelter of the woods on his left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2637"/>So far he had run parallel to the line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2638"/>When well in the woods, turning at right angles, it seemed that he had made his escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2639"/>Meeting just then with an officer of the battery (the only <num value="1">one</num> who escaped) and several comrades, a brief consultation was held, suddenly cut short by a continuous roar of musketry in the rear and near the heel of the <name>Horseshoe</name>, showing that the party were in danger of being enclosed and cut off within the circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2640"/>The consultation was summarily ended, and flight again resumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2641"/>This time they ran well out of the <name>Horseshoe</name> and out of danger, stopping not until they met <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0242.0003.00224.00470" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz-Hugh,,,:1"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s <pb id="p.225" n="225"/> reinforcements going to the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2642"/>Here, from a point of safety, they could hear war holding high revelry in the bottom below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2643"/>Now, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time the soldier took occasion to examine his knapsack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2644"/>A minie-ball had entered the lower part, passing through <num value="16">sixteen</num> folds of tent-cloth, many folds of a blanket, riddling several articles of underwear, and finally burying itself in a small Bible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2645"/>Such was its force that not a leaf from Revelations to Genesis remained without impress of the ball, and half the leaves were actually penetrated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2646"/>Just at this time he was overjoyed to see his brother (about whom he had been painfully anxious) returning to the rear with a company of the <rs>Richmond Howitzers</rs>, who, having spent all their ammunition, came to replenish their chests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2647"/>This young man had been colorbearer of the company, and when the battery <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reached the hill, had turned to the woods on his left to tie his horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2648"/>Hearing a wild yell, which he supposed to be the battle-cry of the <rs>Confederates</rs>, he joined lustily in the shout and rushed forward bearing his colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2649"/>The fog and smoke concealing from him the true state of affairs, it was a terrible shock to see, suddenly, the enemy's color floating from the battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2650"/>Realizing for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time that all was lost, he hastily lowered his flag between the chests of a caisson, and, tearing off the colors, thrust them into his bosom, throwing the staff away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2651"/>He then ran into the woods and up the lines, where he came upon a company of the <rs>Richmond Howitzers</rs>, and served with them until their ammunition was exhausted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2652"/>A remarkable circumstance connected with the above incident was the fact that, during the confusion and haste following the order for the hasty march, the brothers lost sight of each other, and the elder (who bore the flag) was compelled to gallop to the front, leaving the tent-cloth and blankets, which usually were <pb id="p.226" n="226"/> included in the roll behind the saddle, to be carried in the other's knapsack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2653"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thought of the younger was impatience at the unusual burden he had to carry into battle, but reflection brought with it a feeling (perhaps a premonition), <q direct="unspecified">It is all right and perhaps the means of saving my life.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2654"/>In less than half an hour it had proved indeed a blessing in disguise.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2883"/>In the early autumn, on a lovely afternoon, a little girl sat upon the stile which led from a spacious farmyard into a field of newly-mown wheat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2884"/>In her hand she held a long switch, and her business was to watch the motions of a large flock of fowls, which, as is usual at harvest-time, had been kept in their coop all day, and only let out for an hour or <num value="2">two</num>, just before sunset, to run about in the grassy yard, seeking bugs and worms, or other dainties, which they alone know how to find.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2885"/>Of course they could not be allowed in the field before the grain had been safely garnered, so <persName n="Nelly,,,,," id="n0242.0004.00246.00565" reg="mostcommon:Nelly,nomatch:0"><surname>Nelly</surname></persName> had been permitted to mount guard upon the stile, the better to observe and control them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2886"/>She quite felt the importance of the trust, and, holding her switch as proudly as if it had been a sceptre, was eager and quick to discover occasions to use it. Many a staid and demure-looking hen, or saucy, daring young chicken, had stolen quite near to her post, stopping every few moments to peer cautiously around, or to peck at a blade of grass or an imaginary worm, as if quite indifferent to the attractions presented <pb id="p.247" n="247"/> by the field beyond, but just as they had come close to the fence, thinking themselves unnoticed, <persName n="Nelly,,,,," id="n0242.0004.00247.00566" reg="mostcommon:Nelly,nomatch:0"><surname>Nelly</surname></persName> would jump from her perch, and, with a <hi rend="italics">thwack</hi> of the switch, send them squawking back to their companions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2887"/>At length, however, the child seemed to grow weary of her task.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2888"/>Slowly descending to the ground, she walked toward the barn, and, returning with her apron full of corn, opened the door of the chicken-house, and, having enticed her charge within, shut them up for the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2889"/>This done, <persName n="Nelly,,,,," id="n0242.0004.00247.00567" reg="mostcommon:Nelly,nomatch:0"><surname>Nelly</surname></persName> wandered aimlessly about for a while, then, sitting down upon a large stone, which seemed to have been rolled under a tree just to make a nice seat, she looked around in an impatient and discontented manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2890"/>The sights and sounds which surrounded her were very pleasant, and&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> would have imagined&mdash;exceedingly attractive to a child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2891"/>The rays of the declining sun, slanting across the grassy yard, brightened up the low, brown farm-house until the oldfashioned glass door and latticed windows on either side seemed as if brilliantly lighted from within.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2892"/><num value="1">One</num> might easily have imagined it an enchanted castle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2893"/>The mossy roof looked as if gilded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2895"/>On the porch, upon a table scrubbed <q direct="unspecified">white as the driven snow,</q> were set the bright tin pans ready to receive the evening's milk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2897"/>Outside, the creaking wagons were being driven into the barn-yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2899"/>Up the lane came the cow-boy, alternately whistling, singing, and cracking his whip, until at length the drove of <pb id="p.248" n="248"/> sweet-breathed cows stood lowing at the bars, which, at milking-time, would be let down for them to pass each to her own stall.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2901"/>At last she rose, and, crossing the stile, passed rapidly through the wheat-field, climbed a low stone wall and presently came to a green knoll, shaded by a sycamore-tree, commanding a view of the public road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2902"/>Here she stood, eagerly gazing down the road, while seemingly struggling to subdue a sorrow which, however, soon found vent in heart-broken sobs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2903"/>Still searching the road with anxious, tearful eyes, she seemed to hesitate for a while, but at last, after casting many a fearful glance toward the farm-house, the little girl began to descend the high bank, slipping many times, and sadly scratched by the rough gravel and projecting roots of the trees.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2904"/>Having reached the bottom, she did not pause a moment, but drew her light shawl over her head and ran swiftly away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2905"/>And now let us try to discover the cause of all this trouble.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2911"/>The little girl had, ever since she could remember, lived very happily with her parents in their lovely <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2912"/>An only child, she was petted to her heart's content, having scarcely a wish ungratified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2915"/>But after he had gone away she missed him dreadfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2916"/>Her mamma was always so pale and sad that the child also grew anxious, and could no longer enjoy her play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2917"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> letters from the absent soldier cheered them, but as the months passed they ceased to hear at all, except the wild rumors which often frightened and distressed the anxious wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2928"/>A rustic fence, built by her old husband, <q direct="unspecified"><persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Abe</foreName></persName></q> (long since dead), enclosed a small yard, where grew all kinds of bright, gaudy <q direct="unspecified">posies,</q> with here and there a bunch of mint or parsley or sage, and an occasional stalk or <num value="2">two</num> of cabbage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2929"/>Over the little porch were trained morningglories and a flourishing gourd vile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2931"/>The neat fence was now broken down, the bright flowers all trampled and crushed by the feet of men and horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2932"/>Inside also, the once spotless floor was muddy and stained with tobacco, all the old woman's treasures being broken and scattered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2933"/>Amid all this confusion, in the little front room, once the pride of <persName><foreName>Winnie</foreName></persName>'s heart, was carefully placed almost the only thing saved from the burning, an easy-chair, cushioned upon the back and sides, and covered with old-fashioned chintz.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2947"/>Presently she strolled off toward the adjoining cabins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2948"/>These were quite empty, the men-servants having disappeared with the <rs>Federal</rs> soldiers the night before, the women had followed to their camp not far distant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2949"/>Not a living thing was to be seen; even the chickens had disappeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2950"/>The whole scene was very desolate,&mdash;the smoking ruins, the deserted cabin, a cloudy sky.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2953"/>Presently there came riding <pb id="p.252" n="252"/> along a Federal officer on horseback, who, discovering the forlorn child, stopped to speak to her.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3049"/>It seemed to <persName n="Nelly,,,,," id="n0242.0004.00258.00633" reg="mostcommon:Nelly,nomatch:0"><surname>Nelly</surname></persName> that the slight rustle of the leaves under her feet must betray her, and the loud beatings of her heart be heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3050"/>But the boy passed on, and soon his low whistle, as well as the measured beat of the horse's hoofs, grew fainter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3051"/>However, all danger was not over, for just as she was about to venture forth, the panting of some animal <pb id="p.259" n="259"/> startled her. For a moment her terror was extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3052"/>This changed to chagrin and vexation as <persName n="Rover,,,,," id="n0242.0004.00259.00634" reg="mostcommon:Rover,nomatch:0"><surname>Rover</surname></persName>, the farmer's dog, ran to her hiding-place and fawned upon her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3053"/>Now <placeName key="tgn,2101344" n="1.000 5" reg="rover, bedford, tennessee">Rover</placeName> and the little girl had been great friends, and had enjoyed many a romp together, but just then his presence made her very cross; so, seizing a large stick, she beat the poor fellow until he ran yelping away.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3055"/>Having often, in her rides with grandmamma, passed along the same road, she thought she knew the way; but night was approaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3056"/>It appeared to the child that darkness must bring added danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3057"/>Besides, she would soon be missed at the farm, pursued, overtaken, and carried back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3058"/>This dread gave her fresh courage, and again the young traveller walked rapidly on. Before she had gone far, a light wagon overtook her. In its driver she gladly recognized an old man who sometimes supplied her grandmamma with vegetables.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3059"/>He drew up in great astonishment as <persName n="Nelly,,,,," id="n0242.0004.00259.00636" reg="mostcommon:Nelly,nomatch:0"><surname>Nelly</surname></persName> called to him, but at her request allowed her to climb to the seat beside him. As they approached the town, the heart of the runaway began to sink; a sense of her disobedience, and the knowledge that it would add to the grief of her dear mother, and, perhaps, greatly displease grandmamma, oppressed her sorely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3060"/>She decided that she could not face them just then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3061"/>Begging the old man to put her down at the nearest corner, the unhappy little girl approached the house by a back entrance, and, concealed amid the shrubbery, stood trembling and weeping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3075"/></p> 
<p>The mother sank into a chair, her arms instinctively enfolding her naughty child, but she did not kiss or welcome her. Grandmamma, too, looked very grave and troubled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3369"/>The story is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3370"/>It was a dark and starless night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3371"/>Tattoo-beat had long been heard, and <orgName n="Brigade"><persName n="Hay,,,,," id="n0242.0004.00285.00748" reg="mostcommon:Hay,nomatch:0"><surname>Hay</surname></persName>'s Brigade</orgName>, weary after a long day's march, rested beneath the dewy boughs of gigantic <pb id="p.286" n="286"/> oaks in a dense forest near the placid <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3372"/>No sound broke the stillness of the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3373"/>The troops were lying on nature's rude couch, sweetly sleeping, perhaps, little dreaming of the awful dawn which was soon to break upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3374"/>The camp-fires had burned low. The morrow's rations had been hastily cooked, hunger appeased, and the balance laid carefully away; but that which was most essential to life had, unfortunately, been neglected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3375"/>No provision for water had been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3376"/>The springs being somewhat distant from the camp, but few had spirit, after the day's weary march, to go farther.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3377"/>The canteens were, for the most part, empty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3378"/>Though thirsting, the tired soldiers slept, oblivious to their physical sufferings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3379"/>But ere the morning broke, the distant sound of musketry echoed through the woods, rudely dispelling the solemn silence of the night, and awakening from their broken dreams of home and kindred the whole mass of living valor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3380"/>The roll of the drum and the stentorian voice of the gallant chief calling to arms mingled together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3381"/>Aroused to duty, and groping their way through the darkness, the troops sallied forth in battle array.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3382"/>In a rifle-pit, on the brow of a hill overlooking the river, near <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, were men who had exhausted their ammunition in the vain attempt to check the advancing column of <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n0242.0004.00286.00749" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName>'s finely equipped and disciplined army, which was crossing the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3383"/>But owing to the heavy mist which prevailed as the morning broke, little or no execution had been done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3384"/>To the relief of these few came the brigade in double-quick time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3385"/>But no sooner were they intrenched than the firing on the opposite side of the river became terrific, and the constant roaring of musketry and artillery became appalling.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3386"/>Undismayed, however, stood the little band of veterans, pouring volley after volley into the crossing column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3387"/><pb id="p.287" n="287"/></p> 
<p>Soon many soldiers fell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3388"/>Their agonizing cries, as they lay helpless in the trenches, calling most piteously for water, caused many a tear to steal down the cheeks of their comrades in arms, and stout hearts shook in the performance of their duty.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3398"/></p> 
<p>Carefully laying the colors, which he had conspicuously borne on many a field, in the trench, he leaped out in search of water, and was soon, owing to the heavy mist, out of sight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3399"/>Shortly afterwards the firing ceased for a while, and there came a courier with orders to fall back to the main line, a distance of over <measure n="1200yards" type="distance">twelve hundred yards</measure> to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3400"/>It had, doubtless, become evident to <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0242.0004.00287.00750" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz-Hugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> that <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n0242.0004.00287.00751" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName> had crossed the river in sufficient force to advance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3401"/>The retreating column had not proceeded far when it met the noble youth, his canteens all filled with water, returning to the sufferers, who were still lying in the distant trenches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3402"/>The eyes of the soldier-boy, who had oftentimes tenderly and lovingly gazed upon the war-worn and faded flag floating over the ranks, now saw it not. The troops, in their hurry to obey orders and owing, probably, to the heavy mist that surrounded them, had overlooked or forgotten the colors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3403"/>On sped the color-bearer back to the trenches to relieve <pb id="p.288" n="288"/> the thirst of his wounded companions as well as to save the honor of his regiment by rescuing its colors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3404"/>His mission of mercy was soon accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3405"/>The wounded men drank freely, thanked and blessed him. And now to seize the flag and double-quick back to his regiment was the thought and act of a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3406"/>But hardly had he gone <num value="10">ten</num> paces from the ditch when a company of Federal soldiers appeared ascending the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3407"/>The voice of an officer sternly commanded him to <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">Halt</hi> and surrender!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3408"/>The morning sun, piercing with a lurid glare the dense mist, reveals a <num value="100">hundred</num> rifles levelled at his breast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3409"/><num value="1">One</num> moment more and his soul is to pass into eternity, for his answer is, <q direct="unspecified">Never while I hold these colors.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3410"/></p> 
<p>But why is he not fired upon?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3411"/>Why do we still see him with the colors flying above his head, now beyond the reach of rifle-balls, when but a moment before he could have been riddled with bullets?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3412"/>And now, see he enters proudly but breathlessly the ranks, and receives the congratulations of his friends in loud acclaim.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3413"/>The answer comes, because of the generous act of the <rs>Federal</rs> officer in command of that company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3414"/>When this noble officer saw that the love of honor was far dearer to the youth than life, in the impulse of a magnanimous heart he freely gave him both in the word of command,&mdash;</p>

<p>Such nobility of character and such a generous nature as that displayed by this officer, must ever remain a living monument to true greatness; and should these lines perchance meet his eyes, let him know and feel the proud satisfaction that the remembrance of his noble deed is gratefully cherished, and forever engraved in the heart of the soldier-boy in gray.</p></quote> </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3417"/>On a bright <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> Sally sat upon the gallery of her uncle's house slowly swaying backward and forward in a low <rs n="rocking chair" type="product">rocking-chair</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3418"/>In her hand was her prayer-book, but I greatly fear she had not read as she ought, for while her finger was held between the shut covers, marking <q direct="unspecified">the <name>Psalms</name> for the day,</q> her bright eyes wandered continually over the lovely scene before her. Above her head branches of tender green were tossing merrily in the <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> wind, at her feet lay a parterre bright with spring buds and flowers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3419"/>Beyond the garden-fence the carriage-road described a curve, and swept away under the lofty pines which here bounded the view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3420"/>On either side lay fields of newly-planted cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3421"/>Behind the house, seen through the wide-open doors and windows, the orchard gleamed pink and white.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3422"/>Still beyond, blue smoke curled upward from the cabins of the negroes in <q direct="unspecified">the quarter,</q>&mdash;almost a village in itself: The noise of their children at play was borne upon the wind, mingled with the weird chanting of hymns by the older negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3423"/>The family, with the exception of Sally, had gone to church,&mdash;a distance of <measure n="12miles" type="distance">twelve miles</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3424"/>For weeks it had been known that <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Wilson,,,,," id="n0242.0004.00289.00752" reg="mostcommon:Wilson,nomatch:0"><surname>Wilson</surname></persName>'s raiders</q> would be likely at any time to appear; but continued security bad lulled the apprehensions of the planters hereabouts, and, besides, they depended upon Confederate scouts to give timely warning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3425"/>But suddenly on this peaceful <name>Sunday</name> a confused noise from the direction <pb id="p.290" n="290"/> of <q direct="unspecified">the quarter</q> startled Sally, and directly a crowd of frightened negroes ran to the house with the tale that a party of scouts had been driven in, reporting the <rs>Yankees</rs> approaching and only <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> away.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3426"/>The sense of responsibility which at once took possession of the girl's mind overmastered her terror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3427"/>She, as well as a few servants considered worthy of trust, had received clear instructions how to act in such an emergency; but before anything could be accomplished a party of horsemen (Confederates) rode up, and hastily giving information that the <rs>Federals</rs> had taken the <q direct="unspecified"><address><street n="Pleasant Hill road">Pleasant Hill road</street></address>,</q> dashed off again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3428"/>This knowledge did not relieve <persName><foreName>Sally</foreName></persName>'s mind, however, for on the <placeName reg="Pleasant Hill, Cass, Missouri" key="tgn,2060118">Pleasant Hill</placeName> road lay the fine plantation of another uncle, <rs type="role">Dr.</rs>&mdash;&mdash;, who was, she knew, absent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3429"/>The overseer, unaware of the approach of the raiders, would, unless warned, not have time to run off the valuable horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3430"/>By the road the enemy had taken the distance was several miles, but there was a <q direct="unspecified">short cut</q> through the woods, which would bring a rapid rider to the plantation much sooner, and at once it occurred to our heroine to send a boy on the only available animal, an old white mule, which had long enjoyed exemption from all but light work as a reward for faithful services in the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3431"/>Alas! Sally found she had <q direct="unspecified">reckoned without her</q>&mdash;negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3432"/>Abject terror had overcome even the habitual obedience of the servants, and not <num value="1">one</num> would venture; they only rolled their eyes wildly, breaking forth into such agony of protestations that the girl ceased to urge them, and, dismayed at the peril she was powerless to arrest, sat down to consider matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3433"/>She know that the family had that morning driven to church, and so the carriage-horses were safe for the present.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3434"/>But there was the doctor's buggy-horse, a magnificent <pb id="p.291" n="291"/> iron-gray, and Persimmon, her cousin's riding horse, a beautiful cream-colored mare with black, flowing mane and tail, and <hi rend="italics">Green Persimmon</hi>, her colt, which was like its mother, and scarcely less beautiful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3435"/>Besides, there were horses and mules which, if not so ornamental, were indispensable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3436"/>Oh, these must be run off and saved,&mdash;but how?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3437"/>Goaded by these thoughts, and upon the impulse of the moment, the girl ordered a sidesaddle to be put upon old <q direct="unspecified">Whitey,</q> and, hastily mounting, belabored the astonished beast until, yielding to the inevitable, he started off at a smart trot.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3438"/>Once in the woods, <persName><foreName>Sally</foreName></persName>'s heart quailed within her; her terror was extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3439"/>The tramp, tramp of her steed she thought was as loud as thunder, and felt sure that thus she would be betrayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3440"/>The agitation of the underbrush caused by the wind seemed to her to denote the presence of a concealed enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3441"/>She momentarily expected a <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Yank,,,,," id="n0242.0004.00291.00753" reg="mostcommon:Yank,nomatch:0"><surname>Yank</surname></persName></q> to step from behind a tree and seize her bridle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3442"/>As she rushed along, hanging branches (which at another time she would have stooped to avoid) severely scratched her face and dishevelled her hair; but never heeding, she urged on old Whitey until he really seemed to become inspired with the spirit of the occasion, to regain his youthful fire, and so dashed on until at length Sally drew rein at the bars of the <rs n="horse lot" type="product">horse-lot</rs>, where the objects of her solicitude were quietly grazing, with the exception of Green Persimmon, who seemed to be playing a series of undignified capers for the amusement of her elders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3443"/>To catch these was a work of time: Sally looked on in an agony of impatience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3444"/>But, forunately, a neighbor rode up just then with the news that for some unknown reason the <rs>Federal</rs> soldiers had, after halting awhile just beyond the forks of the road, marched back to the river and were recrossing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3445"/>With the usual inconsistency of her sex, <pb id="p.292" n="292"/> Sally now began to cry, trembling so violently that she was fain to dismount, and submit to be <hi rend="italics">coddled</hi> and petted awhile by the old servants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3446"/>She declared that she never could repass those dreadful woods, but later, a sense of duty overcame her nervousness, and (the family having returned), escorted by her cousins and followed by a faithful servant, she returned to her anxious friends, who in <num value="1">one</num> breath scolded her for having dared so great risks and in the next praised her courage and devotion.</p>

<p>His eyes twinkled and looked so pleasant that I knew there was a story on hand, so I told mother and sis' Loo, who promised to find out all about it. After supper that night mother coaxed father to tell us the story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3465"/>But Confederate soldiers' purses were generally as empty as their stomachs, and in this instance the lady of the house did not offer to give away her nice dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3466"/>While the poor fellow was inhaling the enticing odor, and feeling desperately hungry, a girl rode up to the gate on horseback, and bawled out to another girl inside the house,&mdash;</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3470"/>The soldier just then had an idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3478"/>Shall I describe to you this room&mdash;or my suite of rooms?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3479"/>Indeed, I fear you will be disappointed, dear young readers, for perhaps the word <q direct="unspecified">hospital</q> conveys to your mind the idea of a handsome and lofty building containing every convenience for nursing the sick, and for the comfort of attendants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3480"/>Alasduring the war hospital arrangements were of the roughest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3481"/>Frequent changes of location were imperative, transportation was difficult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3482"/>So it became a <q direct="unspecified">military necessity</q> to seize upon such buildings as were suitable in the towns where it was intended to establish a <q direct="unspecified">post.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3483"/>Courthouses, halls, stores, hotels, even churches had to be used,&mdash;the pews being removed and replaced by the rough hospital beds.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3484"/>The <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Buckner Hospital">Buckner Hospital</placeName></q> was expected to accommodate nearly <measure n="1000" type="sick">one thousand sick</measure> and wounded, and embraced every building for <num value="2">two</num> solid squares.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3485"/>Near the centre a small store had been appropriated to the matron's use during the day. Here all business relating to the comfort of the sick and wounded was transacted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3486"/>The store as it stood, shelves, counters, and all, became the <q direct="unspecified">linen-room,</q> and was piled from floor to ceiling with bedding and clean clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3487"/>The back <q direct="unspecified">shed-room</q> was the matron's own. A rough table, planed on the top, stood in the centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3488"/>With the exception of <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.297" n="297"/> large <rs n="rocking chair" type="product">rocking-chair</rs>, kindly donated by a lady of <placeName reg="Ringgold, Catoosa, Georgia" key="tgn,2024062">Ringgold, Georgia</placeName>, boxes served for chairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3489"/>A couch made of boxes and piled with comforts and pillows stood in <num value="1">one</num> corner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3490"/>This served not only as an occasional resting-place for the matron, but, with the arm-chair, was frequently occupied by soldiers who, in the early stages of convalescence, having made a pilgrimage to my room, were too weak to return at once, and so rested awhile.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3491"/>Here I sat on the morning in question looking over some <q direct="unspecified">diet lists,</q> when I heard a slight noise at the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3492"/>Soon a little girl edged her way into the room.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3493"/>Her dress was plain and faded, but when she pushed back the calico sun-bonnet a sweet, bright face appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3494"/>She came forward as shyly as a little bird and stood at my side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3495"/>As I put out my hand to draw her close, she cried, <q direct="unspecified">Don't, you'll scare him!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3496"/></p> 
<p>And then I perceived that she held close to her breast, wrapped in her check apron, something that moved and trembled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3497"/>Carefully the little girl removed a corner of the apron, disclosing the gray head and frightened eyes of a squirrel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3498"/>Said she, <q direct="unspecified">It's Bunny; he's mine; I raised him, and I want to give him to the sick soldiers I <hi rend="italics">Daddy's a soldier</hi>!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3499"/>And as she stated this last fact the sweet face took on a look of pride.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3500"/><q direct="unspecified">What is your name, and how did you get here?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3501"/>I said.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3502"/><q direct="unspecified">My name is <placeName reg="Ca-line">Ca-line</placeName>. <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Jack</foreName></persName>, he brung in a load of truck, and mammy let me come along, an&lsquo; I didn't have nothing to fetch to the poor soldiers but Bunny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3503"/>He's mine,</q> she repeated, as she tenderly covered again the trembling little creature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3504"/>I soon found that she desired to give the squirrel away with her own bands, and did not by any means consider <hi rend="italics">me</hi> a sick soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3505"/>That she should visit the fever-wards was out of the question, so I decided to go with her to a ward <pb id="p.298" n="298"/> where were some wounded men, most of whom were convalescent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3506"/>My own eyes, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3507"/>were so accustomed to the sight of the pale, suffering faces, empty sleeves, and dreadful scars, that I did not dream of the effect it would have upon the child.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3508"/>As we entered she dropped my hand, clinging convulsively to my dress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3509"/>Addressing the soldiers, I said, <q direct="unspecified">Boys, little <placeName reg="Ca-line">Ca-line</placeName> has brought you her pet squirrel; her father is a soldier, she says.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3510"/>But here the poor child broke down utterly; from her pale lips came a cry which brought tears to the eyes of the brave men who surrounded her: <q direct="unspecified">Oh, daddy, daddy; I don't <hi rend="italics">want</hi> you to be a soldier!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3511"/>Oh, lady, <hi rend="italics">will</hi> they do my daddy like this?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3512"/></p> 
<p>Hastily retreating, I led the tortured child to my room, where at last she recovered herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3513"/>I gave her lunch, feeding Bunny with some corn-bread, which he ate, sitting on the table by his little mistress, his bright eyes fixed warily upon me. A knock at the door startled us. The child quickly snatched up her pet and hid him in her apron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3514"/>The visitor proved to be <q direct="unspecified"><persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Jack</foreName></persName>,</q> a white-headed old negro, who had come for <q direct="unspecified">little Missy.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3515"/></p> 
<p>Tears came to my eyes as I watched the struggle which at once began in that brave little heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3516"/>Her streaming eyes and heaving breast showed how hard it was to give up Bunny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3517"/><persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Jack</foreName></persName> was impatient, however, and at last <q direct="unspecified">Missy</q> thrust the squirrel into my hands, saying, sobbingly, <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">Thar</hi>, you keep him to show to &apos;em, but don't let nothina hurt him.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3518"/>I arose and placed Bunny in the deep pocket of an army overcoat that hung by the window, where he cuddled down contentedly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3519"/><placeName reg="Ca-line">Ca-line</placeName> passed out with a lagging step, but in a few moments ran back, and, drawing a box under the window, climbed upon it to peep into the <pb id="p.299" n="299"/> pocket at her pet, who ungratefully growled at being disturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3520"/>She then ran out without a word to me, and I saw her no more.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3521"/>Bunny soon attached himself to me. Creeping into my pocket, he would always accompany me in my rounds through the wards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3522"/>The sick and wounded took the greatest delight in his visits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3523"/>As soon as I entered the door the squirrel would run up on my shoulder; from thence, jumping upon the beds, would proceed to search for the treasures which nearly every patient had saved and hidden for him. His capers were a source of unceasing amusement to his soldier friends,&mdash; I cannot describe to you how great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3524"/>The story of little <placeName reg="Ca-line">Ca-line</placeName>'s self-sacrifice went the rounds among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3525"/>All admired and truly appreciated her heroism and her love for <q direct="unspecified">the poor, sick soldiers.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3526"/></p> 
<p>Bunny lived happily for a long time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3527"/><num value="1">One</num> day, however, as I was passing along the street, he began as usual to run from out my pocket to my shoulder, and back again to nestle in his hiding-place.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3528"/>Just then a large dog came by. The frightened squirrel made a vain attempt to reach a tree by the road-side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3529"/>Failing, he was at once seized and instantly killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3530"/>My regret was shared by all the soldiers, who long remembered and talked of poor Bunny. </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3532"/>He was shivering, and so hoarse that he could only speak in whispers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3533"/>Instead of going at once to bed, however, he sat down upon a bench by the stove, keeping his blanket drawn closely over his chest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3534"/>His teeth were chattering, and continued to do so until I ordered him to go to his bed immediately, meanwhile hastening down-stairs to prepare for him a hot drink.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3535"/>Upon my return, my patient was in bed, closely covered up,&mdash;head and all. As soon as I turned down the bedclothes from his face, I was startled by a furious er-r-r-r bow-wow, wow, wow, which also attracted the attention of every <num value="1">one</num> in the large ward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3536"/>Of course it was impossible longer to conceal the fact that the new patient had brought with him a dog, so he showed me-nestling under his arm&mdash;a young <placeName key="tgn,7005807" n="1.000 179" reg="newfoundland">Newfoundland</placeName> puppy, looking like nothing so much as a fluffy black ball.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3537"/>His bright eyes gleamed fiercely and he continued to bark in a shrill tone, which could not be allowed to continue, as it excited and disturbed the sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3538"/>I am a lover of dogs, and now offered to take charge of this little waif.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3539"/>His master was unwilling to part with him, but there was no alternative, so I carried him off down-stairs, where, installed in comfortable quarters and petted by everybody, the ungrateful little dog seemed to forget the sick <pb id="p.301" n="301"/> master who had cherished him so fondly, and, far from grieving or moping at the separation, grew every day more frolicsome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3540"/>From the soldier I learned the history of his dog. He said,&mdash;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3541"/><q direct="unspecified">Shortly before I was sent to the hospital our regiment captured a Federal camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3542"/>Among the plunder I found that little fellow curled up in a camp-bed that some <name>Yankee</name> had just got out of, and as warm as toast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3543"/>He seemed to take to me right off. I reckon the <rs>Yankee</rs> had a name for him, but I call him <quote><persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0242.0004.00301.00755" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3544"/>The poor fellow has had a hard time since I got him, for rations in the valley are poor and scant, but <hi rend="italics">I've</hi> done with less so <hi rend="italics">he</hi> could have a bite, and I tell you he has kept me warm a many a night.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3545"/></p> 
<p>However, when the soldier was ready to return to camp, <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0242.0004.00301.00756" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> had grown quite too large to be carried in his master's bosom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3546"/>So he was given to my little son, and remained to claim our care and to become an object of interest to all inmates of the hospital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3547"/>It became so much a matter of course for me to take the dog with me on my morning rounds through the wards that whenever he was left behind, my patients never failed to miss him, and to inquire, <q direct="unspecified">Where's the general to-day?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3548"/>He was very intelligent, easily learning to trot quietly along down the rows of beds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3549"/>If he ever grew too frisky, I had only to stop short, pointing to the entrance, when down would drop his tail, and he was off like a shot to the yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3550"/>There he awaited my coming, always looking anxiously in my face to see if I was still angry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3551"/>When I would ask, <q direct="unspecified">Are you sorry, Beau?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3552"/>he would whine and come crawling to my feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3553"/>As soon as he heard me say <q direct="unspecified">All right,</q> he began to bound and run around in a circle and in other ways to show his joy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3554"/>Among the patients he had many warm friends who <pb id="p.302" n="302"/> used to take great pleasure in saving scraps to feed him with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3555"/>They also loved to tease him by wrapping some nice morsel in many papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3556"/>The parcel was then hidden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3558"/>After many attempts to get through the many papers in which lay a coveted morsel, he would grow impatient and disgusted, and would at last sit down, looking earnestly <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> at the inmate of the bed, then at the parcel on the floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3559"/>Then, if he was not helped, he would push the bed with his paw, until at last he succeeded in gaining his wish.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3560"/>Early in the spring Beau fell into some disgrace, for while romping with my little boy be threw him down and broke his arm. Everybody scolded the poor dog, crying shame on him wherever he appeared, until he got a habit of slinking out of sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3561"/>Before the broken arm was quite well, little <persName><foreName>Wally</foreName></persName> grew very ill of typhoid fever, so ill that his papa was sent for, for it seemed that he must die. <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0242.0004.00302.00758" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> attached himself very closely to my husband, rarely leaving his side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3562"/>When his new master returned to camp, I went down to the boat to see him off. The dog followed us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3563"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> letter from my husband announced that the dog had followed his master on the boat, where he must have hidden, for his presence was not discovered until some time after the boat had left the wharf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3564"/>In camp he became a terrible nuisance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3565"/>No matter how securely he was tied, the dog always managed to escape and <hi rend="italics">attend the drill</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3566"/>The shells frequently exploding in the vicinity became a constant terror to this unfortunate, who knew not how to avoid them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3567"/>He soon learned to distinguish the shriek of a coming shell, and would race off in <num value="1">one</num> direction, looking fearfully back over his shoulder, until a similar sound in another quarter would so puzzle and terrify him that he would stand still awhile until the noise of an explosion <hi rend="italics">utterly</hi> demoralized him, when he would frantically dig up the ground, as if trying to bury himself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3568"/>I am afraid I must acknowledge that my dog was not strictly honest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3569"/>In fact, his depredations upon their larders won for him the undying hatred of the colored cooks of various messes, who were always seeking revenge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3570"/>Their dislike culminated <num value="1">one</num> day in a dreadful scalding, inflicted upon the poor dog by the cook of an officers' mess, who poured a whole kettle of boiling water upon his back, causing him weeks of suffering and the loss of part of his beautiful glossy coat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3571"/>This seemed to have implanted in his mind a profound distrust of negroes, which he never ceased to entertain until the day of his death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3572"/>After this <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0242.0004.00303.00760" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> was sent up to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> that I might cure his wound; this I was more easily enabled to do, as my friends among the surgeons kindly advised and assisted me.

When I left <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> with my little boy, Beau accompanied us, and found a permanent home upon the plantation of a relative in <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3573"/>It was here that he <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> showed his extreme dislike for negroes, which attracted attention and became unmistakable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3574"/><pb id="p.304" n="304"/> At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> it gave much trouble, but gradually he grew tolerant of the servants upon the <q direct="unspecified">home-place,</q> although he never took kindly even to these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3575"/>He never forgot that he had been scalded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3576"/>At any time steam arising from a boiling tea-kettle or pot would send him yelping away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3577"/>I remember hearing the youngsters say that once when <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0242.0004.00304.00761" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> had followed them miles into the woods, seeming to enjoy the tramp and the hunt, they having decided to have a lunch of broiled birds, heated some water in a camp-kettle to scald them preparatory to picking off the feathers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3578"/>As soon as the birds were dipped into the water and taken out steaming, the dog set out for home, where they found him, upon their return, hiding under a corn-crib.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3579"/>Although, as I said before, Beau became used to the servants whom he saw every day upon the home-place, no strange negro dared to come inside the big gate unless accompanied by <num value="1">one</num> of the family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3580"/>Whenever the deep, hoarse bark of <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0242.0004.00304.00762" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> announced the appearance of strangers, it was known that the dog must be chained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3581"/>Not once, but many times, I have seen a load of <q direct="unspecified">fodder</q> or <q direct="unspecified">garden-truck</q> driven into the yard and immediately <hi rend="italics">surrounded</hi> by this <num value="1">one</num> big dog, who would keep the black driver crouching at the very top of the load with <q direct="unspecified">ashy</q> face and chattering teeth, while his besieger walked growling around the wagon, occasionally jumping up upon the chance of seizing an unguarded foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3582"/>Until the dog was securely chained nothing would induce his prisoner to venture down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3583"/>No chicken-thieves dared to put in an appearance so long as this faithful beast kept watch upon the premises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3590"/>I have been often and earnestly requested by <q direct="unspecified">my comrades</q> to address to you a few words explanatory of the tie which binds me to them and them to me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3591"/>Having promised to meet their wishes, I must in advance apologize for the egoism which it is quite impossible to avoid, as my own war record is inseparable from that of my comrades.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3595"/>I seem to see them marching, with brave, bright faces and eager feet, to meet the foe. I hear the distant boom of cannon, growing fainter as they press the retreating enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3596"/>And then, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3597"/>many come back to me mutilated, bleeding, dying, yet with ardor unquenched, repressing <pb id="p.307" n="307"/> moans of anguish that they may listen for the shout of victory: wrestling fiercely with the <rs>King</rs> of Terrors, not that they fear to die, but because his chill grasp palsies the arm that would fain strike another blow for the right.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3598"/>I stood among the sick and wounded lying in a hospital in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond, Virginia</placeName>, while the magnificent <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> was passing from the scene of their late glorious victory at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> to meet the invaders under <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0242.0005.00307.00764" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, who were marching upon the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3599"/>Around me lay many sick and wounded men, gathered under the immense roof of a tobacco factory, which covered nearly a whole square.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3600"/>Its windows commanded a full view of the legions passing on both sides.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3601"/>The scene I can never forget.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3602"/>As the strains of martial music fell upon the summer air, pale, gaunt forms struggled to their feet, feebly but eagerly donned clothes and accoutrements, and, staggering under their weight, crept to the office of the surgeon in charge, piteously begging that they might <q direct="unspecified">get to go on with the boys.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3603"/>Many, too weak to rise, broke into bitter sobs: tears poured from eyes bright with fever or dim with the shadow of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3604"/>Passing among these, I was startled to see a patient, whom all had supposed to be dying, sitting up in bed. Stretching his arms toward me, he cried out, <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role2">Lady</rs>, <rs type="role" n="Lady">lady</rs>, come here!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3606"/><pb id="p.308" n="308"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3607"/>I need not mention here the magnificent record of the army that passed that day the streets of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3612"/>On my journey, and while waiting to be assigned to duty, I lingered for a while among the homes of Southern soldiers.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3614"/>Here lay the main-spring of the valor which then and long afterward astonished the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3615"/>In the towns and near the front <num value="1000">thousands</num> of women daily ministered to the sick and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3616"/>When a battle ended, these could soon know the fate of loved ones, perhaps were permitted to nurse them, to attend their dying hour, or&mdash;inestimable privilege&mdash;reclaim the precious casket which had enshrined a gallant soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3617"/>But in many a country home women endured, day after day, crucifixion of the soul, yet heroically, patiently, toiled and prayed on. Startled by flying rumors, tortured by suspense, weary with unwonted labor, they never dreamed of leaving the post of duty or of neglecting the interests confided to their care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3618"/>No comforter had they save their <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, no resource but unwearied prayer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3619"/>Memory brings back to me a scene which sadly illustrates the exalted courage and faith of these noble women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3620"/>I was present <num value="1">one</num> night when, at a plantation <pb id="p.309" n="309"/> home, the family and servants were assembled, as usual, for prayers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3621"/>The aged father led the worship, but, while praying for the absent sons, <num value="2">two</num> of whom had already fallen in battle, he faltered and ceased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3622"/>Instantly the clear, sweet voice of the mother was heard as she prayed fervently, not only for the dear ones at the front, but for the holy cause, for <hi rend="italics">other</hi> parents, <hi rend="italics">other</hi> sons, and for <hi rend="italics">strength</hi> to <hi rend="italics">submit</hi> to <hi rend="italics"><name n="God" type="God">God's</name> will</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3623"/>I have, sitting by the bedside of sick or wounded soldiers, read to them letters from just such homes, breathing lofty courage, full of cheer, although I knew that the hearts of the writers had been almost breaking, the fingers that penned them stiff and trembling with toil hitherto unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3628"/>Heroic souls who bore with equal fortitude and transcendent bravery alike the shock of battle, the pangs of <q direct="unspecified">hope deferred,</q> the untold hardships which soon became their daily portion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3629"/>Their bleeding feet dyed alike the snows of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and the rocky mountain paths of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3630"/>As their ranks were decimated by battle, disease, starvation, death, the hearts that were left swelled higher and higher with holy zeal, sublime courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3631"/>Night after night, with lagging, unwilling feet, they made the hated retreat.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3632"/>Day after day the sun shone on those defiant faces as they presented a still unbroken front and hurled themselves <pb id="p.310" n="310"/> again and again against the invaders, contesting every inch of the land they loved.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3633"/>Ah, the horrors of those latter days, when daily, almost hourly, brought to me ghastly wrecks of manhood, when my ears were always filled with the moans of the dying, or irrepressible agonizing shrieks of those who were undergoing the torture of the surgeon's knife without the blessed aid of chloroform, for that was contraband of war. Do you wonder, then, that I love to call those comrades of mine <q direct="unspecified">my boys</q>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3634"/>Whether they served in the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> or the <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Army of Tennessee</orgName>, they were all alike my comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3635"/>Their precious blood has often dyed my own garments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3636"/>I have gone down with them to the very gates of death, wrestling with the death angel every step of the way, sometimes only to receive their last sighs as they passed into the valley of the shadow,, sometimes permitted to guide their feeble feet once more into the paths of glory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3637"/>I have shared their rations, plain but plentiful at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, at the last only a mouldy crust and a bit of rusty bacon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3638"/>I have been upon an ambulance-train freighted with human agony delayed for hours by rumors of an enemy in ambush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3639"/>I have fed men hungry with the ravening hunger of the wounded with scanty rations of musty corn-bread; have seen them drink eagerly of foetid water, dipped from the road-side ditches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3640"/>Yet they bore it all with supreme patience; fretted and chafed, it is true, but only on account of enforced inactivity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3641"/>I have packed haversacks with marching rations for <measure n="48hours" type="date">forty-eight hours</measure>, a single corn-dodger split and with only a thin slice of bacon between the pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3642"/>This was a <hi rend="italics">Confederate sandwich</hi>. And on such food Southern soldiers marched incredible distances, fought desperate battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3643"/>The world will never cease to wonder <pb id="p.311" n="311"/> at the unfailing devotion, the magnificent courage, the unparalleled achievements of the <rs>Southern</rs> armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3644"/>Scarcely less admirable is the heroic spirit in which they have accepted defeat; the industry which has hidden the desolation of our land with bountiful harvest, the honesty of purpose which now seeks to restore the constitution framed by our forefathers as it was, the patient yet invincible determination which has driven out tyranny and oppression, and reclaimed for posterity this beautiful Southland, rich with historic memories, made sacred and beautiful by the graves of heroes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3645"/>And these are <hi rend="italics">my</hi> boys&mdash;still&mdash;always my boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3646"/>From the highest places of the land they turn to give me a comrade's greeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3647"/>I glory in the renown of these, but just as dear and precious to me is the warm grasp of the toil-hardened hand and the smile which beams upon me from the rugged face of the very humblest of <q direct="unspecified">the boys who wore the gray.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3648"/></p> 
<p>Dear friends, this subject is to me inexhaustible; but I may no longer trespass upon your patience.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3654"/>In congenial companionship the day passed quickly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3655"/>Its close brought us to <placeName reg="Dallas, Paulding, Georgia" key="tgn,2022617">Dallas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3656"/>And here began at once an emotional experience which might well be called <q direct="unspecified">a tempest of the heart,</q>&mdash;glimpses of glory once real.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3657"/><q direct="unspecified">Forms and scenes of long ago</q> appeared in such constant succession that it seemed like a resurrection of the dead and buried past.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3658"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> object that met our view was a large Confederate battle-flag, suspended from a conspicuous building on <num value="1">one</num> of the principal streets, surmounted, surrounded by <q direct="unspecified">star-spangled banners,</q> large and small, but still there, to set our hearts throbbing wildly, to call forth a rain of blinding tears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3659"/>This was but the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3660"/>Borne swiftly onward to the hotel, we momentarily started forward with streaming eyes and bated breath to gaze upon the phantom legions ever passing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3661"/>Squads of cavalry dashed by, manly, weather-beaten boys in gray, and elegant-looking officers wearing the well-remembered slouched hat with cord and feathers, and full Confederate uniforms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3662"/>Infantry and artillery <pb id="p.313" n="313"/> officers and privates thronged the sidewalks, arm in arm, walking in half embrace, or standing with hand grasping hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3663"/>Those not in uniform wore the badges of their respective commands, and frequently some faded remnant of <q direct="unspecified">the gray.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3664"/></p> 
<p>In the large <rs n="dry goods" type="product">dry-goods</rs> establishment of Sauger &amp; Brothers an immense show-window was skilfully and beautifully arranged in honor of the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3665"/>Confederate soldiers (life size), so natural and life-like as to startle <num value="1">one</num>, were grouped around a camp-fire anxiously watching a large kettle containing a temptinglook-ing <q direct="unspecified">mess</q> of green corn, potatoes, other vegetables, and the rations of pork and beef.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3666"/>Blankets neatly rolled and strapped, canteens, haversacks, etc., lay near upon the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3667"/>In the background, a deck of cards and <num value="2">two</num> piles of Confederate money had evidently been thrown down and deserted to <q direct="unspecified">watch the pot.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3668"/>We learned that this most realistic arrangement was the work of a <q direct="unspecified"><name>Yankee</name> boy,</q> whose father had served in the <rs>Federal</rs> army,&mdash;a loving tribute to the people among whom he had come to make his home.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3669"/>Arrived at the hotel, where a crowd of people waited in the parlor to be assigned rooms, we witnessed many a touching scene between veterans who met now after <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3673"/>Then as hand met and grasped hand these strong men would often break into sobs which forbade all speech, while every heart of those who looked on thrilled with responsive feeling.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3674"/>From what I learned of the intended evening festivities at the camp-ground (music and dancing under the glare of the electric light), I felt disinclined to be present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3676"/>On the following morning, <persName><foreName>Amy</foreName></persName> and I, escorted by a gallant <placeName key="tgn,7007523" n="1.000 4898" reg="missouri">Missouri</placeName> veteran, set out for the rendezvous, where we found assembled <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4000">four thousand</num> people, among whom hundreds wearing more or less of the gray were conspicuous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3679"/>In a <num value="100">hundred</num> cool, pleasant nooks were placed casks of ice-water, with dippers and gourds of all sizes attached by long chains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3680"/>If hungry, at <q direct="unspecified">Headquarters</q> requisitions were furnished and duly honored by the commissary, who seemed to have a never-failing supply of delicious barbecued beef and mutton, also generous rations of fresh bread.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3681"/>These were supplemented by elegant refreshments of all kinds, served under shaded tents by ladies, whose entire cordiality made them charming hostesses.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3683"/><num value="1">One</num> of these (Gauche Brothers, of <placeName reg="Dallas, Paulding, Georgia" key="tgn,2022617">Dallas</placeName>) was of rare excellence, rendering <q direct="unspecified">Bonnie Blue Flag,</q> <q direct="unspecified">Dixie,</q> and an exquisite nocturne, <q direct="unspecified">The Soldier's Dream</q> (composed for this occasion by the leader of this band), with so much expression and skill as to elicit great applause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3684"/>The speaker's stand was beautifully ornamented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3685"/>Hanging on either side of the rostrum was a Confederate battle-flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3686"/>Above them, in the centre, floated a new and very handsome <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> banner in graceful undulations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3690"/>sacred emblems of a cause so loved, so nobly defended, yet, alas, lost shattered and torn by shot and shell, begrimed with the smoke of battle, deeply stained with precious blood; as the summer breeze dallied with their ragged folds, they seemed to stir with a feeble, mournful motion, like the slow throbbing of a breaking heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3691"/>Pictures illustrating camp-life, battle scenes, etc., ornamented the stand, which was also decorated plentifully with <rs type="color">red</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs>, with a sufficient admixture of blue to make <num value="1">one</num> remember to be loyal to the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3692"/>The attempt to depict camp-life, cannon, camp-fires, tents, stacked guns, sentries, etc., was utterly upset by the presence of hundreds of ladies and children, with the inevitable paraphernalia necessary to their comfort.
