<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>I was riding by his side, and soon after we entered the woods, with the division following, we came upon a thicket, mostly pine, so thick that the darkness was almost impenetrable.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>I remember well that I kept my hands before my eyes, which were really of no use to me at that time, to protect them, and that more than once I was nearly dragged off my horse by the trees with which I came in contact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>The camp fires in our front seemed to us to be considerably below the plane of our position, as they were in fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>Shortly afterwards I was fully instructed as to all the details; that there was a crew of men already in charge of the balloon, who understood the management of it, as to the inflating, letting it ascend and drawing it down again by means of the rope which was attached to it (which passed around a windlass), and I was also instructed in the signals that I should make when up in the balloon, by means of a wig-wag flag, to tell those below what was wanted, whether I wished to go fast or slow, up or down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>I was also given such information as was at hand as to the supposed position of the enemy, and was instructed to carefully note where each different arm of the service (infantry, artilery, and cavelry) was located, and I was further told to make a memorandum or map of all that I saw while up in the balloon, so as to be able to give the best and most accurate account of all I saw when I returned&mdash;provided of course, that I returned at all.</p></quote> </p></div2>

<p>The balloon party were located behind a large thicket of pine trees about <placeName><distance reg="0.5mile">a half mile</distance> back of the <rs>Confederate</rs></placeName> lines, with a view of allowing the balloon to reach a considerable elevation before it could be seen by the enemy, who would, of course, fire at it in the hope of destroying it. As I had seen some artillery service, I was quite well aware that after attaining a certain height the ordinary field cannon could not be trained to bear upon me, so that the danger zone was only between the time I appeared above the top of the trees and the time when I should have reached such an elevation that their guns could no longer be trained upon me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>However, I determined to make best of a bad bargain, and went to the balloon <pb id="p.36" n="36"/> camp to study the situation and my new duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>I was not left long in suspense, for the next day I received an order from <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0291.0014.00036.00422" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> to make my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ascension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>The balloon was anchored to a long rope, probably <num value="0.5">a half</num> of a mile long, which was tied to a tree and then coiled in a great number of coils, sailor fashion, on the ground, and then passed around a windlass, and was finally attached to a number of cords coming down from the balloon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>From this cone of cords hung a good-sized hamper, or basket in which I was to stand or kneel and make my observations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>It did not take a very long time (in fact, it was accomplished much too quickly for my liking) to fill the balloon with hot air, for a plentiful supply of pine knots and turpentine had been made (to create a great heat under a flue, the end of which opened into the balloon),so that very soon I was told that my aerial horse was ready for me to mount and ride away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>Therefore, with note book and pencil in my pocket, and a heart beneath it beating very furiously (although of course I put on a brave front to those about me), I stepped into the basket and gave the signal to rise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>As you may readily imagine, I did not feel very happy or comfortable; on the contrary, I was scared nearly breathless, and was exceedingly nervous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>I at once gave the signal, <quote>faster,</quote> and the balloon went upward more rapidly, and before long I reached an elevation above the line of fire, when I again signalled them to stop, and squatting down in the hamper, I tried to collect my thoughts and breathe more freely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>I therefore took out my note-book and made a rough diagram showing the rivers, the roads and creeks, and marking where the different bodies of the enemy's troops were upon this little map, using the initial <quote>I</quote> for infantry, <quote>C</quote> for cavalry, <quote>A</quote> for artillery, and <quote>W</quote> for wagon trains, and I marked down about the number of troops that I estimated at each point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>Now, this was not such an easy thing to do, as we may at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> suppose, for the various currents of air made my balloon spin and revolve like a top (only very much slower), so that I must needs wait for a whole revolution to occur before I completed my sketch of any particular spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>I therefore gave the signal, <quote>faster&mdash;faster,</quote> and the men at the windlass put forth their best efforts, working in relays, and as fast as they could.

<p></p> 
<p>A few nights later I made another, and, I am glad to say, my last ascension, which came near being my last trip in anything; but I shall proceed to narrate that occurrence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/><num value="1">One</num> night, just before the body fell back from <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> and fought the <rs n="Battle of Williamsburg" type="battle">battle of Williamsburg</rs> (which was the <dateStruct value="1862-05-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>), the balloon squad was waked up <num value="1">one</num> night with orders from <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0291.0014.00038.00428" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> to fire up the balloon and make a reconnoisance as soon as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>The courier who brought the order informed me privately that information had been received at headquarters from some of the scouts that the enemy was in motion <pb id="p.39" n="39"/> and that <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0291.0014.00039.00429" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> was very anxious to ascertain in what direction the move was to be made, and whether their troops were advancing upon more than <num value="1">one</num> point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>It was at this time near the full moon and the nights were as bright, almost as day. As soon, therefore, as the balloon was inflated I jumped into my basket, feeling quite at ease, as I had already made <num value="2">two</num> ascensions, and as this was to be a night trip, I had but little fear of discovery and of being fired on, especially as the enemy were now in motion, and when marching could not so well arrange for this artillery service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>But there was a still greater danger upon which I had never calculated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>The Confederate troops, almost to a man, had never seen a balloon, and each time that I went up they crowded around the balloon squad to watch this novel performance, and amused themselves by making many and varied remarks, which were not very complimentary upon the whole business and myself in particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>On this occasion the balloon, shining in the bright firelight, attracted a larger crowd than usual, and the crew in charge had great difficulty in keeping them back out of their way, so they could properly perform their work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>I therefore entered the basket and gave the signal to rise, feeling, as I have said, unusually comfortable, and I had ascended about <measure n="200feet" type="distance">two hundred feet</measure> when, all at once, without any warning, the balloon was jerked upward as if by some great force for about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>, so it seemed to me. I was breathless and gasping, and trembling like a leaf from fear without knowing what had happened beyond the surmise that the rope which held me to the earth had broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>What had actually occurred I afterwards found was this: <num value="1">One</num> of the soldiers who was drawn by curiosity to see the balloon ascend had crowded, with the others, too near, and had unwittingly stepped into the coil of rope, <num value="1">one</num> end of which was attached to the balloon, which, before he could step out again, tightened around his leg and began pulling him up to the windlass, whereupon he screamed loudly, and <num value="1">one</num> of his friends seized an axe and cut the rope, releasing him, but also releasing me. Now, there I was, feeling as if I was a couple of miles up in the air, absolutely helpless, with no idea of how to manage my runaway steed, and with every prospect that I would eventually very reluctantly land in the enemy's lines, which meant a long term of imprisonment, or else that my balloon would come down in the <rs type="place">Chesapeake Bay</rs>, with no means of my regaining the shore, which perhaps meant being <pb id="p.40" n="40"/> drowned, but which I much preferred to the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>These thoughts were not of a very consoling nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/><num value="1">One</num> thing I knew was that when the heat died out of the balloon I must make a graceful descent; but as to where I should land I could not even guess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>To say that I was frightened but faintly expresses it, for the almost instantaneous ascent I had made had not only taken all the breath out of my body, but seemed also to have deprived me of all my nerve and courage for the time being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>However, after a while I recovered my breath and found, upon careful examination, that my heart was beating much as usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>The balloon had now reached its equilibrium, and was apparently standing quietly (for there was little air stirring) over the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>, and I was looking down to where, far below me, lay the <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York river</placeName> and the surrounding country which I knew so well.</p></quote> </p></div2>

<p>I was not long left to enjoy the beauties of this scene, for the wind freshened up, and, to my utmost dismay, I found myself being blown from the <rs>Confederate</rs> lines over into those of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>It is impossible to describe my feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>I felt that I was not only leaving my home and friends forever, but was slowly drifting to certain capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>Imagine, therefore, my great delight when, after drifting along for some distance, the wind veered and I was blown back toward the <rs>Confederate</rs> lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>(This ascension had been made from a point back of <placeName reg="Dam 2">Dam No. 2</placeName>, i. e., <placeName reg="Wynn's Mill">Wynn's Mill</placeName>, on the <rs>Confederate</rs> lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>It was evident that the balloon was cooling and settling, so that I was getting nearer and nearer to the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>This was in many respects a great comfort, but it was not unalloyed with new dangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>As I have said, the balloon having now drawn near the earth (a few <measure n="100feet" type="distance">hundred feet</measure> above it I suppose) I was blown from the enemy's lines over the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>, but, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>in a far different locality from where I had ascended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>Therefore, when my balloon passed over the spot where <orgName type="regiment" key="2FLRegiment"><persName n="Ward,Colonel,,,," id="n0291.0014.00040.00430" reg="mostcommon:Ward,Tobe,,,:2"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Ward</surname></persName>'s Second Florida Regiment</orgName> was encamped, they turned out en masse, and believing me to be a Yankee spy, followed me on foot, firing at me as fast as they could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>In vain I cried to them that I was a good Confederate; the only answer I received was from the whistling of their bullets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>I was as a thing haunted, and knew not which way to turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>However, the wind freshened again, and I was <pb id="p.41" n="41"/> blown out over <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York river</placeName>, which, although half a mile wide at <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, is <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> wide where I was now suspended in the air.

<p>I, therefore, began to undress, preparatory to my long swim, but I regret to record that being a young man I was what is termed <quote>somewhat dressy,</quote> and I had on a pair of very tight fitting boots, which, do what I might, I found impossible to pull off, and after tugging and scuffling in every conceivable position that my cramped quarters in the basket would permit, and still being unable to rid myself of those accursed boots (which were not long since my joy and pride.) I fortunately remembered my pocket knife, and had soon ripped them down the back and joyfully dropped them over the edge of my basket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>The balloon was now so near the river that I could hear my rope splashing in the water as it dragged along over the surface and I was waiting to begin my swim at any moment when the wind again changed and blew me towards the <rs>Williamsburg</rs> shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>This was, indeed, luck of the greatest kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>After travelling a short distance inland, my balloon, by this time having settled nearly to the ground, I slipped over the side of the basket and sliding down the rope safely, joyfully stood once more on my native heath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>I had landed in an orchard, and running with my rope, as the balloon passed over an apple tree, I twisted it quickly about the tree trunk, and after a few ineffectual flops, my balloon sank, exhausted to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>What remains to be told can be related in a few words.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>I dressed myself as quickly as possible and made my way to a neighboring farm house, where, after quite a hot discussion with the farmer, I succeeded in securing a horse and rode back to <placeName><persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0291.0014.00041.00431" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s Headquarters</placeName>, a distance of about <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles</measure>, and made my report as to my experience and as to what I had seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>On this trip my balloon had (so far as I can judge) made a halt moon circuit of about <measure n="15miles" type="distance">fifteen miles</measure>, about <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> of which was over <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York River</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1290"/>The writer has not sufficiently studied the above book to warrant his attempting an exhaustive review, even if he were competent for the work, and space admitted of it, but still he would like to call attention to some points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1291"/>Great wars come seldom, perhaps to nations, but when they do come they make or mar the welfare of countless generations, and, whether coming sooner or later, they do come to all peoples, and therefore it is that the subject is of interest to all thinking men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1292"/>In his book the author does not enter into the political questions involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1293"/>Our war to him is merely a military contest viewed from a purely military standpoint, but while he admires with a soldier's instinct the fine fighting qualities and endurance of the <rs>American</rs> soldier on both sides, yet he cannot help thrilling with enthusiasm when recounting the matchless heroism of the <rs type="role" reg="regimental-Officer">regimental officers</rs> and men of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>, the high ability of the prominent generals, and above all the supreme genius of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0291.0019.00079.01106" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:16"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>. He is not a convert to the pessimistic theory, because the population and material resources of the <rs>South</rs> were less than those of the <rs>North</rs>, therefore the success of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> was from the outset hopeless, but on the contrary, believes that it was on the point of final attainment on several battlefields through the superiority of Southern generals over their opponents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1294"/>Well may he hold these views, for the magnificent resistance so long sustained by a handful of <persName n="Boers,,,,," id="n0291.0019.00079.01107" reg="mostcommon:Boers,nomatch:0"><surname>Boers</surname></persName> and the recent successes of <placeName key="tgn,1000120" n="1.000 78" reg="nihon">Japan</placeName> furnish convincing proof&mdash;if more <pb id="p.80" n="80"/> were needed, for history is full of it&mdash;that brains, education and pluck are of more avail in war than mere numbers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1295"/>Studying the subject only in his closet, necessarily without practical experience in war&mdash;for <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> has had none of any consequence since the <name>Crimean</name>&mdash;it is but natural that the author should have fallen into some errors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1298"/>The recoil of the hammer was vastly more destructive than the blow.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1299"/>In estimating the numerical strength of the opposed armies, and their losses in battle, <persName n="Battine,Captain,,,," id="n0291.0019.00080.01111" reg="nearbymention:Battine,Cecil,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Battine</surname></persName> certainly often errs, making the odds against the <rs>Confederates</rs> less than they in fact were, and their losses greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1300"/>For instance, at <placeName reg="Cold Harbor">Cold Harbor</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1864-06-"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, he puts down the <rs>Federal</rs> losses at <num value="7000">seven thousand</num> and the <rs>Confederate</rs> at <num value="4000">four</num> to <num value="5000">five thousand</num>, but in point of fact <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0291.0019.00080.01112" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s casualties reached to about <num value="14000">fourteen thousand</num> and <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0291.0019.00080.01113" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:16"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s did not exceed <num value="1400">fourteen hundred</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1301"/>Thus ended in bloody defeat for the <rs>Federals</rs> the <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure> <q direct="unspecified">Overland campaign,</q> the total losses of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> being about <num value="64000">sixty-four thousand</num>&mdash;about equal to or greater than <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0291.0019.00080.01114" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:16"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s entire army at the commencement of the campaign&mdash;and those of the <rs>Confederates</rs> not over <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of this number.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1302"/>It may seem an easy matter to the theorist to approximate to numbers engaged and losses sustained, and it is easy to do so theoretically, but not practically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1303"/>The official figures cannot in this respect be relied upon, not necessarily because they are intentionally doctored, but because the data from which they are derived are necessarily unreliable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1304"/>The only way by which it can be known how many men are present for duty each day is by the morning reports, but in an active campaign, such as that of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, <time>morning</time> reports may not he, and very often are not, made out for days together&mdash;for there are far more urgent matters to attend to&mdash;and, when made out, are frequently lost or captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1305"/>When Federal recruits were being daily poured in by <num value="1000">thousands</num> to strengthen depleted regiments, these accounts, too, necessarily become very mixed up, or altogether lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1306"/>There is no time for book-keeping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1307"/>In examing monthly and tri-monthly reports of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> of the <pb id="p.81" n="81"/> Potomac, these facts will often be found confessed on the record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1308"/>On the other hand, it was, of course, the cue of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> to make the best possible showing of strength by figures, and if you believed the accounts of Confederate prisoners, you would have come to the conclusion that the <rs>South</rs> had a population to recruit from as large as that of <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 120" reg="zhonghua">China</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1310"/>The war was fought on both sides, as far as infantry was concerned, with the muzzleloader rifle musket and minie ball, which the author thinks had an accurate range of only <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure>, and was not effective at over <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards</measure>, but, as a matter of fact, the range was nearly <num value="4">four</num> times as great, the accuracy satisfactory, where the weapon was decently clean, and the killing power infinitely more fearful than that of modern rifles, because of the size and shape of the bullet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1311"/>Moreover the rough nature of the ground where fighting took place invariably forbade mounted charges in mass, and rifle fire in the open would usually render them impossible, or suicidal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1312"/>All that could be accomplished by shock-tactics was effected against cavalry and small bodies of infantry, but the magnificent fighting qualities of the cavalry (developed by <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n0291.0019.00081.01117" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,nomatch:0"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Forrest,,,,," id="n0291.0019.00081.01118" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0"><surname>Forrest</surname></persName>, and not by <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0291.0019.00081.01119" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,:4"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, as the author supposes), were displayed as dismounted riflemen, where they equalled infantry in deadly work and staying-power and were enabled to excel them in mobility and dash by means of their horses.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1699"/>Comrades, is it all a dream?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1700"/>Sometimes to me and doubtless sometimes to you, absorbed and environed as we are by the present, the war seems a mystical and mysterious thing, and we feel that its reality is in some way slipping from us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1701"/>It is on account of this tendency to lose the reality and meaning of the great war that I have dwelt on this part of my theme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1704"/>The personal reminisence of the war which I next most value and cherish is the feeling with which we made that memorable charge at <placeName key="tgn,2489907" n="1.000 10" reg="malvern hill, charles city, virginia">Malvern Hill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1729"/>On arrival our regiment was detached from the brigade to guard a strategic point and did not rejoin it until after the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1730"/>From <time value="10am">10 A. M.</time> to <time value="5pm">5 P. M.</time> we lay exposed to the shells of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1731"/>At this hour we were sent for and conducted to a deep wooded ravine which ran along the very edge of the open field on which the enemy had made a stand, and where they had planted many batteries and massed a great body of infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1732"/>When we took our position in the ravine we found that <persName n="Magruder,General,,,," id="n0291.0024.00116.01423" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,John,Bankhead,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Magruder</surname></persName> was there in command with a considerable force, all lying down in successive lines on the steep sloping side of the ravine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1734"/>The day was fast declining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1735"/>The deep shade of the majestic trees with which the valley was filled and the smoke of the enemy's guns brought on twilight dimness before the close of day. As we lay in close rank, we marked the flash of exploding shells that kissed the brow of the ravine and lit it up with a weird light, while the incessant firing of the massed batteries filled the air with constant roar and deafening crash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1736"/>At <num value="1">one</num> time, as the sun approached the horizon, the air seemed to change; it gained a new elasticity&mdash;a clear ring, so that from the sound of the enemy's artillery you would have thought that they were approaching nearer to us. <persName n="Magruder,General,,,," id="n0291.0024.00116.01431" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,John,Bankhead,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Magruder</surname></persName> must have also thought so, for he gave direction that some men should ascend the brow of the hill and see if the enemy were advancing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1737"/>The enemy had not and were not advancing, but from an elevation in the open field they poured from their batteries a living fire and a constant flow of shells.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1738"/>The scene was solemn and grandly inspiring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1739"/>We felt that the very genius of battle was astir, and the martial spirit was thoroughly aroused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1740"/>All waited with impatience for the order to charge&mdash;that order which whenever given either fires the heart or pales the face of the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1741"/>At last <persName n="Magruder,,,,," id="n0291.0024.00116.01432" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,John,Bankhead,,:3"><surname>Magruder</surname></persName> gives the order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1746"/>Danger seemed to be banished from every bosom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1747"/>Victory and glory absorbed every other feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1748"/>We rushed on and forward to within a short distance of the crown of the hill on which the enemy was massed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1749"/>On us was concentrated the shell and cannister of many cannon and the fire of compact masses of infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1750"/>It was murderous and a useless waste of life to go further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/>Our regiment was halted and it took position in line with other troops which had preceded us in the charge along and under the slope of the field, and here held its ground until the morning disclosed that the enemy had left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1752"/>This gallant charge immortalized the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA9">Ninth Virginia</orgName> and gave it a fame which it was its pride ever after to maintain in all the great battles in which it was engaged.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1753"/>On this charge there came to me a new experience&mdash;a common experience on the battlefield&mdash;that of being wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1754"/>When our regiment had taken its position just described by moving to the right, I found myself on its extreme left standing up on an open field in the face of the enemy a short distance off with a storm of shot and shell literally filling the air. I remember as I stood there I looked upon the enemy with great admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1755"/>They were enveloped in the smoke of their guns and had a shadowy appearance, yet I could easily discern their cross belts, and I watched them go through the regular process of loading and firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1756"/>They seemed to be firing with as much steadiness and regularity as if on dress parade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1757"/>It was a grand sight and I was impressed with their courage and discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/>I had not then learned the wisdom and duty of a soldier to seek all allowable protection from danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>I had a foolish pride to be and to appear fearless&mdash;as if it were a shame to seem to do anything to avoid danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>I remember that immediately on my right a soldier had sheltered himself behind a low stump.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>While silently approving his conduct in this respect yet apprehending he might only shelter himself, I said to him, <q direct="unspecified">Do not fail to fire on the enemy.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/>I had scarcely uttered these words when I heard and felt that sounding thud of the minie ball which became so familiar to our soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/>My left arm fell to my side and the blood streamed from my throat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>I staggered and would have fallen had not <num value="2">two</num> members of the <rs>Old Dominion Guard</rs> stepped quickly up and caught me and bore me <pb id="p.118" n="118"/> off the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1765"/>I was shot through the throat, through the shoulder and through the arm. And I to-day wear <num value="6">six</num> scars from wounds then received, scars more prized by me than all the ribbons and jewelled decorations of the kingly grant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1767"/>It was in these words which I have ever since borne freshly in memory: <q direct="unspecified">Tell my friends at home that I did my duty.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2551"/>From experiment I learned to improve on the plain old method, as I think, by employing a decoction of red-oak bark added to the water, which acted as a disinfectant, and by its stimulating and astringent properties promoted the healing process.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2553"/>When emollients were indicated, I used slippery elm and wahoo root bark, and solution of common salt often helped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2554"/>In case of great pain I employed poppy heads, nightshade and stramonium.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2555"/>I had a number of cases of intermittent fever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2556"/>I would give strong boneset tea, warm, until free vomiting was produced, and as a substitute for quinine I used, during the intermission, butterfly root or pleurisy root tea, which would nearly always shorten the febrile stage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2557"/>Remittent or bilious fevers were treated much the same way, except that I invariably gave good doses of mandrake tea in the febrile stage.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2560"/>Mayapple root or peach-tree leaves made into a strong tea and drank warm would act on the bowels as certainly as senna; but with children where too much tea is not desirable, I often gave beefs feet oil, hog's feet oil, or even lard heated with syrup.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2561"/>In cases of pneumonia, pleurisy, catarrhal fevers, etc., I made local applications of mustard seed or leaves, stramonium leaves, hickory leaves, pepper, etc., warm, and gave alternately butterflyroot and sanguinaria, and continued to slightly nauseating, from <pb id="p.168" n="168"/> day to day (no need of anything else).

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2564"/> Female complaints gave me some trouble, but I soon learned the use of the black haw, squaw-weed, partridge berry, etc. I had been taught in the use of old text-books that opiates in large doses would control some cases of threatened abortion, when the patient had not lost too much from hemorrhage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2565"/>I found that the black haw root tea would absolutely stop this tendency, not only in cases where there was but little hemorrhage, but where large quantities had passed, and would relieve the most severe cases of dysmenorrhoea, especially when combined with squaw-weed, partridge berry or red shank.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2567"/>In ordinary looseness of the bowels or diarrhea, I gave an infusion of raspberry leaves or whortleberry leaves (both of which act finely on the kidneys and bladder). Where there was nausea or sick stomach, a handful of peach leaves steeped in water and drank will settle it, or what is perhaps better, the kernel of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> seeds cracked and cold water drank off of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2568"/>If stronger astringent is necessary, the inner bark of red oak, blackberry or dewberry root tea, or red shank root, are sure remedies.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2569"/>Agrimony tea, and, as a last resort, the nut-gall or ink-ball made into what, from its color, I called black wash (made by squeezing the juice out and adding a little copperas). This black wash is not only a splendid ink, but is a destroyer of syphilitic sores, warts, corns, ringworm, and old ulcers and excrescences of nearly every kind, much superior to lime water and calomel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2570"/>Weakened properly, it is good in obstinate bowel diseases, and can be used as an injection in gonorrhea, gleet, etc. Silk weed root put in whiskey <pb id="p.169" n="169"/> and drank, giving at the same time pills of rosin from the pine tree, with very small pieces of blue vitrol will cure obstinate cases of gonorrhae, and is a substitute for copaiba, cubebs, etc.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3464"/>At the end of <orgName type="company" n="Company A">Company A</orgName> an umbrella was stretched over the prostrate form of <persName n="L'Etondal,Captain,Jules,,," id="n0291.0030.00229.03135" reg="default:L'Etondal,Jules,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>Jules</foreName> <surname>L'Etondal</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3465"/>Soon the notice of the enemy's artillery was attracted by the umbrella, and they began aiming their <name type="weapon">Napoleon guns</name> at that portion of the regiment, and the balls began to strike in dangerous proximity to it, and to the brave men near it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3468"/>When we were ordered to move forward, the captain, with his <measure n="250l." type="pounds"><num value="250">two hundred and fifty</num> pounds</measure> of avoirdupois, streaming with perspiration, continued to hold aloft his umbrella.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3471"/>Wonderful to relate, the countenance of the <rs>General</rs> was unchanged, so far as we could see.
