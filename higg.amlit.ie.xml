<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>This book is based upon a course of lectures delivered during <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> of <dateStruct value="1903--"><year reg="1903">1903</year></dateStruct> before the <orgName n="Lowell Institute" type="institute">Lowell Institute</orgName> in <placeName key="tgn,7013445" n="1.000 14" reg="boston, suffolk, massachusetts">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Their essential plan was that of concentrating attention on leading figures, instead of burdening the memory with a great many minor names and data.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Various hearers, including some teachers of literature, took pains to express their approval of this plan, and to suggest that the material might profitably be cast into book form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>This necessarily meant a good deal of revision of a kind which the lecturer did not care to undertake; and he was able to secure the cooperation of a younger associate, to whom has fallen the task of modifying and supplementing the original text, so far as either process was necessary in order to make a complete and consecutive, though still brief, narrative of the course of American <pb id="p.-003" n="-003"/> use as a text-book has been supplied in an appendix, and is believed to be adequate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>It should be said further that the personal reminiscences, and, in general, all passages in which the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> person singular is employed, are taken over bodily from the original lectures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Elsewhere the authorship of the book as it stands is a composite, but, it is hoped, not confused affair.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Acknowledgments are due to <persName n="Longmans,Mister,,,," id="n0198.0001.00003.00001" reg="mostcommon:Longmans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Longmans</surname></persName> (of <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> and New York), who have permitted the use of some passages from <title>Short studies of American authors</title>, and to <persName n="Harper,Mister,,,," id="n0198.0001.00003.00002" reg="mostcommon:Harper,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Harper</surname></persName> and Brothers, who consented to similar extracts from a work published by them, entitled <title>Book and heart</title> (New York and <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, <dateStruct value="1899--"><year reg="1899">1899</year></dateStruct>), both these books being by the senior author of this work. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>When <persName n="Shakespeare,,,,," id="n0198.0002.00001.00003" reg="mostcommon:Shakespeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakespeare</surname></persName>'s Slender in <quote>The Merry wives of <persName n="Windsor,,,,," id="n0198.0002.00001.00004" reg="mostcommon:Windsor,nomatch:0"><surname>Windsor</surname></persName></quote> claims that his <persName><roleName n="Cousin">cousin</roleName> <foreName>Shallow</foreName></persName> is a gentleman born, and may write himself <hi rend="italics">armigero</hi>, he adds proudly, <quote>All his successors, gone before him, have done it, and all his ancestors that come after him may.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Slender really builded better than he knew; probably most of the applications at the <rs type="place">Heralds' College</rs> in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, or at the offices of heraldic engravers in New York, are based on the principle he laid down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Its most triumphant application is that recorded by <persName n="Stuart,,Gilbert,,," id="n0198.0002.00001.00005" reg="default:Stuart,Gilbert,,,"><foreName>Gilbert</foreName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>While he was in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> the painter had a call from an Irishman who had become, through some lucky speculation, the possessor of a castle, and who appealed to <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0198.0002.00001.00006" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Gilbert,,,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> to provide him <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> with a family portrait gallery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/><persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0198.0002.00002.00007" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Gilbert,,,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> naturally supposed that there were miniatures or pictures of some kind which he might follow, but on arriving at the castle he found there was nothing of the sort.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/><quote> Then how am I to paint your ancestors, if you have no ancestors?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>he asked in some indignation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/><quote>Nothing is easier,</quote> said the <name>Irishman</name>; <quote>you have only to paint me the ancestors that I ought to have had.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The proposal struck <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0198.0002.00002.00008" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Gilbert,,,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>'s sense of humor, and he went to work, soon producing a series of knights in armor, judges in bushy wigs, and fine ladies with nosegays and lambs, to the perfect satisfaction of his patron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Here was Slender's fine conception literally carried out; the ancestors came afterward because their enterprising successor had gone before.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Something like this method has been employed by many chroniclers of American literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Perceiving that <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> has produced much that is creditable during the past century, they have set about finding a direct American pedigree for it. Yet they would readily agree that almost nothing which has attained permanent fame was written <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> before the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century; and they would not deny that, so far as its form, at least, is concerned, most of our later literature confesses an English ancestry.</p></div2> 
<div2 id="c.2.2" type="section" n="c.2.2"> 
<head>Americanism.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>But if the spirit of those older writers, the writers of the <num value="17" type="ordinal">seventeenth</num> and <num value="18" type="ordinal">eighteenth</num> centuries, was American, what does the form of their writing matter?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The answer to this question depends upon what we mean by Americanism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Until the very outbreak of the <name>Revolution</name> there were few persons in the <rs>American</rs> colonies who were not, in sentiment as well as in mental inheritance, <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0198.0002.00003.00009" reg="nearbymention:English,Elizabethan,,,"><surname>English</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/><placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 7" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was <quote>home</quote> to them, as it is now to the <orgName n="British Canadian" type="newspaper">British Canadian</orgName> or Australian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Circumstances were of course bringing about a gradual divergence in manners and in special sympathies between the colonist of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> or <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and the <name>Englishman</name> of <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Even the shock of the <name>Revolution</name> could, so far as literature was concerned, only hasten that divergence of type &mdash; not transform it into a difference of type.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>To this day, indeed, the course of that divergence has been so slow that we still find <persName n="Howells,Mister,,,," id="n0198.0002.00003.00010" reg="mostcommon:Howells,W.,D.,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Howells</surname></persName> uttering the opinion, not quite justly, that American literature is merely <quote>a condition of <name>English</name> literature.</quote>

<head>American literature.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It would be a remarkable fact if <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> had, in so short a time, created an altogether new and distinct type of literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>What <persName n="Ames,,Fisher,,," id="n0198.0002.00004.00011" reg="default:Ames,Fisher,,,"><foreName>Fisher</foreName> <surname>Ames</surname></persName> said nearly a century ago is still true : <quote>It is no reproach to the genius of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, if it does not produce ordinarily such men as were deemed the prodigies of the ancient world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Nature has provided for the propagation of men &mdash; giants are rare; and it is forbidden by her laws that there should be races of them.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Probably no more wholesome service can now be done to the elementary study of the literature of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> than by directing it toward the sane and cheerful recognition of the close relation which has always existed between American writing and English writing; and toward a careful weighing of the <rs>American</rs> authors in whom we properly take pride, upon the same scales which have served us in determining the value of <name>British</name> authors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>With such ends in view, the present book will attempt, not to be a literary history of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, but simply to give a connected account of the pure literature which has been produced by <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0198.0002.00004.00012" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It will not assume to be in any sense a minute literary cyclopedia <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> of this work, but will rather attempt to select, as time selects, the best or representative names of each period in its course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The intrinsic literary importance of these writers will be considered, rather than their merely historical importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Many minor names, therefore, which might properly be included in a summary of respectable books hitherto produced in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> are here omitted altogether; and others are given such minor mention as their literary merit appears to warrant.</p></div2> 
<div2 id="c.2.4" type="section" n="c.2.4"> 
<head>Pure literature.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>But it is time, you may say, to define more specifically what literature is. No definition of it ever yet given has surpassed that magnificent Latin sentence of <persName n="Bacon,,,,," id="n0198.0002.00005.00013" reg="mostcommon:Bacon,nomatch:0"><surname>Bacon</surname></persName>'s which <num value="1">one</num> marvels never to have seen quoted among the too scanty evidences that he wrote the works attributed to <persName n="Shakespeare,,,,," id="n0198.0002.00005.00014" reg="mostcommon:Shakespeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakespeare</surname></persName> :--<quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>All else is reason</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>(or reasoning) and history (or narrative). <pb id="p.6" n="6"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Where does literature find its source?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Not in thought or feeling alone, else we should look to the cradle for our literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Not even in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impulses of speech; the cradle supplies those, and so, in maturer life, do the street, the railway, the shop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Mere language is not a deliberate creation, but begins in an impulse; and those who, like <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0198.0002.00006.00016" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,:4"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName>, have excelled in its use have long since admitted that language, as such, is the product of the people at large, not of the student.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>But the word <quote>literature</quote> implies that another step has been taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Language is but the instrument of literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Literature involves not merely impulse, but structure; it goes beyond the word and reaches <quote>the perfection and precision of the instantaneous line.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Its foundation is thought, but it goes farther and seeks to utter thought in continuous and symmetrical form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>We must pass beyond the vivid phrase to the vivid line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Thought, emotion, the instinct toward expression &mdash; the whole personality of the man and his skill as an artist &mdash; must work together in perfect adjustment, in order to gain this end. Very few men are both strong and skillful enough for this; and that is why, <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> out of the great mass of written and printed matter which the world produces, so little is worth preserving in the treasury of pure literature.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>In proceeding with our account of American literature, then, we shall try to keep ourselves within the boundary here set. We shall find occasion from time to time to suggest the historical importance of an author or a book, but the final judgment on them will be based upon their relation to literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Such an account may properly begin with a consideration of the germs or fragments of pure literature which were produced in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> before, with <persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n0198.0002.00007.00017" reg="nearbymention:Franklin,Benjamin,,,"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName>, what we may now more properly call American Literature began.</p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1626"/>That he has fully escaped this peril is due to the fact that his method went, after all, deeper than he admitted: he was not merely a good-natured observer, like Geoffrey Crayon, Gentleman, but he had theories and purposes, something to protest against, and something to assert.</p>
