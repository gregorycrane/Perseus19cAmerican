<head>Preface.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>The following historical narrative of the events preceding the late rebellion was prepared soon after its outbreak, substantially in the present form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>It may be asked, Why, then, was it not published at an earlier period?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>The answer is, that the publication was delayed to avoid the possible imputation, unjust as this would have been, that any portion of it was intended to embarrass <persName n="Lincoln,,M.,,," id="n0244.0001.00002.00001" reg="default:Lincoln,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s administration in the vigorous prosecution of pending hostilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>The author deemed it far better to suffer,temporary injustice than to expose himself to such a charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>He never doubted the successful event of the war, even during its most gloomy periods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Having drawn his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> breath soon after the adoption of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> and the <rs>Union</rs> which it established, and having been an eye-witness of the blessed effects of these, in securing liberty and prosperity at home, and in presenting an example to the oppressed of other lands, he felt an abiding conviction that the <rs>American</rs> people would never suffer the <name>Great Charter</name> of their rights to be destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>To the <rs>Constitution</rs>, as interpreted by its framers, he has ever been devoted, believing that the specific <pb id="p.-003" n="-003"/> powers which it confers on the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, notwithstanding the experience of the last dreary years, are sufficient for almost every possible emergency, whether in peace or in war. He, therefore, claims the merit &mdash; if merit it be simply to do <num value="1">one</num>'s duty &mdash; that whilst in the exercise of Executive functions, he never violated any of its provisions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>It may be observed that no extensive and formidable rebellion of an intelligent people against an established Government has ever arisen without a long train of previous and subsidiary causes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>A principal object of the author, therefore, is to present to the reader a historical sketch of the antecedents ending in the late rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>In performing this task, the eye naturally fixes itself, as the starting point, upon the existence of domestic slavery in the <rs>South</rs>, recognized and protected as this was by the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>We shall not inquire whether its patriotic and enlightened framers acted with wise foresight in yielding their sanction to &mdash; an institution which is in itself a great social evil, though they considered this was necessary to avoid the still greater calamity of dissolving the <rs>Convention</rs> without the formation of our <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The narrative will prove that the original and conspiring causes of all our future troubles are to be found in the long, active, and persistent hostility of the <rs>Northern Abolitionists</rs>, both in and out of Congress, against Southern slavery, until the final triumph of their cause in the election of <persName n="Lncoln,President,,,," id="n0244.0001.00003.00002" reg="mostcommon:Lncoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lncoln</surname></persName>; and on the other hand, the corresponding antagonism and violence with which the advocates of slavery resisted these efforts, and vindicated its preservation and extension up till the period of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>So excited were the parties, that had they <pb id="p.-004" n="-004"/> intended to furnish material to inflame the passions of tie <num value="1">one</num> against the other, they could not have more effectually succeeded than they did by their mutual criminations and recriminations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The struggle continued without intermission for more than the quarter of a century, except within the brief interval between the passage of the <name>Compromise</name> measures of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> and the repeal of the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs> in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, during which the hostile feelings of the parties were greatly allayed, and hopes were entertained that the strife might finally subside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>These peaceful prospects, it will appear, were soon blasted by the repeal of this Compromise, and the struggle was then renewed with more bitterness than ever until the final catastrophe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Many grievous errors were committed by both parties from the beginning, but the most fatal of them all was the secession of the cotton States.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The authorities cited in the work will show that <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n0244.0001.00004.00003" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> never failed, upon all suitable occasions, to warn his countrymen of the approaching danger, and to advise them of the proper means to avert it. Both before and after he became <rs type="role2">President</rs> be was an earnest advocate of compromise between the parties to save the <rs>Union</rs>, but Congress disregarded his recommendations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Even after he had, in his messages, exposed the dangerous condition of public affairs, and when it had become morally certain that all his efforts to avoid the civil war would be frustrated by agencies far beyond his control, they persistently refused to pass any measures enabling him or his successor to execute the laws against armed resistance, or to defend the country against approaching rebellion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The book concludes by a notice of the successful domestic <pb id="p.-005" n="-005"/> and foreign policy of the administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>In the portion of it concerning our relations with the <rs>Mexican Republic</rs>, a history of the origin and nature of <quote>the <rs>Monroe</rs> doctrine</quote> is appropriately included:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It has been the author's intention, in the following pages, to, verify every statement of fact by a documentary or other authentic reference, and thus save the reader, as far as may be possible, from reliance on individual memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>From the use of private correspondence he has resolutely abstained.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>that the <rs>Constitution</rs> does not confer upon Congress power to interfere with slavery in the <name>States</name>, has been admitted by all parties and confirmed by all judicial decisions ever since the origin of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>This doctrine was emphatically recognized by the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> in the days of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0244.0002.00009.00008" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> session of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Congress,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Hence, it became necessary for the abolitionists, in order to furnish a pretext for their assaults on Southern slavery, to appeal to a law higher than the <rs>Constitution</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Slavery, according to them, was a grievous sin against <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and therefore no human Constitution could rightfully shield it from destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It was sinful to live in a political confederacy which tolerated slavery in any of the <name>States</name> composing it; and if this could not be eradicated, it would become a sacred <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> duty for the free States to separate from their guilty associates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>This doctrine of the higher law was preached from the pulpits and disseminated in numerous publications throughout <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>At the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, it was regarded with contempt as the work of misguided fanatics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Ere long, however, it enlisted numerous and enthusiastic partisans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>These were animated with indomitable zeal in a cause they deemed so holy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>They constituted the movement party, and went ahead; because, whether from timidity or secret sympathy, the conservative masses failed in the beginning to resist its progress in an active and determined spirit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The anti-slavery party in its career never stopped to reflect that slavery was a domestic institution, exclusively under the control of the sovereign States where it existed; and therefore, if sinful in itself, it was certainly not the sin of the people of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>With equal justice might conscience have impelled citizens of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> to agitate for the suppression of slavery in <placeName reg="Brasil, South America, " key="tgn,1000047">Brazil</placeName> as in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>In both cases they were destitute of all rightful power over the subject.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The Constitution having granted to Congress no power over slavery in the <name>States</name>, the abolitionists were obliged to resort to indirect means outside of the <rs>Constitution</rs> to accomplish their object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The most powerful of these was anti-slavery agitation: agitation for the double purpose of increasing the number of their partisans at home, and of exciting a spirit of discontent and resistance among the slaves of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>This agitation was conducted by numerous anti-slavery societies scattered over the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It was a new and important feature of their organization that women were admitted as members.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Sensitive and enthusiastic in their nature against wrong, and believing slavery to be a mortal sin, they soon became public speakers, in spite of the injunctions of an inspired apostle; and their harangues were quite as violent and extreme as those of their fathers, husbands, and brothers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Their influence as mothers was thus secured and directed to the education of the rising generation in anti-slavery principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Never was an organization planned and conducted with greater skill and foresight for the eventual accomplishment of its object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/><pb id="p.11" n="11"/></p> 
<p>The <orgName n="New England Anti Slavery Society" type="society">New England Anti-Slavery Society</orgName> was organized in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> on <dateStruct value="1832-01-30"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg="30">30th</day>, <year reg="1832">1832</year></dateStruct>; that of New York in <dateStruct value="1833-10-"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1833">1833</year></dateStruct>; and the <orgName n="National Society" type="society">National Society</orgName> was organized in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1833-12-"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1833">1833</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Affiliated societies soon became numerous.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>After the formation of the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> society the agitation against Southern slavery proceeded with redoubled vigor, and this under the auspices of <name>British</name> emissaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/><num value="1">One</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and most pernicious effects of these proceedings was to arrest the natural progress of emancipation under legitimate State authority.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>When this agitation commenced, the subject of such emancipation was freely discussed in the <rs>South</rs>, and especially in the grain-growing border States, and had enlisted numerous and powerful advocates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>In these States the institution had become unprofitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>According to the witty and eccentric Virginian, <persName n="Randolph,Mister,,,," id="n0244.0002.00011.00009" reg="nearbymention:Randolph,George,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Randolph</surname></persName>, if the slave did not soon run away from the master, the master would run away from the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Besides, at this period nobody loved slavery for its own sake.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Many of the leading men, both the principal newspapers, and probably a majority of the people sustained the policy and justice of emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Numerous petitions in its favor were presented to the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName>. <persName n="Randolph,Mister,Jefferson,,," id="n0244.0002.00011.00012" reg="default:Randolph,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Randolph</surname></persName>, a worthy grandson of <persName n="Jefferson,President,,,," id="n0244.0002.00011.00013" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, and a delegate from <num value="1">one</num> of the largest slaveholding counties of the commonwealth (<persName n="Albemarle,,,,," id="n0244.0002.00011.00014" reg="mostcommon:Albemarle,nomatch:0"><surname>Albemarle</surname></persName>), brought forward a bill in the <rs type="place">House</rs> to accomplish the object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>This was fully and freely discussed, and was advocated by many prominent members.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Not a voice was raised throughout the debate in favor of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Unfortunately, at this moment the anti-slavery agitation in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> began to assume an alarming aspect for the peace and security of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>In consequence, they denounced it as a foreign and dangerous interference with rights which the <rs>Constitution</rs> had left exclusively under their own control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>An immediate and powerful reaction against emancipation by State authority was the result, and this good cause, to which so many able and patriotic Southern men had been devoted, was sacrificed.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>He added, so great had been the revulsion of public sentiment in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 15" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, that no member of that body would now dare to propose such a measure.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Through its agency, at an early period, they scattered throughout the slaveholding States pamphlets, newspapers, and pictorial representations of an incendiary character, calculated to arouse the savage passions of the slaves to servile insurrection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>They prayed for the abolition of slavery in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, and in the forts, magazines, arsenals, and dockyards of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> within the slaveholding States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>They also protested against the admission of any new slaveholding State into the <rs>Union</rs>, and some of them went even so far as to petition for a dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs> itself</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>These petitions were signed by hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of men, women, and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>In them slavery was denounced as a national sin and a national disgrace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Every epithet was employed <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> calculated to arouse the indignation of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>The time of Congress was wasted in violent debates on the subject of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>In these it would be difficult to determine which of the opposing parties was guilty of the greatest excess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Whilst the <rs>South</rs> threatened disunion unless the agitation should cease, the <rs>North</rs> treated such threats with derision and defiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>It became manifest to every reflecting man that <num value="2">two</num> geographical parties, the <num value="1">one</num> embracing the people north and the other those south of <placeName reg="Mason, Hillsborough, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2063592">Mason</placeName> and <placeName reg="Dixon, Lee, Illinois" key="tgn,2027503">Dixon</placeName>'s line, were in rapid process of formation&mdash;an event so much dreaded by the <rs>Father</rs> of his Country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>It is easy to imagine the effect of this agitation upon the proud, sensitive, and excitable people of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/><num value="1">One</num> extreme naturally begets another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Among the latter there sprung up a party as fanatical in advocating slavery as were the abolitionists of the <rs>North</rs> in denouncing it. At the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and for a long time, this party was small in numbers, and found it difficult to excite the masses to support its extreme views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>These Southern fanatics, instead of admitting slavery to be an evil in itself, pronounced it to be a great good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Instead of admitting that it had been reluctantly recognized by the <rs>Constitution</rs> as an overruling political necessity, they extolled it as the surest support of freedom among the white race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>If the fanatics of the <rs>North</rs> denounced slavery as evil and only evil, and that continually, the fanatics of the <rs>South</rs> upheld it as fraught with blessings to the slave as well as to his master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Far different was the estimation in which it was held by Southern patriots and statesmen both before and for many years after the adoption of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>These looked forward hopefully to the day when, with safety both to the <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs> race, it might be abolished by the people of the slaveholding States themselves, who alone possessed the power.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>It even went so far as to clothe the master himself <q direct="unspecified">with full <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> authority, in every State of the <rs>Union</rs>, to seize arid recapture his slave, wherever he can do it without a breach of the peace or any illegal violence.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>After these strong affirmations it becomes necessary to state the reason why this decision became the occasion of increased anti-slavery agitation.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>At the date of its passage no doubt was entertained of the power of Congress to direct this duty to be performed by appropriate State authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>From the small number of Federal judges in each State, and their distance from each other, the masters, in almost every instance, resorted to the magistrate of the <q direct="unspecified">county, city, or town corporate,</q> where the slave had been arrested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>Before him the necessary proof was made, and, upon being satisfied, he granted a certificate to the master, which was a sufficient warrant under the law <q direct="unspecified">for removing the said fugitive from labor to the <rs>State</rs> or Territory from which he or she fled.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>These State magistrates were familiar to the people of the respective localities, and their duties were performed in a satisfactory manner, and with but little complaint or commotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>This continued to be the practice until the opinion of the <rs type="place">Court</rs> in the case of Prigg was pronounced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>In this it was decided that State magistrates were not bound to perform these duties; and the question whether they would do so or not, was left entirely to their own discretion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>It was thus rendered competent for State Legislatures to prohibit their own functionaries from aiding in the execution of the <rs>Fugitive Slave Act</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>Then commenced a furious agitation against the execution of this so-called <q direct="unspecified">sinful and inhuman</q> law. State magistrates were prevailed upon by the abolitionists to refuse their agency in carrying it into effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>The Legislatures of several States, in conformity with this decision, passed laws prohibiting these magistrates and other State officials from assisting in its execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>The use of the <rs>State</rs> jails was denied for the safekeep-ing of the fugitives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>Personal Liberty Bills were passed, interposing <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> insurmountable obstacles to the recovery of slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>Every means which ingenuity could devise was put in operation to render the law a dead letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>Indeed, the excitement against it rose so high that the life and liberty of the master who pursued his fugitive slave into a free State were placed in imminent peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>For this he was often imprisoned, and, in some instances, murdered.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>The Fugitive Slave Law, although passed under the administration of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0244.0002.00017.00026" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> for the purpose of carrying into effect a plain, clear, and mandatory provision of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, was set at naught.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>And this was done in the face of a well-known historical fact, that without such a provision the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself never could have existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>Without this law the slaveholder would have had no remedy to enforce his Constitutional right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>There would have been no security for his property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>If the slave, by simply escaping across a State line, could make himself free, the guarantees of the <rs>Constitution</rs> in favor of the master would be effectually abolished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>These very guarantees were rendered practically of little or no avail, by the decision of the <rs type="place">Court</rs> in the case of Prigg <hi rend="italics">vs</hi>. <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, declaring that the <rs>Congress</rs> of <dateStruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></dateStruct> had violated the <rs>Constitution</rs> by requiring State magistrates to aid in executing the law.</p>

<p>On the question of repeal, a long and angry debate arose in both Houses of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>This consumed a large portion of tie session, and exasperated the contending parties to a degree never before witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>The opponents of the bill openly and violently predicted imminent danger to the peace of the <rs>Union</rs> from its passage, whilst its advocates treated any such danger with proud and indignant disdain.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/></p> 
<p>It is impossible to conceive how it could be inferred that the <name>Compromise</name> of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, on the question of slavery in the territories.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>After a careful review of the history of the anti-slavery party, from its origin, the candid inquirer must admit that up till this period it had acted on the aggressive against the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>From the beginning it had kept the citizens of the slaveholding States in constant irritation, as well as serious apprehension for their domestic peace and security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>They were the assailed party, and had been far more sinned against than sinning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>It is true, they had denounced their assailants with extreme rancor and many threats; but had done nothing more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>In sustaining the repeal of the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>, however, the <rs>Senators</rs> and Representatives of the <rs>Southern States</rs> became the aggressors themselves, and thereby placed the country in an alarming and dangerous condition from which it has never since been rescued.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>The repeal of the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs> having entirely removed the interdict against slavery in all our territories north of <num value="36">36</num>&deg; <num value="30">30</num>&prime;, the struggle immediately commenced in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> between the anti-slavery and pro-slavery parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>On this theatre the extreme men of both sections were brought into mortal conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>Each party hurried emigrants to the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>;&mdash;the <num value="1">one</num> intent upon making it a free, the other, though in violation of the laws of climate, upon making it a slave State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>The <num value="1">one</num> strenuously contended that slavery, under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, was local in its character and confined to the <name>States</name> where it existed; and, therefore, if an emigrant passed into the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> with his slaves, these became instantly free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>The other maintained, with equal zeal, that slaves were recognized as property by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and consequently their masters had a right to take them to <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> and hold them there, under its guarantees, like <pb id="p.29" n="29"/> any other property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Besides, the <rs>South</rs> insisted that without this right the equality of the <name>States</name> within their common territory was destroyed, and they would be degraded from the rank of equals to that of inferiors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>It was not long until a fierce and vindictive war arose in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> between the opposing parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>In this, scenes of bloodshed and rapine were enacted by both parties, disgraceful to the <rs>American</rs> character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>It is not our purpose to recapitulate these sad events.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Whilst the pro-slavery party in the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> sustained the <rs>Government</rs> in all its branches which had been established over it by Congress, the anti-slavery party repudiated it. They contended that frauds and violence had been committed in the election of members to the <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> sufficient to render its enactments a nullity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>For this reason they had held a Convention at <placeName key="tgn,7013945" n="1.000 16" reg="topeka, shawnee, kansas">Topeka</placeName>, had framed a State Constitution, had elected their own Governor and Legislature to take the place of those in the actual administration of. the <rs>Territorial Government</rs>, and had applied to Congress for admission into the <rs>Union</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Such were the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> bitter fruits of repealing the <rs>Missouri</rs> interdict against slavery north of <num value="36">36</num>&deg; <num value="30">30</num>&prime;, and thus opening the <placeName key="possibilities=14" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Territory of Kansas</placeName> to the admission of slaves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>It cannot be doubted that frauds and violence had been committed in this election; but whether sufficient to render it a nullity was a question for Congress to decide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>After a long and violent struggle, Congress had decided this question by finally rejecting the application for the admission of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> as a State into the <rs>Union</rs> under the <rs>Topeka Constitution</rs>, and by recognizing the authority of the <rs>Territorial Government</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>Such was the condition of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> when <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n0244.0003.00029.00055" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> entered upon the duties of the <rs type="place">Presidential office</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>All these proceedings had taken place during the session of Congress (<dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">7</year></dateStruct>) which terminated immediately before his inauguration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>It will be admitted that he possessed no power to go behind the action of Congress and adjudge it to be null and void.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>They could no longer expect ever to be admitted as a State under the <rs>Topeka Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>The <num value="34" type="ordinal">thirty-fourth</num> Congress had just expired, having recognized the legal existence of the <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> in a variety of forms which need not be enumerated.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>It is quite true that a controversy had previously arisen respecting the validity of the election of members of the <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> and of the laws passed by them; but at the time I entered upon my official duties Congress had recognized this Legislature in different forms and by different enactments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>In fact, I found the government of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> as well established as that of any other Territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Under these circumstances, what was my duty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Was it not to sustain this government?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>The people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> have, then, <quote>in their own way,</quote> and in strict accordance with the organic act, framed a constitution and State Government; have submitted the all-important question of slavery to the people, and have elected a governor, a member to represent them in Congress, members of the <orgName n="State Legislature" type="legislature">State Legislature</orgName>, and other State officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>They now ask admission into the <rs>Union</rs> under this constitution, which is republican in its form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>It is for Congress to decide whether they will admit or reject the <rs>State</rs> which has thus been created.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>For my own part, I am decidedly in favor of its admission, and thus terminating the <rs>Kansas</rs> question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>This will carry out the great principle of non-intervention recognized and sanctioned by the organic act, which declares in express language in favor of non-intervention by Congress with slavery in the <name>States</name> or Territories, leaving <quote>the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>In this manner, by localizing the question of slavery and confining it to the people whom it immediately concerned, every patriot anxiously expected that this question would be banished from the halls of Congress, where it has always exerted a baneful influence throughout the whole country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>If Congress, for the sake of those men who refused to vote for delegates to the convention when they might have excluded slavery from the constitution, and who afterwards refused to vote on the <dateStruct value="-12-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> last, when they might, as they claim, have stricken slavery from the constitution, should now reject the <rs>State</rs> because slavery remains in the constitution, it is manifest that the agitation on this dangerous subject will be renewed in a more alarming form than it has ever yet assumed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>As a question of expediency, after the right [of admission] has been maintained, it may be wise to reflect upon the benefits <pb id="p.43" n="43"/> to <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> and to the whole country which would result from its immediate admission into the <rs>Union</rs>, as well as the disasters which may follow its rejection.. Domestic peace will be the happy consequence of its admission, and that fine Territory, which has hitherto been torn by dissensions, will rapidly increase in population and wealth, and speedily realize the blessings and the comforts which follow in the train of agricultural and mechanical industry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>The people will then be sovereign, and can regulate their own affairs in their own way. If a majority of them desire to abolish domestic slavery within the <rs>State</rs>, there is no other possible mode by which this can be effected so speedily as by prompt admission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>The will of the majority is supreme and irresistible when expressed in an orderly and lawful manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>They can make and unmake constitutions at pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>It would be absurd to say that they can impose fetters upon their own power which they cannot afterwards remove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>If they could do this, they might tie their own hands for a <num value="100">hundred</num> as well as for <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>. These are fundamental principles of American freedom, and are recognized, I believe, in some form or other, by every State constitution; and if Congress, in the act of admission, should think proper to recognize them, I can perceive no objection to such a course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>This has been done emphatically in the constitution of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>It declares in the <rs n="Bill of Rights" type="document">bill of rights</rs> that all political power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority and instituted for their benefit, and therefore they have at all times an inalienable and indefeasible right to alter, reform, or abolish their form of government in such manner as they may think proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>The great <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">State of New York</placeName> is at this moment governed under a constitution framed and established in direct opposition to the mode prescribed by the previous constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>The Legislature already elected may, at its very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> session, submit the question to a vote of the people whether they will or will not have a convention to amend their <pb id="p.44" n="44"/> constitution, and adopt all necessary means for giving effect to the popular will.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>Every patriot in the country had indulged the hope that the <rs>Kansas</rs> and Nebraska Act would put a final end to the slavery agitation, at least in Congress, which had for more than <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> convulsed the country and endangered the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>This act involved great and fundamental principles, and if fairly carried into effect will settle the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>Should the agitation be again revived, should the people of the sister States be again estranged from each other with more than their former bitterness, this will arise from a cause, so far as the interests of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> are concerned, more trifling and insignificant than has ever stirred the elements of a great people into commotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>To the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, the only practical difference between admission or rejection depends simply upon the fact whether they can themselves more speedily change the present constitution if it does not accord with the will of the majority, or frame a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> constitution to be submitted to Congress hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>Even if this were a question of mere expediency, and not of right, the small difference of time, <num value="1">one</num> way or the other, is of not the least importance, when contrasted with the evils which must necessarily result to the whole country from a revival of the slavery agitation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>In considering this question, it should never be forgotten that, in proportion to its insignificance, let the decision be what it may, so far as it may affect the few <num value="1000">thousand</num> inhabitants of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> who have from the beginning resisted the constitution and the laws, for this very reason the rejection of the constitution will be so much the more keenly felt by the people of <num value="14">fourteen</num> of the <name>States</name> of this Union, where slavery is recognized under the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>It established the following propositions: <pb id="p.49" n="49"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/><num value="1">1</num>. Congress has power to acquire territory, <q direct="unspecified">to be held by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> until it is in a suitable condition to become a State upon an equal footing with the other States.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/></p>

This territory is <q direct="unspecified">acquired by the <rs>General Government</rs>, as the representative and trustee of the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and it must therefore be held in that character for their common and equal benefit; for it was the people of the several States, acting through their agent and representative, the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, who in fact acquired the territory in question, and the <rs>Government</rs> holds it for their common use, until it shall be associated with the other States as a member of the confederacy.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/></p> 
<p><num value="3">3</num>. Until that time should arrive, it was the duty of Congress to establish a government over the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>, <q direct="unspecified">best suited for the protection and security of the citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and other inhabitants who might be authorized to take up their abode there.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/></p> 
<p><num value="4">4</num>. But <q direct="unspecified">the territory being a part of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, the <rs>Government</rs> and the citizen both enter it under the authority of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, with their respective rights defined and marked out; and the <rs>Federal Government</rs> can exercise no power over his person or property beyond what that instrument confers, nor lawfully deny any right which it has reserved.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/></p> 
<p><num value="5">5</num>. The Federal Government possesses no power to violate the rights of property within such Territory, because these <q direct="unspecified">are united with the rights of persons, and placed on the same ground by the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> amendment to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, which provides that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/><q direct="unspecified">And the powers over persons and property of which we speak, are not only not granted to Congress, but are in express terms denied, and they are forbidden to exercise them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>And this prohibition is not confined to the <name>States</name>, but the words are general, and extend to the whole Territory over which the <rs>Constitution</rs> gives it power to legislate, including those portions of it remaining under Territorial Government, as well as that covered by States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>It is a total absence of power everywhere within the dominion of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and places the citizens of a Territory, as far as these rights are concerned, <pb id="p.50" n="50"/> on the same footing with citizens of the <name>States</name>, and guards them as firmly and plainly against any inroads which the <rs>General Government</rs> might attempt, under the plea of implied or incidental powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>And if Congress itself cannot do this&mdash;if it is beyond the powers conferred on the <rs>Federal Government</rs>&mdash;it will be admitted, we presume, that it could not authorize a territorial Government to exercise them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>It could confer no power on any local Government, established by its authority, to violate the provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/></p> 
<p><num value="6">6</num>. <q direct="unspecified">It seems, however, to be supposed, that there is a difference between property in a slave and other property, and that different rules may be applied to it in expounding the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/><q direct="unspecified">Now, as we have already said in an earlier part of this opinion, on a different point, the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>The right to traffic in it, like an ordinary article of merchandise and property, was guaranteed to the citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, in every State that might desire it, for <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>. And the <rs>Government</rs> in express terms is pledged to protect it in all future time, if the slave escapes from his owner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>This is done in plain words&mdash;too plain to be misunderstood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>And no word can be found in the <rs>Constitution</rs> which gives Congress a greater power over slave property, or which entitles property of that kind to less protection than property of any other description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>The only power conferred is the power coupled with the duty of guarding and protecting the owner in his rights.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">Upon these considerations it is the opinion of the <rs type="place">Court</rs> that the <name>Act</name> of Congress which prohibited a citizen from holding and owning property of this kind in the territory of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> north of the line therein mentioned [the <placeName reg="Missouri Compromise">Missouri Compromise</placeName> line], is not warranted by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and is therefore void.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/></p> 
<p>This decision, so full and explicit, established the right of the master to take his slaves into the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> and hold them there in despite of all convicting Congressional or Territorial legislation, until the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> should be prepared to assume the position of States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/><pb id="p.51" n="51"/></p> 
<p>It might have been expected that this decision would have superseded all opposing political platforms, and ended the controversy in regard to slavery in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>This expectation, notwithstanding, soon proved to be a delusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>Instead of yielding it obedience, its correctness and binding effect were instantly resisted by the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>They denounced and repudiated it in every possible form from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> moment, and continued to maintain, in opposition to its express terms, that it was not only the right but the duty of Congress to abolish slavery in all the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>This became a cardinal principle in the <rs>Chicago</rs> platform on which <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0244.0003.00051.00083" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was nominated and elected, and to which his Inaugural proves he had determined to adhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>The agitation continued for years, just as though the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> had never decided the question, until at length Congress passed an Act, on the <dateStruct value="1862-06-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> <month reg="06">June</month>, <year>1862</year>,</dateStruct><note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/></p> 
<p>This Act stands upon the <rs>Statute Book</rs> in direct conflict with the <rs>Constitution</rs> as expounded by the <rs>Supreme Coordinate Judicial Tribunal</rs>, and is therefore, according to the theory of our Government, a mere nullity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>On the other hand, a large and respectable portion of the old <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> of the <rs>North</rs>, best known as the <rs>Douglas Democracy</rs>, equally, disregarded the decision of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>For some years before it was pronounced, this party, whilst admitting that the <rs>Constitution</rs> authorizes the migration of slaves from the <name>States</name> into the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, had maintained that after their arrival it was competent for the <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> to impair or destroy the rights of the master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>They claimed this power by virtue of a supposed inherent attribute of popular sovereignty alleged to belong to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> settlers of a Territory, just as it exists in the people of <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>This doctrine <pb id="p.52" n="52"/> was appropriately, though not in good taste, called <q direct="unspecified">squatter sovereignty.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>It involved, at least in appearance, an extension of popular rights, and was therefore well calculated to enlist public sympathy in its favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>It was presented and enforced by its advocates in such captivating colors, that before the date of the decision it had secured many enthusiastic adherents in the <rs>North</rs>, whilst it was utterly repudiated in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>The Douglas Democracy contended that this their favorite theory had been recognized in <dateStruct value="1854-05-"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, by the <rs>Kansas</rs> and Nebraska Act, declaring it to be <q direct="unspecified">the true intent and meaning of this Act not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State, nor to exclude it therefrom; but to leave the people thereof free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/></p> 
<p>They ought to have reflected that even if this provision had in plain language conferred upon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> settlers the power to abolish slavery, still, according to its very terms, it was <q direct="unspecified">subject to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>,</q> and like all other laws it would be void if in conflict with this Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>What tribunal was to decide this question?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>Certainly the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>Indeed the law itself had, in express terms, recognized this, by prescribing the appropriate method of bringing the question before that Court.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>After the <rs type="place">Court</rs>, therefore, in <dateStruct value="1857-03-"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct>, had decided the question against their ideas of Territorial sovereignty, they ought to have yielded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>They ought to have acquiesced in the doctrine that property, including that in slaves, as well in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> as in the <name>States</name>, is placed under the protection of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and that neither a <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> nor Congress possesses the power to impair or destroy it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>This decision ought surely to have ended the question; but not so. Instead of this, the <rs>Douglas Democracy</rs> disregarded the decision altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>They treated it as though it had never been made, and still continued to agitate without intermission, and with powerful effect, until the very day of <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0244.0003.00052.00084" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>Absolute non-interference with slavery in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, on the part of any human power outside of them, was their watchword; thus leaving the people thereof entirely <pb id="p.53" n="53"/> free to regulate or destroy it according to their own discretion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>On the other hand, the old Democracy, true to its ancient and time-honored principles in support of law and order, at once yielded a willing obedience to the decision of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>Whatever differences of opinion previously existed among them in regard to the correctness of the decision, at once disappeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>Without being the advocates of domestic slavery, they held themselves bound by the compromises made and recorded in the <rs>Constitution</rs> by its illustrious authors, and sustained the decision from an imperious sense of public duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>It did not require the authority of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> to convince a large majority of them that a <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> had not power to deprive a citizen of his property which was denied both to a <orgName n="State Legislature" type="legislature">State Legislature</orgName> and to Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>This extreme power of sovereignty in the latter cases they knew could only be conferred by an amendment to the <rs>State</rs> or Federal Constitution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>The Douglas Democracy still placed their principal reliance, as they had done before the decision, on the language of the <rs>Kansas</rs> and Nebraska Act. The difference between them and the old Democracy related to the point of time intended by the act, when the people of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> were recognized to possess the power <q direct="unspecified">to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>Was this at any time they pleased after the arrival of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> settlers, or not until the people should assemble in convention to form a State government, when, in the language of the act, they were to be admitted into the <rs>Union</rs> <q direct="unspecified">with or without slavery, as their constitution may prescribe at the time of their admission</q>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>According to the construction of the <rs>Douglas Democracy</rs>, the act recognized their right to abolish slavery at any period of the <name>Territorial</name> existence; but according to the construction of the old Democracy, there was no recognition of this right, until the period when they should meet in convention to form a State constitution; and such was in accordance with the decision of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>If the <name>Douglas</name> construction of the act be correct, it is morally certain that the <rs>Southern Senators</rs> and Representatives who <pb id="p.54" n="54"/> were warm advocates of its passage, could not possibly have so understood it. If they had, they would then have voluntarily voted away the rights of their own constituents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>Indeed, such a construction of the act would be more destructive to the interests of the slaveholder, than the <rs>Republican</rs> doctrine of Congressional exclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>Better, far better for him to submit the question to Congress, where he could be deliberately heard by his representatives, than to be deprived of his slaves, after he had gone to the trouble and expense of transporting them to a Territory, by a hasty enactment of a <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> elected annually and freed from all constitutional restraints.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>Such a construction of the <rs>Kansas</rs> and Nebraska Act would be in direct opposition to the policy and practice of the <rs>Government</rs> from its origin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>The men who framed and built up our institutions, so far from regarding the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> to be sovereign, treated them as mere wards of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>Congress, as a faithful and kind guardian, watched over their infancy and promoted their growth and prosperity until they attained their majority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>During the period of their pupilage the persons and property of the inhabitants were protected by the <rs>Constitution</rs> and laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>When the population had so far increased as to render this expedient, Congress gave them a Territorial Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>But in conferring upon the settlers the privilege to elect members to the popular branch of the <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName>, they took care to reserve the appointment of the <rs>Governor</rs> and the members of the <name>Council</name> to the <rs>President</rs> and Senate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>Moreover, they expressly provided, in the language of the compromise measures of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, <q direct="unspecified">that all the laws passed by the <rs>Legislative Assembly</rs> and Governor shall be submitted to the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName>, and if disapproved, shall be null and of no effect.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>This limitation on their powers was intended to restrain them from enacting laws in conflict with the <rs>Constitution</rs>, the laws, or the established policy of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>It produced the happiest effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>The cases are rare, indeed, in which Congress found it necessary to exercise this disapproving power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>It was not then foreseen that any <orgName n="Political Party" type="party">political party</orgName> would arise in this country, claiming the right for the majority of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> settlers of a Territory, under the plea of popular sovereignty, <pb id="p.55" n="55"/> to confiscate the property of the minority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>When the population in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> had reached a sufficient number, Congress admitted them as States into the <rs>Union</rs> under constitutions framed by themselves, <q direct="unspecified">with or without slavery,</q> according to their own discretion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>Long experience had abundantly sanctioned the wisdom of this policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>Under its benign influence many powerful and prosperous States have been admitted into the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>No serious difficulties had ever occurred until the attempt was made to abolish it under the construction in favor of <q direct="unspecified">squatter sovereignty</q> given to the <rs>Kansas</rs> and Nebraska Act.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>The Southern people, who had expected that after the decision of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> their equal rights in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> would be respected by the <rs>Northern Democracy</rs>, were deeply mortified and disappointed to find that a large portion of this party still persevered in assailing these rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>This exasperated them, and placed in the hands of Southern disunion agitators a powerful weapon against the <rs>Union</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>He has been charged with proving faithless to the <rs>Cincinnati</rs> platform, which he accepted and on which he was elected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>To prove this would be impossible, because it is altogether silent in regard to the power of a <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> over the question of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>Nay, more; whilst affirming, in general terms, the provisions of the <rs>Kansas</rs> and Nebraska Act, it specifically designates a future time when slavery may be rightfully abolished, not by the <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName>, but by the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>This is when, <q direct="unspecified">acting through the legally and fairly expressed will of a majority of actual residents, and whenever the number of their inhabitants justifies it, [they assemble] to form a constitution with or without domestic slavery, and be admitted into the <rs>Union</rs> upon terms of perfect equality with the other States.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>Before this period the <rs>Cincinnati</rs> platform is silent on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>The power is claimed by its advocates as a mere inference from the general language of the <rs>Kansas</rs> and Nebraska Act.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>On the other hand, the advocates of their readmission contended that a simple withdrawal of the delegates was not a final renunciation of their seats, but they were still entitled to reoccupy them, whenever, in their judgment, this course would be best calculated to restore the harmony and promote the success of the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>; that the <rs>Convention</rs> had no right to interpose between them and the <name>Democracy</name> of their respective States; that being directly responsible to this Democracy, it alone could accept their resignation; that no such resignation had ever been made, and their authority therefore continued in full force, and this, too, with the approbation of their constituents.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>In the mean time, after the adjournment from <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, the friends of <persName n="Douglas,Mister,,,," id="n0244.0004.00075.00155" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, in several of these States, had proceeded to elect delegates to take the place of those who had withdrawn from the <rs>Convention</rs>, but not in any instance, it is believed, according to the rules and usages of the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>Indeed, it was manifest at the time, and has since been clearly proved by the event, that these delegates represented but a small minority of the party in their respective States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>These new delegates, nevertheless, appeared and demanded seats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/><pb id="p.76" n="76"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>They thus prejudged the question, by deciding that the seats of these delegates had been made and were still vacant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>The Committee on Credentials had been originally composed of <num value="1">one</num> delegate from each of the <num value="33">thirty-three</num> States, but the number was now reduced to <num value="25">twenty-five</num>, in consequence of the exclusion of <num value="8">eight</num> of its members from the <name>States</name> of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>It is unnecessary to give in detail these conflicting reports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>It is Sufficient to state that whilst the report of the majority maintained that the delegates, by withdrawing at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, had resigned their seats, and these were still vacant; that of the minority, on the contrary, asserted the right of these delegates to resume their seats in the <rs>Convention</rs>, by virtue of their original appointment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>In some respects the majority report presented a strange aspect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>Whilst it recommended the admission of all the new delegates from the <name>States</name> of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> and <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, to the exclusion of the old, it divided <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> equally between the conflicting parties, allowing <num value="0.5">one half</num> to each, thus rendering the vote of the <rs>State</rs> a mere nullity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>This anomaly was, however, afterwards corrected by a vote of the <rs>Convention</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1185"/>It could have had no effect in preventing secession, but must have done much to provoke it.

<p>Having thus disposed of the question of revolutionary resistance, the message proceeds to discuss the right of peaceful secession from the <rs>Union</rs> claimed by the <rs>Southern States</rs> in their sovereign character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/>It proceeds:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1377"/>I have purposely confined my remarks to revolutionary resistance, because it has been claimed within the last few years that any State, whenever this shall be its sovereign will and pleasure, may secede from the <rs>Union</rs> in accordance with the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and without any violation of the constitutional rights of the other members of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1378"/>That as each became parties to the <rs>Union</rs> by the vote of its own people assembled in convention, so any <num value="1">one</num> of them may retire from the <rs>Union</rs> in a similar manner by the vote of such a convention.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1379"/>In order to justify secession as a constitutional remedy, it must be on the principle that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> is a mere voluntary association of States, to be dissolved at pleasure by any <num value="1">one</num> of the contracting parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1380"/>If this be so, the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is a rope of sand, to be penetrated and dissolved by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> adverse wave of public opinion in any of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1381"/>In this manner our <num value="33">thirty-three</num> States may resolve themselves into as many petty, jarring, and hostile republics, each <num value="1">one</num> retiring from the <rs>Union</rs> without responsibility whenever any sudden excitement might impel them to such a course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1382"/>By this process a Union might be entirely broken into fragments in a few weeks, which cost our forefathers many years of toil, privation, and blood to establish.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1383"/>Such a principle is wholly inconsistent with the history as well as the character of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1384"/>After it was framed with the greatest deliberation and care, it was submitted to conventions of the people of the several States for ratification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1385"/>Its provisions were discussed at length in these bodies, composed <pb id="p.121" n="121"/> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> men of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1386"/>Its opponents contended that it conferred powers upon the <rs>Federal Government</rs> dangerous to the rights of the <name>States</name>, whilst its advocates maintained that, under a fair construction of the instrument, there was no foundation for such apprehensions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1387"/>In that mighty struggle between the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intellects of this or any other country, it never occurred to any individual, either among its opponents or advocates, to assert or even to intimate that their efforts were all vain labor, because the moment that any State felt herself aggrieved she might secede from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1388"/>What a crushing argument would this have proved against those who dreaded that the rights of the <name>States</name> would be endangered by the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1389"/>The truth is, that it was not until some years after the origin of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> that such a proposition was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1390"/>It was afterwards met and refuted by the conclusive arguments of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0244.0007.00121.00329" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, who, in his message of the <dateStruct value="1833-01-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> <month reg="01">January</month>, <year>1833</year>,</dateStruct> transmitting the nullifying ordinance of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> to Congress, employs the following language: <quote>The right of the people of a single State to absolve themselves at will and without the consent of the other States from their most solemn obligations, and hazard the liberty and happiness of the <num value="1000000">millions</num> composing this Union, cannot be acknowledged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1392"/>It is not pretended that any clause in the <rs>Constitution</rs> gives countenance to such a theory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/>It is altogether founded upon inference, not from any language contained in the instrument itself, but from the sovereign character of the several States by which it was ratified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1399"/>It was intended to be perpetual, and not to be annulled at the pleasure of any <num value="1">one</num> of the contracting parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1400"/>The old Articles of Confederation were entitled <quote>Articles of Confederation and <orgName n="Perpetual Union" type="union">Perpetual Union</orgName> between the <name>States</name>; </quote> and by the <num value="13" type="ordinal">thirteenth</num> article it is expressly declared that <quote>the articles of this confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the <rs>Union</rs> shall be perpetual.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1402"/>And yet it is contended that this <quote>more perfect union</quote> does not include the essential attribute of perpetuity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1403"/>But that the <rs>Union</rs> was designed to be perpetual, appears conclusively from the nature and extent of the powers conferred by the <rs>Constitution</rs> on the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1404"/>These powers embrace the very highest attributes of national sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1405"/>They place both the sword and the purse under its control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1406"/>Congress has power to make war and to make peace; to raise and support armies and navies, and to conclude treaties with foreign governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1407"/>It is invested with the power to coin money, and to regulate the value thereof, and to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1408"/>It is not necessary to enumerate the other high powers which have been conferred upon the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1409"/>In order to carry the enumerated powers into effect, Congress possesses the exclusive right to lay and collect duties on imports, and, in common with the <name>States</name>, to lay and collect all other taxes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1410"/>But the <rs>Constitution</rs> has not only conferred these high powers upon Congress, but it has adopted effectual means to restrain the <name>States</name> from interfering with their exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1411"/>For that purpose it has in strong prohibitory language expressly dedared <pb id="p.123" n="123"/> that <quote>no State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation; grant letters of marque and reprisal; coin money; emit bills of credit; make any thing but gold and <rs n="silver coin" type="product">silver coin</rs> a tender in payment of debts; pass any bill of attainder,<hi rend="italics">ex post facto</hi> law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1412"/>Moreover, <quote>without the consent of Congress no State shall lay any imposts or duties on any imports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws,</quote> and if they exceed this amount, the excess shall belong to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1414"/>In order still further to secure the uninterrupted exercise of these high powers against State interposition, it is provided <quote>that this Constitution and the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made or which shall be made under the authority of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, hall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any thing in the <rs>Constitution</rs> or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1415"/>The solemn sanction of religion has been superadded to the obligations of official duty, and all <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> and Representatives of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, all members of State Legislatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1416"/>and all executive and judicial officers, <quote>both of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and of the several States, shall be bound by oath or. affirmation to support this Constitution.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1417"/>In order to carry into effect these powers, the <rs>Constitution</rs> has established a perfect Government in all its forms, legislative, executive, and judicial; and this Government to the extent of its powers acts directly upon the individual citizens of every State, and executes its own decrees by the agency of its own officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1418"/>In this respect it differs entirely from the <rs>Government</rs> under the old confederation, which was confined to making requisitions on the <name>States</name> in their sovereign character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1419"/>This left it in the discretion of each whether to obey or to refuse, and <pb id="p.124" n="124"/> they often declined to comply with such requisitions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1420"/>It thus became necessary, for the purpose of removing this barrier, and <quote>in order to form a more perfect union,</quote> to establish a Government which could act directly upon the people and execute its own laws without the intermediate agency of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1421"/>This has been accomplished by the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1422"/>In short, the <rs>Government</rs> created by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and deriving its authority from the sovereign people of each of the several States, has precisely the same right to exercise its power over the people of all these States in the enumerated cases, that each <num value="1">one</num> of them possesses over subjects not delegated to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, but <quote>reserved to the <name>States</name> respectively or to the people.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1423"/>To the extent of the delegated powers the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> is as much a part of the constitution of each State, and is as binding upon its people, as though it had been textually inserted therein.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1424"/>This Government, therefore, is a great and powerful Government, invested with all the attributes of sovereignty over the special subjects to which its authority extends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1425"/>Its framers never intended to implant in its bosom the seeds of its own destruction, nor were they at its creation guilty of the absurdity of providing for its own dissolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1426"/>It was not intended by its framers to be the baseless fabric of a vision, which, at the touch of the enchanter, would vanish into thin air, but a substantial and mighty fabric, capable of resisting the slow decay of time, and of defying the storms of ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1427"/>Indeed, well may the jealous patriots of that day have indulged fears that a Government of such high powers might violate the reserved rights of the <name>States</name>, and wisely did they adopt the rule of a strict construction of these powers to prevent the. danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1428"/>But they did not fear, nor had they any reason to imagine that the <rs>Constitution</rs> would ever be so interpreted as to enable any State by her own act, and without the consent of her sister States, to discharge her people from all or any &mdash; of their federal obligations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1429"/>It may be asked, then, are the people of the <name>States</name> without redress against the tyranny and oppression of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1430"/>By no means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1431"/>The right of resistance on the <pb id="p.125" n="125"/> part of the governed against the oppression of their governments cannot be denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1432"/>It exists independently of all constitutions, and has been exercised at all periods of the world's history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1433"/>Under it, old governments have been destroyed and new ones have taken their place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1434"/>It is embodied in strong and express language in our own <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1465"/>Then follows the opinion expressed in the message, that the <rs>Constitution</rs> has conferred no power on the <rs>Federal Government</rs> to coerce a <hi rend="italics">Sate</hi> to remain in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1466"/>The following is the language: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1467"/></p> 
<p>The question fairly stated is, <quote>Has the <rs>Constitution</rs> delegated to Congress the power to coerce a State into submission which is attempting to withdraw, or has actually withdrawn from the <rs>Confederacy</rs>?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1468"/>If answered in the affirmative, it must be on the principle that the power has been conferred upon Congress to make war against a State.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1469"/>After much serious reflection, I have arrived at the conclusion that no such power has been delegated to Congress or to any other department of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1470"/>It is manifest, upon an inspection of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, that this is not among the specific and enumerated powers granted to Congress; and it is equally apparent that its exercise is not <quote>necessary and proper for carrying into execution</quote> any <num value="1">one</num> of these powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1471"/>So far from this power having been delegated to Congress, it was expressly refused by the <rs>Convention</rs> which framed the <rs>Constitution</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1472"/>It appears from the proceedings of that body that on the <dateStruct value="1787-05-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> <month reg="05">May</month>, <year>1787</year>,</dateStruct> the clause <hi rend="italics"><quote>authorizing an exertion of the force of the whole against a delinquent State</quote> </hi> came up for consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1474"/>He observed: <quote>The use of force against a State would look more like a declaration of war than an infliction of punishment, and would probably be considered by the party attacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts by which it might be bound.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1475"/>Upon his motion <pb id="p.128" n="128"/> the clause was unanimously postponed, and was never, I believe, again presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1476"/>Soon afterwards, on the <dateStruct value="1787-06-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> <month reg="06">June</month>, <year>1787</year>,</dateStruct> when incidentally adverting to the subject, he said: <quote>Any government for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, formed on the supposed practicability of using force against the unconstitutional proceedings of the <name>States</name>, would prove as visionary and fallacious as the government of Congress,</quote> evidently meaning the then existing Congress of the old confederation.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1477"/>The <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> have severely but unjustly criticized this portion of the message, simply because they have not chosen to take the distinction between the power to make war against a State in its sovereign character, and the undoubted power to enforce the laws of Congress directly against individual citizens thereof within its limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1478"/>It was chiefly to establish this very distinction that the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> was framed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1479"/>The Government of the old Confederation could act only by requisitions on the different States, and these, as we have seen, obeyed or disobeyed according to their own discretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1480"/>In case of disobedience, there was no resort but to actual force against them, which would at once have destroyed the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1481"/>To remove the necessity for such a dangerous alternative, the present Constitution, passing over the <name>Governments</name> of the <name>States</name>, conferred upon the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> the power to execute its own laws directly against their people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1482"/>Thus all danger of collision between the <rs>Federal</rs> and State authorities was removed, and the indissoluble nature of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1483"/>The <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> have, notwithstanding, construed the message to mean a denial by the <rs>President</rs> of the power to enforce the laws against the citizens of a State after secession, and even after actual rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1484"/>The whole tenor, not only of this message, but of the special message of the <dateStruct value="1861-01-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> <month reg="01">January</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> contradicts and disproves this construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1485"/>Indeed, in the clause of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, immediately preceding that relied upon, and whilst <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> was rapidly rushing to secession, he expressed his determination to execute the revenue laws whenever these should be resisted, and to defend the public property against all assaults.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1486"/>And in the special message, after <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and other States had seceded, he reiterated this <pb id="p.129" n="129"/> declaration, maintaining both his right and his duty to employ military force for this purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1487"/>Having proved secession to be a mere nullity, he considered the <name>States</name> which had seceded to be still within the <rs>Union</rs>, and their people equally bound as they had been before to obey the laws.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1488"/>The Disunionists, unlike the <name>Republicans</name>, placed the correct construction upon both messages, and therefore denounced them in severe terms.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1491"/>As a State, the <rs>Federal Government</rs> has no power to coerce it; but it is a member of the compact to which it agreed in common with the other States, and this Government has the right to pass laws, and. to enforce those laws upon individuals within the limits of each State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1492"/>While the <num value="1">one</num> proposition is clear, the other is equally so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1495"/>Happily our civil war was undertaken and prosecuted in self-defence, not to coerce a State, but to enforce the execution of the laws within the <name>States</name> against individuals, and to suppress an unjust rebellion raised by a conspiracy among them against the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. <pb id="p.130" n="130"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1496"/>After an impartial review of all the circumstances, and a careful consideration of the danger of the crisis, the <rs>President</rs> determined to recommend to Congress to initiate such amendments to the <rs>Constitution</rs> as would recognize and place beyond dispute the rights of the <rs>Southern</rs> people, as these had been expounded by the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1497"/>Whilst acknowledging that the cotton States were without justifiable cause for their threatened attempts to break up the <rs>Union</rs>, either by peaceful secession, as they claimed the right to do, or by forcible rebellion, he could not deny that they had suffered serious wrongs through many years from the <rs>Northern</rs> <orgName n="Abolition party" type="party">abolition party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1498"/>To deny them such a security would be at war with the noblest feelings of patriotism, and inconsistent with the friendly sentiments which ought ever to be cherished between the people of sister States.

<p>to the legislatures of the several States the remedy for existing evils which the <rs>Constitution</rs> has itself provided for its own preservation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1507"/>It is to be found in the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> article providing for its own amendment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1786"/>Nay, more, several of them had already seized the forts, magazines, and arsenals within their limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1787"/>Still all this failed to produce any effect upon Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1788"/>It was at this crisis the <rs>President</rs> sent his special message to Congress (<dateStruct value="1861-01-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>), by which he endeavored to impress them with the necessity for immediate action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1789"/>He concealed nothing from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1790"/>Whilst still clinging to the fading hope that they might yet provide for a peaceful adjustment of our difficulties, and strongly recommending this course, he says: <q direct="unspecified">Even now the danger is upon us. In several of the <name>States</name> which have not yet seceded, the forts, arsenals, and magazines of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have been seized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1791"/>This is by far the most serious step which has been taken since the commencement of the troubles. * * * The seizure of this property, from all appearances, has been purely aggressive, and not in resistance to any attempt to coerce a State or States to remain in the <rs>Union</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1792"/>He also stated the well-known fact that our small army was on the remote frontiers, and was scarcely sufficient to guard the inhabitants against <name>Indian</name> incursions, and consequently our forts were without sufficient garrisons.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1793"/>Under these circumstances he appeals to Congress in the following language: <q direct="unspecified">But the dangerous and hostile attitude of the <name>States</name> toward each other has already far transcended and cast: in the shade the ordinary executive duties already provided for <pb id="p.156" n="156"/> by law, and has assumed such vast and alarming proportions as to place the subject entirely above and beyond executive control The fact cannot be disguised that we are in the midst of a great revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1794"/>In all its various bearings, therefore, I commend the question to Congress, as the only human tribunal, under <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, possessing the power to meet the existing emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1795"/>To them exclusively belongs the power to declare war, or to authorize the employment of military force in all cases contemplated by the <rs>Constitution</rs>; and they alone possess the power to remove grievances which might lead to war, and to secure peace and union to this distracted country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1796"/>On them, and on them alone, rests the responsibility.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1797"/></p> 
<p>Congress might, had they thought proper, have regarded the forcible seizure of these forts and other property, including that of the <rs type="place">Branch</rs> Mint at New Orleans with all the treasure it contained, as the commencement of an aggressive war. Beyond question the cotton States had now committed acts of open hostility against the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/>They had always contended that secession was a peaceful constitutional remedy, and that Congress had no power to make war against a sovereign State for the purpose of coercing her to remain in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1799"/>They could no longer shelter themselves under this plea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1800"/>They had by their violent action entirely changed the position they had assumed; and instead of peacefully awaiting the decision of Congress on the question of coercion, they had themselves become the coercionists and assailants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1801"/>This question had, therefore, passed away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1802"/>No person has ever doubted the right or the duty of Congress to pass laws enabling the <rs>President</rs> to defend the <rs>Union</rs> against armed rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1803"/>Congress, however, still shrunk from the responsibility of passing any such laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1804"/>This might have been commendable had it proceeded from a sincere desire not to interpose obstacles to a compromise intended to prevent the effusion of fraternal blood and restore the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1805"/>Still in any event the time had arrived when it was their duty to make at the least contingent provisions for the prosecution of the war, should this be rendered inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/>This had become the more necessary as Congress would soon expire, and the new Congress could not be convened for a considerable period after the <pb id="p.157" n="157"/> old <num value="1">one</num> had ceased to exist, because a large portion of the <rs>Representatives</rs> had not then been elected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1819"/>It is remarkable that it contains no provision touching the recovery of the forts and other property which had been already seized by the delinquent States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1829"/>The power of the legislative branch to withhold money from the <rs>Executive</rs>, and thus restrain him from dangerous projects of his own, is a necessary safeguard of liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1830"/>This exists in every government pretending to be free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1836"/>At all events he had determined to make the effort with the naval force under his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1837"/>He trusted that this might be accomplished without collision; but if resisted, then the force necessary to attain the object must be applied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>In all such cases, however, it is the <rs>President</rs>'s duty to present to Congress, immediately after their next meeting, the causes which impelled him thus to act, and ask for their approbation; just as, on a like occasion, a British minister would ask Parliament for a bill of indemnity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/>It would be difficult, however, to conceive of an emergency so extreme as to justify or even excuse a President for thus transcending his constitutional powers whilst Congress, to whom he could make an immediate appeal, was in session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1865"/>It is not believed that any attempt will be made to expel the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> from this property by force, but if in this I should prove to be mistaken, the officer in command of the forts has received orders to act strictly on the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1866"/>In such a contingency the responsibility for consequences would rightfully rest upon the heads of the assailants.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/>In order to estimate correctly the wisdom of this defensive policy, it is necessary to revert to the condition of the country on the <dateStruct value="1860-12-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> <month reg="12">December</month>, <year>1860</year>,</dateStruct> when it was announced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>At this period we <pb id="p.163" n="163"/> may divide the <rs>Southern States</rs> into <num value="3">three</num> classes, holding opinions variant from each other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1870"/><num value="1">1</num>. There was <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, which had been the avowed and persistent advocate of disunion for more than <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>She had already called a Convention for the purpose of seceding from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1872"/>Her leading secessionists were ever on the alert to seize upon any action of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> which they might wrest to the purpose of alienating the other slaveholding States from their attachment to the <rs>Union</rs>, and enlisting them in her cause.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1873"/><num value="2">2</num>. The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> class was composed of the <num value="6">six</num> other cotton States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1874"/>The people of these, although highly excited against the abolitionists, were still unwilling to leave the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1875"/>They would have been content, notwithstanding the efforts of secession demagogues, with a simple recognition of their adjudged rights to take slaves into the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, and hold them there like other property, until a territorial convention, assembled to frame a State constitution, should decide the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1876"/>To this decision, whatever it might be, they professed their willingness to submit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1877"/>Indeed, as has already been seen from the statements of <persName n="Douglas,Mister,,,," id="n0244.0010.00163.00490" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> and <persName n="Toombs,Mister,,,," id="n0244.0010.00163.00491" reg="mostcommon:Toombs,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Toombs</surname></persName> in the <name>Senate</name>, they would have consented to abandon their rights in all the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> north of <num value="36">36</num>&deg; <num value="30">30</num>&prime;, leaving what should remain to them little more than a name.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1878"/><num value="3">3</num>. The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> class consisted of the border slaveholding States, with <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 15" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> at the head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1879"/>A large majority of their people, although believing in the right of peaceful secession, had resisted all the efforts of the extreme men in their midst, and were still devoted to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1880"/>Of this there could be no better proof than the result of the election held in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 15" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, <dateStruct value="1861-02-04"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg="4">4</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, for the choice of. delegates to her <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State Convention</orgName>, even after the cotton States had all seceded.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1882"/>Under these circumstances, it is easy to imagine what would have been the effect on the other Southern States of sending a feeble force of <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1883"/>Had collision been the consequence, and blood been shed immediately before the meeting of Congress, the other cotton States, from their well-known affinities, would have rushed to the support of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, She would thus have accomplished her long-sought object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1884"/>Indeed, it was the current report of the day that her leading disunionists had declared the spilling of a little blood would be necessary to secure the cooperation of other Southern States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1885"/>Besides, in the <rs>President</rs>'s opinion, there was no necessity, at the time, for any reenforcement to secure the forts in the harbor of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1886"/>He was convinced that while the other slaveholding States were ready and willing to compromise with the <rs>North</rs>, <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> would not dare to attack <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1887"/>This conviction did not spring from any confidence in her spirit of forbearance; it arose from a certain knowledge that such an outrage would be condemned not only by the border but by the cotton States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1888"/>It would estrange and separate them from her, at the very moment she was most solicitous to conciliate them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1889"/>Whoever was in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> at the time cannot fail to recollect the denunciations in advance of leading Southern men against such an unprovoked attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1890"/>The public property stood within her limits&mdash;<num value="3">three</num> forts, a custom house, an arsenal, and a <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post office</orgName>, covered by the flag of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1891"/>From these she knew she had nothing to fear unless she should <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> make the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/>Such an outrage as the seizure of a fort of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> by any State had never before been imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>There must be a fearful suspense between the conception and the commission of such an act. It was the supreme object of the <rs>President</rs> to promote, by all the means in his power, such a fair and honorable adjustment between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> as would save the country from the scourge of civil war. It was, therefore, his evident policy to isolate <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, as far as possible, from the other Southern States; and for this purpose to refrain from any act which might enable her to enlist them in her cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/>If, after all, she should attack <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName>, this act would have met their universal condemnation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1895"/>Besides, nothing short of such an attack could have united the people of the <rs>North</rs> in suppressing her revolt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1896"/>They were then far from being prepared for civil war. <pb id="p.165" n="165"/> On the contrary, they were intent on a peaceful solution of our difficulties, and would have censured any act of the administration which might have defeated this purpose and precipitated them into hostilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1897"/>The true policy was that expressed by <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0244.0010.00165.00494" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to the seceded cotton States in his inaugural months afterward, in which he informs them, <q direct="unspecified">You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1898"/>Although the <rs>President</rs> believed (and this with good cause, as the event has shown), that under the existing circumstances, <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> would not attack any of the forts in the harbor of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> whilst he suffered their <hi rend="italics">status quo</hi> to remain; yet in this it was possible he might be mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1899"/>To guard against surprise after the secession of the <rs>State</rs>, which was then imminent, he had prepared an expedition as powerful as his limited means would afford, to send reenforcements to <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0244.0010.00165.00495" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> moment of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1900"/>For this purpose the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs> had stationed the <rs>Brooklyn</rs>, a powerful war steamer, then completely ready for sea, in <placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName>, to take on board for <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> <num value="300">three hundred</num> disciplined troops, with provisions and munitions of war, from the neighboring garrison of <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1901"/>Having thus provided for the reenforcement of the forts, in case of need, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> despatched <persName n="Buell,Assistant-Adjutant General,,,," id="n0244.0010.00165.00496" reg="mostcommon:Buell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Assistant-Adjutant General">Assistant Adjutant-General</roleName> <surname>Buell</surname></persName> to <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0244.0010.00165.00497" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, at <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName>, with instructions how he should act in his present position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1903"/>Whilst they instructed the <rs>Major</rs> to avoid every act of aggression, they directed him, in case of an attack upon, or an attempt to take possession of, any of the <num value="3">three</num> forts under his command, to defend them to the last extremity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1904"/>Furthermore, he was authorized, as a precautionary measure, should he believe his force insufficient for the defence of all <num value="3">three</num>, to remove it at his discretion from <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, whenever he should have tangible evidence of a design, on the part of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, to proceed to a hostile act.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1957"/>It is due to <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0244.0010.00170.00507" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to state, that throughout his long progress in the same carriage with the late <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs>, both on the way to the <rs>Capitol</rs> and the return from it, he was far from evincing the slightest apprehension of danger.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1965"/>It evidently proceeded from a defective memory prejudiced by a strong bias.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1966"/>It rests mainly on vague and confused recollections of private conversations alleged to have been held with the <rs>President</rs> several months <pb id="p.171" n="171"/> before its date.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1967"/>These having occurred between the commanderin-chief and the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding General</rs> of the army, on important military questions, pertaining to their respective official duties, were, in their nature, strictly confidential.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1968"/>Were this otherwise, it would destroy that freedom and unreserve which ought to characterize such consultations, and instead thereof, the parties would be ever on their guard in the interchange of opinions, often greatly to the prejudice of the public interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1969"/>Had the <rs>General</rs> resolved to violate a confidence as sacred as that between the <rs>President</rs> and a member of his Cabinet, such is the treachery of the best human memory, he ought, at the least, to have submitted his statements to <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n0244.0010.00171.00511" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> before he had embodied them in his report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1973"/>A suspicion never entered his mind that the <rs>General</rs> held in reserve a quiver of arrows to assail his public character upon his retirement from office.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1974"/>This report does not allege that it had been made in consequence of a call from <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0244.0010.00171.00513" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1975"/>From its face it appears to have been a pure volunteer offering on the part of the <rs>General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2001"/>Before we proceed to analyze in further detail the <rs>General</rs>'s report, it is curious to note the reason for its publication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2002"/>This was a consequence of the publication of his letter to <persName n="Seward,Secretary,,,," id="n0244.0010.00173.00528" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>, which was in its very nature confidential.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2003"/>At this period, in <dateStruct value="1862-10-"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, when the rebellion had assumed a formidable aspect, and when his sinister predictions appeared to <pb id="p.174" n="174"/> be in the course of fulfilment, he read the original draft, in his own handwriting, to a friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2004"/>This gentleman, whilst extolling the far-seeing sagacity and the prophetic spirit it displayed, begged for the draft as an invaluable keepsake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2005"/>This appeal to the <rs>General</rs> proved irresistible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2006"/>The manuscript was delivered to the friend, who soon thereafter read it, amid great applause, at a public meeting in the <placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567">city of New York</placeName>, and whilst a highly excited political canvass was depending for the <orgName>office of Governor</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2008"/>The letter having thus been <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> published by his friend, it was soon thereafter republished in the <q direct="unspecified"><orgName n="National Intelligencer" type="newspaper">National Intelligencer</orgName>,</q> of the <dateStruct value="1862-10-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> <month reg="10">October</month>, <year>1862</year>,</dateStruct> under the <rs>General</rs>'s own authority, and in addition, a copy of his report to <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0244.0010.00174.00530" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2019"/>The <rs>Secretary</rs> did not concur in my views.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2023"/>He does not furnish the <rs>President</rs>'s answer to the proposition to send strong garrisons to the <rs>Southern</rs> forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2024"/>This must unquestionably have referred to the topics of which his mind was then full, viz., the promising aspect of compromise at the moment; the certain effect of such a measure in defeating it; the inadequacy of the force at command for so extended an operation; and the policy which had been laid down in his annual message.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2025"/>Not a word of all this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2026"/>But the <rs>General</rs>'s memory seems to have improved with the lapse of years and the progress of the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2027"/>In his report to <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0244.0010.00175.00539" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, he speaks of but <num value="1">one</num> conversation with <persName n="Buchanan,President,,,," id="n0244.0010.00175.00540" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:2"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>, that of the <dateStruct value="-12-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, whilst in his letter of the <dateStruct value="1862-11-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> <month reg="11">November</month>, <year>1862</year>,</dateStruct> to the <q direct="unspecified"><orgName n="National Intelligencer" type="newspaper">National Intelligencer</orgName>,</q> a portion of the correspondence to which we have referred, he alleges he had, on the <num value="28" type="ordinal">28th</num> and <num value="30" type="ordinal">30th</num> of the same <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, repeated the recommendation to garrison all the <rs>Southern</rs> forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2028"/>In this statement, if material, it would be easy to prove he was mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2029"/>Indeed, <persName n="Buchanan,President,,,," id="n0244.0010.00175.00541" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:2"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> has in his possession a note from the <rs>General</rs> himself, dated on <dateStruct value="-12-30"><day type="name">Sunday</day>, <day reg="30">30th</day> <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, stating that by indisposition he was confined to the house <pb id="p.176" n="176"/> on that day, and could not therefore call upon him. Of this hereafter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2030"/>According to the report, he merely mentions in general terms the recruits he had obtained for the expedition, without allotting them among the several forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2031"/>According to the letter, he informed <persName n="Buchanan,President,,,," id="n0244.0010.00176.00542" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:2"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> that the number of recruits at New York and <placeName reg="Carlisle barracks">Carlisle barracks</placeName> was about <num value="600">six hundred</num>, <q direct="unspecified">besides the <num value="5">five</num> companies of regulars near at hand, making about <num value="1000">one thousand</num> men.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2032"/>And he also stated how he would distribute them among the several forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2033"/>In this distribution he left only <q direct="unspecified">about <num value="200">two hundred</num> men for the twin forts of <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Moultrie</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>, <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2034"/>He also declared in this letter, that <q direct="unspecified">he considered the force quite adequate to the occasion.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2035"/>But, as if rendered conscious of its inadequacy by the logic of events, he alleges that <persName n="Buchanan,President,,,," id="n0244.0010.00176.00543" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:2"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> <q direct="unspecified">might have called forth volunteers to garrison these forts, without any special legislation,</q> and this, too, <q direct="unspecified">with the full approbation of every loyal man in the <rs>Union</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2036"/>That is, that on the <dateStruct value="1860-12-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> <month reg="12">December</month>, <year>1860</year>,</dateStruct> before any State had seceded, he might without law have usurped this authority, when the law-making power was actually in session and had made no movement to grant it, and when all were intent, not on war, but on measures of compromise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2037"/>In this letter he charges the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, <q direct="unspecified">with or without the <rs>President</rs>'s approbation,</q> with <q direct="unspecified">having nearly denuded our whole eastern seaboard of troops.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2038"/>In doing this, he must surely have forgotten that he himself-had eloquently urged that all the force on the frontiers was not sufficient for the protection of our distant fellow-citizens, and had therefore advocated the raising of an additional force by Congress for this very purpose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2039"/>It would seem from the report that the <rs>President</rs> confined his observations at their interview exclusively to the reenforcement of the forts in <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName>, for which <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n0244.0010.00176.00544" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Winfield,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, according to his own statement, in the letter to the <q direct="unspecified"><orgName n="National Intelligencer" type="newspaper">National Intelligencer</orgName>,</q> could spare but <num value="200">two hundred</num> men, the remaining <num value="800">eight hundred</num> being required for the other fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2040"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> having expressed the opinion, according to the report, <q direct="unspecified">that there was at the moment no danger of an early secession <pb id="p.177" n="177"/> beyond <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>,</q> he proceeded to state, <q direct="unspecified">in reply to my [<persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n0244.0010.00177.00545" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Winfield,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>'s] arguments for immediately reenforcing <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName>, and sending a garrison to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>,</q> that <q direct="unspecified">the time has not arrived for doing so; that he should wait the action of the <orgName n="South Carolina Convention" type="convention">Convention of South Carolina</orgName>, in the expectation that a commission would be appointed and sent to negotiate with him and Congress, respecting the secession of the <rs>State</rs> and the property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> held within its limits; and that if Congress should decide against the secession, then he would send a reenforcement, and telegraph the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> (<persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0244.0010.00177.00546" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>) of <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName> to hold the forts (<placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Moultrie</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>) against attack.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2041"/></p> 
<p>Now it is probable that in the course of this conversation, the <rs>President</rs> may have referred to the rumor then current, that the <orgName n="South Carolina Convention" type="convention">South Carolina Convention</orgName> intended to send commissioners to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to treat with the <rs>Government</rs>, but it is quite impossible he could have stated that the reenforcement of the forts should await the result of their mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2042"/>Why? Because the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Brooklyn, New York, Kings" key="tgn,7015822">Brooklyn</placeName></hi> had been for some time ready to proceed to <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName>, dependent on no other contingency than that of its attack or danger of attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2043"/>Least of all was it possible the <rs>President</rs> could have said that if Congress should decide against secession, he would then telegraph to <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0244.0010.00177.00547" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> <q direct="unspecified">to hold the forts (<placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Moultrie</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>) against attack,</q> when instructions of a similar but stronger character had already been sent and delivered to him, and were of record in the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2044"/>It is strange that the <rs>President</rs> should, according to the <rs>General</rs>, have made any future action in regard to these forts dependent upon his own decision, or that of Congress, on the question of secession, when he had in his annual message, but a few days before, condemned the doctrine as unconstitutional, and he well knew it would be equally condemned by Congress.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2045"/>It is curious to note a trait of the fault-finding temper of the <rs>General</rs> in this conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2046"/>In it he makes the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> observe, <q direct="unspecified">with animation,</q> <q direct="unspecified">We have a vessel of war (the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Brooklyn, New York, Kings" key="tgn,7015822">Brooklyn</placeName></hi>) held in readiness at <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>, and he would then send <num value="300">three hundred</num> men in her from <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName> to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>;</q> but the <rs>General</rs> objected to this arrangement, saying in answer, <pb id="p.178" n="178"/> <q direct="unspecified">that so many men could not be withdrawn from that garrison, but could be taken from New York,</q> &amp;c., &amp;c.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2047"/>In making these declarations, he must surely have forgotten not only his own objection to sending these very <q direct="unspecified"><num value="300">three hundred</num> men</q> from <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, but also the fate of the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Star of the West" type="newspaper">Star of the West</orgName></hi>, in the early part of <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, with his recruits from New York, which had been substituted under his advice and direction for the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Brooklyn, New York, Kings" key="tgn,7015822">Brooklyn</placeName></hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2048"/>The reader must have observed that we speak argumentatively and doubtingly of the <rs>General</rs>'s statement of this conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2049"/>We do this simply because <persName n="Buchanan,President,,,," id="n0244.0010.00178.00549" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:2"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>, although a party to it, has no recollection whatever of its particulars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2050"/>The reason doubtless is, that, believing <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n0244.0010.00178.00550" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Winfield,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> to have been aware before the interview that the <rs>President</rs> would not violate his announced policy by sending <num value="1000">one thousand</num> men to all the <rs>Southern</rs> forts, or <num value="200">two hundred</num> to those in <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName>, he must have considered this renewed recommendation rather a matter of form, springing from a motive which he will not attempt to conjecture, than any thing more serious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2051"/>But whatever may have been the cause of his want of memory, the fact is certainly true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2052"/>He sincerely wishes it were otherwise.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2053"/>We may observe generally in regard to this report, that the attempt, at the end of more than <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>, filled with the most important and stirring events, to write out charges against <persName n="Buchanan,President,,,," id="n0244.0010.00178.00551" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:2"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>, must necessarily do him injustice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2290"/>The full scope and precise purport of your instructions, as thus modified, <pb id="p.201" n="201"/> you have expressed in the following words: <quote>I do not come as a military man to demand the surrender of a fortress, but as the legal officer of the <rs>State</rs>&mdash;its attorney-general&mdash;to claim for the <rs>State</rs> the exercise of its undoubted right of eminent domain, and to pledge the <rs>State</rs> to make good all injury to the rights of property which arise from the exercise of the claim</quote> And lest this explicit language should not sufficiently define your position, you add: <quote>The proposition now is that her [<placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>'s] law officer should, under authority of the <rs>Governor</rs> and his council, distinctly pledge the faith of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> to make such compensation, in regard to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> and its appurtenances and contents, to the full extent of the money value of the property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, delivered over to the authorities of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> by your command.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2291"/>You then adopt his <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs>'s train of thought upon the subject, so far as to suggest that the possession of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, <quote>if continued long enough, must lead to collision,</quote> and that <quote>an attack upon it would scarcely improve it as property, whatever the result; and if captured, it would no longer be the subject of account.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2292"/>The proposal, then, now presented to the <rs>President</rs>, is simply an offer on the part of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> to buy <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> and contents as property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, sustained by a declaration, in effect, that if she is not permitted to make the purchase she will seize the fort by force of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2293"/>As the initiation of a negotiation for the transfer of property between friendly governments, this proposal impresses the <rs>President</rs> as having assumed a most unusual form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2294"/>He has, however, investigated the claim on which it professes to be based, apart from the declaration that accompanies it. And it may be here remarked, that much stress has been laid upon the employment of the words <quote>property</quote> and <quote>public property</quote> by the <rs>President</rs> in his several messages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2295"/>These are the most comprehensive terms which can be used in such a connection, and surely, when referring to a fort or any other public establishment, they embrace the entire and undivided interest of the <rs>Government</rs> therein.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2296"/>The title of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> is complete and incontestable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2297"/>Were its interest in this property purely <pb id="p.202" n="202"/> proprietary, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, it might probably be subjected to the exercise of the right of eminent domain; but it has also political relations to it of a much higher and more imposing character than those of mere proprietorship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2298"/>It has absolute jurisdiction over the fort and the soil on which it stands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2299"/>This jurisdiction consists in the authority to <quote>exercise exclusive legislation</quote> over the property referred to, and is therefore clearly incompatible with the claim of eminent domain now insisted upon by <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2300"/>This authority was not derived from any questionable revolutionary source, but from the peaceful cession of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> herself, acting through her legislature, under a provision of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>. <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> can no more assert the right of eminent domain over <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> than <placeName key="tgn,7007516" n="1.000 13" reg="maryland">Maryland</placeName> can assert it over the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2301"/>The political and proprietary rights of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in either case rest upon precisely the same ground.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2302"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>, however, is relieved from the necessity of further pursuing this inquiry by the fact that, whatever may be the claim of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> to this fort, he has to constitutional power to cede or surrender it. The property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> has been acquired by force of public law, and can only be disposed of under the same solemn sanctions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2303"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>, as the head of the executive branch of the government only, can no more sell and transfer <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> to <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> than he can sell and convey the <rs>Capitol</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> or to any other State or individual seeking to possess it. His <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> the <rs>Governor</rs> is too familiar with the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, and with the limitations upon the powers of the <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs> of the government it has established, not to appreciate at once the soundness of this legal proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2304"/>The question of reenforcing <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> is so fully disposed of in my letter to <persName n="Slidell,Senator,,,," id="n0244.0011.00202.00705" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Slidell</surname></persName> and others, under date of the <dateStruct value="-01-22"><day reg="22">22d</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, a copy of which accompanies this, that its discussion will not now be renewed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2305"/>I then said: <quote> At the present moment it is not deemed necessary to reenforce <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0244.0011.00202.00706" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, because he makes no such request.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2307"/>I can add nothing to the explicitness of this language, which still applies to the existing status.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2308"/>The right to send forward reenforcements when, in the judgment of the <rs>President</rs>, the safety of the garrison requires them, rests on the same unquestionable foundation as the right to occupy the fortress itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2309"/>In the letter of <persName n="Davis,Senator,,,," id="n0244.0011.00203.00707" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> and others to yourself, under date of the <dateStruct value="--15"><day reg="15">15th ultimo</day></dateStruct>, they say: <quote>We therefore think it especially due from <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> to our States &mdash;to say nothing of other slaveholding States&mdash;that she should, as far as she can consistently with her honor, avoid initiating hostilities between her and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> or any other power;</quote> and you now yourself give to the <rs>President</rs> the gratifying assurance that <quote><placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> has every disposition to preserve the public peace;</quote> and since he is himself sincerely animated by the same desire, it would seem that this common and patriotic object must be of certain attainment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2310"/>It is difficult, however, to reconcile with this assurance the declaration on your part that <quote>it is a consideration of her [<placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>'s] own dignity as a sovereign, and the safety of her people, which prompts her to demand that this property should not longer be used as a military post by a government she no longer acknowledges,</quote> and the thought you so constantly present, that this occupation must lead to a collision of arms and the prevalence of civil war. <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> is in itself a military post, and nothing else; and it would seem that not so much the fact as the purpose of its use should give to it a hostile or friendly character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2311"/>This fortress is now held by the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> for the same objects for which it has been held from the completion of its construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2312"/>These are national and defensive; and were a public enemy now to attempt the capture of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> or the destruction of the commerce of its harbor, the whole force of the batteries of this fortress would be at once exerted for their protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2313"/>How the presence of a small garrison, actuated by such a spirit as this, can compromise the dignity or honor of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, or become a source of irritation to her people, the <rs>President</rs> is at a loss to understand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2314"/>The attitude of that garrison, as has been often declared, is neither menacing, nor defiant, nor unfriendly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2315"/>It is acting under orders to stand strictly on the <pb id="p.204" n="204"/> defensive; and the government and people of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> must well know that they can never receive aught but shelter from its guns, unless, in the absence of all provocation, they should assault it and seek its destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2316"/>The intent with which this fortress is held by the <rs>President</rs> is truthfully stated by <persName n="Davis,Senator,,,," id="n0244.0011.00204.00708" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> and others in their letter to yourself of the <dateStruct value="-01-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, in which they say: <quote>It is not held with any hostile or unfriendly purpose toward your State, but merely as property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, which the <rs>President</rs> deems it his duty to protect and preserve.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2317"/>If the announcement so repeatedly made of the <rs>President</rs>'s pacific purposes in continuing the occupation of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> until the question shall have been settled by competent authority, has failed to impress the government of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, the forbearing conduct of his administration for the last few months should be received as conclusive evidence of his sincerity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2318"/>And if this forbearance, in view of the circumstances which have so severely tried it, be not accepted as a satisfactory pledge of the peaceful policy of this administration toward <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, then it may be safely affirmed that neither language nor conduct can possibly furnish <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2385"/>Sir: I have the honor to submit for your consideration several letters with enclosures received on yesterday from <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0244.0012.00211.00763" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Foster,Captain,,,," id="n0244.0012.00211.00764" reg="mostcommon:Foster,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Foster</surname></persName>, of the <rs>Corps</rs> of Engineers, which are of a most important and unexpected character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2386"/>Why they were unexpected will appear from the following brief statement:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2387"/>After transferring his forces to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, he (<persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0244.0012.00211.00765" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>) addressed a letter to this Department, under date of the <num value="81" type="ordinal">81st</num> <dateStruct value="1860-12-"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, in which he says: <quote>Thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, we are now where the <rs>Government</rs> may send us additional troops <hi rend="italics">at its leisure</hi>. To be sure the uncivil and uncourteous action of <pb id="p.212" n="212"/> the <rs>Governor</rs> [of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>], in preventing us from purchasing any thing in the city, will annoy and inconvenience us somewhat; <hi rend="italics">still we are safe</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2388"/>And after referring to some deficiency in his stores, in the articles of soap and candles, he adds: <quote>Still we can cheerfully put up with the inconvenience of doing without them for the satisfaction we feel in the knowledge that we can command this harbor <hi rend="italics">as long as our Government wishes to keep it</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2389"/>And again, on the <dateStruct value="-01-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, he wrote: <quote>My position will, should there be no treachery among the workmen whom we are compelled to retain for the present, enable me to hold this fort <hi rend="italics">against any force which can be brought against me;</hi> and it would enable me, in the event of war, to annoy the <name>South Carolinians</name> by preventing them from throwing in supplies into their new posts, except by the aid of the <rs type="place">Wash Channel</rs> through <placeName reg="Stones River, Tennessee, United States" key="tgn,2696868">Stone River</placeName>.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2390"/>Before the receipt of this communication, the <rs>Government</rs>, being without information as to his condition, had despatched the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Star of the West" type="newspaper">Star of the West</orgName></hi> with troops and supplies for <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>; but the vessel having been fired on from a battery at the entrance to the harbor, returned without having reached her destination.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2391"/>On the <dateStruct value="1861-01-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> <month reg="01">January</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> in replying to <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0244.0012.00212.00766" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>'s letters of the <dateStruct value="-12-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> and of <dateStruct value="-01-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, I said: <quote>Your late despatches, as well as the very intelligent statements of <persName n="Talbot,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0244.0012.00212.00767" reg="mostcommon:Talbot,Theodore,,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Talbot</surname></persName>, have relieved the <rs>Government</rs> of the apprehensions previously entertained for your safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2392"/>In consequence it is not its purpose at present to reenforce you. The attempt to do so would no doubt be attended by a collision of arms and the effusion of blood&mdash;a national calamity, which the <rs>President</rs> is most anxious to avoid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2393"/>You will, therefore, report frequently your condition, and the character and activity of the preparations, if any, which may be being made for an attack upon the fort, or for obstructing the <rs>Government</rs> in any endeavors it may make to strengthen your command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2394"/>Should your despatches be of a nature too important to be intrusted to the mails, you will convey them by special messenger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2395"/>Whenever, in your judgment, additional supplies or reenforcements are necessary for your safety or for a successful defence of the fort, you will at once <pb id="p.213" n="213"/> communicate the fact to this Department, and a prompt and vigorous effort will be made to forward them.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2396"/>Since the date of this letter <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0244.0012.00213.00768" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> has regularly and frequently reported the progress of the batteries being constructed around him, and which looked either to the defence of the harbor, or to an attack on his own position; but he has not suggested that these works compromised his safety, nor has he made any request that additional supplies or reenforcements should be sent to him. On the contrary, on the <dateStruct value="1861-01-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> <month reg="01">January</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> in a letter to this Department, he uses this emphatic language: <quote>I do hope that no attempt will be made by our friends to throw supplies in; their doing so would do more harm than good.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2397"/>On the <dateStruct value="-02-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> <month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>, when referring to the batteries, etc., constructed in his vicinity, he said: <quote>Even in their present condition, they will make it impossible for any hostile force, other than a large and well-appointed <num value="1">one</num>, to enter this harbor, and the chances are that it will then be at a great sacrifice of life;</quote> and in a postscript he adds: <quote>Of course in speaking of forcing an entrance, I do not refer to the little stratagem of a small party slipping in.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2398"/>This suggestion of a stratagem was well considered in connection with all the information that could be obtained bearing upon it; and in consequence of the vigilance and number of the guard-boats in and outside of the harbor, it was rejected as impracticable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2399"/>In view of these very distinct declarations, and of the earnest desire to avoid a collision as long as possible, it was deemed entirely safe to adhere to the line of policy indicated in my letter of the <dateStruct value="-01-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, which has been already quoted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2400"/>In that <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0244.0012.00213.00769" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> had been requested to report <quote>at once,</quote> <quote>whenever, in his judgment, additional supplies or reenforcements were necessary for his safety or for a successful defence of the fort</quote> So long, therefore, as he remained silent upon this point, the <rs>Government</rs> felt that there was no ground for apprehension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2401"/>Still, as the necessity for action might arise at any moment, an expedition has been quietly prepared and is ready to sail from New York on a few hours' notice for transporting troops and supplies to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2402"/>This step was taken under the supervision of <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n0244.0012.00213.00770" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Winfield,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, who arranged its details, and who regarded <pb id="p.214" n="214"/> the reenforcements thus provided for as sufficient for the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2403"/>The expedition, however, is not upon a scale approaching the seemingly extravagant estimates of <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0244.0012.00214.00771" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Foster,Captain,,,," id="n0244.0012.00214.00772" reg="mostcommon:Foster,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Foster</surname></persName>, now offered for the fist time, and for the disclosures of which the <rs>Government</rs> was wholly unprepared.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2404"/>The declaration now made by the <rs>Major</rs> that he would not be willing to risk his reputation on an attempt to throw reenforcements into <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName>, and with a view of holding possession of the same, with a force of less than <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> good and well-disciplined men, takes the <name>Department</name> by surprise, as his previous correspondence contained no such intimation.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2615"/>This appears from the records of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2616"/>We deem it necessary to refer only to a few of the most important particulars</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2617"/>The administration succeeded by rigid economy in greatly reducing the expenditures of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2619"/>It was no easy work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2620"/>An overflowing treasury had produced habits of prodigality which it was difficult to correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2621"/>Over the contingent expenses of Congress, which had become far more extravagant than those of any other branch of the <rs>Government</rs>, the <rs>President</rs> could exercise no control For these the two Houses were exclusively responsible, and they had so far transcended all reasonable limits, that their expenses, though in their nature they ought to have been purely incidental, had far exceeded the whole of the regular appropriation for their pay and mileage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2622"/>Such was the extent of the abuse, that in the <num value="2">two</num> fiscal years ending respectively on the <dateStruct value="1858-06-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1858">1858</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></dateStruct>, whilst the regular pay and mileage of the members were less than <measure n="2350000dollars" type="currency">$2,350,000</measure>, these contingencies amounted to more than <num value="3000000.5">three millions and a half</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2746"/>After a delay which has afforded me ample time for reflection, and after much and careful deliberation, I find myself constrained by an imperious sense of duty, as a coordinate branch of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, to protest against the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="2">two</num> clauses of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> resolution, adopted by the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> on the <dateStruct value="--5"><day reg="5">5th instant</day></dateStruct>, and published in the <q direct="unspecified">Congressional <pb id="p.242" n="242"/> Globe</q> on the succeeding day: These clauses are in the following words: <quote><hi rend="italics">Resolved</hi>, That a committee of <num value="5">five</num> members be appointed by the <rs>Speaker</rs>, for the purpose, <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>, of investigating whether the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, or any other officer of the <rs>Government</rs>, has, by money, patronage, or other improper means, sought to influence the action of Congress, or any committee thereof, for or against the passage of any law appertaining to the rights of any State or Territory; and <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>, also to inquire into and investigate whether any officer or officers of the <rs>Government</rs> have, by combination or otherwise, prevented or defeated, or attempted to prevent or defeat, the execution of any law or laws now upon the statute book, and whether the <rs>President</rs> has failed or refused to compel the execution of any law thereof.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2747"/>I confine myself exclusively to these <num value="2">two</num> branches of the resolution, because the portions of it which follow relate to alleged abuses in post-offices, navy-yards, public buildings, and other <orgName n="Public Works" type="works">public works of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2748"/>In such cases inquiries are highly proper in themselves, and belong equally to the <name>Senate</name> and the <rs type="place">House</rs> as incident to their legislative duties, and being necessary to enable them to discover and to provide the appropriate legislative remedies for any abuses which may be ascertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2749"/>Although the terms of the latter portion of the resolution are extremely vague and general, yet my sole purpose in adverting to them at present is to mark the broad line of distinction between the accusatory and the remedial clauses of this resolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2750"/>The <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> possess no power under the <rs>Constitution</rs> over the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> or accusatory portion of the resolution, except as an impeaching body; whilst over the last, in common with the <name>Senate</name>, their authority as a legislative body is fully and cheerfully admitted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2751"/>It is solely in reference to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> or impeaching power that I propose to make a few observations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2752"/>Except in this single case, the <rs>Constitution</rs> has invested the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> with no power, no jurisdiction, no supremacy whatever over the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2753"/>In all other respects he is quite as independent of them as they are of him. As a coordinate branch of the <rs>Government</rs> he is their equal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2754"/>Indeed, he is the only <pb id="p.243" n="243"/> direct representative on earth of the people of all and each of the sovereign States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2755"/>To them, and to them alone, is he responsible whilst acting within the sphere of his constitutional duty, and not in any manner to the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2756"/>The people have thought proper to invest him with the most honorable, responsible, and dignified office in the world, and the individual, however unworthy, now holding this exalted position, will take care, so far as in him lies, that their rights and prerogatives shall never be violated in his person, but shall pass to his successors unimpaired by the adoption of a dangerous precedent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2757"/>He will defend them to the last extremity against any unconstitutional attempt, come from what quarter it may, to abridge the constitutional rights of the <rs>Executive</rs>, and render him subservient to any human power except themselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2758"/>The people have not confined the <rs>President</rs> to the exercise of executive duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2759"/>They have also conferred upon him a large measure of legislative discretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2760"/>No bill can become a law without his approval, as representing the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, unless it shall pass after his veto by a majority of <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of both Houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2761"/>In his legislative capacity he might, in common with the <name>Senate</name> and the <rs type="place">House</rs>, institute an inquiry to ascertain any facts which ought to influence his judgment in approving or vetoing any bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2762"/>This participation in the performance of legislative duties between the coordinate branches of the <rs>Government</rs> ought to inspire the conduct of all of them, in their relations toward each other, with mutual forbearance and respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2763"/>At least each has a right to demand justice from the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2764"/>The cause of complaint is, that the constitutional rights and immunities of the <rs>Executive</rs> have been violated in the person of the <rs>President</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2765"/>The trial of an impeachment of the <rs>President</rs> before the <name>Senate</name> on charges preferred and prosecuted against him by the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, would be an imposing spectacle for the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2766"/>In the result, not only his removal from the <rs type="place">Presidential office</rs> would be involved, but, what is of infinitely greater importance to himself his character, both in the eyes of the present and of future generations, might possibly be tarnished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2767"/>The disgrace cast upon him would in some degree be reflected <pb id="p.244" n="244"/> upon the character of the <rs>American</rs> people who elected him. Hence the precautions adopted by the <rs>Constitution</rs> to secure a fair trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2768"/>On such a trial it declares that <quote>the <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</rs> shall preside.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2769"/>This was doubtless because the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> believed it to be possible that the <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice-President</rs> might be biassed by the fact that <quote>in case of the removal of the <rs>President</rs> from office</quote> <quote>the same shall devolve on the VicePres-ident.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2770"/>The preliminary proceedings in the <rs type="place">House</rs> in the case of charges which may involve impeachment, have been well and wisely settled by long practice upon principles of equal justice both to the accused and to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2771"/>The precedent established in the case of <persName n="Peck,Judge,,,," id="n0244.0013.00244.00971" reg="mostcommon:Peck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Peck</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></dateStruct>, after a careful review of all former precedents, will, I venture to predict, stand the test of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2772"/>In that case, Luke Edward Lawless, the accuser, presented a petition to the <rs type="place">House</rs>, in which he set forth minutely and specifically his causes of complaint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2773"/>He prayed <quote> that the conduct and proceedings in this behalf of said <persName n="Peck,Judge,,,," id="n0244.0013.00244.00972" reg="mostcommon:Peck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Peck</surname></persName> may be inquired into by your honorable body, and such decision made thereon as to your wisdom and justice shall seem proper.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2774"/>This petition was referred to the <orgName n="Judiciary Committee" type="committee">Judiciary Committee</orgName>; such has ever been deemed the appropriate committee to make similar investigations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2775"/>It is a standing committee, supposed to be appointed without reference to any special case, and at all times is presumed to be composed of the most eminent lawyers in the <rs type="place">House</rs> from different portions of the <rs>Union</rs>, whose acquaintance with judicial proceedings, and whose habits of investigation, qualify them peculiarly for the task.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2776"/>No tribunal, from their position and character, could in the nature of things be more impartial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2777"/>In the case of <persName n="Peck,Judge,,,," id="n0244.0013.00244.00973" reg="mostcommon:Peck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Peck</surname></persName> the witnesses were selected by the committee itself, with a view to ascertain the truth of the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2778"/>They were cross-examined by him, and every thing was conducted in such a manner as to afford him no reasonable cause of complaint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2779"/>In view of this precedent, and, what is of far greater importance, in view of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the principles of eternal justice, in what manner has the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> been treated by the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>? <persName n="Covode,Mister,John,,," id="n0244.0013.00244.00974" reg="default:Covode,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Covode</surname></persName>, a representative <pb id="p.245" n="245"/> from <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, is the accuser of the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2780"/>Instead of following the wise precedents of former times, and especially that in the case of <persName n="Peck,Judge,,,," id="n0244.0013.00245.00975" reg="mostcommon:Peck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Peck</surname></persName>, and referring the accusation to the <rs>Committee</rs> on the <name>Judiciary</name>, the <rs type="place">House</rs> have made my accuser <num value="1">one</num> of my judges.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2781"/>To make the accuser the judge is a violation of the principles of universal justice, and is condemned by the practice of all civilized nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2782"/>Every freeman must revolt at such a spectacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2783"/>I am to appear before <persName n="Covode,Mister,,,," id="n0244.0013.00245.00976" reg="nearbymention:Covode,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Covode</surname></persName>, either personally or by a substitute, to cross-examine the witnesses which he may produce before himself to sustain his own accusations against me, and perhaps even this poor boon may be denied to the <rs>President</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2784"/>And what is the nature of the investigation which his resolution proposes to institute?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2785"/>It is as vague and general as the <rs>English</rs> language affords words in which to make it. The committee is to inquire, not into any specific charge or charges, but whether the <rs>President</rs> has, <quote>by money, patronage, or other improper means, sought to influence,</quote> not the action of any individual member or members of Congress, but <quote>the action</quote> of the entire body of Congress itself, <quote>or any committee thereof</quote> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> might have had some glimmering of the nature of the offence to be investigated, had his accuser pointed to the act or acts of Congress which he sought to pass or to defeat by the employment of <quote> money, patronage, or other improper means.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2786"/>But the accusation is bounded by no such limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2787"/>It extends to the whole circle of legislation; to interference <quote>for or against the passage of any law appertaining to the rights of any State or Territory.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2788"/>And what law does not appertain to the rights of some State or Territory And what law or laws has the <rs>President</rs> failed to execute?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2789"/>These might easily have been pointed out had any such existed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2790"/>Had <persName n="Lawless,Mister,,,," id="n0244.0013.00245.00977" reg="mostcommon:Lawless,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lawless</surname></persName> asked an inquiry to be made by the <rs type="place">House</rs> whether <persName n="Peck,Judge,,,," id="n0244.0013.00245.00978" reg="mostcommon:Peck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Peck</surname></persName>, in general terms, had not violated his judicial duties, without the specification of any particular act, I do not believe there would have been a single vote in that body in favor of the inquiry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2791"/>Since the time of the <rs type="place">Star Chamber</rs> and of general warrants, there has been no such proceeding in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2792"/><pb id="p.246" n="246"/></p> 
<p>The <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, the high impeaching power of the country, without consenting to hear a word of explanation, have indorsed this accusation against the <rs>President</rs>, and made it their own act. They even refused to permit a member to inquire of the <rs>President</rs>'s accuser what were the specific charges against him. Thus, in this preliminary accusation of <quote>high crimes and misdemeanors</quote> against a coordinate branch of the <rs>Government</rs>, under the impeaching power, the <rs type="place">House</rs> refused to hear a single suggestion even in regard to the correct mode of proceeding, but, without a moment's delay, passed the accusatory resolutions under the pressure of the previous question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2793"/>In the institution of a prosecution for any offence against the most humble citizen&mdash;and I claim for myself no greater rights than he enjoys&mdash;the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, and of the several States, require that he shall be informed, in the very beginning, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, in order to enable him to prepare for his defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2794"/>There are other principles which I might enumerate, not less sacred, presenting an impenetrable shield to protect every citizen falsely charged with a criminal offence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2795"/>These have been violated in the prosecution instituted by the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> against the executive branch of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2796"/>Shall the <rs>President</rs> alone be deprived of the protection of these great principles, which prevail in every land where a ray of liberty penetrates the gloom of despotism?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2797"/>Shall the. Executive alone be deprived of rights which all his fellow-citizens enjoy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2798"/>The whole proceeding against him justifies the fears of those wise and great men who, before the <rs>Constitution</rs> was adopted by the <name>States</name>, apprehended that the tendency of the <rs>Government</rs> was to the aggrandizement of the legislative at the expense of the executive and judicial departments.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2799"/>I again declare, emphatically, that I make this protest for no reason personal to myself; and I do it with perfect respect for the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, in which I had the honor of serving as a member for <num value="5">five</num> successive terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2800"/>I have lived long in this goodly land, and have enjoyed all the offices and honors which my country could bestow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2802"/>I feel proudly conscious that there is no public act of my life which will not bear the strictest scrutiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2803"/>I defy all investigation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2804"/>Nothing but the basest perjury can sully my good name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2805"/>I do not fear even this, because I cherish an humble confidence that the <rs>Gracious Being</rs> who has hitherto defended and protected me against the shafts of falsehood and malice will not desert me now, when I have become <quote>old and gray-headed.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2806"/>I can declare, before <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and my country, that no human being (with an exception scarcely worthy of notice) has, at any period of my life, dared to approach me with a corrupt or dishonorable proposition; and, until recent developments, it had never entered into my imagination that any person, even in the storm of exasperated political excitement, would charge me, in the most remote degree, with having made such a proposition to any human being.

<text><body> <opener> <salute>To the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>:</salute></opener> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2821"/>In my message to the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> of the <dateStruct value="-03-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> last, I solemnly protested against the creation of a committee, at the head of which was placed my accuser, for the purpose of investigating whether the <rs>President</rs> had <quote>by money, patronage, or other improper means, sought to influence the action of Congress, or any committee thereof, for or against the passage of any law appertaining to the rights of any State or Territory.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2822"/>I protested against this because it was destitute of any specification; because it referred to no particular act to enable the <rs>President</rs> to prepare for his defence; because it deprived him of the constitutional guards which, in common with every citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, he possesses for his protection; and because it assailed his constitutional independence as a coordinate branch of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2823"/>There is an enlightened justice, as well as a beautiful symmetry, in every part of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2824"/>This is conspicuously manifested in regard to impeachments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2825"/>The <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> possesses <quote>the sole power of impeachment;</quote> the <name>Senate</name> <quote>the sole power to try all impeachments;</quote> and the impeachable offences are <quote> treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanors.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2826"/>The practice of the <rs type="place">House</rs>, from the earliest times, had been in accordance with its own dignity, the rights of the accused, and the demands of justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2827"/>At the commencement of each judicial investigation which might lead to an impeachment, specific charges were always preferred; the accused had an opportunity of cross-examining the witnesses, and he was placed in full possession of .the precise nature of the offence which he had to meet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2828"/>An impartial and elevated standing committee was charged with this investigation, upon which no member inspired with the ancient sense of honor and justice would have served, had he ever expressed an opinion against the accused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2829"/>Until the present occasion it was never deemed proper to transform the accuser into the judge, and to confer upon him the selection of his own committee.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2830"/>The charges made against me, in vague and general terms, were of such a false and atrocious character that I did not entertain a moment's apprehension for the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2831"/>They were abhorrent <pb id="p.250" n="250"/> to every principle instilled into me from my youth, and every practice of my life, and I did not believe it possible that the man existed who would so basely perjure himself as to swear to the truth of any such accusations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2832"/>In this conviction I am informed I have not been mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2833"/>In my former protest, therefore, I truly and emphatically declared, that it was made for no reason personal to myself, but because the proceedings of the <rs type="place">House</rs> were in violation of the rights of the coordinate executive branch of the <rs>Government</rs>, subversive of its constitutional independence, and, if unresisted, would establish a precedent dangerous and embarrassing to all my successors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2834"/>Notwithstanding all this, if the committee had not transcended the authority conferred upon it by the resolution of the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, broad and general as this was, I should have remained silent upon the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2835"/>What I now charge is, that they have acted as though they possessed unlimited power, and, without any warrant whatever in the resolution under which they were appointed, have pursued a course not merely at war with the constitutional rights of the <rs>Executive</rs>, but tending to degrade the presidential office itself to such a degree as to render it unworthy of the acceptance of any man of honor or principle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2836"/>The resolution of the <rs type="place">House</rs>, so far as it is accusatory of the <rs>President</rs>, is confined to an inquiry whether he had used corrupt or improper means to influence the action of Congress or any of its committees on legislative measures pending before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2837"/>Nothing more, nothing less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2838"/>I have not learned through the newspapers, or in any other mode, that the committee have touched the other accusatory branch of the resolution, charging the <rs>President</rs> with a violation of duty in failing to execute some law or laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2839"/>This branch of the resolution is therefore out of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2840"/>By what authority, then, have the committee undertaken to investigate the course of the <rs>President</rs> in regard to the <rs>Convention</rs> which framed the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2841"/>By what authority have they undertaker to pry into our foreign relations, for the purpose of assailing him on account of the instructions given by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs> to our Minister in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, relative to the <name>Tehuantepec</name> route?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2842"/>By what authority <pb id="p.251" n="251"/> have they inquired into the causes of removal from office, and this from the parties themselves removed, with a view to prejudice his character, notwithstanding this power of removal belongs exclusively to the <rs>President</rs> under .the <rs>Constitution</rs>, was so decided by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Congress in the year <dateStruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></dateStruct>, and has accordingly ever since been exercised?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2843"/>There is in the resolution no pretext of authority for the committee to investigate the question of the printing of the <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName> blanks, nor is it to be supposed that the <rs type="place">House</rs>, if asked, would have granted such an authority, because this question had been previously committed to <num value="2">two</num> other committees&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> in the <name>Senate</name> and the other in the <rs type="place">House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2844"/>Notwithstanding this absolute want of power, the committee rushed into this investigation in advance of all other subjects.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2845"/>The committee proceeded for months, from <dateStruct value="1860-03-22"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="22">22d</day>, <year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, to examine <hi rend="italics">ex parte</hi>, and without any notice to myself, into every subject which could possibly affect my character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2846"/>Interested and vindictive witnesses were summoned and examined before them; and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and only information of their testimony which, in almost every instance, I received, was obtained from the publication of such portions of it as could injuriously affect myself, in the New York journals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2847"/>It mattered not that these statements were, so far as I have learned, disproved by the most Respectable witnesses who happened to be on the spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2848"/>The telegraph was silent respecting these contradictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2849"/>It was a secret committee in regard to the testimony in my defence, but it was public in regard to all the testimony which could by possibility reflect on my character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2850"/>The poison was left to produce its effect upon the public mind, whilst the antidote was carefully withheld.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2851"/>In their examinations the committee violated the most sacred and honorable confidences existing among men. <rs type="role2">Private</rs> correspondence, which a truly honorable man would never even entertain a distant thought of divulging, was dragged to light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2852"/>Different persons in official and confidential relations with myself, and with whom it was supposed I might have held conversations, the revelation of which would do me injury, were examined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2853"/>Even members of the <name>Senate</name> and members of my own <pb id="p.252" n="252"/> Cabinet, both my constitutional advisers, were called upon to testify, for the purpose of discovering something, if possible, to my discredit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2854"/>The distribution of the patronage of the <rs>Government</rs> is by far the most disagreeable duty of the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2855"/>Applicants are so numerous, and their applications are pressed with such eagerness by their friends both in and out of Congress, that the selection of <num value="1">one</num> for any desirable office gives offence to many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2856"/>Disappointed applicants, removed officers, and those who for any cause, real or imaginary, had become hostile to the administration, presented themselves, or were invited by a summons to appear before the committee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2857"/>These are the most dangerous witnesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2858"/>Even with the best intentions, they are so influenced by prejudice and disappointment, that they almost inevitably discolor truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2859"/>They swear to their own version of private conversations with the <rs>President</rs> without the possibility of contradiction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2860"/>His lips are sealed and he is left at their mercy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2861"/>He cannot, as a coordinate branch of the <rs>Government</rs>, appear before a <orgName n="Investigation Committee" type="committee">committee of investigation</orgName> to contradict the oaths of such witnesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2862"/>Every coward knows that he can employ insulting language against the <rs>President</rs> with impunity, and every false or prejudiced witness can attempt to swear away his character before such a committee without the fear of contradiction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2863"/>Thus for months, whilst doing my best at <num value="1">one</num> end of the avenue to perform my high and responsible duties to the country, has there been a committee of the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> in session at the other end of the avenue, spreading a drag-net, without the shadow of authority from the <rs type="place">House</rs>, over the whole Union, to catch any disappointed man willing to malign my character, and all this in secret conclave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2864"/>The lion's mouth at <placeName key="tgn,7018159" n="1.000 1" reg="venezia,venezia,veneto,italia,europe">Venice</placeName>, into which secret denunciations were dropped, is an apt illustration of the <rs>Covode Committee</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2865"/>The <rs type="place">Star Chamber</rs>, tyrannical and odious as it was, never proceeded in such a manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2866"/>For centuries there has been nothing like it in any civilized country, except the revolutionary tribunal of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 6" reg="france">France</placeName>, in the days of Robespierre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2867"/>Now, I undertake to state and to prove that should the proceedings of the committee be sanctioned by the <rs type="place">House</rs>, and become a precedent for future times, the balance <pb id="p.253" n="253"/> of the <rs>Constitution</rs> will be entirely upset, and there will no longer remain the <num value="3">three</num> coordinate and independent branches of the <rs>Government</rs>&mdash;legislative, executive, and judicial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2868"/>The worst fears of the patriots and statesmen who framed the <rs>Constitution</rs> in regard to the usurpations of the legislative on the executive and judicial branches will then be realized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2869"/>In the language of <persName n="Madison,Mister,,,," id="n0244.0013.00253.00984" reg="mostcommon:Madison,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Madison</surname></persName>, speaking on this very subject, in the <num value="48" type="ordinal">forty-eighth</num> number of the <quote>Federalist:</quote> <quote>In a representative republic, where the executive magistracy is carefully limited both in the extent and duration of its power, and where the legislative power is exercised by an assembly which is inspired, by a supposed influence over the people, with an intrepid confidence in its own strength, which is sufficiently numerous to feel all the passions which actuate a multitude, yet not so numerous as to be incapable of pursuing the objects of its passions by means which reason prescribes, it is against the enterprising ambition of this department that the people ought to indulge all their jealousy and exhaust all their precautions.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2870"/>And in the expressive and pointed language of <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n0244.0013.00253.00985" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, when speaking of the tendency of the legislative branch of Government to usurp the rights of the weaker branches: <quote>The concentrating these in the same hands is precisely the definition of despotic government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2871"/>It will be no alleviation that these powers will be exercised by a plurality of hands, and not by a single <num value="1">one</num>. <num value="173">One hundred and seventy-three</num> despots would surely be as oppressive as <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2872"/>Let those who doubt it turn their eyes on the <rs>Republic</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7018159" n="1.000 1" reg="venezia,venezia,veneto,italia,europe">Venice</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2873"/>As little will it avail us that they are chosen by ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2874"/>An elective despotism was not the government we fought for, but <num value="1">one</num> which should not only be founded on free principles, but in which the powers of government should be so divided and balanced among several bodies of magistracy, as that no <num value="1">one</num> could transcend their legal limits without being effectually checked and controlled by the others.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2875"/>Should the proceedings of the <rs>Covode Committee</rs> become a precedent, both the letter and spirit of the <rs>Constitution</rs> will be violated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2876"/><num value="1">One</num> of the <num value="3">three</num> massive columns on which the whole superstructure rests will be broken down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2877"/>Instead of the executive being a coordinate, it will become a subordinate <pb id="p.254" n="254"/> branch of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2878"/>The presidential office will be dragged into the dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2879"/>The <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> will then have rendered the <rs>Executive</rs> almost necessarily subservient to its wishes, instead of being independent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2880"/>How is it possible that <num value="2">two</num> powers in the <rs>State</rs> can be coordinate and independent of each other, if the <num value="1">one</num> claims and exercises the power to reprove and to censure all the official acts and all the private conversations of the other, and this upon <hi rend="italics">ex parte</hi> testimony before a secret inquisitorial committee&mdash;in short, to assume a general censorship over the others?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2881"/>The idea is as absurd in public as it would be in private life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2882"/>Should the <rs>President</rs> attempt to assert and maintain his own independence, future Covode Committees may dragoon him into submission by collecting the hosts of disappointed office-hunters, removed officers, and those who desire to live upon the public treasury, which must follow in the wake of every administration, and they, in secret conclave, will swear away his reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2883"/>Under such circumstances, he must be a very bold man should he not surrender at discretion and consent to exercise his authority according to the will of those invested with this terrific power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2884"/>The sovereign people of the several States have elected him to the highest and most honorable office in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2885"/>He is their only direct representative in the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2886"/>By their Constitution they have made him commander-in-chief of their army and navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2887"/>He represents them in their intercourse with foreign nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2888"/>Clothed with their dignity and authority, he occupies a proud position before all nations, civilized and savage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2889"/>With the consent of the <name>Senate</name>, he appoints all the important officers of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2890"/>He exercises the veto power, and to that extent controls the legislation of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2891"/>For the performance of these high duties he is responsible to the people of the several States, and not in any degree to the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2892"/>Shall he surrender these high powers, conferred upon him as the representative of the <rs>American</rs> people, for their benefit, to the <rs type="place">House</rs>, to be exercised under their overshadowing influence and control?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2893"/>Shall he alone of all the citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> be denied a fair trial?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2894"/>Shall he alone not be <quote>informed <pb id="p.255" n="255"/> of the nature and cause of the accusation</quote> against him?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2895"/>Shall he alone not <q direct="unspecified">be confronted with the witnesses</q> against him Shall the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, usurping the powers of the <name>Senate</name>, proceed to try the <rs>President</rs>, through the agency of a secret committee of the body where it is impossible he can make any defence, and then, without affording him an opportunity of being heard, pronounce a judgment of censure against him?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2896"/>The very same rule might be applied, for the very same reason, to every judge of every court of the. <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2897"/>From what part of the <rs>Constitution</rs> is this terrible secret inquisitorial power derived?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2898"/>No such express power exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2899"/>From which of the enumerated powers can it be inferred?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2900"/>It is true the <rs type="place">House</rs> cannot pronounce the formal judgment against him of <quote>removal from office,</quote> but they can, by their judgment of censure, asperse his reputation, and thus, to the extent of their influence, render the office contemptible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2901"/>An example is at hand of the reckless manner in which this power of censure can be employed in high party times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2902"/>The <rs type="place">House</rs>, on a recent occasion, have attempted to degrade the <rs>President</rs> by adopting the resolution of <persName n="Sherman,Mister,John,,," id="n0244.0013.00255.00986" reg="default:Sherman,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, declaring that he, in conjunction with the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs>, <quote>by receiving and considering the party relations of bidders for contracts, and the effect of awarding contracts upon pending elections, have set an example dangerous to the public safety, and deserving the re. proof of this <name>House</name>.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2903"/>It will scarcely be credited that the sole pretext for this vote of censure was the simple fact that in disposing of the numerous letters of every imaginable character which I daily receive, I had, in the usual course of business, referred a letter from <persName n="Patterson,Colonel,,,," id="n0244.0013.00255.00987" reg="mostcommon:Patterson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Patterson</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, in relation to a contract, to the attention of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs>, the head of the appropriate department, without expressing or intimating any opinion whatever on the subject; and to make the matter, if possible, still plainer, the <rs>Secretary</rs> had informed the committee that <hi rend="italics"><quote>the <rs>President</rs> did not in any manner interfere in this case, nor has he in any other case of contract since I have been in the department.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2904"/></hi> The absence of all proof to sustain this attempt to degrade the <rs>President</rs>, whilst it manifests the <pb id="p.256" n="256"/> venom of the shaft aimed at him, has destroyed the vigor of the bow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2905"/>To return, after this digression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2906"/>Should the <rs type="place">House</rs>, by the institution of <persName n="Covode,,,,," id="n0244.0013.00256.00988" reg="nearbymention:Covode,John,,,"><surname>Covode</surname></persName> committees, votes of censure, and other devices to harass the <rs>President</rs>, reduce him to subservience to their will, and render him their creature, then the well-balanced Government which our fathers framed will be annihilated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2907"/>This conflict has already been commenced in earnest by the <rs type="place">House</rs> against the <rs>Executive</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2908"/>A bad precedent rarely if ever dies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2909"/>It will, I fear, be pursued in the time of my successors, no matter what may be their political character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2910"/>Should secret committees be appointed with unlimited authority to range over all the words and actions, and, if possible, the very thoughts of the <rs>President</rs>, with a view to discover something in his past life prejudicial to his character, from parasites and informers, this would be an ordeal which scarcely any mere man since the fall could endure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2911"/>It would be to subject him to a reign of terror from which the stoutest and purest heart might shrink.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2912"/>I have passed triumphantly through this ordeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2913"/>My vindication is complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2914"/>The committee have reported no resolution looking to an impeachment against me; no resolution of censure; not even a resolution pointing out any abuses in any of the executive departments of the <rs>Government</rs> to be corrected by legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2915"/>This is the highest commendation which could be bestowed on the heads of these departments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2916"/>The sovereign people of the <name>States</name> will, however, I trust, save my successors, whoever they may be, from any such ordeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2917"/>They are frank, bold, and honest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2918"/>They detest delators and informers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2919"/>I therefore, in the name and as the representative of this great people, and standing upon the ramparts of the <rs>Constitution</rs> which they <quote>have ordained and established,</quote> do solemnly protest against these unprecedented and unconstitutional proceedings.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2920"/>There was still another committee raised by the <rs type="place">House</rs> on the <dateStruct value="-03-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> last, on motion of <persName n="Hoard,Mister,,,," id="n0244.0013.00256.00989" reg="mostcommon:Hoard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hoard</surname></persName>, to which I had not the slightest objection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2921"/>The resolution creating it was confined to specific charges, which I have ever since been ready and willing to meet I have at all times invited and defied fair investigation upon constitutional principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2922"/>I have received <pb id="p.257" n="257"/> no notice that this committee have ever proceeded to the investigation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2923"/>Why should the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> desire to encroach on the other departments of the <rs>Government</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2924"/>Their rightful powers are ample for every legitimate purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2925"/>They are the impeaching body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2938"/><orgName n="Our Flag" type="newspaper">Our flag</orgName> had been insulted, and numerous injuries had been inflicted on the persons and property of American citizens by <persName><foreName>Spanish</foreName></persName> officials acting under the direct control of the <rs type="role" reg="Captain-General">Captain General</rs> of <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2939"/>These gave rise to many but unavailing reclamations for redress and indemnity against the <rs>Spanish Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2940"/>Our successive ministers at <placeName key="tgn,7010413" n="1.000 2" reg="madrid,madrid,madrid,espana,europe">Madrid</placeName> had for years ably presented and enforced these claims, but all without effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2941"/>Their efforts were continually baffled on different pretexts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2942"/>There was a class of these claims called the <q direct="unspecified">Cuban claims,</q> of a nature so plainly just that they could not be gainsayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2943"/>In these more than <num value="100">one hundred</num> of our citizens were directly interested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2944"/>In <dateStruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></dateStruct> duties had been illegally exacted from their vessels at different custom houses in <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName>, and they appealed to their Government to have these duties refunded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2945"/>Their amount could be easily ascertained by the <name>Cuban</name> officials themselves, who were in possession of all the necessary documents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2946"/>The validity of these claims was <pb id="p.259" n="259"/> eventually recognized by <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, but not until after a delay of <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>. The amount due was fixed, according to her own statement, with which the claimants were satisfied, at the sum of <measure n="128635.54dollars" type="currency">$128,635.54</measure>. Just at the moment when the claimants were expecting to receive this amount without further delay, the <rs>Spanish Government</rs> proposed to pay, not the whole, but only <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of it, and this provided we should accept it in full satisfaction of the entire claim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2947"/>They added that this offer was made, not in strict justice, but as a special favor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2948"/>Under these circumstances, the time had arrived when the <rs>President</rs> deemed it his duty to employ strong and vigorous remonstrances to bring all our claims against <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> to a satisfactory conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2949"/>In this he succeeded in a manner gratifying to himself, and it is believed to all the claimants, but unfortunately not to the <orgName n="United States Senate" type="senate">Senate of the United States</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2950"/>A convention was concluded at <placeName key="tgn,7010413" n="1.000 2" reg="madrid,madrid,madrid,espana,europe">Madrid</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="1860-03-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> <month reg="03">March</month>, <year>1860</year>,</dateStruct> establishing a joint commission for the final adjudication and payment of all the claims of the respective parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2951"/>By this the validity and amount of the <name>Cuban</name> claims were expressly admitted, and their speedy payment was placed beyond question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2952"/>The convention was transmitted to the <name>Senate</name> for their constitutional action on the <dateStruct value="1860-05-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> <month reg="05">May</month>, <year>1860</year>,</dateStruct> but on the <dateStruct value="-06-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> they determined, greatly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2953"/>to the surprise of the <rs>President</rs>, and the disappointment of the claimants, that they would <q direct="unspecified">not advise and consent</q> to its ratification.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2954"/>The reason for this decision, because made in executive session, cannot be positively known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2955"/>This, as stated and believed at the time, was because the convention had authorized the <rs>Spanish Government</rs> to present its Amistad claim, like any other claim, before the <orgName n="Commissioners Board" type="board">Board of Commissioners</orgName> for decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2956"/>This claim, it will be recollected, was for the payment to the <rs>Spanish</rs> owners of the value of certain slaves, for which the <rs>Spanish Government</rs> held the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to be responsible under the treaty with <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> of the <dateStruct value="1795-10-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1795">1795</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2957"/>Such was the evidence in its favor, that <num value="3">three</num> <rs type="role" reg="President">Presidents</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had recommended to Congress to make an appropriation for its payment, and a bill for this purpose had passed the <name>Senate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2958"/>The validity of the claim, it is proper to observe, was not recognized <pb id="p.260" n="260"/> by the convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2959"/>In this respect it was placed on the same footing with all the other claims of the parties, with the exception of the <name>Cuban</name> claims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2960"/>All the <rs>Spanish Government</rs> obtained for it was simply a hearing before the <name>Board</name>, and this could not be denied with any show of impartiality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2961"/>Besides, it is quite certain that no convention could have been concluded without such a provision.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2962"/>It was most probably the extreme views of the <name>Senate</name> at the time against slavery, and their reluctance to recognize it even so far as to permit a foreign claimant, although under the sanction of a treaty, to raise a question before the <name>Board</name> which might involve its existence, that caused the rejection of the convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2963"/>Under the impulse of such sentiments, the claims of our fellow-citizens have been postponed if not finally defeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2964"/>Indeed, the <name>Cuban</name> claimants, learning that the objections in the <name>Senate</name> arose from the <rs>Amistad</rs> claim, made a formal offer to remove the difficulty by deducting its amount from the sum due to them, but this of course could not be accepted.</p></div2>

<p>The question presented by the letters you have sent me is the most momentous which has ever been offered to my contemplation since that of independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3204"/>That made us a nation; this sets our compass and points the course which we are to steer through the ocean of time opening on us; and never could we embark on it under circumstances more auspicious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3205"/>Our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and fundamental maxim should be, never to entangle ourselves in the broils of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

She should, therefore, have a system of her own, separate and apart from that of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3208"/>While the last is laboring to become the domicile of despotism, our endeavor should surely be to make our hemisphere that of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3209"/><num value="1">One</num> nation, most of all, could disturb us in this pursuit; she now offers to lead, aid, and accompany us in it. By acceding to her proposition, we detach her from the band of despots, bring her mighty weight into the scale of free government, and emancipate a continent at <num value="1">one</num> stroke, which might otherwise linger long in doubt and difficulty, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> is the nation which can do us the most harm of any <num value="1">one</num>, or all on <pb id="p.279" n="279"/> earth; and with her on our side, we need not fear the whole world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3210"/>With her, then, we should most sedulously cherish a cordial friendship; and nothing would tend more to knit our affections than to be fighting once more, side by side, in the same cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3211"/>Not that I would purchase even her amity at the price of taking part in her wars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3212"/>But the war in which the present proposition might engage us, should that be its consequence, is not her war, but ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3213"/>Its object is to introduce and establish the <rs>American</rs> system of keeping out of our land all foreign powers, of never permitting those of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to intermeddle with the affairs of our nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3214"/>It is to maintain our own principle, not to depart from it; and if, to facilitate this, we can effect a division in the body of the <rs>European</rs> powers, and draw over to our side its most powerful member, surely we should do it. But I am clearly of <persName n="Canning,Mister,,,," id="n0244.0014.00279.01094" reg="mostcommon:Canning,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Canning</surname></persName>'s opinion, that it will prevent instead of provoking war.

For how would they propose to get at either enemy without superior fleets?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3215"/>Nor is the occasion to be slighted which this proposition offers, of declaring our protest against the atrocious violations of the rights of nations, by the interference of any <num value="1">one</num> in the internal affairs of another, so flagitiously begun by <persName n="Bonaparte,,,,," id="n0244.0014.00279.01095" reg="mostcommon:Bonaparte,nomatch:0"><surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName>, and now continued by the equally lawless alliance calling itself holy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3216"/>But we have <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to ask ourselves a question: Do we wish to acquire to our own confederacy any <num value="1">one</num> or more of the <rs>Spanish</rs> provinces?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3217"/>I candidly confess that I have ever looked on <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName> as the most interesting addition which could ever be made to our system of States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3218"/>The control which, with <placeName reg="Florida Point, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,2332600">Florida point</placeName>, this island would give us over the <placeName reg="Gulf of Mexico" key="tgn,7021009">Gulf of Mexico</placeName>, and the countries and isthmus bordering on it, as well as all those whose waters flow into it, would fill up the measure of our political well-being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3219"/>Yet as I am sensible that this can never be obtained, even with her own consent, but by war; and its independence, which is our <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> interest (and especially its independence of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>), can be secured without it, I have no hesitation in abandoning my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> wish to future chances, and <pb id="p.280" n="280"/> accepting its independence, with peace and the friendship of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, rather than its association at the expense of war and her enmity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3220"/>I could honestly, therefore, join in the declaration proposed, that we aim not at the acquisition of any of those possessions, that we will not stand in the way of any amicable arrangement between them and the mother country; but that we will oppose, with all our means, the forcible interposition of any other power, as auxiliary, stipendiary, or under any other form or pretext, and most especially their transfer to any power by conquest, cession, or acquisition in any other way. I should think it, therefore, advisable that the <rs>Executive</rs> should encourage the <rs>British Government</rs> to a continuance in the dispositions expressed in these letters, by an assurance of his concurrence with them as far as his authority goes; and that, as it may lead to war, the declaration of which requires an act of Congress, the case shall be laid before them for consideration, at their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meeting, and under the reasonable aspect in which it is seen by himself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3221"/>I have been so long weaned from political subjects, and have so long ceased to take any interest in them, that I am sensible I am not qualified to offer opinions on them worthy of any attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3222"/>But the question now proposed involves consequences so lasting, and effects so decisive of our future destinies, as to rekindle all the interest I have heretofore felt on such occasions, and to induce me to the hazard of opinions which will prove only my wish to contribute still my mite toward any thing which may be useful to our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3223"/>And praying you to accept it at only what it is worth, I add the assurance of my constant and affectionate friendship and respect.</p></quote> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3329"/>At the opening of your present session I called your attention to the dangers which threatened the existence of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3330"/>I expressed my opinion freely concerning the original causes of those dangers, and recommended such measures as I believed would have the effect of tranquillizing the country and saving it from the peril in which it had been needlessly and most unfortunately involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3331"/>Those opinions and recommendations I do not propose now to repeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3332"/>My own convictions upon the whole subject remain unchanged.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3333"/>The fact that a great calamity was impending over the nation was even at that time acknowledged by every intelligent citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3334"/>It had already made itself felt throughout the length and breadth of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3335"/>The necessary consequences of the alarm thus produced were most deplorable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3336"/>The imports fell off with a rapidity never known before, except in time of war, in the history of our foreign commerce; the <name>Treasury</name> was unexpectedly left without the means which it had reasonably counted upon to meet the public engagements; trade was paralyzed; manufactures were stopped; the best public securities suddenly sunk in the market; every species of property depreciated more or less; and <num value="1000">thousands</num> of poor men, who depended upon their daily labor for their daily bread, were turned out of employment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3337"/>I deeply regret that I am not able to give you any information upon the state of the <rs>Union</rs> which is more satisfactory than what I was then obliged to communicate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3338"/>On the contrary, matters are still worse at present than they then were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3339"/>When Congress met, a strong hope pervaded the whole public mind that some amicable adjustment of the subject would speedily be made by the representatives of the <name>States</name> and of the people, which might restore peace between the conflicting <pb id="p.292" n="292"/> sections of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3340"/>That hope has been diminished by every hour of delay; and as the prospect of a bloodless settlement fades away, the public distress becomes more and more aggravated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3341"/>As evidence of this, it is only necessary to say that the treasury notes authorized by the act of <dateStruct value="-12-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> last were advertised, according to the law, and that no responsible bidder offered to take any considerable sum at par at a lower rate of interest than <num value="0.12">twelve per cent.</num> From these facts it appears that, in a government organized like ours, domestic strife, or even a well-grounded fear of civil hostilities, is more destructive to our public and private interests than the most formidable foreign war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3342"/>In my annual message I expressed the conviction, which I have long deliberately held, and which recent reflection has only tended to deepen and confirm, that no State has a right by its own act to secede from the <rs>Union</rs>, or throw off its Federal obligations at pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3343"/>I also declared my opinion to be that, even if that right existed and should be exercised by any State of the confederacy, the <orgName n="Department of the Executive" type="government">executive department</orgName> of this government had no authority under the <rs>Constitution</rs> to recognize its validity by acknowledging the independence of such State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3344"/>This left me no alternative, as the chief executive officer under the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, but to collect the public revenues and to protect the public property so far as this might be practicable under existing laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3345"/>This is still my purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3346"/>My province is to execute, and not to make the laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3347"/>It belongs to Congress, exclusively, to repeal, to modify, or to enlarge their provisions, to meet exigencies as they may occur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3348"/>I possess no dispensing power.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3349"/>I certainly had no right to make aggressive war upon any State, and I am perfectly satisfied that the <rs>Constitution</rs> has wisely withheld that power even from Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3350"/>But the right and the duty to use military force defensively against those who resist the <rs>Federal</rs> officers in the execution of their legal functions, and against those who assail the property of the <rs>Federal</rs> government, is clear and undeniable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3351"/>But the dangerous and hostile attitude of the <name>States</name> toward each other has already far transcended and cast in the shade the ordinary executive duties already provided for by law, and has assumed such vast and alarming proportions as to place the subject entirely above and beyond executive control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3352"/>The fact cannot be disguised that we are in the midst of a great revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3353"/>In all its various bearings, therefore, I commend the question to Congress, as the only human tribunal, under <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, possessing the power to meet the existing <pb id="p.293" n="293"/> emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3354"/>To them, exclusively, belongs the power to declare war, or to authorize the employment of military force in all cases contemplated by the <rs>Constitution</rs>; and they alone possess the power to remove grievances which might lead to war, and to secure peace and union to this distracted country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3355"/>On them, and on them alone, rests the responsibility.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3356"/>The Union is a sacred trust left by our revolutionary fathers to their descendants; and never did any other people inherit so rich a legacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3357"/>It has rendered us prosperous in peace and triumphant in war. The National flag has floated in glory over every sea. Under its shadow American citizens have found protection and respect in all lands beneath the sun. If we descend to considerations of purely material interest, when, in the history of all time, has a confederacy been bound together by such strong ties of mutual interest?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3358"/>Each portion of it is dependent on all, and all upon each portion, for prosperity and domestic security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3359"/>Free trade throughout the whole supplies the wants of <num value="1">one</num> portion from the productions of another, and scatters wealth everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3360"/>The great planting and farming States require the aid of the commercial and navigating States to send their productions to domestic and foreign markets, and to furnish the naval power to render their transportation secure against all hostile attacks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3361"/>Should the <rs>Union</rs> perish in the midst of the present excitement, we have already had a sad foretaste of the universal suffering which would result from its destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3362"/>The calamity would be severe in every portion of the <rs>Union</rs>, and would be quite as great, to say the least, in the <rs>Southern</rs> as in the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3363"/>The greatest aggravation of the evil, and that which would place us in the most unfavorable light both before the world and posterity, is, as I am firmly convinced, that the secession movement has been chiefly based upon a misapprehension at the <rs>South</rs> of the sentiments of the majority in several of the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3364"/>Let the question be transferred from political assemblies to the ballot-box, and the people themselves would speedily redress the serious grievances which the <rs>South</rs> have suffered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3365"/>But, in Heaven's name, let the trial be made before we plunge into armed conflict upon the mere assumption that there is no other alternative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3366"/>Time is a great conservative power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3367"/>Let us pause at this momentous point and afford the people, both <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, an opportunity for reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3368"/>Would that <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> had been convinced of this truth before her precipitate action!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3369"/>I, therefore, appeal through you to the people of the country to declare in their might that <pb id="p.294" n="294"/> the <rs>Union</rs> must and shall be preserved by all constitutional means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3370"/>I most earnestly recommend that you devote yourselves exclusively to the question how this can be accomplished in peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3371"/>All other questions, when compared with this, sink into insignificance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3372"/>The present is no time for palliatives; action, prompt action, is required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3373"/>A delay in Congress to prescribe or to recommend a distinct and practical proposition for conciliation may drive us to a point from which it will be almost impossible to recede.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3374"/>A common ground on which conciliation and harmony can be produced is surely not unattainable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3375"/>The proposition to compromise by letting the <rs>North</rs> have exclusive control of the territory above a certain line, and to give Southern institutions protection below that line, ought to receive universal approbation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3376"/>In itself, indeed, it may not be entirely satisfactory; but when the alternative is between a reasonable concession on both sides and a destruction of the <rs>Union</rs>, it is an imputation upon the patriotism of Congress to assert that its members will hesitate for a moment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3377"/>Even now the danger is upon us. In several of the <name>States</name> which have not yet seceded, the forts, arsenals, and magazines of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have been seized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3378"/>This is by far the most serious step which has been taken since the commencement of the troubles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3379"/>This public property has long been left without garrisons and troops for its protection, because no person doubted its security under the flag of the country in any State of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3380"/>Besides, our small army has scarcely been sufficient to guard our remote frontiers against <name>Indian</name> incursions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3381"/>The seizure of this property, from all appearances, has been purely aggressive, and not in resistance to any attempt to coerce a State or States to remain in the <rs>Union</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3382"/>At the beginning of these unhappy troubles I determined that no act of mine should increase the excitement in either section of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3383"/>If the political conflict were to end in a civil war, it was my determined purpose not to commence it, nor even to furnish an excuse for it by an act of this government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3384"/>My opinion remains unchanged, that justice as well as sound policy requires us still to seek a peaceful solution of the questions at issue between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3385"/>Entertaining this conviction, I refrained even from sending reenforcements to <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0244.0016.00294.01122" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, who commanded the forts in <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName>, until an absolute necessity for doing so should make itself apparent, lest it might unjustly be regarded as a menace of military coercion, and thus furnish, if not a provocation, a pretext for an outbreak on <pb id="p.295" n="295"/> the part of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3386"/>No necessity for these reenforcements seemed to exist.
