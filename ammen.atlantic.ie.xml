<head>Preface.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>in acceding to a request to write the following pages, the writer had to regret that a brother officer had not undertaken the task, in the belief that the result would have more fully met the expectations of the public. With the view of presenting the facts as clearly as possible, the writer has not spared himself in the examination of whatever was within his reach, and trusts he may thus escape the just criticism of the intelligent reader, the more, too, as these sheets have received in advance of publication the criticism of several of the more prominent actors in the scenes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>The writer is indebted to an able friend for the criticism that these pages are largely made up of quotations, which is certainly the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>This method has been adopted to give occurrences from every point of view obtainable where the quotation is apposite and not designed to be deceptive or meretricious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>They sometimes differ considerably and honestly; each, however, is intended to present the occurrence from a given point of view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>To these have been added such comment, narration, or connection as seemed pertinent and likely to afford the reader as clear an insight of the occurrence as may be possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>The writer would have gladly substituted a written detail and referred to his authorities <pb id="p.-002" n="-002"/> had he supposed that it would be equally interesting and profitable to the reader, as compared with diverse statements honestly made and from as many points of view as there were intelligent observers to be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Official reports have been carefully examined, and, indeed, form almost wholly the basis of what is presented.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>It is desired to avoid exaggeration and adulation, as far as possible, leaving as it were to the reader to put on the gloss, or enthusiastic appreciation, with his own hand, and to present the facts without prejudice to friend or foe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>It is for the reader to assign the merit of the men engaged, sometimes under trying difficulties, whether it be in victory, in lack of actual success, or in defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The public can of course more readily appreciate brilliant success than a lack of it, yet oftentimes a less measure of success does not measure a less degree of professional skill or of courage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The publishers purpose presenting the naval operations during our civil war in <num value="3">three</num> volumes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> would naturally comprise events precedent and immediate, and as many of these transpired within the <name>Capes</name> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, they and matters of primary interest, and matters relating to blockaders and blockade-runners, will be found in the volume written by <persName n="Soley,Professor,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00002.00001" reg="mostcommon:Soley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Soley</surname></persName>, <orgName n="U. S. Navy" type="org">U. S. Navy</orgName>. This volume, which may be regarded as the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, treats of naval operations from <placeName reg="Cape Hatteras, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,3000601">Cape Hatteras</placeName> to <placeName reg="Cape Florida, Dade, Florida" key="tgn,1010697">Cape Florida</placeName>, along the coasts, and within the sounds, rivers, and harbors of this watershed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>As an actuality, <num value="2">two</num> centres of operations existed : the <num value="1">one</num> at <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>, the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t of supplies and usual headquarters of the <orgName n="South Atlantic Blockading Squadron" type="squadron">South Atlantic Blockading Squadron</orgName>; the other within the sounds, and on the coast of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, over <pb id="p.-003" n="-003"/> which the <orgName n="North Atlantic Blockading Squadron" type="squadron">North Atlantic Blockading Squadron</orgName> held watch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>In order to avoid confusion, the events of each section are treated separately.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It may be added that the writer commanded a vessel in the <rs n="Battle of Port Royal" type="battle">battle of Port Royal</rs> and in subsequent operations along that coast until <dateStruct value="1863-05-"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, and was also present in the <num value="2">two</num> bombardments of <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>. He is under many obligations to the <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName>, to the <name>Chiefs</name> of Bureau of Ordnance and Construction, and to <persName n="Scott,Colonel,Robert,N.,," id="n-0001.0001.00003.00002" reg="default:Scott,Robert,N.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName> <foreName>N.</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The centres of direction of aggressive action were in the <rs>South</rs>, and of defence against them in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/><placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> had vauntingly sent her uniformed company <q direct="unspecified">to defend her rights</q> far away from her own soil, and the <rs>North</rs> had sent arms and men to resist force by force.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The violent unquiet element of the <rs>South</rs> had fully determined that the election of <persName n="Lincoln,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0002.00001.00004" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:3"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to the <name>Presidency</name> was in itself a cause of war, and it had so organized and armed its forces as to bear down any reasonable consideration of the differences between the <num value="2">two</num> sections; nay, more, it had, aided by the demagogues of that section, constrained the men of thought and of character to accept the action of these men as embodying their own ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>In coming centuries the remarkable address of <persName n="Stephens,,Alexander,H.,," id="n-0001.0002.00001.00005" reg="default:Stephens,Alexander,H.,,"><foreName>Alexander</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName> at <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> <placeName reg="Milledgeville, Baldwin, Georgia" key="tgn,2023617">Milledgeville, Ga.</placeName>, on the <dateStruct value="1860-11-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month>, <year>1860</year>,</dateStruct> will be read as a clear exposition of the actual political differences that were magnified by demagogues into what were urged as monstrous wrongs, and abuses that war only could terminate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>After the election of <persName n="Lincoln,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0002.00002.00006" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:3"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, <persName n="Buchanan,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0002.00002.00007" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>, in his last message to Congress, favored, as far as he could, the attempted separation of the <name>States</name>, by denying <q direct="unspecified">the right of coercion</q> to the general Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>During the remainder of his administration the heads of the <name>Departments</name> generally so disposed the officers, war material, and the naval vessels in commission, as to best serve the <rs>Confederates</rs> when hostilities became an actuality.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The unhappy days rolled on, and at length <persName n="Lincoln,Mr.,,,," id="n-0001.0002.00002.00008" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:3"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was inaugurated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>State after State passed acts of secession, and others that were actually prepared to follow, cried <q direct="unspecified">no coercion</q> or, <q direct="unspecified">neutrality</q> as the price of remaining in the <rs>Union</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>At <placeName reg="Cummings Point, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2271638">Cummings Point</placeName>, the nearest land to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> at the entrance to <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName>, a battery had been erected during <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>March</month></dateStruct>, for the avowed purpose of reducing that work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>When the attack was made, or rather after <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> had fallen, on the <dateStruct value="1861-04-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> the <rs>President</rs> called on the different States to furnish <num value="75000">75,000</num> men for a period of <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>. This was met by scorn and derision in all the bordering slave States, and <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> at once passed her act of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Then it was, that the mask that had not concealed, and yet had been respected by the general Government, was thrown off by the conspirators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>A prominent Navy officer then on duty at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> said to those under him, even before this event, <q direct="unspecified">The Government is virtually dissolved; there is the semblance of <num value="1">one</num>, nothing more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Disorder reigns everywhere, <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> except in the <rs>South</rs>, where a stable Government is already established, which will ere long receive acquisitions of membership in the <name>States</name> to which you belong.

Would you meanly serve another people when your States have gone, even though no war grows out of the separation, or would you be base enough, for your selfish ends to do so, were there a war against the people from whom you have sprung, to whom you are allied, and whom you can now serve so well?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/></p> 
<p>For days and even weeks the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> gave no sign nor token, and when at last it did, insidious speciousness of presentation had done sad work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Many able and unselfish officers, without a thought of treason, or without desire to do wrong or to do violence to the <rs>Government</rs>, found themselves, rather unwittingly than venally, in the toils of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>These conditions prevailed at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and Southward, both in the army and the navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Those officers who were deemed most likely to be influenced to suit the ends of the conspirators, had been placed, as said before, within favoring districts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>On the <dateStruct value="1861-03-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> <persName n="Toucey,,Isaac,,," id="n-0001.0002.00003.00010" reg="default:Toucey,Isaac,,,"><foreName>Isaac</foreName> <surname>Toucey</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Connecticut" key="tgn,7007159">Connecticut</placeName>, who had been <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs> for the <num value="4">four</num> previous years, was succeeded by <persName n="Welles,,Gideon,,," id="n-0001.0002.00003.00011" reg="default:Welles,Gideon,,,"><foreName>Gideon</foreName> <surname>Welles</surname></persName>, of the same State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>He remained in that position for the <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> following.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Within a few days after the attack on <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, of the <num value="78">78</num> captains on the active list, <num value="12">12</num> resigned or were dismissed; of <num value="114">114</num> commanders, <num value="39">39</num>; of <num value="321">321</num> lieutenants, <num value="73">73</num>.<note anchored="yes">

Many others, belonging to States that had already seceded, had previously resigned.</p></note> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The Confederates had been organizing their forces for months, and menaced <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Norfolk Navy Yard">Norfolk Navy Yard</placeName>. It was absolutely a matter of doubt under the actual circumstances whether they might not accomplish the possession of all of these places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It was of the utmost importance to the inchoate Confederacy to get possession of the <placeName reg="Norfolk Navy Yard">Norfolk Navy Yard</placeName> and secure the large amount of ordnance stored there and to establish a good line of defence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Nothing could more effectually serve their purpose than the pretended loyalty of the officers remaining attached to the <placeName reg="Navy Yard">Navy Yard</placeName> who effectively cajoled the <name>Commandant</name>, who was old and feeble, and actually distracted by reason of the turmoil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>At the final moment he was left alone, without <num value="1">one</num> officer, and with but <num value="40">40</num> marines attached to the <name type="place">Yard</name> to support his authority.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The attack on <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> and its surrender affected the people of the <rs>North</rs> and of the <rs>South</rs> quite differently; while those who captured the fort boasted that they had <q direct="unspecified">finished the war,</q> the people of the <rs>North</rs> awoke to a painful realization of the fact that a war existed that must be fought to the end, and they girded up their loins as best they could; but <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> the <rs>North</rs> was long in attaining that intensity of purpose that is so potent when untrained bodies of troops meet in conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> was regarded in the public mind, <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, as the citadel of the fortress, the incarnation of rebellion, and as such it was attacked and defended.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Failing in the fleet attack, with grim satisfaction, after a time the men of the <rs>North</rs> saw its walls crumble and fall from the fire of guns <measure n="4000yards" type="distance">four thousand yards</measure> away, until from their point of view, it had no longer shape nor semblance of a fort, nor was a single piece of ordnance permitted to stand upon what had once been its walls; but the satisfaction of the <rs>North</rs> was not complete until, in the most formal manner, the flag that had been hauled down, <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> to the day and hour from that event, again floated over the mass of ruins known as <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>In the confusion at the <rs>North</rs>, growing out of numerous resignations hastily sent in, abandonment of duty on the part of others, and in some cases of treachery, it is not to be wondered that the <placeName reg="Norfolk Navy Yard">Norfolk Navy Yard</placeName> fell into the hands of the <rs>Confederates</rs>, with its <num value="3000">three thousand</num> cannon, its fine dry dock, numerous well-appointed workshops, material, and small arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>It is not too much to say now, that it should have been held at any cost of life, long enough at least to have destroyed the cannon, workshops, and ships.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>There is an extenuating fact that may be stated as a partial justification of officers who were recreant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>For half a century perhaps, there had existed a kind of culture of fealty to a State, instead of to the <rs>Government</rs> which they served; it was paraded as a dogma, and was in a degree acknowledged by some officers from the <rs>South</rs> in the military service of the <rs>Government</rs>, more than half of whom, prior to the <rs>Civil War</rs>, either came from the slave States or had married within them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Able and educated men, acknowledging this <q direct="unspecified">doctrine,</q> <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> thought they had only to resign to hopelessly embarrass the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>There was certainly for a time great confusion, and in the case of the <placeName reg="Norfolk Yard">Norfolk Yard</placeName>, great loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The difficulties are very properly stated in the <name>Report</name> of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs>, before referred to.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/><q direct="unspecified">With so few vessels in commission on our coast, and our crews in distant seas, the <name>Department</name> was very indifferently prepared to meet the exigency that was rising.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Every moment was closely watched by the disaffected, and threatened to precipitate measures that the country seemed anxious to avoid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Demoralization prevailed among the officers, many of whom, occupying the most responsible positions, betrayed symptoms of that infidelity that has dishonored the service.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/></p> 
<p>Turning to the vessels of the navy in commission, we find that they had been placed as far as possible in positions to render them least available.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> had only a month before entered a Northern port; the commander, a <orgName n="South Carolinian" type="newspaper">South Carolinian</orgName>, had loitered off the coast apparently undecided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>After reaching port he remarked to an officer of the vessel that he had hesitated whether to obey his orders or go to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, and was quite thunderstruck when told that his hesitation had been observed and he would have been put in irons had he made the attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Several of the vessels in Southern ports or at <placeName reg="Vera Cruz, Douglas, Missouri" key="tgn,2744101">Vera Cruz</placeName> were commanded by Southern officers, who it was supposed would deliver their vessels into the hands of the <rs>Confederates</rs>, but principle or policy was sufficient to spare such an attempted national disgrace.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>The vessels entering were not long in replying to the guns of the enemy; with carefully studied elevations and well-directed aim, the heavy shells fell fast within the earthworks, burying themselves and exploding, throwing sand into the guns, covering platforms and gun-traverses with sand, and disturbing much the accuracy of aim and rapidity of fire of the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>However that may be, seeing the vessels again returning, the <rs>Seneca</rs> was again headed toward them from a position just reached north of <placeName key="tgn,2391938" n="1.000 6" reg="hilton head, beaufort, south carolina">Fort Walker</placeName>, and on her opening fire, they entered <placeName reg="Scull Creek, Norton, Kansas" key="tgn,2649932">Scull Creek</placeName>, the entrance to which has no great depth and is intricate; it is situated <placeName><distance reg="4miles">four miles</distance> <offset>northwest</offset> of  <placeName key="tgn,2391938" n="1.000 6" reg="hilton head, beaufort, south carolina">Fort Walker</placeName></placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Having passed beyond the point which would admit of training the guns, again they turned, and heading into the harbor continued their broadsides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>This was too much for troops not habituated to the use of heavy guns nor trained to war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Before the vessels entered, they saw in the cannon which they served what they fancied and believed a sufficient means to sink or destroy a fleet, and yet, with painful slowness and automaton-like regularity it swept around, delivering broadsides of shells with surprising rapidity, exploding them on the parapets and within their works, covering them up alive, as it were, in what they called their <q direct="unspecified">sacred soil.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Their guns were struck and broken or dismounted, guns' crews killed or wounded, and the mighty engines of yesterday seemed to have no potency to-day, wielded as they supposed deftly, but in reality clumsily.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>On the evening of <dateStruct value="-01-29"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg="29">29th</day></dateStruct>, the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 176">One Hundred and Seventy-sixth Regiment</orgName> <orgName type="mil" key="PAMilitia">Pennsylvania Militia</orgName> (with which we are connected) left <placeName reg="Morehead City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2075757">Morehead City, N.

Upon the morning of the <dateStruct value="--31"><day reg="31">31st</day></dateStruct>, when near <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, could hear firing distinctly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>Upon our arrival off the harbor, which was at about <time value="8:30am">8.30 A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>The distance from land at which they were was estimated to be from <num value="4">four</num> to <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure>; and although the morning was somewhat hazy, yet the land could be plainly seen on each side of the harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>We were right in the midst of the fleet, so near as to be able to carry on a conversation with the <rs>Housatonic</rs>&mdash;were boarded by officers from it and the <placeName reg="Quaker City, Berks, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2602782">Quaker City</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>Being thus near the site of the engagement, and so soon after it came off, we do not hesitate in the least to pronounce the statement that the blockade was raised not only absurd, but utterly and wilfully false in every particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>And the statement of the <rs>English Consul</rs> and the commander of the <rs>Petrel</rs>, that the squadron could not be seen even with the aid of powerful glasses is <num value="1">one</num> equally false, and <num value="1">one</num> that impels us to conclude that it would require a powerful glass, truly, to be able to discover <num value="1">one</num> particle of truth or honesty in the composition of these gentlemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/><pb id="p.80" n="80"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>We, the undersigned officers, commanding various vessels of the <orgName n="Blockading Squadron" type="squadron">blockading squadron</orgName> off <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, have seen the proclamation of <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0005.00080.00285" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,G.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> and <persName n="Ingraham,Commodore,,,," id="n-0001.0005.00080.00286" reg="nearbymention:Ingraham,D.,N.,,"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Ingraham</surname></persName>, herewith appended, as also the results of the so-called engagements, viz.: <num value="2">two</num> vessels sunk, <num value="4">four</num> set on fire, and the remainder driven away; and also the statement that the <rs>British Consul</rs> and the commander of the <name n="United Kingdom">British</name> <term type="ship">war-steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Petrel</rs> had previously gone <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> beyond the usual anchorage of the blockaders, and could see nothing of them with their glasses.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>We deem it our duty to state that the so-called results are <hi rend="italics">false in every particular</hi>. No vessels were sunk, none were set on fire seriously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/><num value="2">Two</num> vessels alone were injured of consequence: the <rs>Mercedita</rs> had her boiler exploded by a shell from the only gun fired at her, when surprised by an attack by night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>A thick haze was prevailing; and the <rs>Keystone State</rs> also had her steam-chest injured at the moment of attempting to run down <num value="1">one</num> of the rams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>The Keystone State was at once assisted by the <rs>Memphis</rs>, which vessel exchanged shots with the iron ram as she was withdrawing toward the bar, after having fired at the <rs>Keystone State</rs>, as did also the <placeName reg="Quaker City, Berks, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2602782">Quaker City</placeName>. So hasty was the retreat of the rams, that, although they might have perceived that the <rs>Keystone State</rs> had received serious damage, no attempt was ever made to approach her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>The <rs>Stettin</rs> and <rs>Ottawa</rs>, at the extreme end of the line, did not get under way from their position till after the firing had ceased, and the <rs>Stettin</rs> merely saw the <hi rend="italics">black smoke</hi> as the rams disappeared over the <pb id="p.81" n="81"/> bar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>The Flag was alongside the <rs>Mercedita</rs> after, it seems, she had yielded to the ram, supposing herself sinking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>The rams withdrew hastily toward the harbor, and on their way were fired at by the <rs>Housatonic</rs> and <rs>Augusta</rs>, until both had got beyond reach of their guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>They anchored under the protection of their forts, and remained there.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>No vessel, <hi rend="italics">ironclad or other</hi>, passed out over the bar after the return of the rams in shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>The Unadilla was not aware of the attack until the <rs>Housatonic</rs> commenced firing, when she moved at toward that vessel from her anchorage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>The <rs>Housatonic</rs> was never <hi rend="italics">beyond the usual line of blockade</hi>. The <placeName reg="Quaker City, Berks, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2602782">Quaker City</placeName>, in the forenoon, picked up her anchor which she had slipped to repair to the point of firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>The Flag communicated with the <rs type="role" reg="senior-Officer">senior officer</rs> on board the <rs type="ship">Housatonic</rs> that forenoon, soon after the firing ended, and the blockade continued as before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>No vessel ran in or out of the port that day, <hi rend="italics">nor was any attempt made to run the blockade</hi>. The Keystone State necessarily was ordered to <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> for repairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>The Unadilla returned to her usual anchorage, after communicating with the <rs type="role" reg="senior-Officer">senior officer</rs>, where she remained during the day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/><hi rend="italics">Throughout the day <num value="2">two</num> small tug-boats</hi> remained apparently in attendance on the rams, under cover of <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Forts Moultrie</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2096117" n="1.000 4" reg="lands end, beaufort, south carolina">Beauregard</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>These are facts, and we do not hesitate to state that no vessel did come out beyond the bar after the return of the rams, at between <time value="7">7</time> and <time value="8am">8 A. M.</time>, to the cover of the forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>We believe the statement that any vessel came anywhere near the usual anchorage of the blockaders, <hi rend="italics">or up to the bar</hi>, after the withdrawal of the rams, to be deliberately and knowingly false.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>If the statement from the papers, as now before us, has the sanction of the captain of the <rs>Petrel</rs> and the foreign consuls, we can only deplore that foreign officers can lend their official positions to the spreading before the world, for unworthy objects, <hi rend="italics">untruths</hi>, patent to every officer of this squadron. </p><closer><signed><persName n="Taylor,,William,Rodgers,," id="n-0001.0005.00081.00287" reg="default:Taylor,William,Rodgers,,"><foreName n="William">Wm.</foreName> <foreName>Rodgers</foreName>  <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>, <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>The reader may well wonder at the several preceding pages; the proclamation and the refutation at such length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-named shows that however able and brave the officers were who signed it, they did not limit their devotion to <hi rend="italics">fighting</hi> for the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; they were willing to go far beyond that.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>The refutation is inserted somewhat maliciously, to embarrass such persons as either believe what they choose, or assert a belief in what is absurd in itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>In the face of the character of the blockading force off the bar at that time, with <num value="3">three</num> exceptions so entirely destructible by such vessels as the rams, it seems unaccountable that they did not remain outside of the bar during the day at least.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>These Confederate rams never ventured out again, although <persName n="Ingraham,Flag-Officer,,,," id="n-0001.0005.00082.00296" reg="nearbymention:Ingraham,D.,N.,,"><roleName n="Flag-Officer">Flag-Officer</roleName> <surname>Ingraham</surname></persName> states in his report that they were not struck by a projectile during the raid.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>The construction of such vessels at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> must have been imperfect from a lack of plant of suitable materials, and of skilled workmen.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>From the experience in the capture of the <rs>Atlanta</rs>, it may be regarded certain that their casemates would not have resisted Xv-inch shells.</p></note> The wonder is, that under so man disadvantages, they should have ventured to construct any vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>In every case the labor was without compensating result, if we except the structure on the hull of the <term type="ship">frigate</term> <rs type="ship">Merrimac</rs>, known as the <rs>Virginia</rs> to the <rs>Confederates</rs>, which, after the destruction of the sailing <term type="ship">frigates</term> <rs type="ship">Congress</rs> and <rs type="ship">Cumberland</rs> at <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName>, was soon after consigned to the flames as a result of the fall of <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.

<p>Soon after this raid, the New Ironsides, then at anchor in <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>, a vessel built under far more favorable auspices than could obtain within the limits of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, was added to the blockading force off <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>We may suppose, without derogation to the enemy, that she exercised a powerful restraining influence on the <name n="Confederate States">Confederate</name> rams within that port.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>The enemy, as we have seen, having felt the power of guns afloat where many of them could be brought to bear, no longer contested inferior points of defence, and fully aware of an intended attack on <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> and under an apprehension of attack on <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, turned his attention to strengthening the defences of those cities by every means within his power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2358"/>In his report, the fleet-captain attributes <q direct="unspecified">the failure of the assault to the absence of the marines from their position, as their fire would have enabled our boarders to use their <pb id="p.239" n="239"/> cutlasses and pistols most effectively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2359"/>By this I would imply the lack of proper organization, it being impossible in the short space of time, on account of so many small squads of men from the different vessels in <num value="1">one</num> mass, lacking proper company formations, and wholly unacquainted with each other, to secure such organization.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2409"/>the <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName> had an immense work to perform in the civil war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2410"/>Except so far as the purchase abroad of vessels of war was concerned, it had the markets of the world to supply its wants without impediment, and it had money without stint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2411"/>That <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars should have been wasted was a probable, not to say an inevitable result of a lack of preparation, and of empiricism, as shown in the construction of the <name>Chimo</name> and her <num value="20">twenty</num> counterparts, known as the <q direct="unspecified">totally submerged class of monitors.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2412"/>The defect of the latter was radical; no professional doctors could cure or even better them; their office was <q direct="unspecified">to lie in cold obstruction and to rot.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2413"/>All that appears in these pages relating to them is given in the language of the <name>Department</name>, without comment.</p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2415"/>There are teachings that seem to belong to war exclusively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2416"/><pb id="p.246" n="246"/> Officers learned to anchor vessels anywhere off the <placeName reg="Southern coast">Southern coast</placeName>, where they rode out with safety the heaviest gales that swept those waters during <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, and they learned to appreciate the advantage of carrying a heavy kedge on the quarter, ready to let go instantly when operating in narrow waters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2417"/>They learned, too, what was new then, the power of rifled guns at long distances against brick or stone forts, and also that wooden vessels armed with heavy spherical shell-guns, aided by a few ironclads, can smother and control the fire from an earthwork when brought within <measure n="1600yards" type="distance">sixteen hundred yards</measure> of it, or better at <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> that distance; and further, that if vessels attack an earthwork there should be no cessation until the troops advance to the assault.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2418"/>To the general, as well as the professional reader who has followed the writer through these pages, a few ideas are ventured in connection with the civil war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2419"/>Accepting the political conditions as existent facts presented by the late <persName n="Stephens,,Alexander,H.,," id="n-0001.0012.00246.01011" reg="default:Stephens,Alexander,H.,,"><foreName>Alexander</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName> in his remarkable address at <placeName reg="Milledgeville, Baldwin, Georgia" key="tgn,2023617">Milledgeville, Ga.</placeName>, on <dateStruct value="1860-11-14"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="14">14</day>, <year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, the reader is lost in wonder that a sanguinary war of <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> duration could have followed, without other inciting causes than those so fairly and clearly stated by him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2420"/>Hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of men perished in battle or by disease through exposure; hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of men, women, and children, many of them former slaves, died from violence, exposure, and want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2421"/><num value="1000">Thousands</num> of <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars were spent in war, by the <rs>North</rs> and by the <rs>South</rs>, and when the forces of the latter laid down their arms, they were absolutely without resources; many of the inhabitants in various sections would have suffered greatly, or actually perished, had not the gratuitous private charity of the <rs>North</rs> supplied shiploads of provisions immediately after the cessation of hostilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2422"/><pb id="p.247" n="247"/></p> 
<p>No <num value="1">one</num> can deny the fact that the <rs>South</rs> commenced and continued the war with the utmost intensity of purpose, worthy of a sense of the most poignant wrongs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2423"/>It is most difficult to reconcile this fact with the plain statements of <persName n="Stephens,,,,," id="n-0001.0012.00247.01012" reg="nearbymention:Stephens,Alexander,H.,,"><surname>Stephens</surname></persName>, which were not, and never can be, fairly controverted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2424"/>In view of all this, does it not appear that the civil war was the result of prejudices, of obliquity, and misconceptions, the output of a long-continued material prosperity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2425"/>Mankind after a time regard this as a normal condition, which is far from the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2426"/>With the <rs n="Jewish people" type="religion">Jews</rs> of old the image of the <rs>Golden Calf</rs> seems but the symbol of great material prosperity, bringing in its train woes and repentance in sackcloth and ashes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2427"/><measure n="18years" type="date">Eighteen years</measure> have passed since the <orgName n="Confederate Forces" type="org">Confederate forces</orgName> laid down their arms and returned to their homes unharmed, nor has a human being been held to accountability for all the wretchedness and misery produced by the civil war; and yet we find that prejudices, unfounded and without reason, are still paraded as facts, and as justifications of a long and sanguinary struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2428"/>May we not say, as a rational deduction, that the prejudices of men far outweigh their reason?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2429"/>These reflections grew out of a conversation with a lifelong friend that has lately passed away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2430"/>He had been a large slave-owner, and a kind and considerate <num value="1">one</num>; the comfortable cabins and the happy faces of the occupants, and the attention given them in sickness and in health could not fail to be observed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2431"/>The gentleman referred to was opposed to secession, yet when the many around him insisted on war, he took up arms, and bravely did his part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2432"/>When the war was over he was broken down in fortune and no longer young, but his courage did not forsake him, and he bravely <pb id="p.248" n="248"/> and honestly struggled to supply the necessities that existence imposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2433"/>Sitting in the gloam of the evening, a few years ago, he said: <q direct="unspecified">Had we succeeded in our efforts, our troubles would have but begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2434"/><placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> on the <num value="1">one</num> side, and <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> on the other, would have seceded from <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, and we would have been a dismembered people.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2435"/>In sadness and in toil he had passed many succeeding years, and these were his final reflections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2436"/>May we not properly&mdash;nay, can we do other than give to such men our entire sympathy, and, in all sincerity, extend the hand of fellowship?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2437"/>He was a man of thought, of courage, of action, and of purpose; it is not given to the vulgar to be possessed of such qualities, whether it be the rich or the poor vulgar, whether it be the educated or the uneducated vulgar.
