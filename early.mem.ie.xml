<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>This was my last <quote>warlike exploit</quote> for many years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>After this we remained near the sea-coast, inactive for the most of the time, until late in the spring, when, as all active hostilities had ceased, we were marched across to <placeName reg="Tampa Bay, Florida, United States" key="tgn,1113893">Tampa Bay</placeName>, from whence my company, with some other troops, was shipped to New Orleans, and then sent up the <placeName key="tgn,7022231" n="1.000 1584" reg="mississippi river">Mississippi</placeName>, <placeName reg="Ohio River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7014265">Ohio</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tennessee River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2715022">Tennessee Rivers</placeName> to <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Ross' Landing</placeName> (now <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>) to report to <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n0015.0001.00000.00024" reg="nearbymention:Scott,John,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, who had charge of the removal of the <name>Cherokees</name>, with whom some difficulty was apprehended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It had not been my purpose to remain permanently in the army, and, as there was to be no difficulty with the <name>Cherokees</name>, and the <rs>Seminole War</rs> was thought to be <pb id="p.iv" n="iv"/> at an end, I determined to resign for the purpose of going into civil life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>I tendered my resignation and received a leave of absence until it could be acted on.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>I was met by a courier with orders to halt where I was, as the alarm, upon which the order to me had been founded, had proved false. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>As this false alarm was rather singular in its nature, but of such a character that any general might have been deceived by it, I will state how it occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>A captain of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Ewell,General,,,," id="n0015.0003.00013.00164" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,Richard,S.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Ewell</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, who had been posted with his company on picket at <placeName reg="Yates' Ford">Yates' Ford</placeName> not far below <placeName reg="Manassas National Battlefield Park, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Union Mills</placeName>, retired from his post and reported in the most positive manner that the enemy had appeared in heavy force on the opposite bank of <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> and commenced building <num value="2">two</num> bridges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>He further stated that he had seen <persName n="McDowell,General,,,," id="n0015.0003.00013.00165" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McDowell</surname></persName> on a white horse superintending the construction of the bridges. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>As there was no reason to doubt his veracity or courage, <persName n="Ewell,General,,,," id="n0015.0003.00013.00166" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,Richard,S.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Ewell</surname></persName>, of course, sent at once the information to <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0015.0003.00013.00167" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,GeneraMl,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> and hence the order for my movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>After the message was dispatched, something suggested a doubt as to the correctness of the report, and the officer making it was sent in charge of another to ascertain the facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>On arriving in sight of the ford he pointed triumphantly to the opposite bank and exclaimed, <quote>There they are. Don't you see the <num value="2">two</num> bridges, don't you see <persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n0015.0003.00013.00168" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,nomatch:0"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName> on his white horse?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>when the fact was there was nothing visible but the ford and the unoccupied banks of the stream, which were so obstructed as to render a crossing impracticable until the obstructions were removed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>It was then apparent that it was a clear case of hallucination, produced by a derangement of the nervous system, consequent on a loss of sleep and great anxiety of mind resulting from the nature of the duties in which he had been engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>Neither his sincerity nor his courage was questioned, and this affair shows how the most careful commander may be misled when he has to rely on information furnished by others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>It requires very great experience and a very discriminating judgment to enable a commanding general to sift the truth <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> out of the great mass of exaggerated reports made to him, and hence he has often to rely on his own personal inspection. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>I have known important movements to be suspended on the battlefield, on account of reports from very gallant officers that the enemy was on <num value="1">one</num> flank or the other in heavy force, when a calm inspection proved the reported bodies of the enemy to be nothing more than stone or rail fences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>Some officers, while exposing their lives with great daring, sometimes fail to preserve that clearness of judgment and calmness of the nerves which is so necessary to enable <num value="1">one</num> to see things as they really are during an engagement; and hence it is that there are so many conflicting reports of the same matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>The capacity of preserving <num value="1">one</num>'s presence of mind in action is among the highest attributes of an efficient commander or subordinate officer, and it must be confessed that the excitement of battle, especially when the shells are bursting and the bullets whistling thick around, is wonderfully trying to the nerves of the bravest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The false alarm out of which the above reflections have sprung, operated as a very great relief to my command, as it enabled my men, who had had very little to eat, and scarcely any rest or sleep for <num value="2">two</num> nights and days, to cook provisions and get a good rest and sleep in the woods where they were halted, and thereby to be prepared to go through the extraordinary fatigues of the next day. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>I cannot better explain the truth of the matter than by giving the following extract of a letter from <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0015.0005.00035.00378" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> himself to me, which is in entire accordance with the facts coming within my knowledge on the field as far as they go, and will not be doubted by any <num value="1">one</num> who knows <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0015.0005.00035.00379" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>As soon as we met I expressed to him my determination to attack next morning, because it was not improbable that <persName n="Patterson,,,,," id="n0015.0005.00035.00381" reg="mostcommon:Patterson,nomatch:0"><surname>Patterson</surname></persName> might come up <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>I accepted the argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>This, however, left him under me, and was the command of a small fraction of troops.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>Claims were put forward in behalf of several commands for the credit of having saved the day and secured the victory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>It is rather surprising to observe that erroneous views often prevail in regard to the relative merits of different commands, engaged in bearing respectively very necessary parts in an action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>If a small force has been fighting obstinately for hours against great odds, until it has become exhausted and is beginning to give way, and then fresh troops come up and turn the tide of battle, the latter are said to have gained the day and often reap all the glory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>It is not likely to be considered, that, but for the troops whose obstinate fighting enabled the fresh ones to come up in time, the day would have been irretrievably lost before the appearance of the latter.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>At this battle, but for the cavalry which watched the enemy's movements and gave timely notice to <persName n="Evans,,,,," id="n0015.0005.00037.00405" reg="mostcommon:Evans,nomatch:0"><surname>Evans</surname></persName> so that he could move to the left and check the advance of <persName n="Hunter,,,,," id="n0015.0005.00037.00406" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,Andrew,,,:2"><surname>Hunter</surname></persName>, the day would probably have been lost at the outset.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>I do not claim to have won or saved the day with my command, but I think it will be conceded by all who read the reports of <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0015.0005.00038.00418" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> and <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0015.0005.00038.00419" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,GeneraMl,,,"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, that the arrival of that command and the cool and deliberate manner in which my men formed in line, under fire and in full view of the enemy, and their advance had a material effect in thwarting the last effort of the enemy to flank our line and in precipitating his retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>The fact is that all the troops engaged in the battle were necessary to prevent defeat and secure victory, and each command in its proper sphere may be said to have saved the day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>All the troops engaged, except <orgName n="regiment"><persName n="Cocke,,,,," id="n0015.0005.00041.00441" reg="mostcommon:Cocke,Philip,St.,George,:1"><surname>Cocke</surname></persName>'s regiment</orgName>, the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA19">19th Virginia</orgName>, the <num value="2">two</num> regiments with <persName n="Kershaw,,,,," id="n0015.0005.00041.00442" reg="mostcommon:Kershaw,Strasburg,,,:1"><surname>Kershaw</surname></persName>, and my command, were so much exhausted and shattered by the desperate conflict in which they had participated, that they made no attempt at pursuit and were incapable of any. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>Our cavalry consisted of <num value="1">one</num> organized regiment of <num value="9">nine</num> companies, and a number of unattached companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>This cavalry was armed principally with shot guns and very inferior sabres, and was without the discipline and drill necessary to make that arm effective in a charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>Moreover it had been necessarily scattered on the flanks and along the line, to watch the enemy and give information of his movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>It could not readily be concentrated for the purpose of an efficient pursuit, and the attempts made in that direction were desultory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>By light on the morning of the <dateStruct value="--22"><day reg="22">22nd</day></dateStruct>, the greater part of the enemy's troops were either in the streets of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> or under the protection of the guns at <placeName reg="Arlington Heights, Weber, Utah" key="tgn,2137140">Arlington Heights</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>The question then arises whether, by pursuit on the morning of the <dateStruct value="--22"><day reg="22">22nd</day></dateStruct>, <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> could have been captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>And I will here call attention to some facts which <pb id="p.42" n="42"/> seem entirely to have escaped the attention of the critics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/><placeName key="tgn,2595792" n="1.000 2" reg="potomac river">The Potomac</placeName> is at least a mile wide at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> and navigable to that place for the largest vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>The only means of crossing the river, except in vessels, are by the <rs type="place">Long Bridge</rs>, the aqueduct on the <rs>Chesapeake</rs> &amp; <placeName reg="Ohio Canal, Ohio, United States" key="tgn,1136027">Ohio Canal</placeName> at <placeName reg="Georgetown, Washington, District of Columbia" key="tgn,7015724">Georgetown</placeName>, and the chain bridge above <placeName reg="Georgetown, Washington, District of Columbia" key="tgn,7015724">Georgetown</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>The <rs type="place">Long Bridge</rs> is an old wooden structure with at least <num value="1">one</num> draw and perhaps <num value="2">two</num> in it, and could have been easily destroyed by fire, besides being susceptible of being commanded through its entire length by vessels of war lying near <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, where there were some out of range of any guns we would have brought to bear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>The aqueduct is long and narrow with a channel for the water, which we could not have turned off as it runs from the northern side of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, and a narrow towpath on the side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/><num value="1">One</num> piece of artillery at its northern end could have effectually prevented the passing of troops over it, and besides it could have been easily ruined and some of the spans blown up, so as to render it impassable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>The chain bridge is a wooden structure and could have been easily burned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>If therefore the entire Federal Army had fled across the river on our approach, we could not have crossed it near <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>The largest pieces of artillery we had, capable of being transported, were small field pieces of which the heaviest for solid shot were <num value="6">six</num> pounders, and we had no Howitzer larger than a <num value="24">twenty-four</num> pounder if we had any of that size.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>None of our guns were of sufficient range to reach across the river into the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>If, therefore, we had advanced at once upon <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> and the <rs>Federal Army</rs> had fled across the river on our approach, abandoning the city itself, still we could not have entered it, unless the bridges had been left intact; and it is not to be supposed that <persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n0015.0005.00042.00443" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,nomatch:0"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName>, <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n0015.0005.00042.00444" reg="mostcommon:Scott,John,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, and all the officers of the regular army, were so badly frightened and demoralized that they would have fled on our approach, and omitted to destroy the approaches to the city, even if such had <pb id="p.43" n="43"/> been the case with the volunteers, the civil authorities, and the <rs>Congress</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>All the bridges above, to and beyond <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, had been burned, and the nearest ford to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, over which at low water it is possible for infantry to pass, is <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">White's Ford</placeName>, several miles above <placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg</placeName>, and <placeName><distance reg="40miles">forty miles</distance> from <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>We had nothing in the shape of pontoons, and it would have been impossible to have obtained them in any reasonable time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>I had occasion, in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, to make myself acquainted with the character of the <rs>Potomac</rs> and its crossing at and above <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, and what I state here is not mere speculation.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>I have heard some wiseacres remark that if we had gone on, we could have entered <hi rend="italics">pell-mell</hi> with the enemy into <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>To have done that, if possible, we would have had to keep up with the enemy, and I don't think any <num value="1">one</num> supposes that a solitary soldier in our army could have reached the banks of the <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Potomac</placeName> by daylight the morning after the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>It is possible to cross a bridge of a few yards in length, or enter through the gates of a city pell-mell with an army, but no <num value="1">one</num> ever heard of that thing being done on a bridge more than a mile in length and with a draw raised in the middle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>The truth is that, while the enemy's retreat was very disorderly and disgraceful, some of his troops retained their organization and the condition of things at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> was not quite as bad as represented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>Spectators in the city, seeing the condition of the fugitives thronging the streets, and the panic of the civilians, may have well supposed that the whole army was disorganized, and so utterly demoralized that it would have fled on <pb id="p.44" n="44"/> the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> cry that the <quote>rebels are coming,</quote> but if <persName n="McDowell,General,,,," id="n0015.0005.00044.00447" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McDowell</surname></persName> and his officers are to be believed, there still remained on the southern bank of the <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Potomac</placeName> a considerable force in fighting condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>The strength of our army at this time, as well as on all other occasions, has been greatly exaggerated even by Southern writers; its organization was very imperfect, many of the troops not being brigaded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>If we had advanced, <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> would probably have fallen into our hands without a struggle, and we might have forced the enemy to evacuate his works south of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, but very likely not until after a fight in which our loss would have been greater than the object to be accomplished would have justified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>We might have transferred our line to the banks of the <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Potomac</placeName>, but we could not have held it, and would eventually have been compelled to abandon it with greater damage to us than the evacuation of the line of <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> caused. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>So much for the question as between the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs> and the cavillers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>But there is another phase of it, in which a staff officer of <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0015.0005.00044.00452" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,GeneraMl,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, writing for a Northern journal, has endeavored to raise an issue between that general and the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>I have before shown that <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0015.0005.00044.00453" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, as commander of the army, was the responsible person, and I believe he has never attempted to evade the responsibility.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>The point made against the <rs>Government</rs> is that <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0015.0005.00045.00455" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> could and would have been taken, if the <rs>President</rs>, <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, and the heads of the <rs type="role" reg="Quartermaster">Quarter-master</rs> and Commissary Departments had furnished sufficient transportation and supplies, though it is admitted that <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0015.0005.00045.00456" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:3"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> left the question of an advance entirely to his generals. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>Now in regard to transportation, we had an abundance of wagons to carry all the ammunition needed, and for gathering in provisions, and if the bridges on the railroad had not been burned, we might have moved our depot to <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> as we moved, provided we could have advanced to that point, as the enemy had repaired the railroad to <orgName n="Fairfax Station" type="station">Fairfax Station</orgName>, and had not interfered with it on his retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>The burning of the bridges on the railroad did not impede the progress of the enemy before the battle, as he did not march on it and <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> was fordable anywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>That burning could only have served the purpose of obstructing the use of the railroad by the enemy in the event of our defeat, which with his means of reconstruction would have been but a very few days, and it did not obstruct our movements for a much longer time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>At the time of the battle, the county of <placeName key="tgn,7015770" n="1.000 39" reg="loudoun, virginia, united states">Loudoun</placeName> on the <rs>Virginia</rs> side of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, and the whole <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">State of Maryland</placeName>, were teeming with supplies, and we could have readily procured all the transportation needed from the citizens, if we had not taken it from the enemy, which would probably have been the case if an advance had been practicable otherwise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>Certain it is, that in <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, after the <rs n="Second Battle of Manassas" type="battle">second battle of Manassas</rs>, when the enemy's army had been defeated, not routed, and was still vastly superior in number and equipment to our own, we did not hesitate a moment about supplies, though our army was without rations and <persName n="Fairfax,,,,," id="n0015.0005.00045.00457" reg="mostcommon:Fairfax,nomatch:0"><surname>Fairfax</surname></persName> and <placeName key="tgn,7015770" n="1.000 22" reg="loudoun, virginia, united states">Loudoun</placeName> had been nearly exhausted of their grain and cattle; but taking only transportation for the ammunition and the cooking utensils, and sending <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> the rest of our trains to the valley, except wagons to gather up flour, we marched across the <rs>Potomac</rs> into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, our men and officers living principally on green corn and beef without salt or bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>Neither was our army prevented from making the movement into <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, for fear of not getting provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>We depended upon taking them from the enemy and the country through which we marched, and did thus procure them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>The alleged difficulties in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> would have been no difficulties in <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, or <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>These were not the real difficulties which prevented the capture of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> after the battle of the <dateStruct value="-07-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, and the issue which is attempted to be made with the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> is therefore an idle <num value="1">one</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>These remarks are not made with the slightest purpose of disparaging in any way <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0015.0005.00046.00458" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,GeneraMl,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, for whom I have great regard and admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>When he ordered the burning of the bridge over <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, he had reason to apprehend that his comparatively small force would have to encounter <persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n0015.0005.00046.00459" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,nomatch:0"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName>'s whole army before any reinforcements arrived to his assistance, and he had therefore good grounds to regard this as a precaution which the circumstances warranted and demanded. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>The foregoing reflections and comments are such as my subsequent experience and observation have enabled me to make, and I do not pretend that a tittle of them occurred to me at the time. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>Both of our generals, notwithstanding their inexperience in command, displayed extraordinary energy and capacity in thwarting the plans of a veteran commander, whom the country at that time regarded as <num value="1">one</num> of the ablest military chieftains of the age.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>Preparations, however, were commenced at once for sending the stores and baggage to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>Owing to the fact that our army had remained stationary so long, and the inexperience in campaigning of our troops, there had been a vast accumulation of private baggage by both officers and men; and when it became necessary to change a camp it was the work of <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>Congress had been tampering for some time with the question of reorganizing the army and supplying the place of the <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> volunteers, which composed much the greater part of our army; and several schemes had been started and adopted with little or no success and much damage to the army itself, until finally it was found necessary to adopt a <orgName n="General Conscription" type="misc">general conscription</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>If this scheme had been adopted in the beginning, it would have readily been acquiesced in, but when it was adopted much dissatisfaction was created by the fact that it necessarily violated promises and engagements made with those who had re-enlisted under some of the former schemes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>The reorganization which took place resulted in a very great change in the officers, especially among the field-officers, all of whom were appointed by election, and as may well be supposed this state of things added nothing to the efficiency of the army or its morals. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>All of the enemy's cavalry visible was in the field in this valley, and the position where my command was posted was hidden from its view by an intervening ridge, which crossed the road diagonally from the woods into the fields and fell off into the low grounds on the small branch mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/>No infantry had yet been discovered, <pb id="p.95" n="95"/> and we were in doubt whether the enemy had any in the vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>On the left of the road was a long, narrow meadow on the branch, and as my brigade could not march along the road except by flank, nor without great difficulty through the woods if deployed in line, I determined to form it in the meadow out of view of the enemy, and then advance obliquely across the road, against his cavalry, following it through the fields on a route parallel to the road. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>The brigade was formed in line in the meadow, on the north of the branch, with the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA13">13th Virginia</orgName>, under <persName n="Walker,Colonel,,,," id="n0015.0010.00095.00870" reg="mostcommon:Walker,James,A.,,:6"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName>, thrown out as skirmishers to cover the front and flank of the left of the brigade, which had to pass obliquely through the corner of the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>It then advanced to the ridge behind which the enemy's cavalry was posted, the right regiment (<orgName type="regiment" key="GA12">12th Georgia</orgName>) moving by flank so as to avoid observation, and forming in line as it reached the ridge, when the whole moved over the crest and came in view of the cavalry, which scampered off in a great hurry, receiving as it went a slight volley at long range, by which <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> saddles were emptied. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>The brigade then swung around to the left and moved forward in line for about <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of a mile, until we reached a farm road leading from <placeName><persName n="Crittenden,Mrs.,,,," id="n0015.0010.00095.00871" reg="mostcommon:Crittenden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName>'s house</placeName> on our right across the <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName> road, <persName n="Walker,Colonel,,,," id="n0015.0010.00095.00872" reg="mostcommon:Walker,James,A.,,:6"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName> still continuing to cover the left, by moving with his regiment extended as skirmishers into the woods across the road, until we came to the farm road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>At this latter point the <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName> road emerged from the woods and ran along the left of a field in our front, by the side of the woods to its termination, where it passed between a cornfield on the right and a wheatfield on the left.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>No infantry had yet been seen, but the boldness with which the cavalry confronted us and the opening of the batteries, satisfied me that we had come upon a heavy force, concealed behind the ridge on which the cavalry was drawn up, as the ground beyond was depressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>I therefore halted the brigade, causing the men to cover themselves as well as they could by moving back a little and lying down, and then sent word for <persName n="Winder,General,,,," id="n0015.0010.00096.00874" reg="mostcommon:Winder,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Winder</surname></persName> to come up.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>Immediately to my right and a little advanced, was a clump of cedars, and from that point the ground sloped off to our right to a bottom on a prong of <placeName reg="Slaughter Mountain, Rappahannock, Virginia" key="tgn,2668881">Cedar Run</placeName>, the whole country between us and <placeName reg="Slaughter Mountain, Rappahannock, Virginia" key="tgn,2668881">Slaughter's Mountain</placeName> consisting of open fields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>The northern end of the mountain was opposite my right and about a mile distant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>On my left was the woods mentioned, which was very dense and extended for a considerable distance to the left. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>In front of this woods, about a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> from my left, was the wheat field, in a hollow, or small valley, and immediately in my front was the cornfield, and a small branch ran from the wheatfield through the cornfield, to which the ground sloped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>On the farther side of the wheatfield was the high ridge on which the enemy's cavalry was formed, and beyond which his batteries were posted; and it extended across the road into the fields on the right, but was wooded on the left of the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>It was on and behind this ridge the enemy's batteries were posted, and it was in the low ground beyond that I supposed, and it subsequently turned out, his infantry was masked. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>Immediately after sending for <persName n="Winder,General,,,," id="n0015.0010.00096.00876" reg="mostcommon:Winder,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Winder</surname></persName>, I sent back for some artillery, but this request had been anticipated, <pb id="p.97" n="97"/> and <persName n="Brown,Captain,,,," id="n0015.0010.00097.00877" reg="nearbymention:Brown,William,F.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, with <num value="1">one</num> piece, and <persName n="Dement,Captain,,,," id="n0015.0010.00097.00878" reg="mostcommon:Dement,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Dement</surname></persName>, with <num value="3">three</num> pieces of their respective batteries of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> artillery, soon came dashing up, and were posted at the clump of cedars on my right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>They immediately opened on the enemy's cavalry and his batteries, causing the former speedily to retire through the woods over the ridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>Those guns continued to be served with great efficiency during the action and rendered most effectual service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1260"/>The situation was most critical and the necessity most pressing, as it was apparent that if the enemy got possession of this woods, possession of the hills in their rear would immediately follow, and then, across to our rear on the road leading back to the <rs>Potomac</rs>, would have been easy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2317"/>We were, therefore, under the necessity of retreating, not because our army had been demoralized by a defe%+, but because our supply of ammunition had become short, and it was difficult to subsist our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2394"/>After a time this was changed, and from motives of humanity the prisoner's life was spared and he became by the laws of war, even among the most civilized nations, the slave of his captor &mdash; his enslavement being justified on the ground that it was a boon to him to spare his life at the expense of his liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2395"/>The justice of this rule is recognized in Holy Writ itself, and the rule continued to prevail long after the commencement of the <orgName n="Christian Era" type="newspaper">Christian era</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2396"/>In the age of chivalry a modification of the rule prevailed, and a prisoner was allowed to ransom himself, when he could raise the means of doing so. In more modern times the system of paroles was adopted, and the prisoner was allowed to go at large upon pledging his honor not to take up arms against his captors until regularly exchanged, the penalty of a forfeiture of his parole being death if again captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2397"/>This is a contract between the prisoner and his captors, which his government <pb id="p.289" n="289"/> is bound to respect in the interests of humanity, by the recognition of all civilized nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2398"/>It is not necessary for him to receive the permission of his government or his leader to give his parole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2399"/>When he is a captive, he is beyond the power and protection of either and has a right to stipulate for his individual safety against the penalties of death, slavery, or imprisonment by neutralizing his services for the time being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2400"/>If his contract is not respected by his government, what must be the consequence? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2401"/>When <num value="2">two</num> nations or parties are at war, the object of each is to destroy the physical power of the other, in order to obtain peace, or accomplish the object for which the war is undertaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2402"/>If <num value="1">one</num> party is so situated that it cannot hold, or cannot support its prisoners, and the other will neither exchange nor recognize the validity of paroles, is it to be expected that the prisoners shall be turned loose to return again to augment the force of the antagonistic party, and thus perhaps insure the destruction of that party liberating them? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2403"/>The very principle which justifies killing in battle, that is the universal principle of self-preservation, will justify the taking of no prisoners or the destruction of all those that may be taken, if they can be neutralized in no other way. It was on this principle that the great <rs>Napoleon</rs>, in his <placeName key="tgn,7016833" n="1.000 10" reg="Misr,Africa">Egyptian</placeName> campaign, killed a number of prisoners whom he did not have the means of feeding, and who would not recognize the validity of a parole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2404"/>If he turned them loose they would have gone immediately into the ranks of his opponents, if he kept them he would have had to take the food from the mouths of his own soldiers to feed them, and the only way of getting rid of them was by killing them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2405"/>It is true a clamor was raised by his enemies, whose interest it was to make him appear as a barbarian devoid of humanity, but now that the feelings of that day have subsided, impartial men do not doubt the conformity of the act to the principles of war. <pb id="p.290" n="290"/> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2406"/>So when <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0015.0027.00290.02937" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,A.,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s order appeared, if the safety of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0015.0027.00290.02938" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, or the success of his campaign had been jeopardized by the necessity of feeding and guarding the prisoners in our hands, he would have been justified in putting them to death, and the responsibility for the act would have rested on the shoulders of the man who issued the inhuman order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2407"/>So too the latter was responsible for all the sufferings to which those prisoners who were carried off were afterwards subjected, if they suffered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2408"/>The alleged reason for stopping the exchange was the fact that the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> would not parole or exchange negro slaves belonging to Southern citizens who were captured in the <rs>Federal</rs> ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2409"/>But it cannot be doubted that this was the mere pretext and not the real reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2410"/>That is to be found in the belief existing on the part of the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities that the failure to exchange would cripple us. The <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">constitution of the United States</rs>, then unchanged in any respect, recognized the right of property in slaves, and guaranteed the return of such as should flee from service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2411"/>The constitution of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> contained the same guaranty, and the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> was recognized by the laws and constitutions of all the <name>States</name> composing the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, from which States alone the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> derived its delegated powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2412"/>That government was bound to respect the laws of the <name>States</name> and the rights of the citizens under those laws, and to protect them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2413"/>Granting, for the sake of the argument, that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> may have had the right to employ as soldiers the captured or fugitive slaves, as it had to take into its armies deserters from ours, still it took them subject to all the rights of the owners and of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, in the event of their recapture, just as deserters taken in arms in the opposite camp were liable to all the penalties for their crime without any infraction of the rules of war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2414"/>Many of the slaves put into the ranks of the <rs>Federal</rs> <pb id="p.291" n="291"/> Army were put there by force, but whether their service was enforced or voluntary, the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> would have been recreant to its trust, and grossly neglectful of its rights and interests, to have allowed so large a proportion of its own population to be used by its enemy for the purpose of strengthening his armies, by recognizing the claim set up on the part of these slaves to the benefit of the rules of war. Most nations have denied the right of its citizens even to expatriate themselves, so as to be competent to serve in the ranks of its enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2415"/>None permit that expatriation to take place after the commencement of hostilities, and it would be the blindest folly to do so. In the case of the recaptured slaves, our government did not propose to punish the slaves themselves, though those that had voluntarily entered the enemy's service had justly forfeited their lives, but merely returned them to their owners, to the great gratification of the negroes themselves in most cases. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2416"/>It was a case in which the <rs>Federal Government</rs> had no rights whatever, any more than it could have had in the case of deserters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2417"/>The claim therefore set up to have these slaves treated as other soldiers taken in battle was without the slightest foundation in the principles of international law, or the rules of civilized war; and the cessation of the exchange on that pretence was a most atrocious act of cruelty to its own prisoners by the <rs>Federal Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2418"/>A great clamor was raised on this specious pretext in order to reconcile the soldiers and the people of the <rs>North</rs> to the discontinuance of the exchange, and blind their eyes as to the real reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2419"/>Not denying the right of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> to refuse to exchange prisoners, if it was its interest to do so, and the war could not be terminated favorably to itself in any other way, still it had no right to violate the faith pledged to the exchange by the cartel; and least of all did it have the right to deprive its own soldiers in our hands of the <pb id="p.292" n="292"/> right to release themselves from prison by giving their paroles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2420"/>If it thought proper not only to adopt the extreme harsh measure of non-exchange from motives of policy, but to go further and adopt a new rule upon the subject of paroles, then it had no right whatever to complain of any measures of harshness towards its prisoners which the necessities or the interests of our government and our army rendered necessary. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2421"/>So much for the question of rights; and now for the facts as to the actual treatment which the prisoners in our hands received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2422"/>I think I can safely deny that they were ever subjected to any maltreatment, suffering, or neglect, which it was in our power to avoid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2423"/>We did not resort to the extreme measures which perhaps the laws of war and our own necessities would have justified, but the prisoners were treated with all the humanity possible under the circumstances in which we were placed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2424"/>Doubtless there may have been rare individual acts of maltreatment, but until human nature is a very different thing from what it is, there can be no body of men in which there are not some who act unjustly and oppressively. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2425"/>Such is the case everywhere over the world, in the church, in government, in society, and in all the relations which men bear to each other, it has been the case, and will continue to be the case until the end of all things that some will do wrong, and we of the <rs>South</rs> cannot claim an exemption from the common lot. What I maintain is that no harsh treatment to the prisoners was authorized or tolerated, and if there were individual cases of the kind they were exceedingly rare. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2426"/>The condition of a prisoner is by no means a desirable <num value="1">one</num> under any circumstances, and he who is captured in war must expect to suffer inconveniences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2427"/>The soldiers of the <rs>Federal Army</rs> were supplied with an abundance of everything necessary for their comfort and even luxury, to which many of them, including some officers, had never been accustomed before, and to which but few <pb id="p.293" n="293"/> of them perhaps, except those who enriched themselves by the plunder of our people, returned again after the war. No army that ever took the field was so well supplied in all that was necessary, and much that was superfluous. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2428"/>The easy communication always kept up with the positions of that army by railway and steamboat supplied it abundantly not only with ample and comfortable clothing of every kind and the government ration of everything, but with most of the delicacies incident to city life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2429"/>They had not only bread, meat, vegetables, coffee and sugar in abundance, but the enormous horde of sutlers following the army supplied it with wines, liquors, fruits, oysters, canned meats and in fact everything that could be desired; and which high pay and high bounties enabled both officers and men to purchase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2430"/>When such men, therefore, fell into our hands and were subjected to the scanty fare to which Confederate soldiers were reduced, it was very natural for them to complain of their treatment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2431"/>Our ports were blockaded and we were cut off from the commerce of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2432"/>The enemy made not only provisions, but medicines, contraband of war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2433"/>Coffee, tea and sugar had disappeared early in <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct> as a part of the ration to our men, and if there was any at all, it was to be found in rare quantities and at the most enormous prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2436"/>On the next day and for a day or <num value="2">two</num> afterwards, all that I had to eat was a piece of cold boiled fresh beef without either salt or bread, which I carried in a haversack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2437"/>This was the strait to which a <rs type="role" reg="Brigadier-General">Brigadier General</rs> was reduced in our army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2438"/>I have many a time on the march, while a division and corps commander, been glad to get a hard cracker and a very small piece of uncooked bacon for my dinner, and I have been often thankful on the road to a soldier for a biscuit from his haversack which he himself had baked, after mixing up the flour on an India rubber cloth, which he had secured on some battlefield.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2439"/>When our money became so depreciated as to be worth only from <num value="5">five</num> to <measure n="10cents" type="currency">ten cents</measure> on the dollar, many of the company officers were compelled from necessity to eat with their men of the scanty food furnished them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2440"/>I have seen commissioned officers often, marching on foot with their pantaloons out behind, their coats out at the elbow and their toes sticking out of their shoes, with but a pretence for a sole, while they had but the shirt that was on their backs as their whole supply of linen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2441"/>I have seen this the case with gentlemen of refinement, whose means before the war had enabled them to live with every desirable comfort, yet they submitted cheerfully not only to this, but to actual hunger; and I have seen them go into battle with the proud tread of heroes, encouraging their men, cheering over the victory, or bravely meeting death in defence of a country which could treat them no better. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2442"/>What these men were content with, the prisoners taken by their valor, and who had been so well pampered in their own country, thought proper to regard, when furnished them, as evidence of a disposition to starve them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2443"/>Not only was our army so meagrely supplied with <pb id="p.295" n="295"/> what was necessary not only to its comfort, but to its very existence, but our people everywhere were pinched for the necessaries of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2444"/>Gentlemen, ladies, and children, who had been accustomed to every indulgence and luxury, were very often put to the utmost straits for clothes to wear and meat and bread to eat, and while this was the case with them there was a long, long list of the wives and the children of the privates in the ranks fighting for their homes and their altars, who were on the very brink of actual starvation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2445"/>Now, I ask, in the name of all that is sacred, did they expect that the men who had come down to make war upon a people so reduced by their barbarous acts to the very verge of starvation and nakedness should, when taken in battle, be fed and clothed better than the men who, sacrificing all mere personal considerations, were so bravely meeting their foes in deadly strife, while their wives, children, mothers and sisters were starving? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2446"/>There is talk about the food furnished the sick and wounded as being unsuited for their condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2447"/>I will mention an incident that occurred under my own observation.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2449"/>When I arrived, his dinner and supper, both in <num value="1">one</num>, were just ready and I was invited in to partake of the meal, and I found it to consist of, what to me was most acceptable, a scant supply of hard crackers, fried fat bacon, and a beverage made as a substitute for coffee out of parched wheat, without sugar, and this was all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2450"/><pb id="p.296" n="296"/> Such fare, if furnished to a sick or wounded Federal soldier, would have been regarded as evidence of a barbarous purpose to cause his death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3827"/>General,--My telegram will have informed you that I deem a change of commanders in your Department necessary; but it is due to your zealous and patriotic services that I should explain the reasons that prompted my action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3828"/>The situation of affairs is such that we can neglect no means calculated to develop the resources we possess to the greatest extent, and make them as efficient as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3829"/>To this end, it is essential that we should have the cheerful and hearty support of the people, and the full confidence of the soldiers, without which our efforts would be embarrassed and our means of resistance weakened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3830"/>I have reluctantly arrived at the conclusion that you cannot command the united and willing co-operation which is so essential to success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3831"/>Your reverses in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, of which the public and the army judge chiefly by the results, have, I fear, impaired your influence both with the people and the soldiers, and would add greatly <pb id="p.469" n="469"/> to the difficulties which will, under any circumstances, attend our military operations in <persName n="Virginia,,S.,W.,," id="n0015.0052.00469.04795" reg="default:Virginia,S.,W.,,"><foreName>S.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Virginia</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3832"/>While my own confidence in your ability, zeal, and devotion to the cause is unimpaired, I have nevertheless felt that I could not oppose what seems to be the current of opinion, without injustice to your reputation and injury to the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3833"/>I therefore felt constrained to endeavor to find a commander who would be more likely to develop the strength and resources of the country, and inspire the soldiers with confidence; and to accomplish this purpose, I thought it proper to yield my own opinion, and to defer to that of those to whom alone we can look for support. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3834"/>I am sure that you will understand and appreciate my motives, and no <num value="1">one</num> will be more ready than yourself to acquiesce in any measures which the interests of the country may seem to require, regardless of all personal considerations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3835"/>Thanking you for the fidelity and energy with which you have always supported my efforts, and for the courage and devotion you have ever manifested in the service of the country, </p>

<head>Appendix: the testimony of letters.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3837"/>I feel reluctant to add a word to what <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n0015.0053.00470.04796" reg="nearbymention:Early,J.,A.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> has written of himself and yet his letters, bearing (as many of them do) upon his manuscript, show that there are some things he has left untold which would interest the reader of his life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3838"/>My feeling in this matter proceeds from the remembrance of his sentiments on the subject of biography, which he forcibly expressed in a letter written in <dateStruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></dateStruct> to a correspondent who proposed writing an account of his life, saying: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3839"/>I trust that you will not suspect me of rudeness or a desire to offend when I respectfully request that you omit mine from the list of biographies you propose writing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3840"/>If I were to furnish you the materials desired, you would become the biographer of my choice, and I would be bound by what you might write.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3841"/>I hope you will understand what I mean, and will not interpret what I say as intended in an offensive sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3842"/>I cannot, of course, prevent your writing on any subject you may choose. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3843"/>If my biography was of sufficient importance to require its being placed before the world, and my wishes were consulted, I would not trust its compilation to any but <num value="1">one</num> who had known me personally and well: you and I are, personally, entire strangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3844"/>During my life I have often associated with men who thought they knew me, but who in fact had very little appreciation of my true character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3845"/>I would not therefore expect it to be understood by <num value="1">one</num> who is a stranger. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3846"/>Naturally possessing a reserved disposition, and in his bachelor life cut off from the softening influences of familiar intercourse to be found in the home, it was not entirely the fault of others that he was often misunderstood: but as he has said, those who knew him best were the ones who best appreciated him.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3847"/>In his autobiographical sketch he writes of the mother whose death was the source of grief to her family, but he does not tell of the affection which caused him to <pb id="p.471" n="471"/> choose her companionship preferably to that of any other, nor of the sense of deprivation he felt upon the loss of her tender counsels at the early age of <num value="16">sixteen</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3848"/>His father was a most thoughtful and affectionate parent, but from him, too, he was parted during the crucial period of his youth, though that parent's watchful care followed closely in a correspondence, preserved by the son, during a long life of many vicissitudes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3849"/>As the son's character developed, he inspired more and more confidence and respect, until the relations of father and son seemed to become reversed, and, as years wore on, the position of head of the family was insensibly accorded the son. Possessing a sense of right never swayed by impulse, his opinion and advice were never questioned by members of his family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3850"/>His grandmother, observing the promise of his youth, had said of him that he was born to make a name for himself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3851"/>In his <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> year, while a cadet at <orgName n="West Point Academy" type="academy">West Point Academy</orgName>, his sympathies were very much aroused for the <rs>Texans</rs> in their revolt against the tyranny of <persName n="Anna,,Santa,,," id="n0015.0053.00471.04797" reg="default:Anna,Santa,,,"><foreName>Santa</foreName> <surname>Anna</surname></persName>, and he wrote urging his father's consent to his joining in their cause.
