<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>But, further round, the other force that had taken the picket was pressing on and up; and suddenly the <rs>Confederates</rs> saw this <pb id="p.93" n="93"/>meeting invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>They fired down uselessly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>Though men fell in this steep scramble, the force came on through stones and thickets, and, joining with the force in front, ascended out of sight into the mist, until <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0061.0005.00093.00505" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> could often only hear the noise of the invisible guns nearer and nearer the top of the mountain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>The shape of the battle was steadily changing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>Something must be done to divert the enemy's increasing blows from <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0061.0005.00094.00514" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,John,,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>They looked at him and his sword and spotless grey uniform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>They mingled their grief with his, grasping his hands; and then, almost overcome, he spoke: <quote>Men, we have fought through the war together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>But my own, which had been quite jubilant on the receipt of his letter, were sad and depressed.
