<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>But in this field, vaster than most of the present generation have imagined, even a book as extensive as a volume of the <rs>Photographic History</rs> can be no more than suggestive.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>Any attempt to present in statistical form the strength of the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> is manifestly impossible, as was explained by <persName n="Wright,General,Marcus,J.,," id="n0115.0006.00150.00979" reg="default:Wright,Marcus,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Marcus</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Wright</surname></persName> in his introductory chapter in Volume I of the <rs>Photographic History</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>The same conditions also render futile any accurate comparison of the troops furnished to the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> by the various states of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>Nevertheless, by tabulating the various organizations and bearing in mind the limitations of the method as well as the original data, a slight basis is afforded to gain some idea of the relative numbers contributed by the different States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>Furthermore, the numbers of the organizations when summarized are of interest in comparison with those given above.</p> 
<p>

<head>Regimental casualties in the <rs>Union Army</rs></head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>In any discussion of the total or relative casualties suffered by a military organization in a war, or in any particular engagement, it must be borne in mind that the entire subject is <num value="1">one</num> around which many questions center.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>The general consideration has been discussed by <persName n="Herbert,Colonel,Hilary,A.,," id="n0115.0006.00152.00995" reg="default:Herbert,Hilary,A.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Hilary</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Herbert</surname></persName> in the preceding chapter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>It now remains to give the readers of the <rs>Photographic History</rs> some few exact statistics of the losses suffered in both great armies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>In the official records there are summarized with considerable completeness the enlistments and casualties for the various regiments and other organizations of the <rs>Union</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>The reports for the most part are complete and comprehensive, admitting of full discussion, yet often there is great difficulty in reducing the vast amount of material to a common denominator for purposes of comparison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>The problem is to consider the various elements in their relations <num value="1">one</num> to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>Thus, it is possible to take those regiments where the number killed or died of wounds during the entire period of service stood at a maximum in comparison with other organizations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>Furthermore, it is possible to consider such casualties relatively, depending upon the strength of the organization, and this latter method gives a clear indication of the efficiency of the regiment during its entire period of service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>Large total losses mean that the regiment was at the fore-front of the fighting in many battles and not necessarily unduly exposed at <num value="1">one</num> particular action.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>Such is the list to be found on <ref n="page 154">page 154</ref>, compiled from the authoritative work of LieutenantColonel <persName n="Fox,,William,F.,," id="n0115.0006.00152.00996" reg="default:Fox,William,F.,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Fox</surname></persName>, <orgName type="mil" key="USVolunteer">U. S. V.</orgName>&mdash;<title>Regimental losses in the <rs>Civil War</rs>.</title> It is, indeed, a record of valor; the <num value="50">fifty</num> regiments here listed are entitled to places of high honor on the scroll of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>It is, all things considered, the most useful basis of making a comparison of the services of the different regiments, and it is <num value="1">one</num> which unfortunately cannot be made for the regiments comprising the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>, on account of the absence of suitable rosters and reports.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>Now, if we should consider the maximum percentage of casualties based on the total of killed, wounded, and missing, a similar roll could be constructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>It would be headed by the <orgName type="regiment" key="1MNInfantry">First Minnesota Infantry</orgName>, which, at the <rs n="Battle of Gettysburg" type="battle">battle of Gettysburg</rs>, with <num value="262">262</num> men engaged on the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> day, lost <measure n="168" type="wounded">168 wounded</measure> and <measure n="47" type="killed">47 killed</measure>, or a percentage of <num value="82">82</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>In fact, other regiments standing at the top of such a list are worthy of note, and a few such, as listed by <persName n="Fox,Colonel,,,," id="n0115.0006.00152.00997" reg="nearbymention:Fox,William,F.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Fox</surname></persName>, are given in the table at the bottom of this page.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>The tabular statement on <ref n="page 154">page 154</ref> must be considered, therefore, as suggestive rather than complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>The selection of <num value="50">fifty</num> regiments is an arbitrary <num value="1">one</num>; for, of over <num value="2000">two thousand</num> regiments in the <rs>Union</rs> army, <num value="45">45</num> infantry regiments lost over <num value="200">200</num> men killed or mortally wounded in action during the war. In fact, <persName n="Fox,Colonel,,,," id="n0115.0006.00152.00998" reg="nearbymention:Fox,William,F.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Fox</surname></persName> has compiled a list of <num value="300">300</num> fighting regiments, which lost over <num value="130">130</num> who were killed and died of wounds during the war, or which, with a smaller enrollment, suffered an equivalent percentage of casualties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3171"/>After the war, many other veteran societies were formed, composed not only of officers but of enlisted men of the various armies, corps, and regiments, as well as many naval organizations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3172"/>Among them, the <rs>Military Order</rs> of the <rs>Loyal Legion</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> society formed by officers honorably discharged from the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3176"/>The titles of officers, the constitution, and general plan, were, in part, afterward adopted by the <orgName n="Grand Army of the Republic" type="association">Grand Army of the Republic</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3177"/>The essential difference was that <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class membership of the <rs>Loyal Legion</rs> was restricted to officers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3178"/>Besides the foregoing organizations of veterans, there were others formed of a political nature, such as the <name>Boys</name> in Blue and other similar societies, and there were held in <dateStruct value="1866-09-"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1866">1866</year></dateStruct>, <num value="2">two</num> political conventions of veterans of the army and navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3179"/>These political soldiers' clubs were the result of the times, for the controversy between Congress and <persName n="Johnson,President,,,," id="n0115.0009.00290.03077" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Bushrod,R.,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> was at its height.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3181"/>The desire for a permanent organization of veterans became strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3183"/>Posts were started, and inasmuch as eligibility to membership in the <rs>Grand Army</rs> was possessed by those who composed the membership of these political clubs, the <name>Boys</name> in Blue and similar clubs formed, in many places, the nucleus of the <rs>Grand Army</rs> posts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3184"/>This fact gave, in good part, a political tinge to the <rs>Grand Army</rs> during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year or <num value="2">two</num> of its existence, and to it was due, chiefly, the severe losses in membership that the order sustained for a short period.
