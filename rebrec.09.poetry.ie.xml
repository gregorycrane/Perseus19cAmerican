<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>They then brought us up in line, preparatory to taking Our rubber blankets, knapsacks, and canteens from us; but as soon as the boys found out what was to be done, we commenced to tear everything to pieces that we could not sell; so they got but few things from us; and by the time they were done the place had the appearance of an old deserted camp, as strips of blankets, knapsacks, and broken canteens were strewn all over the ground, for we were determined that the rebs should not be benefited by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>Here we expected to get on the cars, but were disappointed, and started on foot for <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton</placeName>, <placeName><distance reg="7miles">seven miles distant</distance> from <placeName key="tgn,2024554" n="1.000 207" reg="tunnel hill, whitfield, georgia">Tunnel Hill</placeName></placeName>; and the road being very dusty, and we not being in the best of humor after having our things taken from us, we struck out almost on a double-quick in order to tire out the guards, and several times we were stopped for them to rest and get to their places.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>On the way we were subject to a great many insults, not only from the men, but the women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>They came out as we passed, and threw clubs and stones at us, and did everything they could to express their hatred of the <quote><placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>;</quote> but they soon got tired, for the boys were not in the humor to be outdone by these so-called <hi rend="italics">Southern ladies</hi>, and paid them back in their own coin, till they would go back into their houses, or silently look on and wonder at the impudence the <quote><placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName></quote> had to <hi rend="italics">insult them</hi>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Arriving at <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> we were met by crowds of men, women, and children, both <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs>, and of all ages, from old grayheaded men and women down to the little urchins that could scarcely walk &mdash; all gazing with the greatest eagerness to get a sight of us, to see if we did really look like human beings.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Leaving the depot we were taken to the rear of the town and put in a lot which had the appearance of having been used for a hog lot, and left to spend the night as best we could, which was none the pleasantest, I can assure you.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Here they took our woollen blankets and <rs n="pocket knives" type="product">pocket knives</rs> from us, but they got but few of the latter, for we concealed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>There we got <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure> rations of hard bread and meat, which was to last us till we got to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>In some parts of the <rs>State</rs> they have tried to raise grain, but it has been almost a complete failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>What little corn I saw was very poor, it being so thin over the field that I could almost count the stalks as we passed in the cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>The principal timber through the <rs>South</rs> is pine, which grows in great abundance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>On arriving in sight of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, we got off the cars and were taken to <placeName reg="Belle Isle, Bryan, Georgia" key="tgn,2161651">Belle Island</placeName> on the morning of the <dateStruct value="-09-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>, being just <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> on the way; the distance we travelled over being <measure n="850miles" type="distance">850 miles</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>That part of the island we were on is a very low sand bar, over which the chilly air comes from the river, and almost every night and morning we were enveloped in a dense fog. Here we were exposed to all kinds of weather, without any shelter from the cold rains and chilly winds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>Our rations here consisted of a small piece of bread and a few mouthfuls of meat or soup, over which we would hold a consultation to determine what it was made of, and came to the conclusion that it was intended for bean soup, although the greater portion of the ingredients were sand and bugs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>But we must eat it or do without anything, and as the bugs were well cooked and the sand well settled to the bottom of the vessel, we managed to eat it without any great inconvenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>In this way we lived for <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure>, when we were taken over into the city, and took up lodgings in a large tobacco warehouse, opposite <placeName reg="Libby Prison">Libby Prison</placeName>, and in the lower part of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>We were so crowded that we had scarcely room to lie down without getting on top of each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>Here I remained about <measure n="40days" type="date">forty days</measure>. We were not allowed to go out of the house except to get rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>In this way I managed to get out twice while there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>When <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> put in we got about <num value="0.5">one half</num> rations, which I thought was doing well; but it soon got less, until we were scarcely able to keep from starving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>On the day after we were put in the prison the <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">Provost Marshal</rs> came in and took our names for the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> time since being captured, and told us that if all those who had any greenbacks would give them up to him, he would return them when we went away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>All who did not give them up would be searched, and if any money was found it would be confiscated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>By this means a great many of the boys were induced to give up their money, thinking that we should go away in a few days, and then they would get it back again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>But some were not to be fooled in that way, but were determined to keep their money if possible; so they went to work to conceal it, which was done in various ways, some by sewing it in their clothes, others by putting it in their tobacco, and some would take the buttons of their blouses apart, put a bill in, and then fix it together to look as if it had never been touched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>In this last-mentioned way I kept <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollars</measure>, and gave <num value="2">two</num> to the <rs>Marshal</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>After getting all they could in this way, they commenced to search us; but finding that they were not getting enough to pay them for the trouble, they soon quit it, and issued us some rations, as we had not had any for <measure n="36hours" type="date">thirty-six hours</measure>, and were getting pretty hungry!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>The guards were strictly forbidden to sell anything to us, but they would do almost anything to get our greenbacks, and at night would smuggle in bread to those who had any money; and in this way I managed to get bread for <num value="4">four</num> of us for several days by being economical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>For a <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar</measure> greenback we could get <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> loaves of bread, but for <num value="1">one</num> of Confederate money, sometimes we could get <num value="2">two</num> loaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>Others would not have it at all; said they had their pockets full of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>In passing around the room I could see men once stout and hearty made helpless as infants, their cheeks of a pale death color, their eyes sunken and the light that once sparkled in them gone, and their skeleton-like forms all saying plainly that unless soon aided their time was short for this world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>The sight was enough to draw pity from the hardest of hearts, unless they were so &lt;*&gt;ped in crime that nothing could affect them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>The anguish and suffering here endured can never be told.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>Future history will fail in its endeavors to picture the noble heroism here displayed by men when they were suffering all the misery possible for man to endure, yet true to their country's cause, and would rather die than sacrifice their honor and patriotism, by turning traitor to their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>Almost every day there were from <num value="8">eight</num> to <num value="10">ten</num> taken to the hospital, there to linger on for weeks, and perhaps months, before receiving any benefit by the change, if indeed they ever recovered.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>But there was still another evil to contend against; and that was the vermin, which got so numerous that we could in no way rid ourselves of them; and when a person once got down and was unable to help himself, there was danger of his actually being <hi rend="italics">killed by the lice</hi>. It makes me shudder now while I think of it. What a terrible condition we were then in!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>but how much worse must it have become by this time, as it has been near <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure> since I left!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>But I will not dwell longer on so horrible a scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>After having used what little money I had, and trading my knife and haversack for bread, and seeing what there was in store for me if I remained longer in that place, I resolved to effect my escape or die in the attempt, as it was death any how if I remained there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>I mentioned it to my comrades, but they did not approve of it. But not minding what they said, and finding a young fellow from <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> who was as anxious to get away as myself, we went to work to contrive some means of escape, which was no easy job, for we were closely guarded on all sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>After examining the house all through we could find no place but what was closely guarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>So we came to the conclusion that the only way left was to go out at the door past the guard; and as there had been several of the rebs in cleaning up the house, or rather having it done, we thought it a good time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>Without saying anything to the boys as to what we were about to undertake for fear we might not be successful, as they had been making sport at our not having succeeded before, we went down to the lower floor to get ready for the trial of our new plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>Whichever got out <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was to go to a small hill, about <num value="3">three</num> squares from the prison, and wait for the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>Just about dusk, I got a rebel suit from <num value="1">one</num> of our boys, without much trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>My partner had got his a few days before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>After rigging ourselves in rebel costume, I told my comrade that we would wait till after the relief came on at <time value="7oclock">seven o'clock</time> before going out, and in the mean time look around for a little sport.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>Well, we walked round through the house, and all the boys took us to be rebels, which was just what we wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/><num value="1">One</num> of them took me to <num value="1">one</num> side, and wanted me to try to get him out of the ,prison; he said that he had been conscripted, and did not want to fight against the <rs>South</rs>, had never been in a battle, nor fired a gun at the <hi rend="italics">Southern people</hi>. I told him that I would see about it, and left him. Some of the boys wanted us to bring them in some bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>I told them that the guard would not let us trade with them, but I would try to get some if he would let me bring it in. <time value="7oclock">Seven o'clock</time> came, and I started out, passed the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Guard">first guard</orgName> without saying a word, came to the <num value="1">one</num> on the street; he halted me, and asked where I belonged; I told him I was Police <rs type="role2">Sergeant</rs>, and had been in having the prisoners clean up the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>He did not like to let me pass, but I finally got off, and went directly to the place agreed upon for us to meet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>Getting up on the bank, I concealed myself where I could see down the street.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>When my partner started, the guard would not let him pass; so he had to go back into the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>But he was determined on being out; so he got the boys to attract the guard's attention at the window, and he went back to where some boards had been taken off, and where the guard had been stationed, and crawled out and got away safe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>He came directly to where I had been waiting an hour and <num value="0.5">a half</num>, and was nearly frozen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>I will not attempt to describe our feelings at once more finding ourselves free, at least for the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>But we still had dangers to encounter, being in a strange country, without a guide, and our enemies all around us. But we were resolved to push ahead as best we could; so, shaping our course in an eastern direction, we struck out, guided by the stars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>We crossed the fields and woods till we came to the fortifications, which were not very formidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>These we passed very cautiously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>Coming to a house we tried to rouse the inmates, which we supposed to be negroes, but we could not get them to answer us, and we started on. We soon came to a road which ran in the right direction, and we followed it till about <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time>, when we got so tired, and being so weak, that we had to stop and rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>Going into an old stable, we lay down; but it was too cold for us there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>So we got up and went to a house close by, and found an old crippled negro by herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>We went in and warmed, and remained till daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>Then we found we had travelled <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> during the night, and were on the right road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>This we followed all day, occasionally meeting some citizens and some few soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>But being dressed in rebel clothes, they did not molest us. At <time value="12pm">noon</time> we stopped at a small cabin to get something to eat, and found a woman whose husband was in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>Here we got some bread and milk, and learned a great deal about the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>We came to the <placeName reg="Chickahominy, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1122759">Chickahominy River</placeName>, <placeName><distance reg="20miles">twenty miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>This we crossed on some logs where the long bridges had been, but were destroyed at the time <rs>McClellan</rs> advanced on <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>Soon after crossing the river we met a man whom at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sight we took to be a rebel soldier; but we were mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>He came up and began to question us pretty closely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>He asked where we belonged; we told him, in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, to the <orgName type="regiment" key="19VABattalion">19th Virginia Battalion</orgName>, which was guarding prisoners at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>He then wanted to know where we were going.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>We said, <quote>Home on furlough.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>He looked at us a while, and began to laugh, saying, we need not try to fool him; that we were escaped prisoners, trying to get to the <rs>Federal</rs> lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>This we stoutly denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>So, finding that he could get nothing from us, he told us that we had better turn back to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, that we never could get past the pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>We told him that when our furlough was out we would go back, and not before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>So he rode off and left us. We did not stop long to consider what we should do, but started off as fast as we could walk for about <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure>, when we found a negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>From him we found out where the pickets were stationed, and how to get around them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>He also told us where to find a free negro's house, and as we were very tired, we concluded to go and stay all night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>He put us in the house that the owner had left in his charge, made us a good fire, and got some corn bread for us to eat. We got a pretty good rest, and daylight found us again on the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>We had gone but a short distance, when just ahead of us, we saw a squad of cavalry coming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>There was no time to lose; so, bounding into the woods, we ran as fast as we could for about half a mile; but finding they were not following us, we ceased running.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>After that we did not venture on the road, but kept in the woods all the time, occasionally going to a negro cabin to find the way; and we always found them willing to aid us in any way that they could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>Night coming on, and as we could not well travel in the woods after night, we looted around for a place to stop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>We found a large house near by, and concealing ourselves in the bushes, we watched to see if there were any white folks living in it, but could not see any; so, after it got dark, we went to it, and found no <num value="1">one</num> but a negro and his family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>They gave us some sweet potatoes for supper, and some blankets to keep us warm, and we did very well that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>We were out bright and early the next morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>We had to be more cautious now, as we were among the scouts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>The negroes showed us by-paths through the woods, which we followed all day. We saw several scouts, but managed to evade them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/><pb id="p.13" n="13"/></p> 
<p>Our road was very rough, and we made slow progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>We missed our way, and travelled about <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> before finding it out, then had to go back and start anew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>We had to go through woods and across swamps almost impassable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>We finally came to the place we had been told to go; got permission to stay all night, a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-rate supper and good bed. Upon inquiry we found that we were within <placeName><distance reg="7miles">seven miles</distance> of the <rs>Union</rs></placeName> pickets, and that there was no more danger; so we felt at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>In the morning, after partaking of a good breakfast, our host went with us about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>, and set us on the main road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>We here thanked him for his assistance, and bade him good by.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>We went forward with light hearts that morning, thinking that we were soon to be in the midst of friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>We soon came in sight of the pickets posted on a hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>They saw us coming, and came out to meet us, thinking we were rebel deserters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>We soon told our story, and were warmly received and well provided for. <milestone unit="hr"/> </p></div1>
