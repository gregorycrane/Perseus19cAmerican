<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>This work is the result of contributions by many Southern men to the literature of our country that treats of the eventful years in which occurred the momentous struggle called by <persName n="Stephens,Mister,A.,H.,," id="n0239.0001.00000.00003" reg="expanded:Stephens,Alexander,Hamilton,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName> <quote>the war between the <name>States</name>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>These contributions were made on a well-considered plan, to be wrought out by able writers of unquestionable Confederate record who were thoroughly united in general sentiment and whose generous labors upon separate topics would, when combined, constitute a library of Confederate military history and biography.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>According to the great principle in our government that <num value="1">One</num> may result from and be composed of Many &mdash; the doctrine of <foreign lang="la">E pluribus unum</foreign>--it was considered that intelligent men from all parts of the <rs>South</rs> would so write upon the subjects committed to them as to produce a harmonious work which would truly portray the times and issues of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> and by illustration in various forms describe the soldiery which fought its battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Upon this plan <num value="2">two</num> volumes &mdash; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and the last-comprise such subjects as the justification of the <rs>Southern States</rs> in seceding from the <rs>Union</rs> and the honorable conduct of the war by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> government; the history of the actions and concessions of the <rs>South</rs> in the formation of the <rs>Union</rs> and its policy in securing the existing magnificent territorial dominion of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; the civil history of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, supplemented with sketches of the <rs>President</rs>, <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice-President</rs>, <rs type="role" reg="Cabinet-Officer">cabinet officers</rs> and other officials of the government; Confederate naval history; the morale of the armies; the <rs>South</rs> since the war, and a connected outline of events from the beginning of the struggle to its close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/><pb id="p.-001" n="-001"/></p> 
<p>The <num value="2">two</num> volumes containing these general subjects are sustained by the other volumes of Confederate military history of the <name>States</name> of the <rs>South</rs> involved in the war. Each State being treated in separate history permits of details concerning its peculiar story, its own devotion, its heroes and its battlefields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>The authors of the <rs>State</rs> histories, like those of the volumes of general topics, are men of unchallenged devotion to the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause and of recognized fitness to perform the task assigned them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>It is just to say that this work has been done in hours taken from busy professional life, and it should be further commemorated that devotion to the <rs>South</rs> and its heroic memories has been their chief incentive.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>In <num value="1">one</num> important respect the history of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> differs from the history&mdash;transcends the history&mdash;of any other great power of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>Its boundaries have never receded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>It is true, indeed, that some of the great powers have gained important territorial acquisitions, and have lost others; their boundary lines advancing and receding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>At certain points of their history they may have claimed that their boundaries had never receded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>This statement is now true of no great power except the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/> 
<p> It is also true that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, in adjusting its territorial claims with other nations has, in a few instances, compromised disputed claims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>This was done in the case of our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> claim to <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, based on the purchase of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>But these claims having been adjusted by treaty, and the jurisdiction of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> once established, not <num value="1">one</num> square inch of territory acquired has ever been lost.</p></note> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>This is a fact of deep significance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>It refutes the theory formerly so prevalent in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 4" reg="europe">Europe</placeName>, and entertained to some extent in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, that a vast confederated republic could not possess cohesive force sufficient to hold its several parts together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>Yet experience has shown that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, alone of all the great powers of the world, has preserved intact all the territory it has ever acquired.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>In another respect American history is distinctive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>Every great war in which the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> has ever been engaged, has been accompanied by a large acquisition <pb id="p.62" n="62"/> of territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>Although we have grown to greatness, like <q direct="unspecified">the great robber, <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>,</q> by successive wars and successive acquisitions of territory, yet these wars have not been undertaken for the purpose of foreign conquest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>Such a purpose has never been charged against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> except in the case of the <rs>Mexican</rs> war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>These several wars, accompanied by acquisitions of territory, have been so interspersed along our history, that they form the true key of our chronology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>Not the successive presidential administrations, bat the successive epochs of growth in the acquisition of territory, and the corresponding eras of development in the assimilation of the territory acquired, form the true principle upon which the history of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> should be studied and written.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>Whether these several wars and acquisitions shall be viewed as connected by the relation of cause and effect, or as forming a chain of remarkable coincidence, it is certain that an examination of the territorial map, in connection with a table of dates, will verify the chronological sequence.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>It was regarded by the colonists as an arbitrary violation of their charter rights, against which they made unavailing protest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>Partaking in the prejudices of the times, they felt indignation and feared danger at the prospects of papists for neighbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>They were, also, jealous of certain commercial privileges accorded to this new colony in which they were not permitted to share.

<p>This policy, so solemnly incorporated into her fundamental law, although the purpose of organizing the territory into new States is contingently expressed, furnishing the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> official suggestion of additional States, was voluntarily made without pressure from others, and has been faithfully carried out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>The resolution was speedily followed up by bringing the matter before Congress.

<p>In reply to this letter the convention resolved that the president of the convention be directed to write to Congress and inform them that <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> had no public lands which could be pledged to the soldiers, and knew of no such lands owned by Congress; that <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> declined to pledge the faith of the <rs>State</rs> to offer <measure n="100acres" type="area">one hundred acres</measure> as bounty for enlistment until <q direct="unspecified">the honourable Congress will specify any Land belonging to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> as common stock to be divided among the soldiery.</q>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>This motion fully developed the <rs>Maryland</rs> idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>Coercion was to be used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>This was proposed even before a confederation was established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>The unorganized <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> should seize the territory of the <name>States</name>, and deprive them of jurisdiction and property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>The argument was, that some of the smaller States did not own public land, and felt it to be a hardship to lack this resource while others possessed it; that this land, if secured by <q direct="unspecified">the blood and treasure of all,</q> should be a <q direct="unspecified">common stock</q>; therefore, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> should arbitrarily limit the western boundaries of the claimant States without regard to their charter rights, and take possession of all territory which they saw fit to sequester.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>No wonder that such a proposition received only the vote of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, <pb id="p.99" n="99"/> and neither then nor subsequently obtained the sanction of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>But for whose benefit were these chartered rights to be respected and defended?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>Was all the territory of the <name>States</name> to become the property of Congress, and form a common stock?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1020"/>Every sentiment of justice revolts at the thought.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1021"/>Had the war been unsuccessful, each State would have returned to its colonial condition without change of boundary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/>Had independence been achieved, and no union established, certainly each State would have retained its charter boundaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>In the case of conflict of title under charter claims, as in the case of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 40" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>'s conflict with <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> and <placeName reg="Connecticut" key="tgn,7007159">Connecticut</placeName>, the matter would have been settled between the claimant States, either by war or by treaty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/>When independence was achieved and union was esablished, the charter rights of the claimants were in no <pb id="p.100" n="100"/> way affected, except that a tribunal was provided for the peaceable adjustment of conflicting claims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/>This was done by the unanimous consent of the <name>States</name>, and was carefully guarded to prevent the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> from abusing the position of umpire.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>But it was argued that these western lands were unoccupied and unsettled, and therefore different from other lands; that the settled lands, although <q direct="unspecified">defended by the blood and treasure of all,</q> were not claimed as a common stock, but inured to their respective States and were covered by their respective charters; these lands, however, were different, and the charters of their States did not protect them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>The fallacy of this argument appears on its face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>The charter protected the entire jurisdiction of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>The war was undertaken to secure to each State its rights of person and property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>No right accrued to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to usurp the jurisdiction and abridge the charter limits of any State.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>Later on, <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName>, <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName> and <placeName reg="Delaware" key="tgn,7007239">Delaware</placeName>, though not going to the extreme position of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, came to her aid. The land companies, which had been repudiated by <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 40" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, joined the alliance, and the argument was revived in a modified form.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>Conceding that the <hi rend="italics">jurisdiction</hi> of the several States was protected by their charters, it was urged that the <hi rend="italics">property rights in the soil</hi> were not thus protected; that the <rs>King</rs> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> owned the property right to all ungranted lands within the charter limits of the several colonies until they became States, and therefore the general government, as the successor to the king, became at once the owner of these unoccupied or <q direct="unspecified">crown lands,</q> holding them within the jurisdiction of the several States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>This argument, yielding half the controversy, was more plausible and less repulsive than the former, but was totally unsound.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>If it applied to the unoccupied lands in the west, it must apply with equal force to all unoccupied lands in all <pb id="p.101" n="101"/> portions of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, yet it was proposed that this rule should be applied only to <q direct="unspecified">the western boundaries of such States as claim to the <rs>Mississippi</rs> or the <rs type="place">South Seas</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>In its general application it would have been resisted by every State, and even by <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1036"/>If it applied to the crown lands, it must equally apply to proprietary rights; yet <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> confiscated the proprietary rights and quit rents, and never proposed that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> should inherit them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/>If it applied to lands, it must apply to all other species of property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/>If it applied to property, it must apply to all other rights and powers of the crown, and a general government, as yet unborn, was heir to all the rights and powers of the <rs>British</rs> crown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1039"/>If this doctrine prevailed, what was the use of framing articles of confederation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/>Why was unanimous consent required?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>There was already a nebulous sovereignty whom nobody could locate, inheritor of the crown, and king of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/>The sentiments of the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> could be reconciled to no such doctrine, in whole or in part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1043"/>The strong common sense of their representatives had declared, not that all political connection between the states and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> has <hi rend="italics">descended to an heir</hi>, but that it <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">is totally dissolved</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/>After a discussion as to whether it were better to form a confederation before declaring independence, it was decided to declare independence <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; in order that the free and independent States, and not the <rs>English</rs> colonies, might determine the conditions of permanent union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>When this Confederation was established, it was vested with rights and powers conferred and defined by the <name>States</name>, and possessed not a trace of hereditary rights or powers descended from the <rs>British</rs> crown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1179"/>This remonstrance revives the old claim of the rights which had accrued to the other States by reason of the defense of the country by the <hi rend="italics">common blood and treasure</hi>, an argument which had lost what little plausibility it ever had, for <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 40" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> had some time before rescued the territory from the <rs>British</rs> by the <hi rend="italics">blood and treasure</hi> of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 40" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> alone.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1180"/>The committee to whom the cession of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 40" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> had <pb id="p.117" n="117"/> been referred, reported <dateStruct value="1783-09-13"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="13">13</day>, <year reg="1783">1783</year></dateStruct>, recommending the acceptance of the cession, as soon as the <rs>State</rs> should agree to repeal the <num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num> and <num value="8" type="ordinal">eighth</num> conditions of the cession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1181"/>The remaining <num value="6">six</num> conditions were approved, although the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was considered unnecessary, and an amendment was suggested to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> to more fully carry out its provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1182"/>The <num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num> was considered to be really embraced in the <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num>, but its repeal was urged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1183"/>The real objection was to the <num value="8" type="ordinal">eighth</num> condition, which was wrong in principle, and its repeal was important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1184"/>Of these <num value="2">two</num> conditions whose repeal was desired, the <num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num> declared all purchases from the <name>Indians</name> void, and the <num value="8" type="ordinal">eighth</num> required the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to guarantee to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 40" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> all her remaining territory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1185"/>The report of this committee was decisive, and was adopted, <dateStruct value="-09-13"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="13">13</day></dateStruct>, by the votes of all the <name>States</name> represented, except <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName> and <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1186"/><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 40" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> readily accepted the amendments proposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1187"/>The condition in reference to purchases from the <name>Indians</name> was unnecessary, being embraced in the other conditions which had been approved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1188"/>The condition requiring that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> should guarantee all remaining territory was intended to apply to <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, and to operate as a contract with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to protect the <rs>State</rs> against claims that might arise under the cession of New York or the revival of the plea of <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">common stock</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1189"/>In her anxiety to put a quietus on all such claims, <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 40" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> had gone too far, and had framed this condition at variance with her own theories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1191"/>Its acceptance would have operated as an <hi rend="italics">ex parte</hi> adjudication or a prejudication of all claims against the <rs>State</rs>, and would have barred all proceedings under the <num value="9" type="ordinal">ninth</num> article of the <name>Confederation</name>, to which any claimant State might be entitled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1192"/>There were no adverse charter <pb id="p.118" n="118"/> claimants, and the shadowy claims of New York had been ceded to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1193"/>There was no probability that any State would appear as a contestant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1194"/>Still, it would besetting a precedent wrong in theory that any State might secure from Congress a guarantee to its territory, and thus acquire an exemption from the jurisdiction of the tribunal, provided by the <num value="9" type="ordinal">ninth</num> article of the <name>Confederation</name> for the trial of contests between the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1195"/>At the next meeting of her legislature, <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 40" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> promptly instructed her delegates to execute to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> a deed of cession conforming to the amendments proposed by Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1216"/>The acceptance of such a proposition would have had the effect of confirming her title and establishing her in jurisdiction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1217"/>In <dateStruct value="1786-05-"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1786">1786</year></dateStruct>, her legislature modified the terms of the original offer, in accordance with which her delegates in Congress executed a deed of cession, <pb id="p.120" n="120"/> <dateStruct value="1786-09-13"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="13">13</day>, <year reg="1786">1786</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1654"/>All shades of opinion were expressed, but the <num value="2">two</num> parties have been criticised as substantially reversing their positions as to the powers of the general government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1655"/>The student of history is never surprised to find <num value="2">two</num> political parties shifting their positions on theoretical questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1656"/>General theories, followed out to their logical consequences, invariably lead to the <hi rend="italics">reductio ad absurdum</hi>. Political theories form no exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1657"/>Limitations are as necessary to theories as to all other human productions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1658"/>What is sometimes mistaken for inconsistency is the necessary adaptation and amendment of opinion to new environments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/>Yet it does seem strange to view the <name>Federalist</name> party posing as the champion of strict construction and State rights, while the party of <persName n="Jefferson,,Thomas,,," id="n0239.0005.00152.00453" reg="default:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> is aggressively demanding a liberal construction of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the extension of the powers of the general government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>By common consent and general custom the right of being inconsistent and of throwing rocks at the majority is accorded to the minority party, as a sort of political license, for which they are not held responsible until they come again into power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/>The party in power, however, is subject to indictment for inconsistency, and thus the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> has been the party on trial.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1662"/>Whatever inconsistency there may have been was <hi rend="italics">apparent</hi> rather than <hi rend="italics">real</hi>, and was applicable to the <hi rend="italics">arguments</hi> used rather than to the <hi rend="italics">course</hi> pursued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1663"/>The previous contests in behalf of strict construction had been directed to protecting the <name>States</name>, in their domestic relations and individual rights, from encroachments on the part of the general government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1664"/>In the domestic relations between the general government and the several States, the <name>Republicans</name> regarded a strict construction as the palladium of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1665"/>It did not follow that the same strict construction should be applied for enfeebling the operations of the general government within its <pb id="p.153" n="153"/> own sphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1666"/>The citizens who constituted the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> had aided in establishing the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>They helped to create the general government for general purposes, and they could have no interest in an insane and unpatriotic effort to render it incapable of performing its functions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>Expressed in homely phrase, they did not wish to tie the hands of the general government, but they did wish to keep its hands off the <name>States</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1669"/>There is no inconsistency in maintaining, on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, a rule of strict construction, as applied to conflicts between the general government and the individual States, concerning the powers which the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> can exercise within the several State jurisdictions; and, on the other hand, a rule of liberal construction for exerting the powers of the general government in its unquestioned constitutional sphere, outside of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1670"/>If there be any real inconsistency in these <num value="2">two</num> positions, it has survived in the creeds of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> and its successor, the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>, to the present day.</p>

<p>These extracts serve to illustrate the sentiment largely prevailing in the <rs>Northeast</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1684"/>There was a determined and obstinate hostility to Southern or Western expansion of territory, a feeling that such a policy would lessen the influence of the <rs>Northeastern States</rs> in the <rs>Union</rs>, and would retard their growth in population and wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1685"/>They especially feared that the unimpeded navigation of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> would injure their commercial interests.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1686"/>This sentiment was no sudden ebullition of party zeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1687"/>The jealousy was seen in the efforts of several of the <name>States</name> of this section, in the formation of the <rs>Union</rs>, to claim an interest in the <rs>Western</rs> lands as <q direct="unspecified">a common stock,</q> secured by <q direct="unspecified">the blood and treasure of all.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2811"/>Whatever criticisms or eulogies, just or unjust, patriotic or partisan, may be pronounced upon the actors or the agents in our several wars and acquisitions of territory, all must recognize the hand of destiny which led <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> through the several steps of development to her present sublime position among the nations of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2812"/>None can deny, perhaps none will wish to deny, that the corner stone in the foundation of the greatness of our country is its wide extent of territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2813"/>Beginning with the sparse settlements stretched along the <rs type="place">Atlantic coast</rs>, the <num value="13">thirteen</num> original States, born in revolution, and unwilling to surrender their separate existence, were drawn together by a wonderful law of attraction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2814"/>They founded a government of which the vital principle was compromise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2815"/>This principle, not deduced from the formulas of philosophers, but evolved from the logic of events, and utilized by the practical common sense of the <rs>American</rs> people, has demonstrated itself to be the true principle of free government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2816"/>The Union, thus constructed, owed its marvelous development, and the catholicity of its institutions, to the compromise of the varied interests and diverse sentiments of its constituent sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2817"/>The people of this self-made nation have cause to rejoice that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was built by many factors, each of which has performed a distinctive, honorable, and necessary part in its <pb id="p.245" n="245"/> upbuilding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2818"/>History, while dwelling with admiration on the grand result, the joint work as well as the joint heritage of all, should accord to each factor the appropriate meed of praise.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2819"/>To the <rs>South</rs> belongs the award of being the leading factor in territorial expansion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2820"/>Beginning with the sacrifice of any plans they may have formed for State aggrandizement, the <rs>Southern States</rs> surrendered their extensive western possessions to the general government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2821"/>Advocating the policy of expansion at each stage of growth, overcoming the obstacles of sectional opposition and foreign diplomacy, persistently and successfully the <rs>South</rs> has forced the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to all its acquisitions of territory, except <placeName reg="Alaska" key="tgn,7006450">Alaska</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2822"/>At this day, few persons will be found to dispute the wisdom or the justice of this policy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2823"/>Sending forth its missionary pioneers to win the wilderness, the great Republic, following their footsteps, received the adopted territories, reared them into statehood under the nurture of its beneficent institutions, and protects them with the shield of a nation whose boundaries have never receded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2859"/>The loose Union, which had been created pending the <name>Revolutionary</name> war, through Articles of Confederation, was found inefficient to control or even to direct the irrepressible conflict of opposing or emulating interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2888"/>The world at large practiced it in some form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2890"/>The hardy and adventurous settlers in the <rs>American</rs> colonies permitted themselves after occasional protests, such as occurred in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 40" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and afterward in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, to be seduced into the buying of negroes from the artful and avaricious slave traders of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, <placeName reg="Nederland" key="tgn,7016845">Holland</placeName> and <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2891"/>The importations, however, were few, because the <rs>European</rs> possessions in the semi-tropics were the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> takers of this species of property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2892"/>Tidings of the evils of the system in its barbarous stages, and stories all too true of the horrors of the middle passage aboard <pb id="p.255" n="255"/> the ships of the inhuman slave importers, made the colonies reluctant to engage in the traffic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2893"/>Nevertheless, the colonies experimented with this form of labor, <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> beginning in <dateStruct value="1638--"><year reg="1638">1638</year></dateStruct> and <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> <measure n="33years" type="date">thirty three years</measure> later, and the conclusion was reached before the close of the <num value="18" type="ordinal">eighteenth</num> century that the slavery system of labor could be made useful in some latitudes, but could not be made profitable in all sections of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2894"/>Therefore, Massachusetts, following a Canadian precedent, abolished slavery after being a slave holding State over a <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure>, and soon after the <rs>American Revolution</rs> several States in the higher latitudes, all included in the old <hi rend="italics">North Section</hi> of the original <placeName reg="Plymouth, Plymouth, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014421">Plymouth</placeName> colony, adopted the same policy.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2895"/>But it will be observed that generally this Northern abolition was to take effect after lapse of time, and thus notice was given to the owners sufficient to enable them, if so disposed, to sell their property to purchasers living farther South who still found such labor remunerative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2896"/>Some availed themselves of this privilege and converted their slaves into other more productive property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5241"/>The political battle of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct> set in array at the <rs>North</rs> on the side of the administration was vehemently pronounced to be based on condemnation of secession, vindication of coercion, abolition of slavery and subjugation of the seceding States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5242"/>It was urged that the defeat of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0239.0006.00509.02453" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:7"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> would be a Northern approval of disunion, a rebuke of the armies, and re-establishment of the arrogant slave power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5243"/>In the temper of the times there was but a little chance of so directing Northern popular sentiment as to change the administration of the government in the midst of war. War was party necessity and the source of its power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5244"/>An armistice as suggested by the opposition might be fatal to party supremacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5245"/>It might afford occasion to arouse the supposed latent Union sentiment in the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5246"/>It might give time for sober reflection in the conditions of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct> which were different from those of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5247"/>It might result in divisions among Southern leaders and Southern States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5249"/>Probably the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName> would have dissolved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5250"/>On the other hand, <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0239.0006.00509.02455" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:7"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was even at the point of a fierce earnestness opposed to any armistice&mdash;Grant's hammering must not cease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5252"/>A truce pending the canvass for the presidency might result in peace, reunion, overthrow of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, abolition of slavery, but these gracious results would be brought about by parties opposed to the administration.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5253"/>An armistice in order to dissolve the <rs>Confederacy</rs> and restore the <rs>Union</rs> without further bloodshed was the policy of the <rs>Northern</rs> conservatives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5254"/>No Southern representative men have been suspected of any complicity with these fraternal and patriotic designs further than to suggest that fighting should cease and peace conferences be held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5255"/>Fidelity to the <rs>Confederacy</rs> distinguished Confederate leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5256"/>But this policy was openly and honestly avowed by eminent Northern leaders who held that it was not treasonable to the <rs>Union</rs> to suspend coercion and test the sincerity of Southern declarations in regard to peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5257"/>The openly stated position of Northern leaders who favored a temporary peace was that secession must be abandoned or the war would be pressed to the utmost subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5258"/>But with this outspoken notice to the <rs>South</rs> these patriotic leaders avowed their belief that the <rs>South</rs> would surrender to overtures of honorable peace and therefore they proposed to make them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5259"/>But while this agitation of the armistice plan was under discussion, <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0239.0006.00510.02457" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:7"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was at the <rs>Philadelphia Fair</rs>, <dateStruct value="1864-06-15"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="15">15</day>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, and speaking to the people he said, <q direct="unspecified">This war has taken <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5260"/>The armistice policy had been often brought forward in Congress and by portions of the public press, only to be invariably treated as if it were a truculent submission to the <rs>South</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5265"/>There were undoubtedly very powerful peace currents, genial as the gulf stream, setting in at this date from many sources upon the great throbbing bosom of the <rs>American</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5266"/>They are all perceptible now by every <num value="1">one</num> who reads the signs of those times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5267"/>Those officials to whom the great interests of the <rs>South</rs> had been committed spoke of peace with due caution, sometimes uttering defiance and high resolve to maintain the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause at every cost, and yet it must be remembered that disunion for its own sake was never the <q direct="unspecified">cause of the <rs>South</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5519"/>The message of <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n0239.0006.00538.02629" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> treated especially on the general state of the war, the employment of negroes in the army and negotiations for peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5520"/>The message said on the negro question, that the employment of slaves with the army as teamsters or cooks or in the way of work on fortifications, or in the government workshops, or in hospitals or other similar duties was authorized by the act of <dateStruct value="-02-7"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg="7">7th</day></dateStruct> last, and that provision was made for their impressment to a number not exceeding <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> if it should be found impracticable to obtain them by contract with the owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5521"/>The law contemplated the hiring only of the labor of these slaves and imposed on the government the liability to pay for the value of such as might be lost to the owners from casualties resulting from their employment in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5522"/>This act had produced less results than was anticipated, and further provision was required to render it efficacious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5523"/><q direct="unspecified">But my present purpose,</q> said the <rs>President</rs>, <q direct="unspecified">is to invite your consideration to a radical modification in the theory of the law.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5524"/>The modification referred to was explained to consist in the view that the slave bore the relation of a person to the <rs>State</rs>, while under the <rs>Confederate</rs> as well as the <rs>United</rs> <pb id="p.539" n="539"/> States law he was viewed also as property subject to impressment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5525"/>On account of this relation and because many questions arising under the existing law which authorized contracts and impressments for short terms the <rs>President</rs> suggested that the government acquire by purchase the entire property in the labor of the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5526"/><q direct="unspecified">Whenever the entire property,</q> says the message, <q direct="unspecified">in the service of a slave is thus acquired by the government, the question is presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5527"/>By what tenure should he be held?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5528"/>Should he be retained in servitude or should his emancipation be held out to him as a reward for faithful service, or should it be granted at once on the promise of such service?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5529"/>The policy of engaging to liberate the negro on his discharge after service faithfully rendered seemed to the <rs>President</rs> preferable to that of granting immediate manumission or to that of retaining him in servitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5530"/>An enlargement of negro enrollment on this plan to <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> in the number of negroes to be used for specified purposes and additions to the duties already performed by them of service as pioneers and engineer laborers was regarded by <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n0239.0006.00539.02630" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> as desirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5531"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> carefully distinguished between employing negroes in defense of the homes where they were reared and the inciting the same negroes to insurrection and murder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5532"/>He regarded it as justifiable if it became necessary to organize the negroes to repel the invasion of the country in which they lived, and that their freedom would be justly won by such employment of their services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5533"/>On the other hand the incitement of negroes to insurrection was iniquitous and unworthy of a civilized people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5534"/><q direct="unspecified">Such is the judgment of all writers on public law as well as that insisted on by our enemies in all wars prior to that now waged against us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5549"/>But while it is true that individuals and parties in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have indicated a desire to substitute reason for force and by negotiation to stop the further sacrifice of human life and to arrest the calamities which now afflict both countries, the authorities who control the government of our enemies have too often and too clearly expressed their resolution to make no peace except on terms of our unconditional submission and degradation, to leave us any hope of the cessation of hostilities until the delusion of their ability to conquer us is dispelled. * * * Peace is manifestly impossible unless desired by both parties to this war, and the disposition for it among our enemies will be best and most certainly evoked by the demonstration on our part of ability and unshaken purpose to defend our rights and to hold no earthly price too dear for their purchase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5550"/>Whenever there shall be on the part of our enemies a desire for peace there will be no difficulty in finding means by which negotiations can be opened, but it is obvious that no agency can be called into action until this desire shall be mutual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5675"/>It was, in fact, the precise pivot on which the issue could be made to turn toward peace with a Union promptly restored, or war with distraction long continued.

To this extent and no farther went even the hint of compensated emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5685"/>There was no offer either express or implied by the <rs>President</rs> and his secretary of state to guarantee such a result, and the commissioners understood <pb id="p.558" n="558"/> the intimation as a vague suggestion on which they could base no proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5686"/>Their action was accordingly unaffected by it, nor were they trammeled in any degree by instructions which prevented their consideration of it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5688"/>But still more important to the <rs>South</rs> and the <rs>Union</rs> itself than slaves or their value was the question of the status of the <name>States</name> and people of the <name>States</name> upon surrender by negotiation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5689"/>What position would the <name>States</name> of the <rs>South</rs> occupy on their abandonment of secession?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5691"/>To this vital question the <rs>President</rs> answered as to his own opinion the <name>States</name> would be restored to their practical relations to the <rs>Union</rs>, but said emphatically he could not enter into any stipulations upon the subject, and in reply to the urgency of <persName n="Stephens,Mister,,,," id="n0239.0006.00558.02789" reg="nearbymention:Stephens,Alexander,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName> on this matter <q direct="unspecified">persisted in asserting that he could not enter into any agreement upon this subject or upon any other matters of that sort with parties in arms against the government.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5693"/>Not the slightest deviation from this was admissible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5694"/>The conference had reached the line where it seems the <pb id="p.559" n="559"/> Southern commissioners would have taken a step committing their government to dissolution without another battle, provided only they had been fully and frankly assured by authority to be trusted that the <rs>Union</rs> even without slavery would be at once re-established, the <name>States</name> with all their rightful relations restored, the people of the <rs>South</rs> protected, the <rs>Constitution</rs> respected and sectionalism ended forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5695"/>But around the form of the <rs>President</rs> was the portentous shadow of the radical war cloud, an influence that he could not withstand at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5696"/>His ultimatum was dictated by a fierce policy that does not clearly appear to have been his own, and even his hint that he would temper wrath with mercy was given with qualifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5697"/>He could give no assurances, make no stipulations, enter into no agreement, and have no understanding as to the result of surrender.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5792"/>The overthrow and disbanding of its armies destroyed its belligerency; its civil authority becoming scattered and powerless could not operate, and therefore its position as a government de facto became untenable; what it still was de jure on account of the demands of Constitutional law was practically determined by the necessary resort to State action for the abrogation of the secession ordinances, also to State consent to the <name>Constitutional</name> amendments then proposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5793"/>Thus it was dissolved by war and by the action of the <name>States</name> which had formed it.
