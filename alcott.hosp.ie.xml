<p>This remark being addressed to the world in general, no <num value="1">one</num> in particular felt it their duty to reply; so I repeated it to the smaller world about me, received the following suggestions, and settled the matter by answering my own inquiry, as people are apt to do when very much in earnest. </p>

<p>So far, very good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Here was the will, and plenty of it; now for the way. At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sight not a foot of it appeared; but that didn't matter, for the <name>Periwinkles</name> are a hopeful race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Their crest is an anchor, with <num value="3">three</num> cock-a-doodles crowing atop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>They all wear rose-colored spectacles, and are lineal descendants of the inventor of aerial architecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>An hour's conversation on the subject set the whole family in a blaze of enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>A model hospital was erected, and each member had accepted an honorable post therein.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The paternal P. was chaplain, the maternal P. was matron, and all the youthful P.&lsquo;s filled the pod of futurity with achievements whose brilliancy eclipsed the glories of the present and the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Arriving at this satisfactory conclusion, the meeting adjourned; and the fact that Miss Tribulation was available as army nurse went abroad on the wings of the wind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>In a few days a townswoman heard of my desire, approved of it, and brought about an interview with <num value="1">one</num> of the sisterhood which I wished to join, who was at home on a furlough, and able and willing to satisfy all inquiries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>A morning chat with <rs type="role" reg="Miss-General">Miss General</rs> S.--we hear no end of <rs type="role" reg="Mrs.-General">Mrs. Generals</rs>, why not a Miss?--produced <num value="3">three</num> results: I felt that I could do the work, was offered a place, and accepted it, promising not to desert, but stand ready to march on <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> at an hour's notice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>A few days were necessary for the letter containing my request and recommendation to reach headquarters, and another, containing my commission, to return; therefore no time was to be lost; and heartily thanking my pair of friends, I tore home through the <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> slush as if the rebels were after me, and like many another recruit, burst in upon my family with the announcement- </p>

<p><quote>Thank you; then I'll <hi rend="italics">take</hi> something :</quote> which I did. in the shape of dinner, reeling off my news at the rate of <num value="36">three dozen</num> words to a mouthful; and as every <num value="1">one</num> else talked equally fast, and all together, the scene was most inspiring. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>As boys going to sea immediately become nautical in speech, walk as if they already had their <quote>sea legs</quote> on, and shiver their timbers on all possible occasions, so I turned military at once, called my dinner my rations, saluted all new comers, and ordered a dress parade that very afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Having reviewed every rag I possessed, I detailed some for picket duty while airing over the fence; some to the sanitary influences of the wash-tub; others to mount guard in the trunk; while the weak and wounded went to the Work-basket Hospital, to be made ready for active service again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>To this squad I devoted myself for a week; but all was done, and I had time to get powerfully impatient before the letter came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>It did arrive however, and brought a disappointment along with its good will and friendliness, for it told me that the place in the <rs type="place">Armory Hospital</rs> that I supposed I was to take, was already filled, and a much less desirable <num value="1">one</num> at Hurly-burly <persName n="House,,,,," id="n0116.0001.00005.00003" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName> was offered instead. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/><quote> That's just your luck, Trib.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>I'll take your trunk up garret for you again; for of course you won't go,</quote> <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> remarked, with the disdainful pity which small boys affect when they get into their teens.

<p>I have a confused recollection of spending the afternoon in pervading the house like an executive whirlwind, with my family swarming after me, all working, talking, prophesying and lamenting, while I packed my <quote>go-abroady</quote> possessions, tumbled the rest into <num value="2">two</num> big boxes, danced on the lids till they shut, and gave them in charge, with the direction,-- </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/><quote> If I never come back, make a bonfire of them.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/></p> 
<p>Then I choked down a cup of tea, generously salted instead of sugared, by some agitated relative, shouldered my knapsack &mdash; it was only a <rs n="traveling bag" type="product">traveling bag</rs>, but do let me preserve the unities-hugged my family <num value="3">three</num> times all round without a vestige of unmanly emotion, till a certain dear old lady broke down upon my neck, with a despairing sort of wail- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/><quote>Oh, my dear, my dear, how can I let you go?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/></p> 
<p><quote>I'll stay if you say so, mother.</quote>

<p><quote>But I don't; go, and the <rs>Lord</rs> will take care of you.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/></p> 
<p>Much of the <rs>Roman</rs> matron's courage had gone into the <rs>Yankee</rs> matron's composition, and, in spite of her tears, she would have sent <num value="10">ten</num> sons to the war, had she possessed them, as freely as she sent <num value="1">one</num> daughter, smiling and flapping on the door-step till I vanished, though the eyes that followed me were very dim, and the handkerchief she waved was very wet. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>My transit from The Gables to the village depot was a funny mixture of good wishes and good byes, mud-puddles and shopping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>A <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> twilight is not the most cheering time to enter upon a somewhat perilous enterprise, and, but for the presence of <persName><foreName>Vashti</foreName></persName> and neighbor <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>, I fear that I might have added a drop of the briny to the native moisture of- <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/></p><l>The town I left behind me ;</l></quote> though I'd no thought of giving out: oh, bless you, no!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>When the engine screeched <quote>Here we are,</quote> I clutched my <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> escort in a fervent embrace, and skipped into the car with as blithe a farewell as if going on a bridal tour-though I believe brides don't usually wear cavernous black bonnets and fuzzy brown coats, with a hair-brush, a pair of rubbers, <num value="2">two</num> books, and a bag of ginger-bread distorting the pockets of the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>If I thought that any <num value="1">one</num> would believe it, I'd boldly state that I slept from C. to B., which would simplify matters immensely; but as I know they wouldn't, I'll confess that the head under the funereal coal-hod fermented with all manner of high thoughts and heroic purposes <quote>to do or die,</quote> perhaps both; and the heart under the fuzzy brown coat felt very tender with the memory of the dear old lady, probably sobbing over her army socks and the loss of her topsy-turvy Trib.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>At this juncture I took the veil, and what I did behind it is nobody's business; but I maintain that the soldier who cries when his mother says <quote>Good bye,</quote> is the boy to fight best, and die bravest, when the time comes, or go back to her better than he went. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Till <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> I trotted about the city streets, doing those last errands which no woman would even go to heaven without attempting, if she could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Then I went to my usual refuge, and, fully intending to keep awake, as a sort of vigil appropriate to the occasion, fell fast asleep and dreamed propitious dreams till my rosy-faced cousin waked me with a kiss. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>A bright day smiled upon my enterprise, and at <num value="10">ten</num> I reported myself to my General, received last instructions and no end of the sympathetic encouragement which women give, in look, touch, and tone more effectually than in words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The next step was to get a free pass to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, for I'd no desire to waste my substance on railroad companies when <quote>the boys</quote> needed even a spinster's mite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>A friend of mine had procured such a pass, and I was bent on doing likewise, <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> though I had to face the president of the railroad to accomplish it. I'm a bashful individual, though I can't get any <num value="1">one</num> to believe it; so it cost me a great effort to poke about the <rs type="place">Worcester depot</rs> till the right door appeared, then walk into a room containing several gentlemen, and blunder out my request in a high state of stammer and blush.--Nothing could have been more courteous than this dreaded <rs type="role2">President</rs>, but it was evident that I had made as absurd a demand as if I had asked for the nose off his respectable face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>He referred me to the <rs>Governor</rs> at the <rs type="place">State House</rs>, and I backed out, leaving him no doubt to regret that such mild maniacs were left at large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Here was a Scylla and <persName n="Charybdis,,,,," id="n0116.0001.00008.00004" reg="mostcommon:Charybdis,nomatch:0"><surname>Charybdis</surname></persName> business: as if a President wasn't trying enough, without the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> and the <name>Hub</name> of the <name>Hub</name> on top of that. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/><quote> I never can do it,</quote> thought I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/><quote><persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> will hoot at you if you don't,</quote> whispered the inconvenient little voice that is always goading people to the performance of disagreeable duties, and always appeals to the most effective agent to produce the proper result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The idea of allowing any boy that ever wore a felt basin and a shoddy jacket with a microscopic tail, to crow over me, was preposterous, so giving myself a mental slap for such faint-heartedness, I streamed away across the <name>Common</name>, wondering if I ought to say <quote>your Honor,</quote> or simply <quote>Sir,</quote> and decided upon the latter, fortifying myself with recollections of an evening in a charming green library, where I beheld the <rs>Governor</rs> placidly consuming oysters, and laughing as if <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> was a myth, and he had no heavier burden on his shoulders than his host's handsome hands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Like an energetic fly in a very large cobweb, I struggled through the <rs type="place">State House</rs>, getting into all the wrong rooms and none of the right, till I turned desperate, and went into <num value="1">one</num>, resolving not to come out till I'd made somebody hear and <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> answer me. I suspect that of all the wrong places I had blundered into, this was the most so. But I didn't care; and, though the apartment was full of soldiers, surgeons, starers, and spittoons, I cornered a perfectly incapable person, and proceeded to pump for information with the following result: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/><quote> Could he tell me where to look?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/></p> 
<p>No, he couldn't. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/><quote> Did he know anything about free passes?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/></p> 
<p>No, he didn't. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/><quote> Was there any <num value="1">one</num> there of whom I could inquire?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/></p> 
<p>Not a person. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/><quote>Did he know of any place where information could be obtained?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/></p> 
<p>Not a place. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/><quote> Could he throw the smallest gleam, of light upon the matter, in any way?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/></p> 
<p>Not a ray. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>I am naturally irascible, and if I could have shaken this negative gentleman vigorously, the relief would have been immense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The prejudices of society forbidding this mode of redress, I merely glowered at him; and, before my wrath found vent in words, my General appeared, having seen me from an opposite window, and come to know what I was about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>At her command the languid gentleman woke up, and troubled himself to remember that <rs type="role2">Major</rs> or <rs type="role2">Sergeant</rs> or something <placeName reg="Fort Mc">Mc</placeName> K. knew all about the tickets, and his office was in <address><street n="Milk Street">Milk Street</street></address>. I parked up instanter, and then, as if the exertion was too much for him, what did this animated wet blanket do but add--<pb id="p.10" n="10"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/><quote> I think <placeName reg="Fort Mc">Mc</placeName> K. may have left <address><street n="Milk Street">Milk Street</street></address>, now, and I don't know where he has gone.</quote>

<p><quote>Never mind; the new comers will know where he has moved to, my dear, so don't be discouraged; and if you don't succeed, come to me, and we will see what to do next,</quote> said my General. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>I blessed her in a fervent manner and a cool hall, fluttered round the corner, and bore down upon <address><street n="Milk street">Milk street</street></address>, bent on discovering <placeName reg="Fort Mc">Mc</placeName> K. if such a being was to be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>He wasn't, and the ignorance of the neighborhood was really pitiable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Nobody knew anything, and after tumbling over bundles of leather, bumping against big boxes, being nearly annihilated by descending bales, and sworn at by aggravated truckmen, I finally elicited the advice to look for <placeName reg="Fort Mc">Mc</placeName> K. in <address><street n="Haymarket Square">Haymarket Square</street></address>. Who my informant was I've really forgotten; for, having hailed several busy gentlemen, some <num value="1">one</num> of them fabricated this delusive quietus for the perturbed spirit who instantly departed to the sequestered locality he named.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>If I had been in search of the Koh-i-noor diamond I should have been as likely to find it there as any vestige of <placeName reg="Fort Mc">Mc</placeName> K. I stared at signs, inquired in shops, invaded an eating house, visited the recruiting tent in the middle of the <rs type="place">Square</rs>, made myself a nuisance generally, and accumulated fine samples of mud from every gutter I fell into.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>All in vain; and I mournfully turned my face toward the <rs>General</rs>'s, feeling that I should be forced to enrich the <orgName n="Railroad Company" type="company">railroad company</orgName> after all, when, suddenly, I beheld that admirable young man, brother-in-law <persName n="Coobiddy,,Darby,,," id="n0116.0001.00010.00005" reg="default:Coobiddy,Darby,,,"><foreName>Darby</foreName> <surname>Coobiddy</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs> I arrested him with a burst of news, and wants, and woes, which caused his manly countenance to lose its usual repose. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/></p> 
<p>I'm a woman's rights woman, and if any man had offered help in the morning, I should have condescendingly refused it, sure that I could do everything as well, if not better, myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>My strong-mindedness had rather abated since then, and I was now quite ready to be a <quote>timid trembler,</quote> if necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Dear me!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>how easily <persName n="Darby,,,,," id="n0116.0001.00011.00007" reg="mostcommon:Darby,nomatch:0"><surname>Darby</surname></persName> did it all: he just asked <num value="1">one</num> question, received an answer, tucked me under his arm, and in <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> I stood in the presence of <placeName reg="Fort Mc">Mc</placeName> K., the <name>Desired</name>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/><quote> Now my troubles are over,</quote> thought I, and as usual was direfully mistaken. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Oh, indeed!

Nor was that all; he might as well have asked me to catch a humming-bird, toast a salamander, or call on the man in the moon, as find a Doctor at home at the busiest hour of the day. It was a blow; but weariness had extinguished enthusiasm, and resignation clothed me as a garment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>I sent <persName n="Darby,,,,," id="n0116.0001.00011.00008" reg="mostcommon:Darby,nomatch:0"><surname>Darby</surname></persName> for <persName><foreName>Joan</foreName></persName>, and doggedly paddled off, feeling that mud was my native element, <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> and quite sure that the evening papers would announce the appearance of the <rs>Wandering Jew</rs>, in feminine habiliments. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>Everything goes by contraries with me; so, having made up my mind to be disappointed, of course I wasn't; for, presently, in walked Dr. H., and no sooner had he heard my errand, and glanced at my credentials, than he said, with the most en gaging readiness: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>All was hurry and confusion; the hall was full of these wrecks of humanity, for the most exhausted could not reach a bed till duly ticketed and registered; the walls were lined with rows of such as could sit, the floor covered with the more disabled, the steps and doorways filled with helpers and lookers on; the sound of many feet and voices made that usually quiet hour as noisy as noon; and, in the midst of it all, the matron's motherly face brought more comfort to many a poor soul, than the cordial draughts she administered, or the cheery words that welcomed all, making of the hospital a home. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>It seemed a poor requital for all he had sacrificed and suffered, --that hospital bed, lonely even in a crowd; for there was no familiar face for him to look his last upon; no friendly voice to say, Good bye; no hand to lead him gently down into the <rs type="place">Valley of the Shadow</rs>; and he vanished, like a drop in that <placeName reg="Red Sea" key="tgn,7016791">red sea</placeName> upon whose shores so many women stand lamenting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>There was an uncanny sort of fascination in watching him, as he peered and probed into the mechanism of those wonderful bodies, whose mysteries he understood so well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>The more intricate the wound, the better he liked it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>It seemed a David and <persName><foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName> sort of friendship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>The man fretted for his mate, and was never tired of praising John-his courage, sobriety, self-denial, and unfailing kindliness of heart; always winding up with: <quote>He's an out an' out fine feller, ma'am; you see if he aint.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/></p> 
<p>I had some curiosity to behold this piece of excellence, and when he came, watched him for a night or <num value="2">two</num>, before I made friends with him; for, to tell the truth, I was a little afraid of the stately looking man, whose bed had to be lengthened to accommodate his commanding stature; who seldom spoke, uttered no complaint, asked no sympathy, but tranquilly observed what went on about him; and, as he lay high upon his pillows, no picture of dying statesman or warrior was ever fuller of real dignity that this <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> blacksmith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>A most attractive face he had, framed in brown hair and beard, comely featured and full of vigor, as yet unsubdued by pain; thoughtful and often beautifully mild while watching the afflictions of others, as if entirely forgetful of his own. His mouth was grave and firm, with plenty of will and courage in its lines, but a smile could make it as sweet as any woman's; and his eyes were child's eyes, looking <num value="1">one</num> fairly in the face, with a clear, straightforward glance, which promised well for such as placed their faith in him. He seemed to cling to life, as if it were rich in duties and delights, and be had learned the secret of content.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>The only time I saw his composure disturbed, was when my surgeon brought another to examine <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>, who scrutinized their faces with an anxious look, asking of the <pb id="p.50" n="50"/> elder: <quote>Do you think I shall pull through, sir?</quote>

<p>I could have sat down on the spot and cried heartily, if I had not learned the wisdom of bottling up <num value="1">one</num>'s tears for leisure moments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>I could not give him up so soon, or think with any patience of so excellent a nature robbed of its fulfiment, and blundered into eternity by, the rashness or stupidity of those at whose hands so many lives maybe required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>I had not the heart to do it then, and privately indulged the hope that some change for the better might take place, in spite of gloomy prophesies; so, rendering my task unnecessary. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>A few minutes later, as I came in again, with fresh rollers, I saw <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> sitting erect, with no <num value="1">one</num> to support him, while the surgeon dressed his back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>I had never hitherto seen it done; for, having simpler wounds to attend to, and knowing the fidelity of the attendant, I had left <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> to him, thinking it might be more agreeable and safe; for both strength and experience were needed in his case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/><persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> looked lonely and forsaken just then, as he sat with bent head, hands folded on his knee, and no outward sign of suffering, till, looking nearer, I saw great tears roll down and drop upon the floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>It was a new sight there; for, though I had seen many suffer, some swore, some groaned, most endured silently, but none wept.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>Yet it did not seem weak, only very touching, and straightway my fear vanished, my heart opened wide and took him in, as, gathering the bent head in my arms, <pb id="p.52" n="52"/> as freely as if he had been a little child, I said, <quote>Let me help you bear it, <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/></p> 
<p>Nor did he; for now I understood the wistful look that sometimes followed me, as I went out, after a brief pause beside his bed, or merely a passing nod, while busied with those who seemed to need me more than he, because more urgent in their demands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>Now I knew that to him, as to so many, I was the poor substitute for mother, wife, or sister, and in his eyes no stranger, but a friend who hitherto had seemed neglectful; for, in his modesty, he had never guessed the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>This was changed now; and, through the tedious operation of probing, bathing, and dressing his wounds, he leaned against me, holding my hand fast, and, if pain wrung further tears from him, no <num value="1">one</num> saw them fall but me. When he was laid down again, I hovered about him, in a remorseful state of mind that would not let me rest, till I had bathed his face, brushed his bonny brown hair, set all things smooth about him, and laid a knot of heath and heliotrope on his clean pillow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>While doing this, he watched me with the satisfied expression I so liked to see; and when I offered the little nosegay, held it carefully in his great hand, smoothed a ruffled leaf or <num value="2">two</num>, surveyed and smelt it with an air of genuine delight, and lay contentedly regarding the glimmer of <pb id="p.53" n="53"/> the sunshine on the green.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>Although the manliest man among my <num value="40">forty</num>, he said, <quote>Yes, ma'am,</quote> like a little boy; received suggestions for his comfort with the quick smile that brightened his whole face; and now and then, as I stood tidying the table by his bed, I felt him softly touch my gown, as if to assure himself that I was there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>Anything more natural and frank I never saw, and found this brave <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> as bashful as brave, yet full of excellencies and fine aspirations, which, having no power to express themselves in words, seemed to have bloomed into his character and made him what he was. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>After that night, an hour of each evening that remained to him was devoted to his ease or pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>He could not talk much, for breath was precious, and he spoke in whispers; but from occasional conversations, I gleaned scraps of private history which only added to the affection and respect I felt for him. Once he asked me to write a letter, and as I settled pen and paper, I said, with an irrepressible glimmer of feminine curiosity, <quote>Shall it be addressed to wife, or mother, <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/></p> 
<p><quote>Neither, ma'am; I've got no wife, and will write to mother myself when I get better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/><quote>Shall I write to your mother, now?</quote>

<p>So I wrote the letter which he dictated, finding it better than any I had sent; for, though here and there a little ungrammatical or inelegant, each sentence came to me briefly worded, but most expressive; full of excellent counsel to the boy, tenderly bequeathing <quote>mother and <persName><foreName>Lizzie</foreName></persName></quote> to his care, and bidding him good bye in words the sadder for their simplicity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>He added a few lines, with steady hand, and, as I sealed it, said, with a patient sort of sigh, <quote>I hope the answer will come in time for me to see it ;</quote> then, turning away his face, <pb id="p.56" n="56"/> laid the flowers against his lips, as if to hide some quiver of emotion at the thought of such a sudden sundering of all the dear home ties. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>These things had happened <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> before; now <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> was dying, and the letter had not come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>He was; and so rapidly that, even while he spoke, over his face I saw the grey veil falling that no human hand can lift.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>I sat down by him, wiped the drops from his forehead, stirred the air about him with the slow wave of a fan, and waited to help him die. He stood in sore need of help-and I could do so little; for, as the doctor had foretold, the strong body rebelled against death, and fought every inch of the way, forcing him to draw each breath with a spasm, and clench his hands with an imploring look, as if he asked, <quote>How long must I endure this, and be still!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>For hours he suffered dumbly, without a moment's respite, or a moment's murmuring; his limbs grew cold, his face damp, his lips white, and, again and again, he tore the covering off his breast, as if the lightest weight added to his agony; yet through it all, his eyes never lost their perfect serenity, and the man's soul seemed to sit therein, undaunted by the ills that vexed his flesh. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>I thought him nearly gone, and had just laid down the fan, believing its help to be no longer needed, when suddenly he rose up in his bed, and cried out with a bitter cry that broke the silence, sharply startling every <num value="1">one</num> with its agonized appeal: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>He laid himself gently down; and, stretching out his strong right arm, as if to grasp and bring the blessed air to his lips in a fuller flow, lapsed into a merciful unconsciousness, which assured us that for him suffering was forever past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>He died then; for, though the heavy breaths still tore their way up for a little longer, they were but the waves of an ebbing tide that beat unfelt against the wreck, which an immortal voyager had deserted with a smile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>He never spoke again, but to the end held my hand close, so close that when he was asleep at last, I could not draw it away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>When they had made him ready for the grave, <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> lay in state for half an hour, a thing which seldom happened in that busy place; but a universal sentiment of reverence and affection seemed to fill the hearts of all who had known or heard of him; and when the rumor of his death went through the house, always astir, many came to see him, and I felt a tender sort of pride in my lost patient; for he looked a most heroic figure, lying there stately and still as the statue of some young knight asleep upon his tomb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>The lovely expression which so often beautifies dead faces, soon replaced the marks of pain, and I longed for those who loved him best to see him when half an hour's acquaintance with Death had made them friends.

With many, there was much reading of Testaments, humming over of favorite hymns, and looking at such books as I could cull from a miscellaneous library.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>Some lay idle, slept, or gossiped; yet, when I came to them for a quiet evening chat or reading, they often talked freely and well of themselves; would blunder out some timid hope that their troubles might <quote>* do 'em good, and keep 'em stiddy;</quote> would choke a little, as they said good night, and turned their faces to the wall to think of mother, wife, or home, these human ties seeming to be the most vital religion which they yet knew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>I observed that some of them did not wear their caps on this day, though at other times they clung to them like <persName><foreName>Quakers</foreName></persName>; wearing them in bed, putting them on to read the paper, eat an apple, or write a letter, as if, like a new sort of <persName n="Samson,,,,," id="n0116.0006.00083.00066" reg="mostcommon:Samson,nomatch:0"><surname>Samson</surname></persName>, their strength lay, not in their hair, but in their hats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>Many read no novels, swore less, were more silent, orderly, and cheerful, as if the <rs>Lord</rs> were an invisible Wardmaster, who went his rounds but once a week, and must find all things at their best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>I liked all this in the poor, rough boys, and could have found it in my heart to put down sponge <pb id="p.84" n="84"/> and <rs n="tea pot" type="product">tea-pot</rs>, and preach a little sermon then and there, while homesickness and pain had made these natures soft, that some good seed might be cast therein, to blossom and bear fruit here or hereafter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>Regarding the admission of friends to nurse their sick, I can only say, it was not allowed at <placeName reg="Hurlyburly House">Hurlyburly House</placeName>; though <num value="1">one</num> indomitable parent took my ward by storm, and held her position, in spite of doctors, matron, and Nurse Periwinkle Though it was against the rules, though the culprit was an acid, frost-bitten female, though the young man would have done quite as well without her anxious fussiness, and the whole room-full been much more comfortable, there was something so irresistible in this persistent devotion, that no <num value="1">one</num> had the heart to oust her from her post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>She slept on the floor, without uttering a complaint; bore jokes somewhat of the rudest; fared scantily, though her basket was daily filled with luxuries for her boy; and tended that petulant personage with a never-failing patience beautiful to see. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>I feel a glow of moral rectitude in saying this of her; for, though a perfect pelican to her young, she pecked and cackled (I don't know that pelicans usually express their emotions in that manner,) most obstreperously, when others invaded her premises; and led me a weary life, with <quote><persName><foreName>George</foreName></persName>'s tea-rusks,</quote> <quote><persName><foreName>George</foreName></persName>'s <orgName n="foot">foot</orgName>-bath,</quote> <quote><persName><foreName>George</foreName></persName>'s measles,</quote> and <quote><persName><foreName>George</foreName></persName>'s mother ;</quote> till, after a sharp passage of arms and tongues with the matron, she wrathfully packed up her rusks, her son, and herself, and departed, in an ambulance, scolding to the very last. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>This is the comic side of tie matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>The serious <num value="1">one</num> is harder to describe ; for the presence, however brief, of relations and friends by the bedsides of the dead or dying, is always a trial to the bystanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>They are not near enough <pb id="p.85" n="85"/> to know how best to comfort, yet too near to turn their backs upon the sorrow that finds its only solace in listening to recitals of last words, breathed into nurse's ears, or receiving the tender legacies of love and longing bequeathed through them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>To me, the saddest sight I saw in that sad place, was the spectacle of a grey-haired father, sitting hour after hour by his son, dying from the poison of his wound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>The old father, hale and hearty; the young son, past all help, though <num value="1">one</num> could scarcely believe it; for the subtle fever, burning his strength away, flushed his cheeks with color, filled his eyes with lustre, and lent a mournful mockery of health to face and figure, making the poor lad comelier in death than in life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>His bed was not in my ward; but I was often in and out, and, for a day or <num value="2">two</num>, the pair were much together, saying little, but looking much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>The old man tried to busy himself with book or pen, that his presence might not be a burden; and once, when he sat writing, to the anxious mother at home, doubtless, I saw the son's eyes fixed upon his face, with a look of mingled resignation and regret, as if endeavoring to teach himself to say cheerfully the long good bye. And again, when the son slept, the father watched him, as he had himself been watched; and though no feature of his grave countenance changed, the rough hand, smoothing the lock of hair upon the pillow, the bowed attitude of the grey head, were more pathetic than the loudest lamentations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>The son died; and the father took home the pale relic of the life he gave, offering a little money to the nurse, as the only visible return it was in his power to make her; for, though very grateful, he was poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>Of course, she did not take it, but found a richer compensation in the old man's earnest declaration: <pb id="p.86" n="86"/> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>Another day, running up to my room for a breath of fresh air and a <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> rest after a disagreeable task, I found a stout young woman sitting on my bed, wearing the miserable look which I had learned to know by that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>Seeing her, reminded me that I had heard of some <num value="1">one</num>'s dying in the night, and his sister's arriving in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>This must be she, I thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>I pitied her with all my heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>What could I say or do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>Words always seem impertinent at such times; I did not know the man; the woman was neither interesting in herself nor graceful in her grief; yet, having known a sister's sorrow myself, I could not leave her alone with her trouble in that strange place, without a word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>So, feeling heart-sick, home-sick, and not knowing what else to do, I just put my arms about her, and began to cry in a very helpless but hearty way; for, as I seldom indulge in this moist luxury, I like to enjoy it with all my might, when I do. <pb id="p.87" n="87"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>It so happened I could not have done a better thing; for, though not a word was spoken, each felt the other's sympathy; and, in the silence, our handkerchiefs were more eloquent than words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>She soon sobbed herself quiet; and, leaving her on my bed, I went back to work, feeling much refreshed by the shower, though I'd forgotten to rest, and had washed my face instead of my hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>I mention this successful experiment as a receipt proved and approved, for the use of any nurse who may find herself called upon to minister to these wounds of the heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>They will find it more efficacious than cups of tea, smelling-bottles, psalms, or sermons; for a friendly touch and a companionable cry, unite the consolations of all the rest for womankind; and, if genuine, will be found a sovereign cure for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sharp pang so many suffer in these heavy times. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>I am gratified to find that my little <rs type="role2">Sergeant</rs> has found favor in several quarters, and gladly respond to sundry calls for news of him, though my personal knowledge ended <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure> ago.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>You ask if nurses are obliged to witness amputations and such matters, as a part of their duty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>I think not, unless they wish; for the patient is under the effects of ether, and needs no care but such as the surgeons can best give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>Our work begins afterward, when the poor soul comes to himself, sick, faint, and wandering; full of strange pains and confused visions, of disagreeable sensations and sights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>Then we must sooth and sustain, tend and watch; preaching and practicing patience, till sleep and time have restored courage and self-control. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>I witnessed several operations; for the height of my ambition was to go to the front after a battle, and feeling that the sooner I inured myself to trying sights, the more useful I should be.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/><num value="1">One</num> funereal lady came to try her powers as a nurse; but, a brief conversation eliciting the facts that she fainted at the sight of blood, was afraid to watch alone, couldn't possibly take care of delirious persons, was nervous about infections, and unable to bear much fatigue, she was mildly dismissed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>I hope she found her sphere, but fancy a comfortable bandbox on a high shelf would best meet the requirements of her case. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/><rs type="role">Dr.</rs> Z. suggested that I should witness a dissection; but I never accepted his invitations, thinking that my nerves belonged to the living, not to the dead, and I had better finish my education as a nurse before I began that of a surgeon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>But I never met the little man skipping through the hall, with oddly shaped cases in his hand, and an absorbed expression of countenance, without being sure that a select party of surgeons were at work in the dead house, which idea was a rather trying <num value="1">one</num>, when I knew the subject was some person whom I had nursed and cared for. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>I am inclined to think that in some cases it does; for, though a capital surgeon and a kindly man, <rs type="role">Dr.</rs> P., through long acquaintance with many of the ills flesh is heir to, had acquired a somewhat trying habit of regarding a man and his wound as separate institutions, and seemed rather annoyed that the former should express any opinion upon the latter, or claim any right in it, while under his care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>He had a way of twitching off a bandage, and giving a limb a comprehensive sort of clutch, which, though no doubt entirely scientific, was <pb id="p.92" n="92"/> rather startling than soothing, and highly objectionable as a means of preparing nerves for any, fresh trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>I afterwards discovered that he split the wood himself on that cool <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> midnight, and went about making or mending fires for the poor old ladies in their <pb id="p.95" n="95"/> dismal dens; thus causing himself to be regarded as a bright and shining light in more ways than <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>I never thanked him as I ought; therefore, I publicly make a note of it, and further aggravate that modest M. D. by saying that if this was not being the best of doctors and the gentlest of gentlemen, I shall be happy to see any improvement upon it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>To such as wish to know where these scenes took place, I must respectfully decline to answer; for Hurly-burly <persName n="House,,,,," id="n0116.0006.00095.00076" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName> has ceased to exist as a hospital; so let it rest, with all its sins upon its head,--perhaps I should say chimney top. When the nurses felt ill, the doctors departed, and the patients got well, I believe the concern gently faded from existence, or was merged into some other and better establishment, where I hope the washing of <measure n="300" type="sick">three hundred sick</measure> people is done out of the house, the food is eatable, and mortal women are not expected to possess an angelic exemption from all wants, and the endurance of truck horses. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>Since the appearance of these hasty Sketches, I have heard from several of my comrades at the <rs type="place">Hospital</rs>; and their approval assures me that I have not let sympathy and fancy run away with me, as that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>lively team is apt to do when harnessed to a pen. As no <num value="2">two</num> persons see the same thing with the same eyes, my view of hospital life must be taken through my glass, and held for what it is worth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>Certainly, nothing was set down in malice, and to the serious-minded party who objected to a tone of levity in some portions of the <name>Sketches</name>, I can only say that it is a part of my religion to look well after the cheerfulnesses of life, and let the dismals shift for themselves; believing, with good <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName></persName> More, that it is wise to <quote>be merrier in <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</quote>

<p>The next hospital I enter will, I hope, be <num value="1">one</num> for the colored regiments, as they seem to be proving their right to <pb id="p.96" n="96"/> the admiration and kind offices of their white relations, who owe them so large a debt, a little part of which I shall be proud to pay.</p>
