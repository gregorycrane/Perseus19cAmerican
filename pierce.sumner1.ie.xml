<p>I admire the old <name>English</name> authors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>In them is to be found the pure well of <name>English</name> undefiled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>There is a richness of expression with them to which we moderns are strangers; but, above all, there is a force and directness which constitute their chief merit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>They are copious without being diffuse, and concise without being obscure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>They had not then learned&mdash;or, if they had learned, they had not practised&mdash;the art of wire-drawing a sentence into a page, and a page into a book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>Learning was then confined to fewer than at present, and consequently there must have been fewer authors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>There were then no would-be authors, who sprung up like mushrooms, and died as soon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>Few attempted to play the part who were not competent to its performance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>They did not write till the spirit within forced them to; and when they did, they wrote with all that energy and expansion of thought which sincerity and earnestness could not fail to give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>Their illustrations and figures are most striking; there is a simplicity, a grandeur, and, withal, a pertinency, about them which we look for in vain amongst the <quote> exquisites </quote> of our <quote>degenerate days.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>Their works are not scattered over with flowers, which only serve to deck and adorn them without adding to their strength or clearness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>Their figures rather resemble pillars, which are at once ornaments and supports of the fabric to which they are attached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>Witness the beauty and strength of <persName n="Shakspeare,,,,," id="n0206.0004.00049.00552" reg="mostcommon:Shakspeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakspeare</surname></persName>'s allusions, and also those of <persName n="Taylor,,Jeremy,,," id="n0206.0004.00049.00553" reg="default:Taylor,Jeremy,,,"><foreName>Jeremy</foreName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName> and <persName n="Bacon,,,,," id="n0206.0004.00049.00554" reg="mostcommon:Bacon,R.,W.,,:1"><surname>Bacon</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/></p> 
<p>How can we account for this great superiority that they possessed over us in point of real strength and beauty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>It was because they depended more upon their own resources; because they thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>Yet many of their works are most curious examples of pedantry, which none of the dullest dogs of our dull days could hope to equal even in this particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/>My <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> recollections of him are at this period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1895"/>He used to come to our house some <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> evenings in the week, and to his long conversations I used to listen night after night with eager pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1896"/>His simplicity and directness of character, his enthusiasm and craving for information, his lively spirit and genial feeling, immediately made a strong impression on me. My father was very fond of him, always received him with a beaming face, and treated him almost as if he were a son; and we were all delighted to welcome him to our family circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1897"/>He was free, natural, and <hi rend="italics">naive</hi> in his simplicity, and plied my father with an ever-flowing stream of questions; and I need not say that the responses were as full and genial as heart and mind could desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1898"/>When I heard that he was in the room, I quitted all occupations to see and hear him, though for the most part I only played the <hi rend="italics">role</hi> of listener.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1899"/>When other persons came in, he would turn to me and make inquiries as to my studies, and endeavor to help me in them; and at last, out of pure good nature, he proposed to me to come to his room in the <rs type="place">Dane Law College</rs>, and read Latin with him and talk over the ancient authors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1900"/>I gladly accepted the offer, and many an evening I used to spend with him in half study, half talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1901"/>He had the art to render these evenings most agreeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1902"/>He talked of <persName n="Cicero,,,,," id="n0206.0006.00105.01149" reg="mostcommon:Cicero,French,,,:1"><surname>Cicero</surname></persName> and <persName n="Caesar,,,,," id="n0206.0006.00105.01150" reg="mostcommon:Caesar,nomatch:0"><surname>Caesar</surname></persName>; of <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>, <persName><foreName>Virgil</foreName></persName>, <persName n="Tacitus,,,,," id="n0206.0006.00105.01151" reg="mostcommon:Tacitus,nomatch:0"><surname>Tacitus</surname></persName>, Sallust, and indeed of all the old Latin writers; of the influence they had on their age, and their age had on them; of the characteristics of their poetry and prose; of the peculiarities of their style; of the differences between them and our modern authors: and he so talked of them as to interest and amuse me, and bring them before me as real and living persons out of the dim, vague mist in which they had hitherto stood in my mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1903"/>We used then, also, to cap Latin verses; and he so roused my ambition not to be outdone by him that I collected from various authors a book full of verses, all of which I committed to memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1904"/>Of course he beat me always, for he had <pb id="p.106" n="106"/> a facile and iron memory which easily seized and steadily retained every thing he acquired.</p>

<p>Then, as afterwards, his judgment in respect to poetry was not a keen <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1910"/>The higher flights of the imagination, or the rapid ranges of fancy, were above him; and I think his noblest idea of poetry was embodied in <persName n="Gray,,,,," id="n0206.0006.00106.01155" reg="mostcommon:Gray,nomatch:0"><surname>Gray</surname></persName>'s <quote>Elegy,</quote> which he would repeat with sonorous tones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1912"/>He had himself little imagination or fancy, and better loved strong manly sentiments and thoughts within the range of the understanding, and solid facts and statements of principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1913"/>When he could steady himself against a statement by an ancient author he felt strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1914"/>His own moral sense, which was very high, seemed to buttress itself with a passage from <persName n="Cicero,,,,," id="n0206.0006.00106.01156" reg="mostcommon:Cicero,French,,,:1"><surname>Cicero</surname></persName> or <persName n="Epictetus,,,,," id="n0206.0006.00106.01157" reg="mostcommon:Epictetus,nomatch:0"><surname>Epictetus</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1916"/></p> 
<p>He was then, as ever in after life, an indefatigable and omnivorous student.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1917"/>He lived simply, was guilty of no excesses of any kind, went very little into society, and devoted his days and nights to books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1918"/>Shortly after my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> acquaintance with hi, he became librarian of the <orgName n="Dane Law School" type="school">Dane Law School</orgName>, and I think there was scarcely a text-book in the library of the contents of which he had not some knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1919"/>Nor was this a superficial knowledge, considering its extent and his youth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1920"/>He had acquainted himself, also, with the lives, characters, and capacity of most of the authors, and could give a fair <hi rend="italics">resume of</hi> the contents of most of their works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1921"/>His room was piled with books: the shelves overflowed and the floor was littered with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1922"/>Though a devoted student of law, he did not limit his reading to it, but ranged over the whole field of literature with eager interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1923"/>He was at this time totally without vanity, and only desirous to acquire knowledge and information on every subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1924"/>Behind every work he liked to see and feel the man who wrote it, and, as it were, to make his personal acquaintance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1925"/>Whenever a particular question interested him, he would come to my father and talk it over with him, and discuss it by the hour.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1926"/></p> 
<p>He had no interest in games and athletic sports; never, so far as I know, fished or shot or rowed; had no fancy for dogs and horses; and, in a word, was without all those tastes which are almost universal with men of his age. As for dancing, I think he never danced a step in his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1927"/>Of all men I ever knew at his age, he was the least susceptible to the charms of women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1928"/>Men he liked best, and with them he preferred to talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1929"/>It was in vain for the loveliest and liveliest girl to seek to absorb his attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1930"/>He would at once <pb id="p.107" n="107"/> desert the most blooming beauty to talk to the plainest of men. This was a constant source of amusement to us, and we used to lay wagers with the pretty girls, that with all their art they could not keep him at their side <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1931"/>Nor do I think we ever lost <num value="1">one</num> of these bets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1932"/>I remember particularly <num value="1">one</num> dinner at my father's house, when it fell to his lot to take out a charming woman, so handsome and full of <hi rend="italics">esprit</hi> that any <num value="1">one</num> at the table might well have envied him his position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1933"/>She had determined to hold him captive, and win her bet against us. But her efforts were all in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1934"/>Unfortunately, on his other side was a dry old <hi rend="italics">savant</hi>, packed with information; and within <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> <persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n0206.0006.00107.01158" reg="nearbymention:Sumner,Charles,,,"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName> had completely turned his back on his fair companion, and engaged in a discussion with the other, which lasted the whole dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1935"/>We all laughed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1936"/>She cast up her eyes deprecatingly, acknowledged herself vanquished, and paid her bet.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1939"/></p> 
<p>Though he was an interesting talker, he had no lightness of hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1940"/>He was kindly of nature, interested in every thing, but totally put off his balance by the least <hi rend="italics">persiflage</hi>; and, if it was tried on him, his expression was <num value="1">one</num> of complete astonishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1941"/>He was never ready at a retort, tacked slowly, like a frigate when assaulted by stinging feluccas, and was at this time almost impervious to a joke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1942"/>He had no humor himself, and little sense of it in others; and his jests, when he tried to make <num value="1">one</num>, were rather cumbrous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1943"/>But in <quote>plain sailing</quote> no <num value="1">one</num> could be better or more agreeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1944"/>He was steady and studious, and, though genial, serious in his character; while we were all light, silly, and full of animal spirits, which he sympathized with but could not enter into.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1945"/>He was, as a young man, singularly plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1946"/>His complexion was not healthy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1947"/>He was tall, thin, and ungainly in his movements, and sprawled rather than sat on a chair or sofa.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1948"/>Nothing saved his face from ugliness but his white gleaming teeth and his expression of bright intelligence and entire amiability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1949"/>None could believe that he was thus plain in his youth, who only knew him in his full and ripened manhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1950"/>As years went on, his face and figure completely changed; and at last he stood before us a stalwart and imposing presence, full of dignity and a kind of grandeur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1951"/>Age added to his appearance as well as to his influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1952"/>His genial illuminating smile he never lost; and at <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> of age he was almost a handsome, and certainly a remarkable, man in his bearing and looks.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1954"/><hi rend="italics">That</hi> developed itself afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1974"/>Your objections to the Anti-masonic party, and not to Anti-masonry, are perhaps good, though rather too strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1975"/>What party ever showed uniform placidness; and especially what young party?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1976"/>The blood is too warm to beat slowly or healthfully; sores and ulcers show themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1977"/>And so it is with Anti-masonry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1978"/>Some there are with more zeal than knowledge, and whose rabid philosophy will not suffer them to judge in candor and truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1979"/>They strain the principles of their party to such a tension that they almost crack (as in the case you instanced); but pray set this down to the infirmity <pb id="p.109" n="109"/> of man. They, poor men, have their consciences on their side; and with that ally need we admire that they are insensible to those feelings which would make them stop?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1980"/>For myself, my mind is made up: I shall never give back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1981"/>Yet may this hand forget its cunning, if ever aught shall come from me savoring of intolerance or unwarrantable exclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1982"/>I have been scourged into my present opinions by the abuse which my father has met with,&mdash;namely, my mind was brought by this to see what Masonry did, and to inquire what it could do. Anti-masonry has rather a ridiculous, repulsive air, of which no <num value="1">one</num> is more conscious than myself; and had not the circumstances of my father's relation to it brought me into close contact (almost perforce) with it, I should probably have been an unbeliever to this day. Anti-masonry cannot claim its due proportion of talent for the numbers of its professors; and there is nothing strange in this, for it is <hi rend="italics">new</hi>. The religion you profess drew to it none but fishermen when it <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> came down with the <name>Son</name> of the <rs>Father</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/>Truth always walks lame when she <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> starts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1984"/>It is <hi rend="italics">time</hi> which habits her in the wings that bear her upward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1985"/>I have said more upon this than I wished to; for I care not to have it in my mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1986"/>I feel so strongly upon it, that when it is called before me my mind engages itself too much, to the detriment of more profitable thoughts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1987"/>Come to <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> and see me. I room at <placeName reg="Divinity Hall">Divinity Hall</placeName>, <num value="10">No. 10</num>, on the lower floor; and you shall have half of the couch which is mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1988"/>Come, and we will have an evening's chat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1989"/>You will not disturb me; for, though I try to seize every moment of time, yet our law-studies are so indefinite that no number of hours cut out will be missed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1990"/>We recite but <num value="3">three</num> times a week; and <num value="1">one</num> forenoon will master our lesson, though days can be given to it with profit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1991"/>Come, then, and bring with you <q direct="unspecified">The <num value="9">Nine</num></q> book, and <persName n="Browne,,,,," id="n0206.0006.00109.01170" reg="mostcommon:Browne,John,W.,,:1"><surname>Browne</surname></persName> and yourself and myself will renew old scenes and live happy times over again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1992"/>I like living here, for I can be by myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1993"/>I know hardly an individual in the school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1994"/>Days of idleness must be atoned for; the atoning offering is at hand, and it is a steady devotion to <hi rend="italics">study</hi>. Late to bed and early to rise, and full employment while up, is what I am trying to bind myself to. The <hi rend="italics">labor ipse voluptas</hi> I am coveting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1995"/>I had rather be a toad and live upon a dungeon's vapor than <num value="1">one</num> of those lumps of flesh that are christened lawyers, and who know only how to wring from quibbles and obscurities that justice which else they never could reach; who have no idea of law beyond its letter, nor of literature beyond their Term Reports and Statutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1996"/>If I am a lawyer, I wish to be <num value="1">one</num> who can dwell upon the vast heaps of law-matter, as the temple in which the majesty of right has taken its abode; who will aim, beyond the mere letter, at the spirit,&mdash;the broad spirit of the law,&mdash; and who will bring to his aid a liberal and cultivated mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1997"/>Is not this an honest ambition?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1998"/>If not, reprove me for it. A lawyer is <num value="1">one</num> of the best or worst of men, according as he shapes his course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1999"/>He may breed strife, and he may settle dissensions of years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2000"/>But when I look before me and above me, and see the impendent weight,&mdash;<hi rend="italics">molem ingentem et perpetuis humeris sustinendam</hi>,&mdash;I incontinently shrink back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2001"/>Book peers above book; and <num value="1">one</num> labor of investigation is gone only to show a greater <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2002"/>The greatest lawyers, after <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> of enfolding study, have confessed, with the <rs>Wise Man</rs>, <pb id="p.110" n="110"/> that they only knew that they knew nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2003"/>And what a discomfiting expression is here, that all the piled &mdash; up grains of human wisdom will raise <num value="1">one</num> not at all from this earth; that he may labor and heap his acquirements, and yet they are as nothing!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2004"/>He begins with nothing, and ends where he began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2005"/>If it is so, yet knowledge and acquirements are relative; and the man who knows that he knows nothing is yet more wise than the herd of his fellow-men,&mdash;even as much more wise, as wisdom itself is wiser than he is. And here is the place for hope,&mdash;though we cannot mount to the skies or elevate ourself from mother earth, yet can we reach far above those around us, and look with a far keener gaze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2006"/><q direct="unspecified">What man has done, man can do;</q> and in these words is a full fountain of hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2007"/>And again, hear <persName n="Burke,,,,," id="n0206.0006.00110.01171" reg="mostcommon:Burke,Edmund,,,:1"><surname>Burke</surname></persName>: <q direct="unspecified">There is nothing in the world really beneficial that does not lie within the reach of an informed understanding and a well-directed pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2008"/>There is nothing that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has judged good for us that He has not given us the means to accomplish, both in the natural and the moral world.</q><note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2009"/> 
<p>Speech on the <q direct="unspecified">Plan for Economical Reform.</q></p></note> What a sentiment!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2010"/>how rich in expression, how richer in truth!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2011"/>A lawyer must know every thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2012"/>He must know law, history, philosophy, human nature; and, if he covets the fame of an advocate, he must drink of all the springs of literature, giving ease and elegance to the mind and illustration to whatever subject it touches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2013"/>So experience declares, and reflection bears experience out.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2014"/>I have not yet methodized my time,&mdash;and, by the way, method is the life of study,&mdash;but I think of something like the following: The law in the forenoon; <measure n="6hours" type="date">six hours</measure> to law is all that <persName n="Coke,,,,," id="n0206.0006.00110.01172" reg="mostcommon:Coke,Edward,,,:4"><surname>Coke</surname></persName> asks for (<hi rend="italics">sex horas des legibus aequis</hi>), and <persName n="Hale,,Matthew,,," id="n0206.0006.00110.01173" reg="default:Hale,Matthew,,,"><foreName>Matthew</foreName> <surname>Hale</surname></persName> and <persName n="Jones,Sir,William,,," id="n0206.0006.00110.01174" reg="default:Jones,William,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName> and all who have declared an opinion; though, as to that matter, I should be influenced little more than a tittle by any opinions of others.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2021"/>Well, <measure n="6hours" type="date">six hours</measure>,&mdash;namely, the forenoon wholly and solely to law; afternoon to classics; evening to history, subjects collateral and assistant to law, &amp;c.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2031"/>A new curtain has arisen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2032"/>I am treading another scene of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2033"/>I behold new objects of study, and am presented with new sources of reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2034"/>I have left <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> and the profitless thoughts which its streets, its inhabitants, its politics, and its newspapers ever excite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2035"/>I find myself again in loved <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, where are sociability and retirement, and where those frittering cares and thoughts which every city inflicts upon its unlucky sojourners do not intrude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2036"/>I feel differently, very differently, from what I did when I enjoyed this town, in all the <hi rend="italics">nonchalance</hi> of an undergraduate, heedless of <hi rend="italics">time</hi>,&mdash;that property more valuable than <rs type="color">silver</rs> and <rs type="color">gold</rs>,&mdash;and seeking, in the main, a pleasant way to throw away hours and minutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2037"/>I now feel that every moment, like a filing of gold, ought to be saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2038"/>But in the acting up to this feeling, strong as it may be, will lie the failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2039"/>Labor, though we all acknowledge its potency, still has too repulsive a front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2040"/>Be it my duty to see in its appearance nothing but invitation and incentive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2041"/>Yes, duty shall gird me for its endurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2042"/>But, to stop this vague sermonizing, I am now a regular member of the <orgName n="Law School" type="school">Law School</orgName>, have read a volume and <num value="0.5">a half</num> of <persName n="Blackstone,,,,," id="n0206.0006.00111.01178" reg="mostcommon:Blackstone,nomatch:0"><surname>Blackstone</surname></persName>, and am enamored of the law. <persName n="Tower,,,,," id="n0206.0006.00111.01179" reg="nearbymention:Tower,Charlemagne,,,"><surname>Tower</surname></persName>, we have struck the true profession; the <num value="1">one</num> in which the mind is the most sharpened and quickened, and the duties of which, properly discharged, are most vital to the interests of the country,&mdash;for religion exists independent of its ministers; every breast feels it: but the law lives only in the honesty and learning of lawyers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2043"/>Let us feel conscious, then, of our responsibility; and, by as much as our profession excels in interest and importance, give to it a corresponding dedication of our abilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2044"/>And yet I give back in despair when I see the vast weight which a lawyer must bear up under.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2045"/>Volumes upon volumes are to be mastered of the niceties of the law, and the whole circle of literature and science and history must be compassed. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2046"/>Tell me what law-books you have read and are reading, and whether you have taken notes of or <q direct="unspecified">commonplaced</q> any of your study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2047"/>I have taken some notes from <persName n="Blackstone,,,,," id="n0206.0006.00111.01180" reg="mostcommon:Blackstone,nomatch:0"><surname>Blackstone</surname></persName> of the different estates, contingent remainders, &amp;c.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2048"/>He is clear, fluent, and elegant, with occasionally a loose expression and a bad use of a metaphor; but what a good thing for our profession that we can commence our studies with such an author.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2049"/>His commentaries unfold a full knowledge by themselves of the law,&mdash;a knowledge to be filled out by further study, but which is yet a whole by itself. . . .</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2055"/>my dear friend,&mdash;I never receive a letter from <num value="1">one</num> of my old college friends without experiencing a most pleasing melancholy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2056"/>Memory is always at hand, with her throng of recollections and associations, the shadows of past joys,&mdash;joys gone as irrevocably as time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2057"/>Youth and college feelings have given way to manhood and its sterner avocations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2058"/>The course is fairly commenced in the race of life, and every intellectual and corporal agency is bent to exertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2059"/>There are now no <date value="--6">Saturdays</date> bringing weekly respites from drudgery, allowing a momentary stop in the path of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2060"/>All is labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2061"/>It mattereth not the day or hardly the hour, for duty is urgent all days and all hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2062"/>What, then, could bring up more pleasing recollections, and yet tinged with melancholy (because they are never more to be seen, except in memory's mirror) than a letter from <num value="1">one</num> who was present and active in those scenes to which the mind recurs?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2063"/>I sometimes let a whole hour slip by unconsciously, my book unvexed before me, musing upon old times, feelings, and comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2064"/>My eye sees, as exactly as if I had left it but yesterday, the old recitation-room and all its occupants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2065"/>My ear seems yet to vibrate with the sound of the various voices which we heard so often.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2205"/>my dear friend,&mdash;I have received and am grateful for your letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2206"/>The interest you manifest in my welfare calls for my warmest acknowledgments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2207"/>I do not know how I can better show myself worthy of your kindness than with all frankness and plainness to expose to you, in a few words, the state of my mind on the important subject upon which you addressed me. <pb id="p.118" n="118"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2208"/>The last time I saw you, you urged upon me the study of the <hi rend="italics">proofs of Christianity</hi>, with an earnestness that flowed, I was conscious, from a sincere confidence in them yourself and the consequent wish that all should believe; as in belief was sure salvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2209"/>I have had your last words and look often in my mind since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2210"/>They have been not inconstant prompters to thought and speculation upon the proposed subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2211"/>I attended <persName n="Hopkins,Bishop,,,," id="n0206.0006.00118.01231" reg="mostcommon:Hopkins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Hopkins</surname></persName>'s lectures, and gave to them a severe attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2212"/>I remained and still remain unconvinced that <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0206.0006.00118.01232" reg="mostcommon:Christ,nomatch:0"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> was divinely commissioned to preach a revelation to men, and that he was entrusted with the power of working miracles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2213"/>But when I make this declaration, I do not mean to deny that such a being as <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0206.0006.00118.01233" reg="mostcommon:Christ,nomatch:0"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> lived and went about doing good, or that the body of precepts which have come down to us as delivered by him, were so delivered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2214"/>I believe that <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0206.0006.00118.01234" reg="mostcommon:Christ,nomatch:0"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> lived when and as the <name>Gospel</name> says; that he was more than man,&mdash;namely, above all men who had as yet lived,&mdash;and yet less than <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; full of the strongest sense and knowledge, and of a virtue superior to any which we call <name>Roman</name> or Grecian or Stoic, and which we best denote when, borrowing his name, we call it <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Christian,,,,," id="n0206.0006.00118.01235" reg="mostcommon:Christian,nomatch:0"><surname>Christian</surname></persName></hi>. I pray you not to believe that I am insensible to the goodness and greatness of his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2215"/>My idea of human nature is exalted, when I think that such a being lived and went as a man amongst men. And here, perhaps, the conscientious unbeliever may find good cause for glorifying his <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; not because he sent his Son into the world to partake of its troubles and be the herald of glad tidings, but because he suffered a man to be born, in whom the world should see but <num value="1">one</num> of themselves, endowed with qualities calculated to elevate the standard of attainable excellence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2216"/>I do not know that I can say more without betraying you into a controversy, in which I should be loath to engage, and from which I am convinced no good would result to either party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2217"/>I do not think that I have a basis for faith to build upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2218"/>I am without religious feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2219"/>I seldom refer my happiness or acquisitions to the <name>Great Father</name> from whose mercy they are derived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2220"/>Of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> great commandment, then, upon which so much hangs, I live in perpetual unconsciousness,&mdash;I will not say disregard, for that, perhaps, would imply that it was present in my mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2221"/>I believe, though, that my love to my neighbor&mdash;namely, my anxiety that my fellow-creatures should be happy, and disposition to serve them in their honest endeavors&mdash; is pure and strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2222"/>Certainly I do feel an affection for every thing that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> created; <hi rend="italics">and this feeling is my religion</hi>. <quote rend="blockquote"><lg type="stanza"><l>He prayeth well, who loveth well</l> <l>Both man and bird and beast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2224"/>I ask you not to imagine that I am led into the above sentiment by the lines I have just quoted,&mdash;the best of <persName n="Coleridge,,,,," id="n0206.0006.00118.01236" reg="mostcommon:Coleridge,John,Taylor,,:1"><surname>Coleridge</surname></persName>'s <q direct="unspecified">Rime of the <rs>Ancient Mariner</rs>,</q>&mdash;but rather that I seize the lines to express and illustrate my <hi rend="italics">feeling</hi>. <pb id="p.119" n="119"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2807"/>According to tradition, he weighted his arguments with learning where only a skilful handling of testimony would have been most effective; and was not gifted with the quickness of perception which is as essential in the court-room as in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3984"/>my dear <persName n="Frick,,,,," id="n0206.0009.00206.02471" reg="nearbymention:Frick,William,Frederick,,"><surname>Frick</surname></persName>,&mdash;I feel unwilling to leave the country, not to return perhaps until after the completion of your professional studies, without venturing to say a word to you of advice and encouragement, which you will <pb id="p.207" n="207"/> receive as from a friend, I trust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3985"/>My conversation with you during the delightful afternoon at <persName n="Donaldson,Mister,,,," id="n0206.0009.00207.02472" reg="mostcommon:Donaldson,Thomas,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Donaldson</surname></persName>'s has interested me much in your course, and as you then appealed to me, I feel anxious to avail myself of the privilege afforded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3986"/>Let me suggest, then, that you should not hesitate to propose to yourself the highest standard of professional study and acquirement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3987"/>Be not deterred by its apparent impracticability; but strive zealously, and you will be astonished at the progress you make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3988"/>If you place a low standard at which to aim, you will not surely rise above it, even if you reach it; whereas, failing to reach a higher mark may be full of honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3989"/>In plain language, determine that you will master the whole compass of law; and do not shrink from the crabbed page of black-letter, the multitudinous volumes of reports, or even the gigantic abridgments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3990"/>Keep the high standard in your mind's eye, and you will certainly reach some desirable point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3991"/>I am led to make these suggestions from knowing, from my experience with law students, that the whisperings of their indolence and the suggestions of practitioners, with more business than knowledge, lead them to consider that all proper professional attainments may be stored up with very slight study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3992"/>I know from observation that great learning is not necessary in order to make money at the bar; and that, indeed, the most ignorant are often among the wealthiest lawyers: but I would not dignify their pursuit with the name of a profession,&mdash;it is in nothing better than a trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3993"/>And I feel persuaded, from the honorable ambition which characterizes you, that you would not be content to tread in their humble track.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3994"/>Pursue the law, then, as a science; study it in books; and let the results of your studies ripen from meditation and conversation in your own mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3995"/>Make it a rule never to pass a phrase or sentence or proposition which you do not understand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3996"/>If it is not intelligible,&mdash;so, indeed, that a clear idea is stamped upon your mind,&mdash;consult the references in the margin and other works which treat of the same subject; and do not hesitate, moreover, to confess your ignorance or inability to understand it, and seek assistance from some <num value="1">one</num> more advanced in the pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3997"/>In this way, you will gradually&mdash;<hi rend="italics">per intervalla ac spiramenta temporis</hi>&mdash;make advances and clear the way. You may seem to move slowly at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; but it is like the tardy labor of fixing the smooth rails on which the future steam-car is to bowl through the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3998"/>I would not have you understand that I am a devotee of authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3999"/>There are few, I flatter myself, who are more disposed than I am to view the law as a coherent collection of principles rather than a bundle of cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4000"/>With me, cases are the exponents of principles; and I would have you read them in order to understand the principles of the law and the grounds of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4001"/>The best way, therefore, of reading them is in connection with some text-book, following the different references in the margin to their sources, and thus informing yourself of the reasons by which the principles are supported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4002"/>The most important cases, in which some principle has been <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> evolved or <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> received a novel application, are called <q direct="unspecified">leading cases,</q> and all these should be read with great attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4003"/>These are the caskets of the law, containing the great fundamental principles which are applied in numerous subsequent cases of less impression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4004"/>There are not many who can be <pb id="p.208" n="208"/> prevailed upon to study reports in this way; but all who have ever done it, within my knowledge, have reaped ample benefit therefrom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4005"/>In this connection, let me renew my advice that you should diligently study the characters of reporters and judges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4006"/>It may seem a hard task at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blush, but I assure you it is of comparatively easy accomplishment to familiarize yourself with the character of every reporter and of all the important judges in <name>English</name> history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4007"/>To this end read legal biography, wherever you can lay your hands upon it,&mdash;Roscoe's <q direct="unspecified">Lives,</q> the collection in the <q direct="unspecified">London Law Magazine,</q> <q direct="unspecified">American Jurist,</q> &amp;c. Study legal bibliography; acquaint yourself with the time of publication of every legal work, and the repute in which it has been held; examine its preface and look at the book itself, so that you may have it bodily before you whenever you see it referred to.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4008"/>I hope you will not consider me as suggesting too much when I add, Study the <name>Norman</name> or Law <persName n="French,,,,," id="n0206.0009.00208.02473" reg="mostcommon:French,Jonathan,,,:2"><surname>French</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4009"/>A few hours a day for a few weeks will give you a competent knowledge of it. There is a dictionary of the language by Kelham, but it is very poor, and you must rely upon your good wits to assist you. At the beginning of the <q direct="unspecified">Instructor Clericalis,</q> you will find a list of the principal abbreviations which prevail in the black-letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4010"/>Commence studying <persName n="Norman,,,,," id="n0206.0009.00208.02474" reg="mostcommon:Norman,nomatch:0"><surname>Norman</surname></persName> by reading <persName n="Littleton,,,,," id="n0206.0009.00208.02475" reg="mostcommon:Littleton,nomatch:0"><surname>Littleton</surname></persName> in an old copy of <persName n="Coke,,,,," id="n0206.0009.00208.02476" reg="mostcommon:Coke,Edward,,,:4"><surname>Coke</surname></persName>-<placeName reg="Littleton, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050022">Littleton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4011"/>There the translation will serve for a dictionary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4012"/>Then attempt <q direct="unspecified">The Mirror</q> or <persName n="Britton,,,,," id="n0206.0009.00208.02477" reg="mostcommon:Britton,nomatch:0"><surname>Britton</surname></persName>, and a few pages of the <q direct="unspecified">Year-Books.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4013"/>Do not consider that you will never have any use for this learning, and therefore that it is not worth the time it costs to obtain it. A few weeks will suffice to make you such a proficient in it that you will never again be obliged to study it. I assure you that I have found occasion for my scanty knowledge of this; and that, slight as it is, at <num value="2">two</num> different times it has given me opportunities of no little value.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4014"/>I need hardly add to these desultory recommendations that you cannot read history too much, particularly that of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4015"/>History is the record of human conduct and experience; and it is to this that jurisprudence is applied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4016"/>Moreover, in the <rs>English</rs> history is to be found the gradual development of that portion of the common law which is called the <rs>Constitution</rs>,&mdash;for the <orgName n="British Constitution" type="newspaper">British Constitution</orgName> stands chiefly on the common law. The history of legislation in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> contains the origin, also, of portions of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4017"/>History is of itself such a fascinating study that it can need to your mind no such feeble recommendation as mine.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4018"/>But, above all, love and honor your profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4019"/>If you become attached to it, all that you read will make a lively impression on your mind, as the countenance of his mistress upon a lover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4123"/>The course which my studies have taken has also made it highly desirable that I should have the advantage derived from a knowledge of the <rs>European</rs> languages, particularly <name>French</name> and <name>German</name>, and also a moderate acquaintance with the laws and institutions of the Old World, more at least than I can easily gain at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4221"/>I can hardly believe in my personal identity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4222"/>Such is the intensity of my present experience, that all I have undergone to reach here seems obliterated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4223"/>I enjoyed my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sleep ashore last night, in sheets of linen and on a pillow of down, as much as my excited imagination would allow, and early in the morning I prepared for <placeName key="tgn,7008929" n="1.000 4" reg="rouen,departement de la seine-maritime,haute-normandie,france,europe">Rouen</placeName>; breakfasted at <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time>, at the hotel where I was stopping, on a mutton chop, light wine, and coffee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4224"/>Wine in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName> appears to be a drink as common at breakfast as coffee; and, from the experience of <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure>, I should not feel disinclined to adopt the usage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4225"/>I repaired to the place of starting for <placeName key="tgn,7008929" n="1.000 4" reg="rouen,departement de la seine-maritime,haute-normandie,france,europe">Rouen</placeName>, and found the diligence on the point of leaving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4226"/>My place, however, had been secured on the day before, when I had paid <num value="5">five</num> francs as earnest-money, or a sort of pledge, which I was to forfeit if I did not present myself at the proper time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4227"/>As soon as I arrived I was addressed in the rapid <name>French</name> style, <q direct="unspecified">Montez!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4228"/>montez!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4229"/>and the diligence immediately started.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4230"/>I had taken the place on the top. My seat was protected by a heavy and cumbersome covering, like that of a chaise, and my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> desire was to have that thrown back; but my <name>French</name> vocabulary would not enable me to express my wish, so that I was obliged to resort to the universal language of gesture and pantomime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4231"/>My desire being understood, I was informed in French that the top should be turned back when we stopped to change horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4232"/>And it was done.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4233"/> 
<p>The diligence is described at length, and particularly as <q direct="unspecified">very much in the shape of a Boston Booby-hut on runners in the winter.</q></p></note> . . . I was alone on top and tried to enter into conversation with <hi rend="italics">le conducteur</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4234"/>When I undeceived him, he said, pointing to the snakelike stream, that it was the <rs>Mississippi</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4235"/>All the while he and the postilion were whipping their scraggy horses with constant lashes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4236"/>It was an amusing sight to see the <hi rend="italics">empressement</hi> with which they applied the lash, taking hold of the whip-handle with both hands and using it for several minutes together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4237"/>There were sometimes <num value="5">five</num> and sometimes <num value="6">six</num> horses to the diligence,&mdash;all of them short and thick, with rough, uncombed <pb id="p.220" n="220"/> manes, and tails tied up; a practice which seems to be universal here with regard to horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4238"/>Their tails are not docked, but suffered to grow to their natural length, and then tied up to about the same shortness with the docked tail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4239"/>On our way to <placeName key="tgn,7008929" n="1.000 4" reg="rouen,departement de la seine-maritime,haute-normandie,france,europe">Rouen</placeName>, which was <measure n="54miles" type="distance">fifty-four miles</measure>, we changed horses as many as a dozen times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4240"/>I succeeded on the way so well with my little French as to extract considerable information from <hi rend="italics">le conducteur</hi>, and also to add to my facility in the use of the language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4241"/>Now, indeed, I feel the situation of a foreigner, who cannot speak the language of the country where he is. He is cut off from society and from a great source of knowledge, and his thoughts are all imprisoned within himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4242"/>In the few hours during which I have been in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName>, my mind has been chafing in the chains by which it is now confined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4243"/>I feel sensibly the advantages which I lose from not being able to speak the language, and I feel mortified at being restrained to the uttering of a few sentences, and that in such a stammering uncouth way, that the very postilion stares at me. However, I shall not be deterred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4244"/>My rule is to practise upon everybody; to take every opportunity to speak the language, even if it be but a word; for every time of trial gives me assurance, and also adds to my stock of words or phrases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4245"/>Accordingly I did not hesitate all the way from <placeName key="tgn,7008927" n="1.000 4" reg="le havre,departement de la seine-maritime,haute-normandie,france,europe">Havre</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7008929" n="1.000 4" reg="rouen,departement de la seine-maritime,haute-normandie,france,europe">Rouen</placeName> to interrogate <hi rend="italics">le conducteur</hi> to the full extent of my knowledge; and he was pleased to endure me with great grace.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4247"/>It was very smooth, and made easy going for the horses compared with our roads; though the lowness of the wheels of the diligence, and its general cumbersomeness, went far to counterbalance the facilities of the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4248"/>Within a few miles from <placeName key="tgn,7008927" n="1.000 4" reg="le havre,departement de la seine-maritime,haute-normandie,france,europe">Havre</placeName> we passed through Harfleur, the same, I suppose, which <persName><foreName>Harry</foreName> <genName n="5">V</genName></persName>. of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> besieged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4249"/>It is a small but very ancient place, with streets so narrow that it seemed as if I could span them, and surrounded by a decayed wall and moat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4250"/>It was the last part of the month of <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, and yet the plough and harrow were seen constantly in the fields, and sheep grazing, with a shepherd and dog in attendance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4251"/>How the romance of poetry and bucolics was dashed by the appearance of these men!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4252"/>Their flocks did not appear to consist of more than <num value="40">forty</num> or <num value="50">fifty</num> sheep; and they were rude-looking men, who lounged about with a cane instead of a shepherd's crook.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4253"/>Their vocation arises from the absence of fences to separate different parcels of land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4254"/>Here and there you may see a thin ridge or mound of earth, or a hedge, in the neighborhood of a house, and surrounding some choice field; but nearly all the lands are without any kind of fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4255"/>This gives the country a very open appearance to <num value="1">one</num> accustomed to the stone walls and rail fences of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4256"/>By the wayside I constantly saw cottages and barns covered with thatch, which was generally overgrown with moss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4257"/>The thatch appears to be straw matted on the roof quite thickly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4258"/>In observation of the country, and in reflection upon what I saw, the time passed away until, after descending a long and steep hill, we entered <placeName key="tgn,7008929" n="1.000 4" reg="rouen,departement de la seine-maritime,haute-normandie,france,europe">Rouen</placeName>,&mdash;time-honored <placeName key="tgn,7008929" n="1.000 4" reg="rouen,departement de la seine-maritime,haute-normandie,france,europe">Rouen</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4266"/>Next took lodgings at the <rs type="place">Hotel</rs> de Normandie, and dined; and then, having fixed some landmarks in my eye, walked by the lights of the shop windows through the principal streets of the city; passed by <num value="2">two</num> theatres, and about <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time> visited <num value="1">one</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4267"/>My knowledge of French did not serve me so that I was able to take much interest in the play; and though every thing that I saw both on and off the stage had an interest for me, yet it was all blurred by my ignorance of the language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4268"/>The audience appeared very respectable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4269"/>The accommodations were different, as well as more various, than those in our theatres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4270"/>Sentinels were on guard before the doors of both the theatres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4271"/>During the play, I left the house and again wandered round the city before commencing this record of the day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4275"/>Shortly after breakfast, in company with a fellow-traveller, I took a <hi rend="italics">commissionnaire</hi>, or guide, to conduct me to the interesting objects in the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4280"/>Certainly it is immensely vast and elaborate, transcending all that my imagination had pictured as the result of this architecture, The minuteness of the workmanship testifies that it was done by those who commanded hands for labor with a facility not unlike that which summoned the <num value="1000">thousands</num> of laborers who raised the pyramids of <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4285"/>Different parts, in the neighborhood of altars, are occupied by inscriptions and engraved effigies of bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and other eminent men, whose standing or character gave them admission after death to this company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4286"/>Over all was the vast Gothic roof, stretching on with its ancient and numerous arches in imposing perspective; and the light which was shed upon this scene came through richly painted windows, where were martyrdoms and sufferings and triumphs, such as the history of Christianity records.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5231"/>Commenced the morning by a visit with <persName n="Shattuck,Doctor,,,," id="n0206.0011.00259.03024" reg="mostcommon:Shattuck,George,C.,,:1"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Shattuck</surname></persName> to <num value="1">one</num> of the distant hospitals, full of the most disgusting sights and the most impressive moral lessons,&mdash;the <name>Hopital</name> des Veneriens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5232"/>About <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time>, went over the river to the thronged boulevards; in the streets met the fat ox, which was escorted by a band of butchers on horseback, dressed in the most fantastic costumes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5233"/>The boulevards and the <rs type="place">Rue St. Honore</rs> were crowded literally for miles with equipages, with groups of maskers and spectators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5234"/>An ever-present and most numerous police kept this immense and inflammable multitude in the most perfect order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5235"/>For several hours I walked or stood on the boulevards, and during all the time saw not a single instance of collision either between those on foot or those in carriages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5236"/>The people on foot moved on by easy swells without jarring upon each other; the carriages were all kept in regular files or <hi rend="italics">queues</hi>, and moved on slowly as a funeral procession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5237"/>There were many maskers on horseback; others in carts and carriages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5239"/>I was told that formerly, on this occasion, the young men, the <hi rend="italics">&eacute;lite</hi> of society, appeared habited in fantastic dresses; this is now left chiefly, I think, to the lower orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5240"/>Nevertheless, there were many to-day in costume who had gentle blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5241"/>Among the fantastic dresses was a man habited like a bear, with an iron collar about his neck, and another man leading him. He sprawled upon the ground, and then reared himself very much like the hugging animal.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5242"/>Dined at Grignon's, <num value="1">one</num> of the renowned restaurants of <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>; then read at Galignani's reading-room; and at <time value="12am">midnight</time> went to the masked ball at the house of the <rs>French Opera</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5243"/>On this evening, or rather night, <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> is full of balls; every hall, every musical saloon, and almost every theatre, with its pit floored over, has its ball and its set of maskers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5244"/>At the <rs>French Opera</rs> the dancing commenced about <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time>, or a little after; when I left at <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time>, the spirit of the dancers and <hi rend="italics">intrigantes</hi> had not abated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5246"/>The <hi rend="italics">coup d'oeil</hi> was beautiful of the brilliantly dressed assemblage, under a sun-like stream of light from numerous chandeliers, moving in the mazy dance or in the volatile waltz, while the powerful band was pouring out a flood of music.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5247"/>The words for the figures were given through a speaking-trumpet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5248"/>At <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time> in the morning, with some friends, I took a carriage, drove over the boulevards still brilliant with the light of the lamps and the windows of the <hi rend="italics">cafes</hi> and restaurants, all of which were open to receive and entertain the maskers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5249"/>Little rest was there in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> this night, I should think.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5250"/>We stopped about <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time> at a restaurant on the <rs>Boulevard du Temple</rs>, where we took something, whether breakfast or supper it would be difficult to tell; and then drove outside the barriers of <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> to what is called the <name>Courtille</name>,&mdash;a village the other side of the wall, where, on this night, all the common people assemble to enjoy <hi rend="italics">their</hi> dance and <hi rend="italics">their</hi> mask.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5251"/>We entered <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> balls, where dancing was proceeding as vigorously as if the streaks of morning had not begun to appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5252"/>In some of the corners, leaning on the tables, were some sleepers; but the main assemblage seemed to <pb id="p.260" n="260"/> be unconscious of the peep of day. The noise was considerable, but I saw no quarrel, and indeed no disturbance of any kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5253"/>There was, indeed, the deep stamp of low life upon the appearance of every thing; but there was nothing to justify the interference of the police.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5254"/>Here the police was also in great force; horsemen were constantly riding up and down the street, and within each <hi rend="italics">bal</hi> there were stationed several <hi rend="italics">gendarmes</hi>. Shortly after, when morning had finally penetrated the darkness, and many of the dancers, excited from the labors of the long night, had rushed into the street, squads of troops of the line were posted in the street, at intervals of a few rods, for the space of <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> or half a mile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5255"/>It was towards <time value="7oclock">seven o'clock</time> when we left; the light of day had already filled the streets, and was struggling with the lamps in the dancing halls; the music, however, was still sounding, and there were many who danced on in obedience to its time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5256"/>As we came away we passed a train of carriages and <hi rend="italics">citadines</hi>, a mile long, of persons, some maskers and some not, going from the city to see the scene which we had left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5257"/>This is usually the last scene of the <name>Saturnalia</name> of <hi rend="italics">Mardi Gras</hi>. Flour is liberally thrown from and into the carriages without offence being taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5258"/>Glad was I, after struggling for a mile or thereabout over muddy pavements, through the dense crowd which attended these carriages, to find a cabriolet, and set my face homeward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5259"/>At <time value="7:30oclock">half-past 7 o'clock</time> of the morning went to bed so thoroughly fatigued, that I did not recover consciousness till <time value="3">three</time> and <time value="0.5oclock">a half o'clock</time> of the afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5260"/>So much for <hi rend="italics">Mardi Gras</hi> and the last day of a Parisian Carnival.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5296"/>In the <hi rend="italics">salon</hi>, during the <hi rend="italics">soiree</hi>, I could not but observe that the ladies were more herded together than among us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5297"/>Some ladies, indeed, asked me to bring them a book or pamphlet from the table to read; and this was in a room almost crammed with people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5303"/><name>French</name> taste always selects something of this kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5304"/>I have not seen in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> our simple hair-bottom chairs.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5306"/>Took a cab and drove in various directions, leaving letters of introduction, which I had retained till the present time because I could not speak French enough to justify presenting them: and now I do it with the greatest distrust; but, if ever done, it is necessary to do it quickly, as the days which remain to me in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> are few.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5310"/>The dress of the <name>Peers</name> was a blue coat with a standing collar and cuffs trimmed with gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5311"/>The assembly appeared highly respectable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5312"/>Most of the <name>Peers</name> were considerably advanced in years, and the snows of age seemed liberally scattered among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5313"/>The subject under discussion was a law regulating the number of horses and the weight of vehicles allowed to pass on the public roads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5314"/>All the members, who spoke at any length, left their places and mounted the tribune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5315"/>If they only spoke by way of explanation, they did not leave their seats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5316"/>Several Peers who spoke had their remarks apparently written out, and read them from the paper in their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5317"/>The style of debate was entirely creditable; it was animated and courteous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5318"/>Indeed, I can hardly imagine an assembly appearing more respectable, or a debate conducted with more of that spirit by which truth and the public good are best advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5319"/>Yet I cannot help recording, that I observed a Peer standing in a most prominent place, on the elevation of the <rs>President</rs>'s chair, and in conversation with the <rs>President</rs>, with his thumbs stuck in the arm-holes of his waistcoat,&mdash;which I remember hearing years ago was a Yankee trick.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5572"/>Here I shall only mention a few things that I observed, and which will not appear in the published account.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5573"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step was the reading of the <hi rend="italics">act of accusation</hi> or indictment by the clerk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5574"/>The names of <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the witnesses were then called.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5575"/>They were very numerous, and were all sent into an adjoining room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5576"/>Among them was the mother of the prisoner and also the mother of the deceased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5577"/>The prisoner himself was <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num></hi> examined very minutely by the judge, and detailed all the important circumstances of his life, his education, and of his final commission of the offence with which he was charged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5578"/>He gave all the particulars fully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5579"/>This examination was conducted entirely by the <rs type="role" reg="senior-Judge">senior judge</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5580"/>The prisoner cried while telling his story, and did not speak loud enough to be distinctly heard by the jury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5581"/>He was then removed from the witnesses' stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5582"/>The judge next read the <hi rend="italics">proces verbal</hi> of the examination of the prisoner on his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> apprehension, and then the testimony given by physicians at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> examination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5583"/>Witnesses were then introduced <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>; <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the <hi rend="italics">mother</hi> of the accused: she was sworn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5584"/>The oath was very much like ours; so much so, that I think it must have been borrowed from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5585"/>The witness holds up his hand while the judge repeats the oath (the judge not rising); and, at the close of the oath, kisses his hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5586"/>The mother sat while giving her testimony, and was in tears all the while.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5587"/>She frequently fortified what she said by adding that it was given upon her <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">parole d'honneur</hi>,</q>&mdash;which sounded a little curious when she was already under oath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5588"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> witness was a man. He stood up and was examined, as were all after him, by the judge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5589"/>The few questions put by counsel on either side were through the mouth of the judge; and there were not half-a-dozen during the whole trial, and to, perhaps, <num value="30">thirty</num> witnesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5590"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> set of witnesses proved the previous character of the accused; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> set the same of the deceased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5591"/>Next came the doctors, and then the persons who found the body and the prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5592"/>Members of the jury asked questions when they pleased; and all, or nearly all, had a little piece of paper on which to make notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5593"/>The examination of witnesses was completed the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day, and the court adjourned at about <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time> in the afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5599"/>I told him he would commit a crime, according to English and American law,&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">Embracery;</q> but he laughed at the idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5600"/>This forenoon the <name>Procureur</name>-General <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> spoke, then the counsel for the prisoner; then again the <name>Procureur</name>, and again the counsel for the prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5601"/>I understood that they had a right to speak as many times as they chose, the counsel for the prisoner always having the last word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5602"/>In the arguments there was nothing such as I have been accustomed to; every thing was different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5604"/>At the close of his argument, he called upon his client to promise, in the face of the court and of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, that, if he were restored to liberty by the verdict of the jury, he would hasten to precipitate himself upon the tomb of the unfortunate girl he had destroyed and pray for forgiveness; and the prisoner, by way of response, stretched his hand to his counsel, who seized it with a strong grasp, saying at once, <quote lang="fr">J'ai fini.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5605"/>Women screamed and fainted, strong men yielded, and tears flowed down the cheeks of the jury and even the grim countenances of the half-dozen police, or <hi rend="italics">gendarmes</hi>, who sat by the side of the prisoner, elevated and within the observation of all the audience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5606"/>The arguments concluded, the judge, sitting (and the jury sitting), read a very succinct statement of the case, and the law which bore upon it. This occupied perhaps <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure>. The jury then retired, and within less than <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5607"/>The prisoner, in the mean time, had been conducted to a room out of the court-room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5608"/>The jury rendered their verdict, <q direct="unspecified">Not guilty;</q> the prisoner was then brought in, and the judge communicated the decision to him, dismissing him with an impressive admonition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5734"/>Papers of all kinds are admitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5735"/>You will see from these few words that the duties of the judge and advocate are infinitely abridged; the lawyer giving his chief attention to his pleading (<hi rend="italics">plaidoyer</hi>), and the presiding judge putting a series of questions which have been digested beforehand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5981"/>my dear friend,&mdash;I think you have hardly yet lost your interest in <hi rend="italics">inaugurations</hi>, particularly of law-professors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5982"/>I will, therefore, tell you how this affair is ordered in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5983"/>Another professorship, in addition to the <hi rend="italics"><num value="15">fifteen</num></hi> already existing in the <rs type="place">School of Law</rs>, has just been established to treat of <hi rend="italics">comparative penal legislation</hi>; and <persName n="Ortolan,,M.,,," id="n0206.0012.00289.03308" reg="default:Ortolan,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Ortolan</surname></persName> has been chosen professor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5984"/>His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> or inaugural lecture took place last week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5985"/>Now the inaugural lecture is nothing more than the <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num></hi> lecture of the course, in which the professor salutes his audience and gives an outline of his subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5986"/>I presented myself in proper season at the door of the lecture room, and was refused entrance by the janitor because I had no ticket, which was required on this occasion from some motives of <hi rend="italics">police</hi>, but which could have been procured beforehand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5987"/>Determined not to lose the inaugural, I stepped into the porter's lodge, demanded a morsel of paper, and wrote something like the following: <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics"><persName n="Sumner,,M.,,," id="n0206.0012.00289.03309" reg="default:Sumner,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName>, avocat des Etats-Unis, a l'honneur de saluer <persName n="Ortolan,Monsieur,,,," id="n0206.0012.00289.03310" reg="nearbymention:Ortolan,M.,,,"><roleName n="Monsieur">Monsieur</roleName> <surname>Ortolan</surname></persName>, et de lui exprimer son empressement &agrave; entendre la premiere lecon <persName n="Ortolan,,de,M.,," id="n0206.0012.00289.03311" reg="mostcommon:Ortolan,M.,,,:2"><foreName>de</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Ortolan</surname></persName> aujourd'hui.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5988"/>M. S. attendra chez le concierge un billet d'entree</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5989"/>I handed this note to the porter, and asked him to carry it to the professor, who was then in his robing-room, just assuming the red gown and cap. The porter at once returned with <persName n="Ortolan,,M.,,," id="n0206.0012.00289.03312" reg="default:Ortolan,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Ortolan</surname></persName>'s compliments to me, and ushered me into the robing-room of the professor, who received me with great distinction; and astonished me by saying that he had been apprised beforehand of my intention to honor his lecture by my presence, and directed the attendant to show me into the lecture room by the professors' entrance; and I soon found myself seated in the circle of the great lawyers of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName>, near <placeName reg="Dupin">Dupin</placeName>, the <name>Procureur</name>-General, Troplong, the continuator of Toullier, &amp;c. Soon, the professor entered,&mdash;a short, modest, dark-haired man of <num value="35">thirty-five</num> or <num value="40">forty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5990"/>His countenance trembled with anxiety; but his entrance was received with a shout from the students.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5991"/>He took his seat, and then, <hi rend="italics">ex cathedra</hi>, delivered his lecture, putting on his hat immediately after the utterance of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sentence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5992"/>In his lecture he discussed the importance of comparative penal legislation, and gave an outline of the manner in which he proposed to treat the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5993"/>Several times was he interrupted by a shout of applause from the students; and when he ceased the shout was redoubled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5994"/>He immediately left the room, and so ended the inauguration.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5995"/> 
<p>The legal journals which gave an account of the ceremonies noted <persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n0206.0012.00289.03313" reg="nearbymention:Sumner,M.,,,"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName> among the distinguished persons present.</p></note> You see that an inauguration <pb id="p.290" n="290"/> is a simple affair; but I believe that this man met it with as great anxiety as a friend of mine on the other side of the salt sea. The students here form such a numerous and powerful body, and are under so little restraint, that a professor feels much solicitude with regard to his reception until he has actually met them face to face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5996"/>You see, from this account, that there is no solemnity, no squeezing out of reluctant Latin; but the <rs>Latin</rs> must be exhibited before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5997"/>In order to be chosen professor, <num value="1">one</num> must <hi rend="italics">contest</hi> before certain judges certain topics of law in Latin!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5998"/>The judges, after this <hi rend="italics">concours</hi>, as it is called, make the election.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5999"/>In a bundle of books which I shall send home will be a letter, written by a friend of mine, the <rs>Professor</rs> of Commercial Law, to the <rs>Minister</rs> of Instruction, making fun of this old usage, and asking for its abolition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6000"/>I got the author to give me some copies, for I thought it might do good in helping to explode the practice among us of using Latin at inaugurations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6001"/>I find much more to interest me at <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> than I expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6002"/>I have been here <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure>; but I leave much unseen, and many pursuits neglected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6003"/>I wish that I were able to spend <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> more months here, immediately before my return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6004"/>I am excessively anxious to make myself master of the operation of the code and of the system of legal instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6005"/>The last I think I have done pretty well; but the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is a great work which it would take months, perhaps years, to accomplish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6006"/>I shall be in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> soon,&mdash; the great theatre of a different jurisprudence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6007"/>You shall hear how that affects me. This is a dull letter for <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> G.; but my recollections are not the less affectionate on this account.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6015"/>His countenance does not denote the student, but there is in it that quickness of motion and peculiar brightness of expression which rather mark the man of affairs: I might take him for the steward or manager of a large concern in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6016"/>His wife has much more the air of society; she is as graceful as simple, and both exhibited towards each other a loverlike attachment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7812"/>My dear <persName n="Greenleaf,,,,," id="n0206.0015.00379.04867" reg="nearbymention:Greenleaf,Simon,,,"><surname>Greenleaf</surname></persName>,&mdash;Which is the older of the <num value="2">two</num>,&mdash;--you or I?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7813"/>There cannot be much disparity of age, I feel; for you write so freshly as to respond to all the little of youth there is left in me, or I have grown so grave as to be climbing prematurely to the dignity of your years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7814"/>But time has moved faster with me, since I left your planet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7815"/>I certainly can hardly make up my mind, or find voice or even pen-strokes, to call you &lsquo;<rs type="role">Mr.</rs>&rsquo; or &lsquo;Professor.&rsquo; There is no feature in <name>English</name> social life, particularly in the intercourse of the bar, that has more struck me than the familiarity and brotherly tone in which all acquaintances&ndash;I do not say simply friends&mdash;address each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7816"/>At the bar, as a general rule, all barristers address each other simply by their surnames, without any prefix; and there are many of the <rs>English</rs> bar, who are old enough to be my father, whom I address with that familiarity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7817"/>I wish I could talk with you now; there are a <num value="1000">thousand</num> things on my mind that I fear I may lose in the <name>Lethean</name> waters of <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 4" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>, where I go from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and which I should like to discuss with you and the <rs>Judge</rs>, and others of the goodly fellowship.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7818"/>I am now the guest of the <rs>Earl Leicester</rs>,&mdash;the famous &lsquo;old <persName n="Coke,,,,," id="n0206.0015.00379.04868" reg="nearbymention:Coke,William,,,"><surname>Coke</surname></persName>,&rsquo; as he has been called for years,&mdash;who was offered a peerage <num value="4">four</num> times before he accepted it. His house is beautiful beyond expression, and is adorned with the choicest antiques and paintings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7819"/>The rooms are spacious, magnificent, and comfortable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7820"/>His library of manuscripts is said to be the richest in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>; it contains Mss. of most of the classics; also <persName n="Italian,,,,," id="n0206.0015.00379.04869" reg="mostcommon:Italian,nomatch:0"><surname>Italian</surname></persName> and ancient <name>English</name> ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7821"/>They are all beautifully bound, and occupy the shelves which surround a room nearly as large as your study in <placeName reg="Dane Hall">Dane Hall</placeName>&mdash; how my pulse throbs as I write this word!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7823"/>Little did I think when I moiled in the pages of this writer, and almost felt my eyesight fail before his stern black-letter, that I should ever be the guest of his descendant,&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> of the most distinguished peers of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>,&mdash;in <num value="1">one</num> of the most remarkable private dwellings in the world, and permitted to see and examine the very books &mdash;the <hi rend="italics">Registrum Brevium, Statuta Antiqua</hi>, &amp;c.&mdash;that our great master once used, to study his crabbed handwriting, and to pore over the darksome notes and memoranda which he made on the margin of the volumes he read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7824"/><persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Spencer</foreName></persName> and <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Ebrington</foreName></persName> are here; while they are wandering through fields, with their faithful dogs to bear them company, after partridges and pheasants, I have been scanning these gloomy pages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7825"/>On the title-page of many of these books is written, <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Coke,,Edward,,," id="n0206.0015.00379.04871" reg="default:Coke,Edward,,,"><foreName>Edward</foreName> <surname>Coke</surname></persName></hi>,&mdash;being the autograph of the grim lawyer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7826"/>In <num value="1">one</num> of the drawing-rooms of the house is an original portrait of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Coke</foreName></persName>, by <persName n="Janssen,,,,," id="n0206.0015.00379.04872" reg="mostcommon:Janssen,nomatch:0"><surname>Janssen</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7827"/>You may imagine that I have felt no common thrill in being thus permitted to look upon these things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7828"/>Have I not cause for great gratitude in the opportunities of gratifying so many of my fondest desires, in enjoying the society and confidence <pb id="p.380" n="380"/> of so many of the learned in the law, in mingling with the good and great in such various walks of life?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7829"/>I have feasted from silver, and lived among nobles; but I believe that you would find me at the present moment not less desirous of getting knowledge and doing my duty, than I have ever been during the few years in which I have had the happiness of your friendship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7830"/>I look forward to my return with no little anxiety; and hope, after a few days of quiet intercourse with my friends, to renew the labors which I have for the while forsaken; to grasp resolutely the plough which I have left in the furrow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7831"/>Tell me frankly; do you and the <rs>Judge</rs> think it would have been better for me had I stayed at home?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7832"/>This broad page of human life which I have been studying has been full of instruction; and I feel that I know more, and can do more, than before I forsook my affairs for <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7833"/>You have thrown out some hints with regard to my occupying a place with you and the <rs>Judge</rs> at <placeName reg="Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England" key="tgn,7010874">Cambridge</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7834"/>You know well that my heart yearns fondly to that place, and that in the calm study of my profession I have ever taken more delight than in the pert debate at the bar. I shall only wish to see some distinct and honorable line of duty marked out for me, and I shall at once enter upon it. I should observe, however, that, for various causes, I shall feel a strong obligation to devote myself to my profession on my return, in such wise as will insure me the most considerable income,&mdash;those principles of duty and honor being regarded which you have taught me never to lose sight of. I shall of course be always obliged by your advice and suggestions, and hope to hear from you at length before my return with regard to the best way of recovering the place in my profession which I have left.
