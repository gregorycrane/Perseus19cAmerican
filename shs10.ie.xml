<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>[In our discussion of the <quote>Treatment of prisoners</quote> we introduced the testimony of a number of Federal prisoners to refute the wholesale slanders against us, which had been published in every form and scattered over the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>We have recently met with the following, which is <num value="6">No. 6</num> of a series of articles which <persName n="Boate,Mister,,,," id="n0123.0003.00025.00654" reg="mostcommon:Boate,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Boate</surname></persName> published in the <orgName n="New York News" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">News</hi></orgName> in <dateStruct value="1865-07-"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>We regret that we have not the full series, for, from this specimen, we are satisfied they would all be valuable additions to our large collection of material.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>But the paper we give below (coming from a man who was <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> a prisoner, who was in position to know whereof he affirms, who was a member of the commission sent to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> by the prisoners to endeavor to effect an exchange, and who published his statements at a time when he had to <pb id="p.26" n="26"/>face great obliquy to do so) will be found of great interest as well as valuable testimony on points we made in the discussion :]</p></quote> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>The bread was badly baked, the bakery being run night and day; the <measure n="10000" type="prisoners">ten thousand prisoners</measure>--the number originally intended to be confined at <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.273 000000.5455	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.273 000000.5455	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName> &mdash; having risen to <num value="38000">thirty-eight thousand</num>, and, in addition to the fact that many of our men engaged in the bakery had very little sympathy with the poor men in the stockade, and took as little trouble with their work as possible, they were themselves overtasked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Hence the bread was badly baked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>Besides, our men were not used to corn bread, a fact which used to mate the <name>Georgians</name> wonder, as they grew fat on corn bred, just as the healthiest and most ablebodied Irishman you could meet at a fair was a man whose principal food was potatoes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>The water was diarrhoeal &mdash; a fact which was as injurious to the health of the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities in that locality as to our men. But this difficulty was partially obviated by the digging of innumerable wells in various parts of the prison, and excellent water obtained, which the well diggers monopolized and sold for a cent a glass to those who had no claim on the wells.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>But our men were great sufferers, and deaths were alarmingly on the increase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>The Confederate doctors were, as I have already said, themselves startled and alarmed at the progress of disease and death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>But they seemed powerless to check it. I can honestly say &mdash; and every man who was connected with the hospital department will bear me out &mdash; that the <num value="25">twenty-five</num> or <num value="30">thirty</num> Confederate surgeons who were in attendance at the hospital and in the stockade, acted with as much humanity to-ward the prisoners as the disheartening circumstances would permit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>We were often a fortnight without being able to get medicine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>They had no quinine for fever and ague; they had no opium for diarrhoea and dysentery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Our government made medicine a contraband of war, and wherever they found medicine on a blockade runner, it was confiscated, a policy which indicated, on the part of our rulers, both ignorance and barbaric cruelty; for, although no amount of medicine would save many of our men who have laid their bones in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, I am as certain as I am of my own existence, that hundreds of men died, who, if we had had the right sort and proper quantity of medicine, would have been living to-day and restored to their families.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>Scurvy was another disease which was making formidable inroads upon the health of the prisoners, but vegetables could not be had for love or money, although for miles the country was scoured, and I knew <pb id="p.27" n="27"/><persName n="White,Chief-Surgeon,,,," id="n0123.0003.00027.00655" reg="mostcommon:White,Elijah,V.,,:2"><roleName n="Chief-Surgeon">Chief Surgeon</roleName> <surname>White</surname></persName> to pay from a <num value="100">hundred</num> to <measure n="200dollars" type="currency">two hundred dollars</measure> for a quantity of squashes, collards, onions and other garden stuff which could have been purchased in <placeName reg="Fulton, Callaway, Missouri" key="tgn,2058848">Fulton</placeName> or <placeName reg="Washington market">Washington market</placeName> for <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6dollars" type="currency">six dollars</measure>; although a <quote>greenback</quote> in <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.205 000000.4091	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.205 000000.4091	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName> rated at only <num value="4">four</num> times the value of a Confederate dollar &mdash; at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> it was rated at <num value="10">ten</num> and <num value="12">twelve</num> Confederate dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>These vegetables were necessarily, from their limited quantity, confined to the hospital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>In addition to this the hospital was supplied with eggs, no doubt in limited quantities. [<measure n="3dollars" type="currency">Three dollars</measure> in greenbacks for a dozen of eggs.] Fresh beef was supplied to the hospital <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> times a week, and sometimes to the stockade, when it could be had, cattle having for this purpose been sought for miles around the country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>The hospital and sick men in the stockade were supplied with whiskey, <num value="3">three</num> and <measure n="4barrels" type="mass">four barrels</measure> having been some days brought into headquarters, and regular details of our own men appointed to distribute it, who, however, often drank the rations themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The hospital was supplied with tea and sugar, not abundantly to be sure, but hospitals, even in <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York city</orgName>, are not over-abundantly supplied with such articles.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Nevertheless, great misery prevailed in the stockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>But it was inevitable from the circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>The men, <num value="2">two</num> out of every <num value="3">three</num>, had no change of underclothing, and although there was water enough to wash them, they could not get soap, an article of which the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities were themselves especially in need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The bodies of our men, and indeed the minds, had become prostrated from long confinement, in many instances <num value="16">sixteen</num> and <measure n="20months" type="date">twenty months</measure>. There were gathered into <num value="1">one</num> prison, by the force of events, nearly <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> men, to be provided with food, and <num value="5000">five thousand</num> with medicine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>They were deprived of their accustomed food, and had to live upon the same kind of rations, day after day, nearly the whole of the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>But none, except those who have gone through the mill, know what a tremendous task it is to provide daily rations for such a vast multitude of human beings.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>There are some special facts I wish to state of my own knowledge, as they will throw some light on this unhappy subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>It has been stated over and over, and reiterated in a <num value="1000">thousand</num> different shapes, that the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities meant to starve our men. But I, who was <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> a prisoner of war, and suffered sickness, and cold, and hunger, in common with the other prisoners, deny this flatly, for, while we all suffered, there was no desire to inflict suffering or hardship upon Federal prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>Why, the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities were suffering <pb id="p.28" n="28"/>many a privation at <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.182 000000.3636	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.182 000000.3636	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>The surgeons who were in attendance upon the sick had not decent shoes or stockings; their shoes and boots being in many instances so patched, that the original leather out of which they had been manufactured had become invisible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>These gentlemen, men of education and professional ability, and who were reared in luxury, did not know often &mdash; while giving their services daily and nightly to such a host of prisoners &mdash; where to look for a dinner or a bed. During the <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> I was in <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.182 000000.3636	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.182 000000.3636	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName>, not <num value="1">one</num> of them received a dollar's pay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>He was an able surgeon, humane, enlightened, abstemious and self-denying, and had all the high-souled chivalry and deportment of the best of the F. F. V's.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>In this connection, let me refer to <persName n="Wirz,Captain,,,," id="n0123.0003.00028.00658" reg="mostcommon:Wirz,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wirz</surname></persName>, the <name>Commandant</name> of the prison, who was generally regarded as being very harsh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>He was a mere keeper of prisoners &mdash; a work which can never be popular.

The trenches were, moreover, so hastily constructed, that they barely afforded room for the line of battle to crouch in, and in many places egress to the rear being impossible from the severity and accuracy of the sharp-shooters' fire, and locomotion to the right and left being extremely difficult, though the crowds huddled together in the water they soon became offensive beyond description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>Fires were strictly prohibited by day and night, the greatest, and what it made it harder to bear, perhaps an entirely unnecessary hardship, under the circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>The scanty rations, generally miserably cooked at the camps, were brought into the trenches at night and distributed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>Very great changes of officers, particularly of <rs type="role2">Captains</rs> and <rs type="role2">Lieutenants</rs>, resulted from these elections, and while many excellent officers were promoted, many others were entirely thrown out, and the whole effect was very prejudicial to the discipline of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1477"/>I do not suppose any candid mind informed of the evidence, circumstantial and direct, oral and documentary, doubts where the responsibility for the crime lies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1478"/>Still it does no harm to have cumulative evidence on so interesting a subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1479"/>What I have to relate proves, I think, that <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0123.0016.00109.01649" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> found no fire in the city, when his troops entered, and that he was in entire and undisputed possession for hours before the conflagration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1481"/>A few months since I noticed a most remarkable plea in his favor advanced by <quote><hi rend="italics">The Nation</hi>,</quote> a respectable and ably conducted newspaper published in New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1482"/>The editor generally strives to bear himself fairly towards his opponents in argument, though not always in a style entirely free from flippancy or self-righteousness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1483"/>The idea expressed was, in substance, that <hi rend="italics">because</hi> <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0123.0016.00109.01651" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> holds a high rank in official circles, <hi rend="italics">therefore</hi> any statements made by him about matters concerning himself <pb id="p.110" n="110"/>and others were to be accepted as conclusive, and that it was <quote>very bad form</quote> to listen to evidence to the contrary from any <num value="1">one</num>, even from <num value="1">one</num> claiming to be suffering under an unjust charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1484"/>In other words, the testimony of the prisoner at the bar in his own favor proves incontestably his innocence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1485"/>Rather than adopt such an absurd view as this, I would prefer to endeavor to become more credulous about the psychological influence of names than <persName n="Shandy,,Tristram,,," id="n0123.0016.00110.01652" reg="default:Shandy,Tristram,,,"><foreName>Tristram</foreName> <surname>Shandy</surname></persName>'s father, and then <num value="1">one</num> might believe that <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0123.0016.00110.01653" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> has been borne down to savagery by the weight of his <name>Indian</name> name, without involving his own moral responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1488"/>In the latter part of the month of <dateStruct value="1864-12-"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, the <orgName n="Cavalry Division" type="division">cavalry division</orgName> in which I was serving as a private, was in winter quarters near <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg, Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1489"/>The campaign, which was, I believe, the bloodiest of the war, had not been long ended.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1490"/>Our division, consisting of <num value="2">two</num> brigades, each composed of <num value="3">three</num> regiments, had come to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> from the <rs>South</rs> early in the spring with full ranks and in excellent condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1491"/>Now, our numbers did not much exceed those of <num value="1">one</num> ordinary regiment of the maximum numerical strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1492"/>Thus had our division been boiled down in the devil's cauldron of war to a very small residuum.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1493"/>At the time of which I am speaking we were doing picket duty a few miles from camp, and were suffering a good deal from cold, so that we all thought it a great nuisance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1494"/>We were very much pleased therefore to hear the news that we were under marching orders for <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia, S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1495"/>Any change is agreeable to soldiers in winter quarters, whose only variation from the dull monotony of camp life is picketing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1496"/>Moreover square meals were to us pioneers of the <name>Tanner</name> system, a recollection of the dim, and shadowy past, while we regarded ourselves as being about to go to a land comparatively overflowing with milk and honey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1497"/>Our joy, however, was not entirely unalloyed by regrets at leaving, for we had great pride in the army of which we were a part, and in the fame of our incomparable chieftain; and the soil itself was endeared to us by kindnesses received from its self-sacrificing people, and by the bones of our many comrades reposing in it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1498"/>We soon found ourselves in front of <placeName key="tgn,7013641" n="1.000 5" reg="columbia, richland, south carolina">Columbia</placeName> awaiting the approach of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1501"/>Of all the officers of this grade in the army, my impression is, only <num value="2">two</num> attained the rank who had not received a technical military education, and these were <persName n="Hampton,General,,,," id="n0123.0016.00111.01659" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,Wade,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName> and <persName n="Forrest,General,,,," id="n0123.0016.00111.01660" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,N.,B.,,:1"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Forrest</surname></persName>, both of the cavalry.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1503"/>Besides our division, there was in front of <placeName key="tgn,7013641" n="1.000 5" reg="columbia, richland, south carolina">Columbia</placeName> but a very slender force of cavalry, consisting mainly of fractions of regiments from the <rs>West</rs>, in a more or less demoralized condition, some of whom proved more of a nuisance to the friends than a terror to their enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1504"/>The consolidation of our command with the garrisons of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 4" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, and some other places, took place after the retreat from <placeName key="tgn,7013641" n="1.000 5" reg="columbia, richland, south carolina">Columbia</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1505"/>The importance of holding <placeName key="tgn,7013641" n="1.000 5" reg="columbia, richland, south carolina">Columbia</placeName> did not arise from its strategical value, for it possessed very little of this for friend or foe. It was protected by no fortifications, nor was there military stores there of any practical importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1506"/>It was for these reasons deemed not impossible that <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0123.0016.00111.01662" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:2"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> would not come in force against the place, as no military reasons existed for his doing so, and that if a feeble demonstration were made against it, we might be able to frustrate it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1507"/>As the capture of the city was needless strategically, it follows that its subsequent destruction was without a vestige of justification or excuse.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1508"/>The desire of our commander to keep the town intact from the enemy doubtless did not proceed so much from his instincts as a soldier, as from his feelings as a man. This place had been for several years an asylum of refuge for the homeless, not only from its own State, but also measurably from all parts of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1509"/>Being far from the coast, and remote from where the tragedy of war had hitherto been enacted, and food being accessible, it was supposed to be a safe retreat for the impoverished, weary wanderers from once happy homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1510"/>Thither had fled from the advance of the invader, and too frequently from his torch, enfeebled, gray-haired men, bowed down under the weight of years and misfortunes, tenderly-nurtured women, ill able to withstand the buffets of adversity, gentle maidens in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> bloom of loveliness, and innocent little children, crying aloud to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for bread <pb id="p.112" n="112"/>in the agony of hunger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1511"/>These poor beings had painfully struggled to this narrow strip of dry land in their deluge of ruin, and now wet, exhausted and shivering, were still bearing themselves with fortitude in their forlorn plight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1512"/>Hard must have been his heart who could push them back into the cruel waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1513"/>I do not envy that man, <quote>despite his titles, power and pelf</quote> who could find it in his nature to withhold from them pity and respect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1514"/>These refugees had brought with them whatever trifling remnant of their lost fortunes or mementoes of their loved homes they could manage to save from the wreck &mdash; jewelry, silver, pictures, and other heirlooms, silk dresses, valuable shawls and lace; in short, whatever had been saved and could be sold were disposed of to Jews and blockade-runners' agents, and the pittances thus realized sufficed to keep away actual starvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1515"/>Every house was packed to overflowing with occupants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1516"/>To save these poor non-combatants from pillage (for no <num value="1">one</num>, or very few, apprehended the utter destruction <hi rend="italics">which it is since known was then deliberately planned</hi>,) it was determined to hold our ground as stoutly as possible against any attack that might be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1517"/>We were not kept long waiting, for soon some of the advancing columns of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0123.0016.00112.01663" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:2"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, with the remaining ones in supporting distance, were encountered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1518"/>I am unable to give an accurate, technical account of the military operations, and therefore shall not make the attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1519"/>I would say, however, that some rather tall fighting, in a smallish sort of way, took place, and that we made it as hot for them as our limited numbers would admit of. When did troops, who had had the proud honor of being a part of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">army of Northern Virginia</orgName>, ever fail to do their duty gaily when the grand thunder of battle pealed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1520"/>When our beloved <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</rs> put himself at our head, his manly form dilated with enthusiasm, and his eyes flashing, and called, <quote>Troops from <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, follow me!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1522"/>Soon, however, it became apparent that in spite of all efforts we could not for long withstand the overwhelming numbers against us. We checked them for a time, but retreat was unavoidable unless reinforcements could be sent us, which was impracticable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1523"/>Oh! it was sad and humiliating for strong men to know that they must turn their backs upon the city and leave its helpless population to their fate, though the terrible doom awaiting them was not imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1524"/>Our intrepid leader had blown in vain his last bugle-blast for the sorely needed succorers; he was forced to submit reluctantly to the inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1525"/><pb id="p.113" n="113"/></p> 
<p>The retreat from <placeName key="tgn,7013641" n="1.000 5" reg="columbia, richland, south carolina">Columbia</placeName> was decided on, and to our brigade was assigned the position of <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1526"/>Our gallant, and brilliant divison commander, <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0123.0016.00113.01664" reg="mostcommon:Butler,Nathaniel,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>, personally superintended our operations, which were necessarily of a delicate nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1527"/>The retreat is sometimes termed an evacuation, but I should suppose, incorrectly so, as the place was unfortified, and no troops had been operated from, or quartered in it; they had simply been manoeuvered in its neighborhood, not from it, and had merely passed through its streets in retreating, when it was necessary to do so. Only non combatants had occupied the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1528"/>The final withdrawal took place on <dateStruct value="-02-17"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg="17">17th</day></dateStruct>, but on the previous day, or during the night all troops had been brought across the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/>It was on this day or the previous day, I think, that <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0123.0016.00113.01665" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:2"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> shelled this city of women and children without the slightest military or moral justification or excuse, and without the smallest chance, or purpose of injuring any <num value="1">one</num> but non-combatants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1530"/>I happened to witness the scene, as I had been dispatched through the town with an order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1531"/>The new State-house, then incomplete, but an imposing structure, was being used as a target apparently, for the shells were striking about that neighborhood to the infinite peril of many whose sex or tender years should have proved a secure aegis from violence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1532"/>On the morning of the retreat, our brigade, which, as already mentioned, was the last body of Confederate troops to leave the town, marched out at an early hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1533"/>At some distance behind the main body followed a small detachment of <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> men, which halted just outside of the town and took up a position on the crest of a bill beyond the <rs type="place">Charlotte depot</rs>, over-looking the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/>I was <num value="1">one</num> of that detachment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/>The object of thus posting us, was, I suppose, to observe the enemy and to prevent the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> from being surprised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/>This body was, at the time, covering the retreat of a portion of our wagon-train, and would have been obliged, if necessary, to skirmish for its protection, but this would have occurred at some little distance from the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/>From the lower level of the streets our appearance must have been that of the front of a column of some size, and not merely a handful of men which would discourage small detachments from ascending the hill to molest us, and was, no doubt, so intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>We had been strictly ordered to fire no shots under any circumstances, relying upon our sabres alone, as no excuse was to be given to the enemy for inaugurating violence in the streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>Below this little eminence stretched out the city, plainly to be seen from where we were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>The road which we occupied ran at right angles to the street down which <orgName n="column"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0123.0016.00113.01666" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:2"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s column</orgName> entered, and, before long, we saw the line of blue pouring steadily like a river <pb id="p.114" n="114"/>towards the other end of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1541"/>It was a very impressive spectacle, and I am not likely to forget it, while I live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1542"/>For the information of my many worthy friends in the militia, I would say, that their sweetly-pretty parades do not at all remind me of the scene then before me. Up to this time there had been no fires in the town except an accidental <num value="1">one</num> in some military stores kept at a railroad depot, which did no damage elsewhere, and which is admitted to have had no connection whatever with the subsequent conflagration at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/>On this hill I remained for several hours, and in the meantime the city had been completely and peacefully occupied by <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0123.0016.00114.01667" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:2"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1544"/>At <num value="1">one</num> time a few infantry skirmishers had been thrown out towards us, and some harmless bullets from long range had whirred over our heads, but we did not return the fire, which soon ceased and was not renewed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1545"/>It will be understood that being then a private, I have no memoranda written at the time, and that I would not usually take any special note of hours of the day, or even of dates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1546"/>I am unable, therefore, to state the hour at which <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0123.0016.00114.01668" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:2"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s entry began, or the number of hours during which our occupancy of the hill lasted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1547"/>The facts which I relate, however, prove, it seems to me, the entire and undisputed occupation of the city by <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0123.0016.00114.01669" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:2"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> before any fires were visible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1548"/><hi rend="italics">That</hi> is the vital point which, once admitted, makes it undeniable that the place was burnt with his responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1551"/>He mentions that after the occupation had been some time completed he was riding towards the <rs type="place">Charlotte depot</rs>, but was advised not to do so by some of his men, as <quote>rebel videttes</quote> were visible on the hill beyond, as he himself saw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1553"/>Shortly before we had taken up our position on the little hill, which I have been alluding to, and when we were quite near it, I had obtained permission from my commanding officer to return to the town for a few minutes, and had dashed back accordingly, as fast as spurs liberally applied could take me. As I turned a corner with furious speed I suddenly found myself confronted by a small column of horsemen, coming on a walk from an <pb id="p.115" n="115"/>opposite direction, into which I was madly charging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1554"/>I made a strenous effort to check my mare, but she was a hard-mouthed brute, the villainous curbchain snapped, and a very serious collision was only prevented by the dexterity of the leader of the band.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1555"/>You may faintly imagine my amazement and discomfiture, when that leader proved to be <persName n="Hampton,General,,,," id="n0123.0016.00115.01672" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,Wade,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName>, followed by his staff and couriers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1556"/>Thus was I very near performing a feat never yet achieved by mortal man, single-handed, unhorsing that peerless knight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1557"/>I explained my strange proceeding, feeling very foolish about it, but was dismissed on my errand with a kindly smile, and a wave of the hand, as the <rs>General</rs> rode out of the town.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1558"/>It will be necessary for me to explain why I had returned to the city where there were no Confederate troops to whom I could have been sent to carry dispatches from my officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1559"/>I must confess that the cause was no more and no less than the recollection of the whereabouts of a few dozen of <placeName reg="Madeira, Putnam, Ohio" key="tgn,2478598">Madeira</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1560"/>It is a refining wine, <num value="1">one</num> inspiring noble impulses, and therefore no true cavalier would hesitate to run the risk of a few vulgar bullets for the sake of its delicious perfume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1561"/>It is altogether different from whiskey, which, it is said, will make a man steal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1562"/>Apropos of that, <orgName n="regiments"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0123.0016.00115.01673" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:2"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s regiments</orgName> were chiefly recruited where whiskey is the <hi rend="italics">vin du pays</hi>. My earnestness in my mission will, at all events, not be doubted when it is remembered that <orgName n="Confederate Cavalry" type="org">Confederate cavalry</orgName>-men furnished their own mounts, and when I mention, that I bestrode a war-horse worth <measure n="3000dollars" type="currency">$3,000</measure>, whose valuable life I was thus risking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1563"/>This sounds well, suggestive of the resplendent days of chivalry, but lest it should be thought that my prowess in drawing the long bow is greater than my skill with other weapons, I will be obliged to say, that the said <measure n="3000dollars" type="currency">$3,000</measure> thus invested were the proceeds of only <measure n="20l." type="pounds"><num value="20">twenty</num> pounds</measure> sterling (about the equivalent of <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">$100</measure> gold), part of a remittance which I found awaiting me on my arrival at <placeName key="tgn,7013641" n="1.000 5" reg="columbia, richland, south carolina">Columbia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1564"/>This amount was exchanged for me into Confederate money by a benevolent trader, with a generosity worthy of a descendant of some of the stowaways by the <quote>Mayflower,</quote> as I afterwards discovered that he had not <quote>shaved</quote> me to a much greater extent than <num value="0.25">twenty-five per cent.</num></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1565"/>Besides the quest for wine I had another, and perhaps a better, reason for my private raid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1566"/>A lady of my acquaintance in the city, a refugee, had a small store of rare wine, which had been saved in some way from the general wreck of her home, and it was almost the only article of value saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1567"/>It was possible by selling some of this from time to time (blockade-runners' agents the purchasers) to procure necessary food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1568"/>This was not the only use made of the slender supply however, as many a sorely wounded soldier could with gratitude attest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1569"/><pb id="p.116" n="116"/></p> 
<p>This kind lady was so unduly complimentary as to suppose that I would know beforehand if a retreat was decided on, and could therefore furnish her timely warning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1570"/>Of course this was a mistake, as I was only a private, but still I had been asked to bring her the desired information, and had promised to do my best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1571"/>The precious wine would have to be destroyed when it became certain we were to leave the city behind us, for then the wary traders would no longer purchase it, and if seized by the enemy on his entry it might contribute to produce drunken excesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1572"/>I had not known absolutely that we were to retreat until the night before &mdash; up to that time still hoping that reinforcements would render this unnecessary, and since that time it had been absolutely impossible for me to leave ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1573"/>This, therefore, had had been the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opportunity for fulfilling my promise.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1574"/>Pouring the fragrant contents of the bottles on the ungrateful ground was a very disagreeable libation to witness, so I lessened it as much as possible by putting as many as I could manage in my overcoat pockets and saddle holsters, and fastening others to my saddle-tree by straps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1575"/>I do not suppose <num value="1">one</num> horse and man every carried so many bottles before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1576"/>Meanwhile time was flying, and so must I be, unless desirous of testing the penetration of the enemy's rifles, or the cheer that he furnished to his uninvited guests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1577"/>So I had to mount in hot haste and away in my loaded down condition, not cutting as graceful a figure I fear as romantic young Lochinvar, judging from the difficultly suppressed mirth of the ladies, but more resembling doubtless the worthy <rs>Gilpin</rs>, though more fortunate than he. I got my bottles through unbroken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1578"/>Not that it was any laughing matter for the poor ladies, for they were losing almost their last resource, but <quote>'tis better to laugh than to cry</quote> says the proverb, and it is certainly more becoming to the sex, even charming in spite of being blockaded from the fashions and fabrics of <persName n="Werth,,,,," id="n0123.0016.00116.01674" reg="mostcommon:Werth,nomatch:0"><surname>Werth</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1580"/>When I reached the hill, where my detachment was posted, the advance guard of the enemy was already in the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1581"/>In passing through the streets I had seen no <num value="1">one</num> except an anxious female face at an upper window occasionally, and a few drunken negroes where the commissary stores had been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1582"/>I saw no Confederate cavalrymen or stragglers, and no fires, and cannot believe that I could have failed to see them, if they had existed, for <num value="1">one</num>'s eyesight becomes almost preternaturally sharpened under such circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1585"/>For any <num value="1">one</num> with a spark of manhood in his composition to leave under such circumstances was a hard trial, but to those thus compulsorily deserting their families it was painful in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1587"/>By night, from a reaction of feeling, the men were quite bright and jolly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1588"/>Chatting and smoking over the camp fires we all came to the conclusion that the devil was not so black as he was painted after all. My mess discussed the <name>Madeira</name> which I had brought with great satisfaction, the wine shaken into such a muddy condition, as to be unrecognizable, and drunk from tin cups.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1590"/>Soon the men were all peacefully sleeping on that soil for whose freedom they were struggling, all dangers and anxieties for the time forgotten, but they were booted and dressed ready to mount at a moment's notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1591"/>A chilly wintry night was succeeded by a gloomy leaden gray dawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1592"/>As the cavalrymen aroused themselves a strange sight met their half-blinded eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1593"/>Great clouds of heavy black smoke were drifting through the camp, and their horses in alarm were straining uneasily at their halters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1773"/>The whole of this ground was swept by the enemy's artillery and musketry from their main line, not to speak of the fire from those within our works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1774"/>No troops could stand a moment exposed to such a fire, and such as did not fall were immediately withdrawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1781"/>The slaughter was terrific, and probably more men were killed in the retreat than in the advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1782"/>The victory was virtually won, but those of the enemy within the crater continued for sometime the desperate contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1783"/>In my opinion they remained in the crater more from fear of running the gauntlet to their own lines than from any hope of holding their position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2444"/>Sir,--In obedience to orders No.--, received to-day, I herewith submit to <persName n="Benning,Brigadier-General,H.,L.,," id="n0123.0029.00179.02357" reg="default:Benning,H.,L.,,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Benning</surname></persName> a report of the part taken by my regiment (the <orgName type="regiment" key="GA15">Fifteenth Georgia</orgName>) in the <rs n="Battle of Gettysburg" type="battle">battle of Gettysburg</rs> on the <dateStruct value="1863-07-02"><day reg="2">2d</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1863-07-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2445"/>My regiment occupied that portion of the ground on the extreme left of the brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2446"/>On the <dateStruct value="-07-2"><day reg="2">2d</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, after moving for a considerable distance across an open field under a heavy shelling from the enemy's batteries, <orgName type="company" n="Battery I">I</orgName> reached my position from which I was to move in line of battle to assist in supporting <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Laws,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n0123.0029.00179.02358" reg="mostcommon:Laws,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Laws</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, which I learned had moved forward to attack the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2447"/>After marching forward <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="500yards" type="distance">five hundred yards</measure>, I, with the rest of the brigade, was halted and rested until an order came to me from <persName n="Benning,General,,,," id="n0123.0029.00179.02359" reg="nearbymention:Benning,H.,L.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Benning</surname></persName> to move forward at once to the support of our advanced troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2448"/>This movement was made at once, in good order, under fire of the enemy's artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2449"/>After getting within a <measure n="150yards" type="distance">hundred and fifty yards</measure> of the advanced troops, I was again halted by <persName n="Benning,General,,,," id="n0123.0029.00179.02360" reg="nearbymention:Benning,H.,L.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Benning</surname></persName> for a few moments, my regiment having gotten a short distance ahead of another portion of our brigade lines, owing, I suppose, to the difference in the nature of the ground, over which we had to march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2450"/><persName n="Benning,General,,,," id="n0123.0029.00179.02361" reg="nearbymention:Benning,H.,L.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Benning</surname></persName> then left the position where he was, then near my right, and went towards the right of the brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2451"/>I rested a few minutes in this position, until I saw the balance of the brigade had moved up even with my position and were still advancing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2452"/>I immediately ordered a forward movement, and soon gained the point where our advance troops were fighting behind a stone fence, a little above the foot of a high, wooded, rocky hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2453"/>At this point my regiment commenced the engagement with the enemy who occupied the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2454"/>At this point the nature of the ground was such that I could not see the other portion of our brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2455"/>After fighting the enemy in this position a short time, I saw from the heavy fire of musketry on my right that the other portion of the brigade were hotly engaged trying to carry the hill in their front, which was destitute of trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2456"/>I immediately ordered my regiment to jump the stone fence and charge that portion of the hill in my front; which order they obeyed willingly and promptly, driving <pb id="p.180" n="180"/>the enemy from my part of the hill, turning that portion of their right flank which occupied the barren hill in front of the troops of our own brigade, on my right, and thereby assisting them in gaining the hill in their front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2457"/>In this charge a portion of <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Texas</rs> regiments joined me (the <orgName type="regiment" key="TX1">First Texas</orgName>) and behaved well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2458"/>After gaining the hill I continued to move forward, driving the enemy before me at a rapid rate, capturing between <num value="140">one hundred and forty</num> and <measure n="200" type="prisoners">two hundred prisoners</measure>, including officers as well as men. I had gone on rapidly from the top of the hill between <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> and <measure n="0.5mile" type="distance">a half mile</measure> ahead of the other portion of our brigade, which I found had halted at the top of that portion of the hill in their front, when I discovered a large body of the enemy moving so as to put themselves between me and the troops on my left and in my rear, and thereby cut me off entirely from support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2459"/>As soon as I saw the danger to which I was exposed I ordered a halt, and also ordered my regiment to fall back.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2460"/>I fell back to the stone fence before referred to, and there very soon arranged my line and fought the enemy in this position until I saw the troops on my left getting ready for another charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2461"/>I at once ordered my regiment to charge, which they did well, driving the enemy from their position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2462"/>The troops on my left then fell back to their original position and the enemy commenced advancing upon my left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2463"/>I took a small party of men, threw them out as skirmishers on the left and drove back the enemy's advance, but very soon a heavy column of the enemy came upon my left flank, drove in the skirmishers, and not being supported on the left in that position, I fell back again to my original position, and continued the fight at this point until I received a message from the commander of the troops on my left, stating that he was going to charge the enemy again, and desired me to do the same on my part of the line, which proposition I agreed to at once, and immediately ordered my regiment forward, and again did they obey my order with alacrity and courage, driving the enemy this time entirely out of the woods in my front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2464"/>I then changed the front of my line so as to fire upon the enemy in the open field at the foot of the mountain on my right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2465"/>In this position my line was almost at a right angle with the line of the brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2466"/>I placed them in this position so as to assist the troops on the left, who had followed the retreating column of enemy, and were then attempting to charge a portion of the mountain height.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2467"/>I ordered my men to pour in a heavy fire upon the enemy as soon as the troops on the left commenced falling back, as I thought they would have to do, and thereby protect their retreat as much as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2468"/>This they did very effectually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2469"/>I remained in this position <pb id="p.181" n="181"/>a considerable length of time, and until late in the evening, when it became so dark that objects in the woods could not be so easily discerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2470"/>I then learned that the enemy were again moving round upon my left in heavy force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2471"/>Upon learning this, I changed my line back about <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> and fronted differently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2472"/>I had not gotten through this movement before I discovered that the enemy were moving forward rapidly and were within <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> of the left of my line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2473"/>I halted, faced about and commenced fighting them, and after a few well directed volleys, succeeded in checking their advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2474"/>They then fell back, and I moved my regiment back to the stone fence in my rear, formed them in a few moments and rested in this position until <persName n="Benning,General,,,," id="n0123.0029.00181.02362" reg="nearbymention:Benning,H.,L.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Benning</surname></persName> ordered me to rest for the night upon the hill in my front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2475"/>It was now after dark; I moved up and occupied the position he had directed me to, and also collected together all the fragments of regiments and companies from other commands, and formed them upon the same line with my own regiment, and stationed pickets in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2476"/>In this position I remained until just before daylight on the morning of the <dateStruct value="-07-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, when I was ordered by <persName n="Benning,General,,,," id="n0123.0029.00181.02363" reg="nearbymention:Benning,H.,L.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Benning</surname></persName> to move my regiment back to the stone wall, from which he had ordered me the night before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2477"/>I remained in position behind this wall until late in the evening of the <dateStruct value="-07-3"><day reg="3">third</day> day of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, keeping a body of skirmishers in my front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2478"/>In the latter part of the evening the enemy pressed so heavily upon my skirmishers that I was compelled to reinforce them with <num value="2">two</num> additional companies, and very soon thereafter a heavy skirmish commenced.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2479"/>The enemy had commenced moving around upon my left in heavy force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2480"/>The troops upon my left having been withdrawn, I notified <persName n="Benning,General,,,," id="n0123.0029.00181.02364" reg="nearbymention:Benning,H.,L.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Benning</surname></persName> of the movement being made by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2481"/>He immediately came down to my position and there received orders through a courier to move the left of his brigade so as to unite with the right of <orgName n="Division"><persName n="McLaws,General,,,," id="n0123.0029.00181.02365" reg="mostcommon:McLaws,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McLaws</surname></persName>'s Division</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2482"/><persName n="Benning,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n0123.0029.00181.02366" reg="nearbymention:Benning,H.,L.,,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Benning</surname></persName> ordered me to move to the position pointed out by the courier, which order I obeyed at once, calling in most of my skirmishers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2483"/>The new position to which I had been ordered and occupied left a space of fully <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile between my right and the then left of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Benning,General,,,," id="n0123.0029.00181.02367" reg="nearbymention:Benning,H.,L.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Benning</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2484"/>This space was entirely unoccupied except by a few skir-mishers from my regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2485"/>I had not gained my new position but a short time before a brisk skirmish commenced between the enemy and my <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2486"/>At this time I received an order from <persName n="Benning,General,,,," id="n0123.0029.00181.02368" reg="nearbymention:Benning,H.,L.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Benning</surname></persName> by <num value="1">one</num> of his couriers to hold the hill I was on and that <persName n="McLaws,General,,,," id="n0123.0029.00181.02369" reg="mostcommon:McLaws,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McLaws</surname></persName> would support me on the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2487"/>By the courier who brought me <pb id="p.182" n="182"/>this order I notified <persName n="Benning,General,,,," id="n0123.0029.00182.02370" reg="nearbymention:Benning,H.,L.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Benning</surname></persName> that I could see nothing of <persName n="McLaws,General,,,," id="n0123.0029.00182.02371" reg="mostcommon:McLaws,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McLaws</surname></persName>, but instead of finding his troops upon my left, that the enemy were moving around upon my left in heavy force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2488"/>After this time I received no further orders or notice of the movement of our troops from any <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2489"/>The enemy came on rapidly in heavy force, turning my left entirely, and also advancing in front, and moving upon my right, in the space between my right and the left of the position where I had left the balance of our brigade.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2490"/>After fighting in this position until I saw the enemy had greatly the advantage of me by his flank movement, I drew my line of battle back about <num value="70">seventy</num> or <measure n="80yards" type="distance">eighty yards</measure>, changing at the same time my front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2491"/>At this position I secured my men as best I could behind rock and trees, seeing that I was compelled to fight greatly superior numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2492"/>In this position I had a desperate fight, the enemy moving up on my right and left flanks and front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2493"/>I fought them until they had gotten within <num value="20">twenty</num> to <measure n="40yards" type="distance">forty yards</measure> of my men. Seeing no reinforcements coming to my relief, and finding that in a few moments more my whole regiment would be either killed or captured, I ordered a retreat through the only space left open to me by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2494"/>After falling back <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards</measure>, I rallied my regiment behind a stone fence, and there checked the advance of the enemy; but after fighting in this position for a time, the enemy made the same movement upon this position that he had done upon the <num value="1">one</num> I had last left, by throwing a force around my left flank, and moving up on my right flank, by this means hoping to surround me, and entirely cut off all means of retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2495"/>As soon as I saw that the position of the enemy rendered my position untenable, I again ordered my men to retire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2496"/>After retreating some <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards</measure> further back I again rallied the remnant of my regiment, and fought them until driven from my position by <num value="1">one</num> of the enemy's batteries, which completely enfiladed my position, throwing shells among my men who were lying behind the stone fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2497"/>I again ordered a retreat and fell back to where the balance of the brigade had been ordered after I left it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2498"/>During each of the <num value="4">four</num> separate fights I made that evening I looked for and expected support either upon my right or left, which did not come, nor did I retire from either position until I had ascertained that there was no support to be had. My men and officers fought bravely, but my loss was immense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2499"/>How any of us escaped, I do not see. In the battle of the <dateStruct value="-07-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> I went in with <num value="330">330</num> or <num value="335">335</num> muskets, and lost <num value="70">seventy</num> men killed, wounded and missing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2500"/>In the battle of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> I lost <num value="101">one hundred and one</num>, making a total loss of <num value="171">one hundred and seventy-one</num> men in the <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2501"/><pb id="p.183" n="183"/></p> 
<p>During the battle of the <dateStruct value="-07-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> I was greatly assisted by <persName n="Hearnsburger,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0029.00183.02372" reg="mostcommon:Hearnsburger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>Hearnsburger</surname></persName> and my <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant-Lieutenant">Adjutant-Lieutenant</rs>, <persName n="Pierce,,L.,,," id="n0123.0029.00183.02373" reg="default:Pierce,L.,,,"><foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Pierce</surname></persName>, both of whom behaved with coolness and courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2502"/>I am also indebted to all of my officers who were present, for the assistance rendered by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2503"/>My men behaved well and worthy of their former reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2504"/>All of which is respectfully submitted.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3123"/><hi rend="italics">Ladies and Gentlemen</hi>,--It would be more than superfluous to address to a New Orleans audience any argument in favor of the preservation of the history of our Confederate struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3124"/>Your course is too well known, marked by too many deeds both in war and in peace, to render it at all doubtful that your hearts beat time to the cause for which so many of your bravest and best have died.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3125"/>The early colony of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> consisted of men who were refugees from conquest, and who, guided by patriotism and sustained by valor, plunged into the wilderness to make for themselves a new home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3126"/>Their descendants have shown from that day to this the same characteristics which marked their fathers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3127"/>I believe it has been generally conceded, and I think most truly, that never was a people more universally gallant than the <name>Creoles</name> of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3129"/>At the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> call of the late war your citizens rushed forth to the defense of their country, and you gave of your sons the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> who reduced the fort that threatened to blockade a Southern harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3132"/>[Applause.]</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3133"/>It would consume the whole evening were I to attempt to enumerate the list.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3134"/>You have seen standing before you here to introduce me <num value="1">one</num> who went forth to the battle in the vigor of manhood, who lost a limb, and waited but for convalescence,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3136"/>[Applause.] What is left of him is more precious to you still, like Sibylline leaves, growing in value as they were reduced in bulk.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3137"/>But when the war was over, then the fair daughters of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> (it is always the women who are <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in good work), originated that plan of decorating the graves of the <rs>Confederate</rs> dead, paying to them annually a tribute of flowers, which, in their beauty and recurring vitality, best express the everlasting love you bear toward the dead.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3138"/>Then here, in New Orleans, was organized the <orgName n="Historical Society" type="society">Historical Society</orgName>, with a view to preserving the records of the <rs>Confederate</rs> war. That Society has been removed, but still looks back to this the place of its birth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3139"/>Here, where more than in any other city, you had been swept by the besom of desolation &mdash; where you had been more terribly pillaged than any other town that had been overrun &mdash; here have arisen more monuments to the <rs>Confederate</rs> heroes than in any other city of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3140"/>Glorious New Orleans!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3141"/>You have the right to be proud of the past, and we have the right to be expectant of you in the future, for there is yet a higher and more immediate duty to perform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3142"/>Monuments may crumble, their inscriptions may be defaced by time, but the records, the little slips of paper which contain the memorial of what is past will live forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3143"/>To collect and preserve these records is, therefore, our highest duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3144"/>They are said to be in danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3145"/>The <orgName n="Southern Historical Society" type="society">Southern Historical Society</orgName> appeals to you now. They appeal to you in the midst of your disaster, when your country has been overwhelmed by a flood, and when there is a want of means to supply the necessities of your people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3146"/>Still the <orgName n="Historical Society" type="society">Historical Society</orgName> comes to <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> as the first place, in which they ask that the <rs>Confederate</rs> records should be perfected and protected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3147"/>I do not doubt that you will respond to the extent of your ability; that you will here inaugurate a movement which, growing and extending from city to city and year to year, will render certain the preservation of those archives, the value of which it is impossible to compute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3148"/>It is a duty we owe to the dead &mdash; the dead who died for us, but whose memories can never die. It is a duty we owe to <pb id="p.227" n="227"/>posterity to see that our children shall know the virtues and rise worthy of their sires; to see that the sons grow up worthy of their noble mothers &mdash; those mothers who never faltered through all the hours of trial through which we passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3149"/>[Applause.]</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3150"/>They who now sleep in the grave cannot be benefitted, it is true, by anything we may do; their cause has gone before a higher tribunal than any earthly judgment-seat, but their children and children's children are to be benefitted by preserving the record of what they did, and, more than all, the moral with which they did it. As for me &mdash; I speak only for myself &mdash; our cause was so just, so sacred, that had I known all that has come to pass, had I known what was to be inflicted upon me, all that my country was to suffer, all that our posterity was to endure, I would do it all over again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3151"/>[Great applause.]</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3152"/>It is to me most desirable that the conduct of our men in defense of that cause should be so presented to the world as to leave no stain upon it. They went through trials which might have corrupted weaker men, and yet thoughout the war I never went into an army without finding their camp engaged in prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3153"/>After the war was over, see how many of these men who bore muskets in the ranks became ministers of the <name>Gospel</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3154"/>It is your good foutune to have <num value="1">one</num> presiding over your diocese now, and who is the successor of <num value="1">one</num> who drew his last breath on the field of battle, the glorious holy <persName n="Polk,Bishop,,,," id="n0123.0039.00227.03112" reg="nearbymention:Polk,W.,N.,,"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName>!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3155"/>It is not necessary that we should have recorded what is conceded by all the world, that our men were brave, that they had a power of endurance and self-denial which was remarkable, but if you would have your children rise to the high plane you desire them to occupy, you must add the evidence of their father's chivalry and forbearance from that staining crime of the soldier, plunder, under all the circumstances of the war. True that we did not invade to any great extent, though we did to some.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3156"/>It is a fact which I am happy to remember that when our army invaded the enemy's country, their property was safe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3157"/>I draw no comparisons, as I am speaking now of our people and of our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3158"/>If somebody else did not behave as well, let it rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3159"/>[Laughter.]</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3160"/>We had no army at the opening of the war; our defenders were not professional soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3161"/>They were men who left their wives, children and peaceful occupations, and, at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> call of their country, seized such arms as they could gather, and rallied around their flag like a wall of fire to defend the rights their fathers left them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3162"/>Could there be cause more sacred than this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3163"/>If there be anything that justifies human war, it is defense of country, of family, of constitutional rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3164"/>[Applause.] <pb id="p.228" n="228"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3165"/>If I be asked, as is possible, why do you wish to perpetuate these bitter memories?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3166"/>I say, in no spirit of vengeance, with no desire for vainglory, with no wish for sectional exaltation, but that the posterity of men such as I have described, may rise equal to their parents, higher if possible, and that the <rs>South</rs> may exhibit for all time to come the noble qualities which her sons have heretofore manifested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3167"/>[Applause.]</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3168"/>Examples to posterity of the cardinal virtues of mankind they lived for humanity, and it is only by preserving your records, by gathering those incidents which are apt to be forgotten, that you can hope to convey to future generations an exact idea of the men who served through our struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3169"/>It is not enough to say that some General won a battle; that don't teach you his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3170"/>It is not enough to say where some army displayed great valor, stormed a work or defended <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3171"/>Show the character of the men, how they behaved in the field and in the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3172"/>For this you should collect and collate such evidence as our worthy riend, <persName n="Nicholls,General,,,," id="n0123.0039.00228.03113" reg="nearbymention:Nicholls,Francis,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Nicholls</surname></persName>, has said it was the object of this Society to gather.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3173"/>The highest quality of man is self-sacrifice.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3174"/>The man who gives his life for another, who surrenders all his earthly prospects that his fellow men may be benefitted, has most followed that grand exemplar who was given as a model for weak humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3175"/>That we had many men in the <rs>Confederate</rs> service who forgot self in the defence of right, it is the purpose of this Society, by collecting the evidence, to show to the world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3176"/>I constantly find myself impelled to drift into comparative narration, which I wish to avoid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3177"/>Let it suffice to say that I would have our children's children to know not only that our cause was just, (that may be historically established), but to have them know that the men who sustained it were worthy of the cause for which they fought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3178"/>These are the great objects for which your co-operation is invoked.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3179"/>The other side has written, and is writing, their statement of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3180"/>We wish to present ours also, that the future historian by considering both may deduce the unbiased statement, which no contemporary could make.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3181"/>I will frankly acknowledge that I would distrust the man who served the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause and was capable of giving a disinterested account of it. [Applause.] If he bad any heart it must be on his own side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3182"/>I would not give twopence for a man whose heart was so cold that he could be quite impartial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3183"/>You remember the fable of the lion who, seeing a statue which represented a lion prostrate, and a man victorious, bending over him, said that if a lion had made the statue, <pb id="p.229" n="229"/>the figures would have been reversed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3184"/>We want our side of the war so fully and exactly stated, that the men who come after us may compare and do justice in the case.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3185"/>You all know how utterly unprepared we were when we engaged in the war, without money, without an army, without credit, without arms or ammunition, or factories to make them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3186"/>We went into the struggle relying solely on brave hearts, strong arms, and, unfortunately many relying on deciding the issue by argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3187"/>When they found they were mistaken &mdash; that it was the dread ordeal of battle by which the question was to be settled &mdash; they shrank not from it, and I do contend their valor was equaled only by the moral of their conduct throughout the struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3188"/>The unanimity of our people and the heroism of our soldiers has caused us to be the admiration of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3189"/>They know the disadvantages under which we fought; they know the great achievements which we did. But there is much that is not known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3190"/>You may ask the school-boy in the lowest form, who commanded at the <rs type="place">Pass of Thermopylae</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3191"/>He can tell you. But my friends there are few in this audience who, if I asked them, could tell me who commanded at <placeName reg="Sabine Pass, Jefferson, Texas" key="tgn,2107319">Sabine Pass</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3192"/>And yet, that <rs n="Battle of Sabine Pass" type="battle">battle of Sabine Pass</rs> was more remarkable than the battle of <placeName reg="Thermopylae, Hampshire, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2716872">Thermopylae</placeName>, and when it has orators and poets to celebrate it, will be so esteemed by mankind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3193"/>The disparity of numbers was greater, the inequality of arms was greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3194"/>When an iron-clad fleet came to pass the <rs>Sabine</rs> so as to invade the interior of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, an <persName n="Lieutenant,,Irish,,," id="n0123.0039.00229.03114" reg="default:Lieutenant,Irish,,,"><foreName>Irish</foreName> <surname>Lieutenant</surname></persName>, with <num value="42">forty-two</num> men behind a little mud fort, having only field guns for its armament, held them in check.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3195"/>When he asked for instructions he was told he had better retire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3196"/>But this gallant man said: <quote>We will never retire <num value="1">1</num></quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3197"/>[The speaker went on to relate how the <rs>Irish Lieutenant</rs>, <persName n="Dowling,,,,," id="n0123.0039.00229.03115" reg="mostcommon:Dowling,nomatch:0"><surname>Dowling</surname></persName>, had <measure n="2" type="captured">captured two</measure> of the war vessels on <dateStruct value="1863-09-09"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="9">9</day>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, and taken a great number of prisoners.]</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3198"/>It is our duty to keep the memory of our heroes green.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3199"/>Yet they belong not to us alone; they belong to the whole country; they belong to <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3201"/>Nor were their services rendered in our war those only which claim grateful remembrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3202"/>There was pious <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0123.0039.00229.03117" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, the man, who, when he was waiting for the troops to move up would, under a storm of bullets, be lost in ejaculatory prayer: the man who, when he bent over a wounded comrade, would feel a woman's weakness creep into his eyes: the man who came like a thunderbolt when his friends most needed him, and his enemies least expected his coming, was the same who had marched into the valley of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> to sustain the flag of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3203"/>That man <pb id="p.230" n="230"/>who had been the terror of the enemy in the hour of battle but was as peaceful as a lamb after the conflict, when he found he was on a bed of death, calmly folded his arms, resigning his soul to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and saying: <quote>Let us cross over the river and rest under the shade of the trees.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3204"/>We do not claim to appropriate all his glory, but we hold dear every part of him that nobody else wants.</p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3206"/>We do not wish to wholly appropriate the glory of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0123.0039.00230.03120" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> but will willingly share it with those who have an equal right to it, and we would rather they should claim some share of the grand conduct of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0123.0039.00230.03121" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> at <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>, <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, the <rs>Wilderness</rs>, and everywhere that soldiers met soldiers against mighty odds.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3208"/>Never was man more true to his duty, more devoted to his cause, or more sincere in his purposes, as was shown in the hour of his death, when, on the field of <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName>, having driven the enemy from every position before him save <num value="1">one</num>, which he saw must be carried to make the victory complete, he led a column to storm it, receiving a death wound from which the life-blood was pouring, he recked not of himself, but thinking, feeling only of his country and its cause, rode on until he fell lifeless from his horse.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3215"/>They may arise, and that result will certainly be promoted by the course which has been advocated here to-night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3216"/>Let the rising generation learn what their fathers did, and let them learn the still better lesson to emulate not only the deeds, but the motives which prompted them.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3219"/>Though the gallantry and capacity of the <rs>Confederate</rs> troops was so often and so brilliantly exhibited as to be undeniable and undenied, yet we have been inconsistently charged with cruelty to prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3220"/>I say inconsistently, because brave men are never cruel to those who are helpless and in their power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3221"/>The fact is, we used our best efforts to alleviate the sufferings of the prisoners held by us. That they languished and died in prison was their misfortune and ours also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3222"/>There were physical and climatic causes which we could not alter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3223"/>We were wanting in supplies of the proper medicines and the kind of food to which the prisoners were accustomed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3224"/>As the number of prisoners accumulated beyond what could have been anticipated, there was not a sufficient shelter for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3225"/>Disease was the consequence, and the medicine required could not be obtained because the enemy had made it contraband.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3226"/>It is a burning shame that the slander was ever circulated which imputed to us cruelty to those who were in our power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3227"/>Enough has been collected and published on this subject to convince any fair, disinterested mind, but let us not stop until the facts have been so established that not even malignity and slanderous falsehood can fail to be silenced and abashed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3228"/>Let the testimony of reliable persons who were in our prisons be taken, especially the evidence of those who came to me as a delegation from the prisoners at <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.102 000000.2045	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.102 000000.2045	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName>, and whom I sent on parole to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to plead for the execution of the cartel for the exchange of prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3229"/>In due time they came back to report that they could not get an audience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3230"/>Their conduct in observing their parole proved their honorable character, and must entitle them to credence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3231"/>Let these and all other pertinent facts be added to the testimony already of record, so that the odious accusations about <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.121 000000.2424	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.121 000000.2424	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName> shall not be thrown in the faces of our children and our children's children.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3232"/>Time's mellowing influence has been felt on both sides of the <rs>Susquehanna</rs>, and our people sincerely appreciate the kindness shown to them in time of pestilence, and more recently in time of flood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3233"/>It is the <pb id="p.232" n="232"/>characteristic of the brave and generous always gratefully to acknowledge any kindness they receive.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3234"/>I trust that these mellowing influences may grow stronger and that at no distant day those offensive epithets which, in view of our history, it was an abuse of the <rs>English</rs> language to employ, may cease to be part of the <rs>Northern</rs> vocabulary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3235"/>Those who must live together should cultivate cointelligence and mutual respect, in order to which not <num value="1">one</num> side only but both must be heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3236"/>The Southern people are not revengeful, the fact is they are not capable of lasting hate which is the child of fear, therefore brave men do not hate like cowards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3238"/>Here, where the <orgName n="Historical Society" type="society">Historical Society</orgName> began, in an hour of utter desolation, it is here also in another period of disaster that I find you assembled to determine what can be done to preserve this Society and increase its usefulness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3239"/>If you succeed in giving impulse to such an organization as will preserve this Society, you will add another feather to the wing which I trust will bear you to prosperity and happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3240"/>You will have another claim to the admiration of those who honor virtue, and who feel gratitude for your generosity, and to us Confederates you will be, if possible, doubly dear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3241"/>Here in the neighborhood of the <rs>Southern</rs> cross, that emblem in the skies of our sign upon earth, that likeness of the battle flag which our men so often followed, here where the <name>Society</name> began, it is meet that the <name>Society</name> should be preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3242"/>In any event you are entitled to much credit, and now I bear a free testimony in your favor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3243"/>My friends, it is somewhat difficult for a Confederate whose heart-love lies buried in the grave of our cause, to speak to you on a subject which revives the memories of that period, and to speak with that forbearance which the occasion requires.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3244"/>I have tried to do so, and all I can say is that, if I have exceeded the proper limit, you don't know how hard I have tried to keep within it. [Applause.]</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3245"/>Now, my friends, ladies and gentlemen, let me assure you that the same affectionate regard, the same hope for you, the same belief in your prosperity, the same high expectations of New Orleans, which I have so often declared, will follow me in the few remaining days I may yet live among you.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3457"/>This pithy sentence of the great <name>German</name> poet may in its spirit be applied to the special history of every single nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3458"/>Whatever the deeds and experiences of peoples and States--whatever the destinies and events occurring in the bosom of the human family, history transmits them in its records to posterity to render an impartial verdict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3459"/>Happily, in the progress of human knowledge, history need no longer be construed from mute monuments which have been preserved from the ravages of time, but the modern historian is enabled to render a truthful account of any important event or period by examining and collating the written documents which throw light on the course of events he desires to illustrate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3460"/>True history is the result of patient research, unbiased judgment, a comprehensive, intelligent review of cause and effect, of all attainable facts and data that mark the course of events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3461"/>It must be free from hasty conclusions of the moment, contracted judgments of selfishness <pb id="p.249" n="249"/>and preconceived opinions.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3475"/>It will be remembered that the tribes of <persName><foreName>Reuben</foreName></persName>, <placeName reg="Gad">Gad</placeName>, and the half tribe of <placeName reg="Manasseh">Manasseh</placeName>, had received their inheritance beyond the <rs>Jordan</rs> on the express condition of sending their warriors to assist their brethren in the conquest of the promised land.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3477"/>But no sooner had they reached the borders of the <rs>Jordan</rs> than they erected a great altar, visible from afar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3479"/>They suspected that the <num value="2">two</num> tribes and <num value="0.5">a half</num> meant treason, intending to set up an independent establishment for worship, and to destroy the connection by which the tribes were linked <pb id="p.250" n="250"/>together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3480"/>But in order not to act hastily, or without proper inquiry in a matter of such deep importance, they sent a delegation to investigate the subject.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3481"/>The delegates proceeded on their mission, and stated the grounds of complaint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3482"/>But the <num value="2">two</num>-and-a-half tribes protested in the most solemn terms that their object was, in all respects, the very reverse of that imputed to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3483"/>Instead of meaning a separation, they had set up their altar as a monument to future ages of the connection between tribes separated by the river, so that if, at any time to come, their descendants should attempt to cast off the connection and assert their independence, or if the <name>Israelites</name> should hereafter attempt to disown their union, and declare that the people beyond the river had <quote>no part in the <rs>Lord</rs>,</quote> this monument might be pointed to in evidence of the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3484"/>Hearing this explanation, the delegates expressed their approval and returned.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3485"/>The application of this episode is easily made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3494"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is that the history of every historic people should be fully written, and nothing must be withheld which contributes to that end. The scholarly youth, when he encounters in his academic course the study of history, is appalled by its magnitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3495"/>With the map of the world spread before him, he asks, in dismay, is a lifetime sufficient to compass the history of all these lands and of the peoples who have lived and wrought upon them for <measure n="6000years" type="date">6,000 years</measure>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3502"/>These earlier chronicles are the original sources from which a more elaborate and philosophic record may be constructed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3503"/>For example, I was interested the other day in the argument used by <placeName reg="La Salle, La Salle, Illinois" key="tgn,2028715">La Salle</placeName> with the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, when he suggested to him the plan of connecting the <rs>St. Lawrence</rs> with the <rs>Mississippi</rs> by a chain of forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3507"/>In the second place there are great principles underlying the struggle through which we have recently passed, which need to be expounded as held by both the combatants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3508"/>It is a mistake to suppose that war is always the mere outburst of human passion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3509"/>On the contrary the great wars of earth &mdash; those which have been projected upon the largest scale and protracted through the longest period, and especially occurring between members of the same race, have been the result of an antecedent conflict of opinions which seeking reconciliation in vain, appealed finally to the sword to settle the question of ascendency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3510"/>Why! The <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> war between <placeName reg="Sparta, White, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101606">Sparta</placeName> and <persName n="Attica,,,,," id="n0123.0046.00252.03445" reg="mostcommon:Attica,nomatch:0"><surname>Attica</surname></persName> was but the culmination of the struggle between the <name>Doric</name> and Ionic elements of the <rs>Grecian</rs> stock which emerged at the earliest dawn of authentic history; <num value="2">two</num> nations struggled together like <persName><foreName>Jacob</foreName></persName> and <persName><foreName>Esau</foreName></persName>, even in the womb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3511"/>So ancient was the feud that even the armed invasion of <placeName key="tgn,7000231" n="1.000 27" reg="iran">Persia</placeName> scarcely composed it for a time, only to break forth in the war of the <name>Peloponnesus</name>, so fatal in its issue to the independence of both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3512"/>From the outset these <num value="2">two</num> were the exponents of <num value="2">two</num> opposing systems of government and social discipline, Lacedaimon espousing a policy which may be defined as continental and oligarchic, while <placeName reg="Athens, McMinn, Tennessee" key="tgn,2097784">Athens</placeName> represented the idea of commerce and democracy &mdash; <placeName reg="Sparta, White, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101606">Sparta</placeName> seeking to consolidate the continental States under the supremacy of the few &mdash; <placeName reg="Athens, McMinn, Tennessee" key="tgn,2097784">Athens</placeName> to weld the maritime States into a confederacy of which she should be the centre and the head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3513"/>Or, take as a more modern example, the long struggle of <dateStruct value="1648--"><year reg="1648">1648</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></dateStruct> in <name>English</name> history, which was simply a contest between prerogative on the part of the <name>Crown</name> and privilege on the part of the people, the final issue of which was the establishment of the present <name>English</name> government, the freest and happiest empire on the globe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3514"/>And can it be denied that great and fundamental principles lay at the heart of the civil war in which the <num value="2">two</num> sections of this country were lately engaged?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3515"/>I am not here to discuss these principles upon the <num value="1">one</num> side or the other, but it is due to historic truth that both should be set forth by the advocates who were willing to submit them to the gauge of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3516"/>I would have the <rs>Southern</rs> expounder and the <rs>Northern</rs> expounder stand face to face, as did <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0123.0046.00252.03446" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Charles,C.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> and <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0123.0046.00252.03447" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:3"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName>, and argue the case before the nations of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3517"/>For this cause let the documents be preserved upon which the argument is to be founded, and the verdict is to be rendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3518"/>I assign as <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> reason for the perpetuation of this Society, my conviction that the result of <pb id="p.253" n="253"/>the conflict between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> will be the preservation of the principles and institutions of our fathers, in all the grand future which I hope is before us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3519"/><rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, we hear on every hand about the <rs>Lost Cause</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3520"/>Was there ever a cause lost which was supported by truth?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3521"/>And can a cause be lost which has passed through such a baptism as ours?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3522"/>Principles never die, and if they seem to perish it is only to experience a resurrection in the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3523"/>I have lived long enough, though my observation lies chiefly in the ecclesiastical sphere, to see small minorities leaven with their principles the very majorities by which they were overwhelmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3524"/>And you have read in history that nations have morally subdued the very powers by whom they have been crushed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3525"/><placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> conquered <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName>, but <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> in her fall infused her philosophy and her culture into the very foe by whom she was destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3526"/><placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, in her turn, civilized the very savages by whom she was overrun, so that out of the very chaos of the obliterated <name>Roman</name> empire emerged the present congress of European States.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3527"/>Sir, there is a tribunal before which even nations must appear &mdash; a tribunal before which old causes shall be retired and the final verdict be rendered which can never again be reversed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3528"/>There must come a time when the passions which have shaken the earth to its centre must subside; when the mists of error and mistake roll up and drift away after hanging their curtains long around the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3529"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> in his adorable <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> raises up the advocates who speak, men of a judicial build, who force these solemn historic retractions in which eternal justice throws down its shadow upon the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3530"/>Look, for example, at <persName n="Motley,,,,," id="n0123.0046.00253.03448" reg="mostcommon:Motley,nomatch:0"><surname>Motley</surname></persName> drawing from the archives of the <name>Escurial</name> itself the damning evidence that had slept for <measure n="300years" type="date">three hundred years</measure>, upon which the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <persName><foreName>Philip</foreName></persName> is convicted as the blackest felon that ever disgraced the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3531"/>Look, again, at <placeName reg="Carlyle, Clinton, Illinois" key="tgn,2026869">Carlyle</placeName> planting his burly form against the billows and rolling back the tide of prejudice which had swelled against <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0123.0046.00253.03449" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName> for <measure n="200years" type="date">two hundred years</measure>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3535"/>It is a little over <measure n="100years" type="date">one hundred years</measure> since our independence of the <rs>British</rs> throne, and less than <num value="100">one hundred</num> since the adoption of the <rs>Constitution</rs> under which we live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3536"/>I speak, no doubt, the sentiment of every person in this large audience when I express the wish, I may even add the faith, that these <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> may remain united when its government shall cover the continent from ocean to ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4374"/>Until the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities appeal to be relieved <quote>from the obligation to treat prisoners of war according to the laws of civilized warfare,</quote> or offer as <quote>an explanation or excuse</quote> for insufficient food that supplies have not been forwarded by your government, it is entirely unnecessary to discuss what will be the views of your authorities in either contingency.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4375"/>Statements most infamously false have recently been made and circulated at the <rs>North</rs> by persons whose calling should have imposed a respect for truth, which their own personal honor seems to have failed to secure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4376"/>Our regulations require that prisoners shall receive the same rations as soldiers in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4377"/>Such your prisoners have received, and will continue to receive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4380"/>We recognize in the fullest form our obligation to treat your prisoners with humanity, and to serve them with the same food, in quantity and quality, as is given to our own soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4381"/>If the supply is scanty, you have only to blame the system of warfare you have waged against us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4382"/>In the first place, we have importuned you to agree to a fair and honest proposition which would secure the release of all of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4387"/>No degree of haste would have secured the assent of the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities to a proposition so flagrantly unequal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4388"/>We are ready to relieve your Government from the burthen of supplying <quote>food and clothing as heretofore</quote> to our people in your hands, and if they are sent to us, yours shall be returned to you, the excess on <num value="1">one</num> side or the other to be on parole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4412"/>It was perhaps too just and humane to be formally declined, and therefore resort was had to silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4417"/>Sir,--As it appears to be more than probable that a large number of prisoners will be held in captivity by both belligerents during the coming winter, the cause of humanity to which, though foes, we all owe a common allegiance, demands that some measure should be adopted for the relief of such as are held by either party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4418"/>To that end I propose that each government shall have the privilege of forwarding for the use and comfort of such of its prisoners as are held by the other necessary articles of food and clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4419"/>The manner of their distribution, with all proper safeguards, can be agreed upon in the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4420"/>A fair reciprocity is only asked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4421"/>The articles that can be mutually sent can also be made the subject of agreement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4422"/>I propose that each may send necessary clothing, and blankets, and rations of meat, bread, coffee, sugar, tobacco, pickles and vinegar.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4423"/>I would suggest that the receipt of the stores, and their distribution amongst the prisoners for whom they are intended, might be authenticated by the certificate of the <rs type="role" reg="senior-Officer">senior officer</rs> at the respective camps or depots.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4424"/>In order to carry out this arrangement with effectiveness, it would be necessary that we should make purchases outside the limits of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and then ship them to <num value="1">one</num> of your ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4425"/>It would be impracticable to send the stores by your flag of truce boats.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4738"/>Your very kind note of the <num value="13" type="ordinal">13th</num> only reached me this morning, but we are none the less grateful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4739"/>The unexpected blow which has fallen upon us is almost stunning, but it shall not impair my efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4740"/><measure n="2hours" type="date">Two hours</measure> before hearing of the certain fall of the fort I felt as confident as ever man did of successfully defending it. The responsibility is all mine, of course, and I shall bear it as resolutely as possible, but time will make known some matters which may as well be told you now in confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4741"/>No human power could have prevented the enemy from landing, covered as he was by a fleet of ships carrying <num value="600">six hundred</num> heavy guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4742"/>Anywhere beyond the range of our heavy guns on the fort our land force could not approach him. Once landed, our only chance was to keep him, if possible, from the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4743"/>With less than half his numbers, had we extended far enough towards the fort to prevent his movement that way, he could have crossed the narrow peninsula north of us and cut us off entirely, when the fort and all must have gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4744"/>The land is heavily timbered and very swampy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4745"/>We then confronted him as closely as possible to watch his movements and endeavor to strike if he moved from under his shipping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4746"/>A dense swamp lay between us and extended <placeName><distance reg="3miles">three miles</distance> towards <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4747"/>In this position I found the <num value="2">two</num> forces when I reached <persName n="Hoke,General,,,," id="n0123.0064.00346.04643" reg="mostcommon:Hoke,Robert,F.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hoke</surname></persName>, and took the command just at night on <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4748"/>Cavalry was on our extended right towards <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>, and occupying ground entirely to the sea, placing us between the enemy and the fort for observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4749"/>These were to report any movement, and the troops lay upon their <pb id="p.347" n="347"/>arms all night, ready to move to the attack or towards the fort if the enemy did so. My knowledge of the ground was good, as I knew <persName n="Hoke,General,,,," id="n0123.0064.00347.04644" reg="mostcommon:Hoke,Robert,F.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hoke</surname></persName>'s to be, both of us having been over it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4750"/>We stayed in our camp under the heavy shelling of the enemy's fleet for the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4751"/>No report of any movement having been made, we moved out early to reconnoitre, <persName n="Hoke,,,,," id="n0123.0064.00347.04645" reg="mostcommon:Hoke,Robert,F.,,:2"><surname>Hoke</surname></persName> towards the fort and I to our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4752"/>I found the enemy in strong force in front of our left, as well as could be seen across the swamp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4754"/>Not a word had been heard from our cavalry, and they had evidently withdrawn from their position in the night and did not themselves know what had occurred, for they fired on <persName n="Hoke,,,,," id="n0123.0064.00347.04647" reg="mostcommon:Hoke,Robert,F.,,:2"><surname>Hoke</surname></persName> and his staff, who got in front of them in reconnoitring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4755"/>On learning this I put the command in motion and ordered the enemy dislodged, if it was at at all practicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4757"/>I moved forward with them and made a close examination, confirmed their opinion, and after a conference decided not to attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4758"/>An attack and failure would have ensured the fall of the fort and would also have opened the whole State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4759"/>We could not have succeeded without defeating double our numbers behind entrenchments, whilst at the same time exposed to a raking fire from their fleet, plainly in sight and within good range, the sea as smooth as glass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4760"/>But I did not feel the slightest apprehension for the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4761"/>The enemy had landed without artillery and not even a general officer brought a horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4762"/>Prisoners captured and deserters coming in concurred in <num value="1">one</num> report, that if repulsed once they would immediately retreat (re-embark) the work being considered too strong for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4763"/>Believing my-self that <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0123.0064.00347.04649" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:3"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> could not storm and carry the fort, if it was defended, I felt perfect confidence that the enemy had assumed a most precarious position, from which he would escape with great difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4764"/>I accordingly ordered <persName n="Hoke,,,,," id="n0123.0064.00347.04650" reg="mostcommon:Hoke,Robert,F.,,:2"><surname>Hoke</surname></persName> to entrench immediately in his front, and push his lines close on him, so as to keep him engaged and closely observed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4765"/>Whilst this was going on I started <num value="1000">one thousand</num> of our best men, who had defended forts at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 4" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>, to reinforce <persName n="Fisher,,,,," id="n0123.0064.00347.04651" reg="mostcommon:Fisher,nomatch:0"><surname>Fisher</surname></persName>, and, as I considered the garrison there already as sufficient, being <num value="2000">2,000</num> strong, I ordered about <num value="600">600</num> less reliable troops to come out, considering it an unnecessary exposure of life to keep them there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4766"/>This order, however, was rescinded on <persName n="Whiting,,,,," id="n0123.0064.00347.04652" reg="nearbymention:Whiting,W.,H.,C.,"><surname>Whiting</surname></persName>'s appeal, and he was allowed to keep the <pb id="p.348" n="348"/>whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4767"/>With this garrison I considered the <hi rend="italics">fort perfectly safe</hi>, and capable of standing any length of siege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4770"/>Such was the configuration of the country and the obstacles that he would have accomplished his object with the force he had. Our only safe reliance was in his repulse, we being the weak and assailed party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5137"/>The cavalry companies located as before described, commenced to form, forming on a line with the court-house enclosure, on the part of the <rs>Prince William</rs> company, and on the street or turn-pike over which the enemy must pass in charging through town, while the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> company, similarly employed, was forming in the court-house lot, but with the advantage of being protected from an enemy by a high boarded fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5143"/>This is a gross mistake, we had no such force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5144"/>It is true, as the enemy went through the town firing to the right and left, apparently at random, and as if for no other purpose than to excite alarm, he drove before him a small portion of <persName><roleName n="Prince">the Prince</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName></persName> cavalry, <num value="4">four</num> of whom he succeeded on this occasion in capturing, the <rs>Rappahannock Company</rs> having been left behind in the court-house lot to complete its formation at leisure.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5145"/>In the meantime, the alarm having reached <persName n="Marr,Captain,,,," id="n0123.0065.00372.04844" reg="nearbymention:Marr,Fannie,H.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Marr</surname></persName> also, he promptly deployed his company in <placeName key="tgn,2005379" n="1.000 91" reg="stevenson, jackson, alabama">Stevenson</placeName>'s clover field, his right near the road to the <orgName n="Fairfax Station" type="station">Fairfax Station</orgName> and near its quarters, the <orgName n="Methodist Church" type="church">Methodist church</orgName>, and parallel with the street before described, and which divided the clover field from the court-house lot, resting its left on the road leading to the <rs type="place">Stevenson farm</rs> house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5147"/>Here he was, doubtless, handling his men, and was struck by a random shot to the left, fired by the enemy as he passed the court-house, the distance being, as well as I can judge, <num value="300">three hundred</num> steps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5148"/>I have not been able to ascertain that anyone of his men knew of his death &mdash; the clover was very rank and tall, and I am told <pb id="p.373" n="373"/>completely enveloped his person, which may account for it. And, further, from a careful examination of his wound next morning, I became satisfied that the <rs>Captain</rs> was killed, as I have before said, by a random shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5149"/>The wound was immediately over the heart &mdash; had a perfect circular suffusion of blood under the skin, something larger than a silver dollar, but the skin was unbroken, and not a drop of blood was shed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5150"/>Nothing but a round spent ball could have inflicted such a wound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5151"/>Manifestly, it was the shock of the blow, which, suspending the machinery of the heart, had necessarily produced instant death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5152"/>It was reported to me that <persName n="Marr,Captain,,,," id="n0123.0065.00373.04846" reg="nearbymention:Marr,Fannie,H.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Marr</surname></persName>, when found, was upon his face, with his sword firmly gripped in his right hand, not having taken time, it is inferred, in the hurry and excitement of passing events, to belt it round his person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5154"/>This, very naturally, impressed the <orgName n="Cavalry company" type="company">cavalry company</orgName> with the idea they had been fired upon by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5155"/>So that under the mutual mistake, the cavalry being entirely unfit for effectual service, and the <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> of the <name>Rifles</name> demoralized by the unexpected disappearance of its <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, both dispersed, and sought safety in darkness, perhaps as intense as I ever saw.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5156"/>While these events were occurring, of which I knew nothing other than from the noise, I was satisfied that the enemy had passed through town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5157"/>I was delayed briefly in fixing my tape to my <persName n="Maynard,,,,," id="n0123.0065.00373.04849" reg="mostcommon:Maynard,nomatch:0"><surname>Maynard</surname></persName> rifle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5163"/>Without hesitation, they jumped the the fence, and at the corner of the court-house lot on the sidewalk leading from the church to the hotel, I, without the slightest knowledge of tactics, commenced to form them into <num value="2">two</num> files.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5164"/>I had <pb id="p.374" n="374"/>nearly completed my work, when hearing a disturbance at the head of the column, I walked rapidly up the line to hear what was the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5168"/>Of course this ended the trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5169"/>The men might well be excused for doubting <persName n="Ewell,Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0065.00374.04856" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,R.,S.,,:2"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Ewell</surname></persName>, for when he came up, he was bare and bald-headed, in his shirt sleeves and bleeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5170"/>Fearful that the enemy might be on his return through town before we were prepared to intercept him, <persName n="Ewell,Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0065.00374.04857" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,R.,S.,,:2"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Ewell</surname></persName> again hurried to the column to complete its formation, which was soon accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5171"/>We put ourselves at the head, and gave the command <quote>march,</quote> having <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> to go before we could reach the turnpike, running by the hotel and over which the enemy must pass on his return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5172"/>It was during this march that <persName n="Ewell,Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0065.00374.04858" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,R.,S.,,:2"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Ewell</surname></persName> told me how he came to be in his then condition, that he had undertaken to run across the street from the hotel, just ahead of the enemy's column, which he supposed he could do under cover of the darkness, that the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> of the enemy discovering that some <num value="1">one</num> was crossing the street in front of him, had fired upon him, and struck him in the fleshy part of the shoulder, that as he ran, he jerked off his uniform, and pitched it into a lot, his fear being that the enemy might discover he was an officer, and might make a special effort to capture him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5173"/>He then said to me, that as soon as we reached the hotel he would have to leave me to get a courier to send off to <orgName n="Fairfax Station" type="station">Fairfax Station</orgName> for some calvary camped at that place, and added that as I seemed to have a turn for this sort of thing, I must take charge of the boys and manage them to the best advantage until he rejoined me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5174"/>I will here collate the incidents which had occurred up to this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5175"/>I think it was a little before <time value="3am">3 A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5176"/>I am confident that all these incidents occurred within the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> half an hour of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> appearance of the enemy in town; resulting in the slight wounding of <persName n="Ewell,Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0065.00375.04865" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,R.,S.,,:2"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Ewell</surname></persName>, the killing of <persName n="Marr,Captain,,,," id="n0123.0065.00375.04866" reg="nearbymention:Marr,Fannie,H.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Marr</surname></persName>, and the dispersion of the whole Confederate force, except some <num value="40">forty</num> to <num value="45">forty-five</num> of the <name>Rifles</name>, then in hand; and with which to redeem the fortunes of the night.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5177"/>But to resume, we had just struck the turn-pike, and turning our little squad to the left had got it cleverly on the road between the hotel and the court-house, when the enemy appeared advancing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5178"/>My purpose was to advance until I found a good position for the expected fight, but we had to take things as we found them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5179"/>Both of us had narrow fronts, <num value="2">two</num> files, and neither could deploy, the road being enclosed on each side by the fences of the hotel and the court-house respectively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5180"/>The enemy halted, because, (I suppose,) he saw something occupying the road in his front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5181"/>Flushed with their success, they were manifestly in considerable disorder, and when I ordered the <name>Rifles</name> to fire, which, owing to their position, was obeyed to a very limited and inefficient extent, I do not think the enemy returned it. But, reversing his movement returned, I inferred, to the run west of the town, to reform his command, I presume, in order to charge, in order, through the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5182"/>It must have been at this time, or when we <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> entered the turn-pike, (for I saw no more of him afterwards,) that <persName n="Ewell,Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0065.00375.04867" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,R.,S.,,:2"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Ewell</surname></persName> left the command to dispatch a courier to bring up the cavalry companies of <persName n="Harrison,,,,," id="n0123.0065.00375.04868" reg="mostcommon:Harrison,nomatch:0"><surname>Harrison</surname></persName> and <persName n="Wickham,,,,," id="n0123.0065.00375.04869" reg="mostcommon:Wickham,nomatch:0"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, camped at <orgName n="Fairfax Station" type="station">Fairfax Station</orgName>, <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> from the court-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5184"/>Neither man, nor beast, that I could ascertain, sustained the slightest injury in this collision.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5185"/>Having been left to my own discretion, and perfectly satisfied that my position was untenable against any mounted force of dash and courage, I followed immediately on the retiring footsteps of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5186"/>It was not until I had reached <persName n="Cooper,,,,," id="n0123.0065.00375.04871" reg="mostcommon:Cooper,nomatch:0"><surname>Cooper</surname></persName>'s wagon shop, ascertained by recent measurement to be <num value="195">one hundred and ninety-five</num> steps west from the court-house, that I found a place which satisfied my judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5187"/>Here I found a new post and rail fence, on each side of the turn-pike &mdash; the <num value="1">one</num> on the south side, helping to enclose the wagon shop yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5188"/>Feeling safe in this position, I at once divided my command, placing it on <pb id="p.376" n="376"/>opposite sides of the road, and protecting it by the post and rail fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5189"/>I stated to the men, if I was not much mistaken, the enemy would soon appear &mdash; that they would seem a dark moving mass, and when I gave the command <quote>fire</quote> they must all aim at the head of the column, my object being to crush it in, throw the command into confusion, win time, deliberately to reload, and to give them another plunging volley before they could recover from their confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5190"/>And in that way I said, I counted on whipping the veteran enemy, although our superior in numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5193"/>It was admirably executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5194"/>Another fine volley followed, and <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> partially, when the enemy fell back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5195"/>During this time the enemy fired wildly and irregularly, not only without wounding or killing any of my men, but not even entertaining <quote>The Rifles</quote> with the whistle of a bullet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5196"/>The result of this affair was the capture on our part of <measure n="3" type="prisoners">three prisoners</measure>, I think <num value="4">four</num> horses, a number of horses killed and wounded, and, according to <persName n="McDonald,General,,,," id="n0123.0065.00376.04872" reg="mostcommon:McDonald,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McDonald</surname></persName>'s <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> official report, (which I have,) <num value="1">one</num> man killed and <measure n="6" type="wounded">six wounded</measure>, besides a number of arms and fancies, such as photographs of pretty women and the like, picked up after the fight.

If he did not know it he should not be blamed for it, and I never have heard an individual complain of his not knowing it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5637"/>Finding that he did not do so I said to him that I understood he had expressed a wish to have a personal interview with me. He replied that he had not.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5780"/>The noblest bands of men who ever fought or who ever fell in the annals of war, whose glorious deeds history ever took pen to record, were, I exultingly claim, the private soldiers in the armies of the great Confederate cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5781"/>Whether right or wrong in the cause which they espoused, they were earnest and honest patriots in their convictions, who thought that they were right to defend their own, their native land, its soil, its altars, and its honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5782"/>They felt that they were no rebels, and no traitors in obeying their State sovereignties, and they thought that it was lawful to take up arms under their mandates, authorized expressly by the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, to repel invasion or to suppress insurrection, when there was such <quote><hi rend="italics">imminent danger as not to admit of delay</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5784"/>They have been invaded until every blade of grass has been trodden down, until every sanctuary of temple, and fame, and altar, and home has been profaned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5785"/>The most of these men had no stately mansions for their homes; no slaves to plow and plant any broad fields of theirs; no stocks or investments in interest bearing funds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5792"/>Prodigies of valor, miracles of victories, undoubted and undoubting devotion and endurance to the last, entitled them to honors of surrender which gilded the arms of their victors and extorted from them even cheers on the battle-field where at last they yielded for peace!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5993"/>I was appointed by <persName n="Letcher,Governor,,,," id="n0123.0079.00433.05482" reg="mostcommon:Letcher,S.,H.,,:1"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Letcher</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Colonel">Colonel</rs> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="49VAVolunteer">Forty-ninth Virginia volunteers</orgName>, the latter part of <dateStruct value="1861-06-"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, upon my individual application.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5994"/>The Governor replied to my application, that I was too old; to which I rejoined, that I would like to see the young man who could stand more hardship and fatigue than <persName n="Well,,I.,,," id="n0123.0079.00433.05483" reg="default:Well,I.,,,"><foreName>I.</foreName> <surname>Well</surname></persName>, he said, if you insist upon it, I will not refuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5995"/>To which I said, in the words of the bridegroom, who, when asked by the parson if he would take this woman as his wedded wife, <quote>zounds man, that is just what I come for.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5996"/>The Governor thereupon gave me an order to <persName n="Lee,General,R.,E.,," id="n0123.0079.00433.05484" reg="expanded:Lee,Robert,Edward,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, then <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</rs> of our State, to prepare my commission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5997"/>Upon presenting it, <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0123.0079.00433.05485" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, after glancing over it, looked up with manifest surprise, he, too, doubtless thinking I was too old; and pausing a moment, and without a word, he filled up and handed it to me. I took it to the <rs>Governor</rs> for his signature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5998"/>Receiving it, I returned with it to <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0123.0079.00433.05486" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, that he might make the proper record &mdash; who, having done so, returned it to me, with an order to <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0123.0079.00433.05487" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,G.,T.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> to form my regiment out of companies as they severally reported for duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5999"/>In my <pb id="p.434" n="434"/><num value="64" type="ordinal">sixty-fourth</num> year, and wholly unacquainted with drill or tactics, my military prospects were anything but flattering; yet, I thought I knew how to manage men, and flattered myself that I could soon, for all practical purposes, overcome existing deficiences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6000"/>Besides, I well knew the bitter feeling of hostility against the <rs>South</rs> cherished by Northern politicians, who would greedily seize upon this opportunity to gratify their hatred and satiate their revenge; and in view of the great inequality of the contest, I felt it to be my duty to set a spirited example and to contribute all in my power to the success of a cause which was dear to my heart, and which I believed, and ever shall believe, to be right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6001"/>With this explanation, by way of reply, to the many friends who kindly remonstrated against my entering the army, I proceed to carry out the purpose of this article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6002"/>Having made my personal arrangements, and having fortunately secured unexceptionable field officers, to wit: <persName n="Murray,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0079.00434.05488" reg="mostcommon:Murray,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>Murray</surname></persName>, a graduate, I believe, of <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, and certainly a splendid drill-master and tactician, and <persName n="Smith,Major,,,," id="n0123.0079.00434.05489" reg="nearbymention:Smith,William,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, my nephew, a veteran soldier, just about <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> from the <rs>Federal</rs> army, having resigned therefrom to enter the <rs>Confederate</rs> service, I felt that my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> great difficulty had been overcome.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6003"/>And so, with <num value="3">three</num> companies only assigned to my regiment, I found myself regularly enrolled in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>, only <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> before the <rs n="First Battle of Manassas" type="battle">first battle of Manassas</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6004"/>On the <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="2">first</day></dateStruct> <time>day</time>, and late in the afternoon, I was ordered to the <rs type="place">Sudley mills</rs>, where I expected to meet <persName n="Hunton,Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0079.00434.05490" reg="mostcommon:Hunton,Eppa,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Hunton</surname></persName>, then on his march from <placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6005"/>On our arrival, finding <persName n="Hunton,Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0079.00434.05491" reg="mostcommon:Hunton,Eppa,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Hunton</surname></persName> had not arrived, we camped in and around the <placeName reg="Sudley Church">Sudley church</placeName>, my quarters being in a house not far from it. It was fully <time value="11pm">11 P. M.</time> before my men got their supper and fixed themselves for the night, and I had not been asleep more than an hour when, about <time value="1am">1 A. M.</time>, I received an order to get my men under arms and move with them to a point on <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> near the <rs type="place">Lewis house</rs>, and to report to <persName n="Cocke,General,,,," id="n0123.0079.00434.05492" reg="mostcommon:Cocke,C.,H.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Cocke</surname></persName>; in other words, to return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6006"/>I promptly gave the necessary orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6007"/>On reaching the camp I found the command in a state of confused preparation, and when it was reported as ready to move I walked over the ground and found many of its conveniences about to be abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6008"/>I at once sternly rebuked the men for their negligence, told them that <hi rend="italics">order</hi> and <hi rend="italics">care</hi> were <num value="2">two</num> of the duties of the soldier, and that I would not tolerate the loss of a tin cup if an act of carelessness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6009"/>The ground being gleaned, the order to march was given, and we reached our position about sunrise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6010"/>The next day we camped near the <rs type="place">Lewis house</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6011"/>As it was understood we were to fight the day thereafter, and my men had but little rest the previous night, I determined they <pb id="p.435" n="435"/>should have a good night's rest the coming night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6012"/>Accordingly, when the sentinels were posted, they were charged not, under any circumstances, to permit the men to be disturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6013"/>On the morning of the <dateStruct value="1861-07-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> <month reg="07">July</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> I was ordered to take position on <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, north of the <rs type="place">Lewis house</rs>; and <persName n="Harris,Captain,,,," id="n0123.0079.00435.05493" reg="mostcommon:Harris,Charles,,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Harris</surname></persName>, an engineer officer of much note, was ordered to accompany and post us. We were placed on the edge of the run, under a bluff, on which a section of <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Rogers,,,,," id="n0123.0079.00435.05494" reg="mostcommon:Rogers,Walter,H.,,:2"><surname>Rogers</surname></persName>'s battery</orgName>, under <persName n="Heaton,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0123.0079.00435.05495" reg="mostcommon:Heaton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Heaton</surname></persName>, was posted, and temporarily attached to my command.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6014"/>Riding up on the bluff, I found but <num value="1">one</num> gun. Surprised, I asked the <rs>Lieutenant</rs> where his other was. Pointing to it, near the <rs type="place">Lewis house</rs>, he said, <quote>there it is, and put there by order of <persName n="Cocke,General,,,," id="n0123.0079.00435.05496" reg="mostcommon:Cocke,C.,H.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Cocke</surname></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6015"/>Putting spurs to my horse, as I passed the gun, I gave orders for every man to be in the saddle, ready to move on my signal to do so, on my return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6016"/>Dashing up to <persName n="Cocke,General,,,," id="n0123.0079.00435.05497" reg="mostcommon:Cocke,C.,H.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Cocke</surname></persName>, who was some <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> west &mdash; after saluting him &mdash; I said, General, permit me to suggest that the gun I have just passed would be more likely to render effective service along side of its mate on yonder bluff than where it is now; and I beg you will permit me to so order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6017"/>Receiving his consent, and touching my hat in salute, I moved rapidly in return, giving the expected signal, so that the gun with all its equipments was promptly in motion, and moved with such celerity, that it reached the bluff before I could, with all my dash, overtake it. It was a happy reunion, and under the exhilarating circumstances, gave assurance of a splendid fight, should the exigency require it; but a few shots from our guns and from <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Latham,,,,," id="n0123.0079.00435.05498" reg="mostcommon:Latham,nomatch:0"><surname>Latham</surname></persName>'s battery</orgName>, near by, on my right, induced the enemy, who had shown himself in the pines, on the northern side of the run to abandon his purpose which, obviously, was to reach, in this direction, our line of inter-communication with <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6018"/>As far as I can learn, the enemy's force referred to was under the command of <persName n="Schenck,General,,,," id="n0123.0079.00435.05499" reg="mostcommon:Schenck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Schenck</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6019"/>He was easily checked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6020"/>About this time the peals of musketry, apparently about the <rs type="place">Robinson</rs> and the <rs type="place">Henry houses</rs> was incessant and fascinating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6021"/>While thus absorbed, and sitting on my horse, surrounded with <persName n="Murray,Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0079.00435.05500" reg="mostcommon:Murray,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Murray</surname></persName>, <persName n="Harris,Captain,,,," id="n0123.0079.00435.05501" reg="mostcommon:Harris,Charles,,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Harris</surname></persName> and others on the bluff, near <persName n="Heaton,,,,," id="n0123.0079.00435.05502" reg="mostcommon:Heaton,nomatch:0"><surname>Heaton</surname></persName>'s guns, <persName n="Murray,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0079.00435.05503" reg="mostcommon:Murray,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>Murray</surname></persName> called to me, <quote>Look there, <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6022"/>Following the direction of his finger, I saw <num value="2">two</num> regiments in line of battle, moving at quick time, apparently from the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6023"/>I know not how to account for my conduct, but giving way to the impulse of the moment, I put spurs to my horse, threw myself in their front and brought them to a halt, simply remarking, <quote>Gentlemen, I must inform you that you have taken the wrong direction.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6024"/><pb id="p.436" n="436"/></p> 
<p>Returning quickly to my position, for the heavy firing still continued, I had barely done so, when <persName n="Murray,Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0079.00436.05504" reg="mostcommon:Murray,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Murray</surname></persName> cried out: <quote>Look, <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>, those fellows are moving.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6025"/>Again stopping them I again returned to the bluff, when <persName n="Murray,Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0079.00436.05505" reg="mostcommon:Murray,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Murray</surname></persName> for the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> time exclaimed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6026"/><quote><rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>, those fellows are off again.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6027"/>Much exasperated, I put spurs to my horse, soon overtook them, and galloping around their left flank, drew up in their front, and again brought them to a halt on the road leading from the <rs type="place">Lewis house</rs> to <persName n="Ball,,,,," id="n0123.0079.00436.05506" reg="mostcommon:Ball,nomatch:0"><surname>Ball</surname></persName>'s or <placeName reg="Lewis' ford">Lewis' ford</placeName>, I am uncertain which.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6028"/>As I did so, I heard some in the ranks cry out, <quote>who the h-ll is that?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6029"/>To which I replied in a loud voice, <quote>I am <persName n="Smith,Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0079.00436.05507" reg="nearbymention:Smith,William,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="49VAVolunteer">Forty-ninth Virginia Volunteers</orgName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6030"/>To which <persName n="Fisher,Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0079.00436.05508" reg="mostcommon:Fisher,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Fisher</surname></persName> promptly replied, <quote>and I am <persName n="Fisher,Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0079.00436.05509" reg="mostcommon:Fisher,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Fisher</surname></persName> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="NC6">Sixth North Carolina</orgName>, all I ask is to be put in position,</quote> and <persName n="Falkner,Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0079.00436.05510" reg="mostcommon:Falkner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Falkner</surname></persName> then said, <quote>and I am <persName n="Falkner,Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0079.00436.05511" reg="mostcommon:Falkner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Falkner</surname></persName> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="MS2">Second Mississippi</orgName>,</quote> but from the distance he was from me, I heard him imperfectly, yet understood him to say that he was ready to obey orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6031"/>Then, I said, <quote>dress your men on the line of this road, bring them to a rest, and wait for orders.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6032"/>These regiments and the gun I had had moved to the bluff, were, it is highly probable the foundation of <persName n="Schenck,General,,,," id="n0123.0079.00436.05512" reg="mostcommon:Schenck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Schenck</surname></persName>'s estimate of our force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6033"/>He had them in full view from the position he occupied in the pines.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6034"/>Returning rapidly to my position, I there found a <rs n="General Order" type="misc">general order</rs>, that every man not in the face of the enemy should report to <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0123.0079.00436.05513" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,G.,T.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> near the <rs type="place">Robinson house</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6035"/>Promptly putting my little command in motion, I soon crossed a small ravine draining into <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6036"/>Ascending the opposite hill, <persName n="Tibbs,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0079.00436.05514" reg="mostcommon:Tibbs,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>Tibbs</surname></persName> of <orgName type="regiment" key="8VARegiment"><persName n="Hunton,Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0079.00436.05515" reg="mostcommon:Hunton,Eppa,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Hunton</surname></persName>'s Eighth Virginia Regiment</orgName> hallooed to me: <quote>I am posted here (near the head of the ravine) with <num value="3">three</num> companies, for <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> sake let <persName n="Hunton,Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0079.00436.05516" reg="mostcommon:Hunton,Eppa,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Hunton</surname></persName>, who is at the <rs type="place">Lewis house</rs> with the balance of the regiment know your orders.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6037"/>The hill on which the <rs type="place">Lewis house</rs> stood is of very considerable size and the northern slope of it drains into the ravine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6038"/>The whole of this slope, up to the new grounds, near and north of the <rs type="place">Lewis house</rs>, was then covered with an oaken growth of original forest; but it is now, I find upon a recent examination (<dateStruct value="1882--"><year reg="1882">1882</year></dateStruct>), under a fine crop of corn, the house having been burnt by the enemy in the spring of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, when he <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> took possession of it. Ordering <persName n="Murray,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0079.00436.05517" reg="mostcommon:Murray,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>Murray</surname></persName> to take charge of my command, and to move on without delay, saying I would soon rejoin him, I put spurs to my horse, dashed through the woods and nearing <orgName n="command"><persName n="Hunton,Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0079.00436.05518" reg="mostcommon:Hunton,Eppa,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Hunton</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>, hallooed to him that <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0123.0079.00436.05519" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,G.,T.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>'s order was, <quote>that every man not in the face of the enemy should move into action.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6039"/>To which he promptly <pb id="p.437" n="437"/>replied: <quote>I am posted here by <persName n="Cocke,General,,,," id="n0123.0079.00437.05520" reg="mostcommon:Cocke,C.,H.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Cocke</surname></persName>, with express orders not to leave my position without his command.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6040"/>I rejoined, <quote>You know whom to obey.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6041"/>Returning rapidly to my command, I had scarcely reached it when a squad of <num value="15">fifteen</num> to <num value="20">twenty</num> men crossed my line of march, from the direction of the <rs type="place">Lewis house</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6042"/>I halted them for information, when at the instant a heavy outburst of musketry breaking upon the ear, they resumed their previous rapid movement, like frightened deer, amid the derisive laughter of my whole command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6043"/>Resuming our march, we had proceeded but a short distance when we encountered a <orgName type="mil" key="SCCompany">South Carolina company</orgName> moving in the direction of the stone bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6044"/>Ascertaining it was lost, I said: <quote>Fall in upon my left and I'll conduct you to the post of duty.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6045"/>This was promptly done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6046"/>Moving but a short distance I encountered <num value="2">two</num> <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> companies under precisely similar circumstances, to whom I also said: <quote>Fall in, on my left, and I'll conduct you where men can show their mettle;</quote> which was done with alacrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6047"/>So that when I reported to <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0123.0079.00437.05521" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,G.,T.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, some <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> from the <rs type="place">Robinson house</rs>, I had <num value="3">three</num> companies of my own regiment, <num value="1">one</num> <orgName type="mil" key="SCCompany">South Carolina company</orgName> and <num value="2">two</num> <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> companies &mdash; not exceeding in all <num value="450">450</num> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6048"/>Pausing for a moment, he replied: <quote><rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>, what can you do?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6049"/>This was a hard question to <num value="1">one</num> wholly unacquainted with military duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6050"/>I, however, promptly answered, <quote>Put us in position and I'll show you.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6051"/>I then added: <quote>General, <persName n="Hunton,Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0079.00437.05523" reg="mostcommon:Hunton,Eppa,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Hunton</surname></persName>, with a fine regiment, is posted at or near the <rs type="place">Lewis house</rs> and is burning with impatience to join in the battle.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6052"/>Promptly acting on the information, he ordered <num value="1">one</num> of his staff to proceed forthwith to <persName n="Hunton,Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0079.00437.05524" reg="mostcommon:Hunton,Eppa,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Hunton</surname></persName>, and to order him to report with his regiment with all possible dispatch.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6053"/>At this time <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0123.0079.00437.05525" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,G.,T.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> was forming his new line of battle, his right in the open field, midway between the <rs type="place">Robinson</rs> and <placeName reg="Henry house">Henry houses</placeName>, and in a line parallel therewith, but considerably to the east thereof and running south in a line that soon gave them the shelter of the pines for <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile or so. The enemy was heavily flanking our left, and our reinforcements, as they came up, were ordered to form on the left of our line, and so, by extending it, counteract the movements of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6054"/>Accordingly, I was ordered to form on the left, by passing the rear of our line until I reached my position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6064"/>Having taken my position, I found myself quite well sheltered from view by a small growth of old-field pines, as was <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s left, with some small gullies now plainly to be seen in the rear of my left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6065"/>Looking around me, I found myself on the eastern slope of the ridge or plateau, opposite to, with my left a little to the south of the <rs type="place">Henry house</rs>, and directly in front of the <placeName reg="Ricketts, Luzerne, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2617612">Ricketts</placeName> battery, which had just taken position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6066"/>I am quite sure the enemy had not yet discovered us. I admonished my men to be cool and deliberate, and not to fire without an object under sight, and gave the word to fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6067"/>This fire, with <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s, which was no doubt simultaneous, was so destructive that it utterly disabled the <placeName reg="Ricketts, Luzerne, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2617612">Ricketts</placeName> battery for all efficient purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6068"/>I am not sure, but I am under the impression, that it never fired upon us <pb id="p.439" n="439"/>more than once, if that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6070"/>Indeed, such was the impetuosity of <num value="1">one</num> of these charges &mdash; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, I think &mdash; that <num value="2">two</num> of my men, <persName n="Kirkpatrick,,,,," id="n0123.0079.00439.05538" reg="mostcommon:Kirkpatrick,nomatch:0"><surname>Kirkpatrick</surname></persName> and <persName n="Suddoth,,,,," id="n0123.0079.00439.05539" reg="mostcommon:Suddoth,nomatch:0"><surname>Suddoth</surname></persName>, penetrated so deeply into the enemy's lines that they could not fall back with their comrades when repulsed, but remained in the confused masses of the enemy, unnoticed I presume, until another charge, which almost immediately followed, extricated them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6071"/>Shortly after this bloody strife began, looking to my left, I saw a heavy mass of the enemy advancing from the direction of the <placeName reg="Sudley, Anne Arundel, Maryland" key="tgn,2700708">Sudley</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> road, on a line parallel with and equi-distant between my line of battle and the <rs type="place">Henry house</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6556"/>I charged, they surrendered, and in a few minutes I had them in front of me in the bow of the boat, while the boys on the other shore were yelling like madman at my success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6590"/>We started on a cruise of observation, the whole command following along the bank of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6604"/>We lay the balance of the day under the guns of the artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6610"/>No wet or mud, all comfortable and dry, and as we steamed along through the heavy mist that had settled like a fog on the river, I built castles in the air all in the next few hours to be dissolved in smoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6612"/>I gave the <pb id="p.478" n="478"/>artillery credit for their silence, but never even doubted that they were there just as <persName n="Forrest,General,,,," id="n0123.0082.00478.05985" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,N.,B.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Forrest</surname></persName> said they would be.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6613"/>Soon all was uproar in <placeName reg="New Johnsonville, Humphreys, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100724">Johnsonville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6614"/>Long files of infantry could be seen on the banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6615"/>Dozens of steamers, side by side, lined the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6616"/>From out of this mass of vessels <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> gunboats made their appearance, saluting me as they arranged themselves side by side, heading toward me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6617"/>I had given the entire command below decks to <persName n="Leonard,Sergeant,,,," id="n0123.0082.00478.05986" reg="nearbymention:Leonard,John,,,"><roleName n="Sergeant">Sergeant</roleName> <surname>Leonard</surname></persName>, instructing him to fire as rapidly as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6618"/>I was giving instructions to my pilots and watching the bank for our artillery, when my attention was attracted by the violent gestures of <persName n="Weaver,,William,,," id="n0123.0082.00478.05987" reg="default:Weaver,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Weaver</surname></persName>, an Ohio river pilot and a member of my battery, whom I had placed in the pilot house in case of injury to my regular <placeName reg="Tennessee River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2715022">Tennessee-river</placeName> pilot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6619"/>I could not hear him speak, the din and uproar were terrific.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6620"/>Finally, I understood his gestures were to look at something in our rear, or down stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6621"/>On passing around the pilot house I saw a sight to make him gesticulate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6623"/>Why they did not shoot I could not say, unless they were afraid of striking their friends who were in easy range just above me. I now was certain the artillery was not on the river below me else the gunboats below could not pass without my hearing the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6624"/>The vessels above me, no longer fearing an ambuscade, and doubtless not wishing to divide the honors of my capture with the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio river</placeName> fleet, closed down on us rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6625"/>It was perfectly evident now we could not save our vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6626"/>The only question was, should we surrender, or blow her up, taking our chances for escape?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6627"/>Having no <num value="1">one</num> to consult with, I soon determined to blow her up. I ordered a number of mattresses, used by the mariners, and made of shavings, to be cut open and thrown into the magazine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6628"/>On this was poured a barrel of oil. A man stood by with a burning lamp to touch it off when I gave the word, and not before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6629"/>Another wistful look along the shore for <persName n="Forrest,,,,," id="n0123.0082.00478.05988" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,N.,B.,,:1"><surname>Forrest</surname></persName>, another shot at the enemy, and the order was given to head her hard down for shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6631"/>The torch was applied, and almost before you could jump into the water the flames burst through the hurricane roof, the enemy firing several rounds of canister or grapeshot at us as we were wading and scrambling up the bank, but happily without injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6632"/>The gunboats withdrew a short distance, fearing our vessel in her death throes more than they did whilst living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6633"/>Soon our <pb id="p.479" n="479"/>side batteries, that were left heavily loaded, were fired by the heat of the burning vessel, quickly followed by the magazine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6961"/>Nearly all that day we tramped through the muck of the roads, that was ankle deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6962"/>There was a constant cannonading in our front.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6963"/>It was late in the evening when we arrived at <placeName key="tgn,2111044" n="1.000 114" reg="chantilly, fairfax, virginia">Chantilly</placeName>, that stately old country house, where several of us had stood guard in the lovely autumn nights of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6966"/>Standing, then, in the drowning summer's storm, we beheld the evidence so plain before our eyes of the sacked and ruined <placeName key="tgn,2111044" n="1.000 114" reg="chantilly, fairfax, virginia">Chantilly</placeName>; that sweet, lovely place which, for nearly a century, had been famous for all that makes a home prized and loved, and an estate cared for and valued.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6967"/>The fences were all levelled, the out-buildings were demolished, the splendid park cut down &mdash; every shade tree was felled by the axe, even the fruit trees were hacked down out of mere wantoness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6968"/>As for the house, it was hardly habitable, the furniture was smashed to kindling wood, the windows dashed to pieces with the butt-end of the muskets, the plastering from the walls knocked off, and the rooms so defaced and defiled that it discounted a hog pen in filth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6998"/>The country people lined the roads, gazing in open-eyed wonder upon the long lines of infantry, that filled the road for miles, and as far as the eye could reach, was the glitter of the swaying points of the bayonets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7007"/>No bursts of martial music greeted your ear, no thundering sound of canon, no brilliant staff, no glittering cortege dashed through the streets, instead came <num value="3">three</num> long dirty columns, that kept on in an unceasing flow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7035"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the soldiers used to steal out companionless and alone, and hide in the woods and bushes, with as much secretness and caution as if he was going to commit some fearful crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7036"/>Once hid from the eyes of men, he would pursue and murder the crawling insects with a vengeful pleasure, thinking that now he would have peace and comfort of mind, and be able to hold up his head once more before his fellow men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7041"/>Once lodged in the seams of the clothing they remained until time mouldered the garments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7042"/>You might scald, scour, scrub, cleanse, rub, purify, leave them in seathing liquid, or bury the raiment in the ground, but it was wasted labor, for the insects seem to enjoy the process and increased and multiplied under it. <pb id="p.511" n="511"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7043"/>On this march particulary, when the troops had no change of clean clothes for weeks, the soldiers were literally infested with them, many used to place their under raiment, during the night, in the bottom of some stream and put a large stone to keep them down; in the morning they would hastily dry them and get a temporary relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7044"/>Every evening in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, when the army halted and bivouaced for the night, hundreds of the soldiers could be seen, sitting on the roads or fields, half denuded with their clothes in their laps busily cracking, between the <num value="2">two</num> thumb-nails, these creeping nuisances &mdash; a <num value="100">hundred</num> full-fledged fathers of families was not considered an unusual number in <num value="1">one</num> haul.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7046"/>In our march along the turnpike, there was not left a ear of corn, or a green apple, in the bordering fields; the soldiery made a specialty of cooking these vegetables, eating them raw, roasted, boiled, and all mixed in a kind of soup, filling themselves full, but still longing for the meat and bread diet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7047"/>The actions of the citizens of <placeName reg="Hagerstown, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7013681">Hagerstown</placeName> showed in vivid contrast to <placeName reg="Frederick City">Frederick City</placeName>, for not only were the men and women out-spoken in their sympathy for the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, but they threw wide open their hospitable doors and filled their houses with the soldiers, feeding the hungry, and clothing the naked, as well as their limited means allowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7050"/>A savage attack came from the enemy on our left to break the line, but was repulsed; the musketry firing and cannonading was for a short time very severe; no determined infantry charge was made upon our brigade, though several <name>Yankee</name> batteries shelled the line, and a feeble attack made, which was easily checked, for the regiment was in place behind a fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7051"/>The <num value="17" type="ordinal">Seventeenth</num> only lost about half a dozen wounded.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7052"/>That night, or rather at early dawn of the <dateStruct value="--15"><day reg="15">15th</day></dateStruct>, the brigade marched towards <placeName reg="Sharpsburg, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7014501">Sharpsburg</placeName>; the men had not a mouthful to eat, and squads from the different companies obtained permission to forage for them-selves and comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7053"/>I was on <num value="1">one</num> of these details; leaving the road and striking across the fields, we entered into a yard in the centre of which stood a fine brick mansion; we knocked at the door &mdash; there was <pb id="p.512" n="512"/>no response, and then after waiting awhile we entered and found to our astonisment that it was deserted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7055"/>Not an article had been carried off &mdash; the parlor door was open &mdash; there stood the piano, the pictures depended from the wall, the curtains hung as gracefully as if some hand has just arranged its fold; we entered the dining-room &mdash; there rested the cat on the window-sill &mdash; everything seemed so natural, it was difficult to realize that the hostess would not enter and welcome us in a few moments.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7056"/>We had no time to linger, the cannon sounded their warning note; besides, we had come to get something to eat, and not to make any voyage of discovery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7057"/>So finding nothing in the pantry, nor in the kitchen, we went to the spring and filled our canteens with water, then to the dairy at the foot of the hill, and discovered several buckets and cans of milk which had been placed there last night by some visible means; we filled our canteens with the lacteal fluid, and noticing the loft, a room over the dairy, we climbed up, found it a perfect store-room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7058"/>Several barrels were on stands, and on investigating the contents of <num value="1">one</num>, it was found to be cider, and then the canteens were emptied of milk and filled with the juice of the apple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7059"/>Then an exclamation from <num value="1">one</num> of the party brought us over to him, and he showed us a barrel of <rs n="apple brandy" type="product">apple brandy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7060"/>That cider in the canteens was soon poured on the floor, and the apple jack took its place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7061"/>An animated discussion took place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7062"/>The whole squad, except the sergeant, wanted to carry the barrel and leave everything else behind, but then came the difficulty about obeying orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7063"/>The discussion waxed high, and to end the matter the sergeant stove in the head of the barrel with the butt of his musket, and the precious liquid that would have made glad, for a time at least, the whole brigade, poured in a useless stream upon the floor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7064"/>In the room was half a dozen tubs of apple butter, which we confiscated for the use of our comrades, and carried it off with us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7068"/>It also became necessary, on our retreat from the <rs>State</rs>, for us to flank the town of <placeName reg="Trenton, Todd, Kentucky" key="tgn,2041680">Lebanon, Kentucky</placeName>, which lay in our most direct road south, from the fact that the garrison there had been heavily reinforced, and the town occupied by a large force of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7069"/>This necessitated our leaving the turnpike road at <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532">Springfield</placeName> on the evening of <dateStruct value="1862-12-30"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="30">30th</day>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>; and on that bitter night, which will be long remembered by every member of the command, we made the famous all-night march around <placeName reg="Lebanon, Laclede, Missouri" key="tgn,2059507">Lebanon</placeName>, and owing mainly to the almost impassable condition of the mud roads, found ourselves at day-light the next morning only about <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles distant</measure> from the point we had left the evening before.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7070"/>Thus compelled to leave the main highway, we struggled along, making slow progress over mud roads, in which our horses sank in many places to their knees, trying to get the artillery over these difficulties, and aiming to strike the turnpike running from <placeName reg="Lebanon, Laclede, Missouri" key="tgn,2059507">Lebanon</placeName> to <placeName reg="Campbellsville, Taylor, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038050">Campbellsville</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7072"/>We had the impression that the command was to pass through <placeName reg="New Market, Marion, Kentucky" key="tgn,2040494">New Market</placeName> that afternoon; in which, however, we afterwards found ourselves mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7073"/>Acting on <persName n="Tribble,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00513.06421" reg="nearbymention:Tribble,Alexander,,,"><surname>Tribble</surname></persName>'s suggestion, I went with him to <persName n="Morgan,General,,,," id="n0123.0085.00513.06422" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,John,A.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Morgan</surname></persName>, and without difficulty we obtained his permission to pass on in front of the advance guard for the purpose mentioned, which we accordingly did. After going several miles, we learned by inquiring of a farmer, that New Market was about <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> off to the left of the road we were then traveling, and by his direction we left that road by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lane leading to the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7074"/>This lane led us, after traveling over it for about a mile, into another main country road, where we had been directed to turn to the right; and following these directions we came to the junction of this road with the <pb id="p.514" n="514"/><placeName reg="Lebanon, Laclede, Missouri" key="tgn,2059507">Lebanon</placeName> and <address><street n="Campbellsville turnpike">Campbellsville turnpike</street></address> where we found the little town of which we were in search.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7075"/>We dismounted at the best looking store in the village (which consisted of a few houses strung along on either side of the pike), but soon found that our mission was a fruitless <num value="1">one</num>, as the store contained nothing that we cared to buy, even for Confederate money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7076"/>In the meantime we had been asked by several citizens of the little town, and along the road, if we were <persName n="Halisey,Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0085.00514.06423" reg="nearbymention:Halisey,Dennis,J.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Halisey</surname></persName>'s men, to which inquiry we generally responded in the affirmative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7077"/>The fact was, however, that we had never heard of <persName n="Halisey,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00514.06424" reg="nearbymention:Halisey,Dennis,J.,,"><surname>Halisey</surname></persName> until the day before, and then mainly through the prayers of the enthusiastic women sympathizers of the <rs>South</rs>, who had flocked to the road-side to see the command pass, and had besought us that we would kill <persName n="Halisey,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00514.06425" reg="nearbymention:Halisey,Dennis,J.,,"><surname>Halisey</surname></persName> before we left the <rs>State</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7079"/>After briefly looking over the stock of goods in the store at which we had dismounted, we told the proprietor that we were members of <orgName n="command"><persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00514.06427" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,John,A.,,:1"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7080"/>He replied that we were, perhaps, in much greater danger than we were aware of, as small bands of Federal cavalry had been passing through the village all day, at short intervals, going on to reinforce <placeName reg="Lebanon, Laclede, Missouri" key="tgn,2059507">Lebanon</placeName>, which place they expected <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00514.06428" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,John,A.,,:1"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName> to attack that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7081"/>To confirm his statement, he pointed to a house a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> further down the pike, and told us that the horse hitched there belonged to a Federal soldier who had stopped there as the last squad had passed through a few minutes before.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7082"/><persName n="Tribble,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00514.06429" reg="nearbymention:Tribble,Alexander,,,"><surname>Tribble</surname></persName> and I thought that we might capture this fellow, and at once mounted and started in the direction of the house referred to. We were, however, quickly discovered by the cavalryman, who seemed to know our uniforms better than the citizens we had met, and he immediately mounted and started in the direction of <placeName reg="Lebanon, Laclede, Missouri" key="tgn,2059507">Lebanon</placeName> at full speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7083"/>We gave chase for a short distance, but soon found that the <rs>Yankee</rs> was out-running us; and having concluded that New Market was not a very congenial clime in which to tarry, we turned our horses' heads, and going back through the village, turned off from the pike into the dirt road over which we had come, hoping soon to rejoin our command.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7084"/>We had gone but a short distance in that direction before we met <num value="2">two</num> stragglers from our own command going in the direction of <placeName reg="New Market, Marion, Kentucky" key="tgn,2040494">New Market</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7085"/>We told them they were going in the wrong direction, and made them turn back and accompany us. It then occurred to <persName n="Tribble,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00514.06430" reg="nearbymention:Tribble,Alexander,,,"><surname>Tribble</surname></persName> and myself that, as we could get no shoes to add to the comfort of our men <pb id="p.515" n="515"/>in walking, the next best thing we could do would be to take in a couple of fresh horses, which might obviate the necessity for some poor fellows having to walk <hi rend="italics">without shoes</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7086"/>We had by this time come to the mouth of the lane through which we had passed in getting into this main dirt road, and where we would have to turn off to get back to the road on which we had left the command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7087"/>About <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> from where we then were, and just opposite the mouth of this lane, stood a comfortable looking farm-house with a good looking horse grazing in the yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7088"/>It was then agreed between <persName n="Tribble,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00515.06431" reg="nearbymention:Tribble,Alexander,,,"><surname>Tribble</surname></persName> and myself, that he should take <num value="1">one</num> of the men whom we had just before met, and get this horse, provided he should find him suitable for our purposes, while I was to take the other man, and go further on down this main road to see if I could not capture, or, as we then expressed it <quote>press</quote> another horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7089"/>Accordingly, <persName n="Tribble,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00515.06432" reg="nearbymention:Tribble,Alexander,,,"><surname>Tribble</surname></persName> started for the horse referred to, and I, with <num value="1">one</num> of the stragglers we had picked up, proceeded down this main road, still going away from <placeName reg="New Market, Marion, Kentucky" key="tgn,2040494">New Market</placeName>, and having passed the lane at which we should have left this road in order to get back to our command.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7090"/>My man and myself had gone perhaps half a mile when at a sudden turn in the road we were met by <num value="3">three</num> more men from our command going at full speed, and as though the whole <name>Yankee</name> army was at their heels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7091"/>As they dashed by us they had time only to call out to us, <quote>if you are <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00515.06433" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,John,A.,,:1"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName>'s men you had better be getting away from here, as the <rs>Yankees</rs> are right on us.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7092"/>I looked in the direction from which these men had come, and saw <num value="3">three</num> Federal cavalrymen coming rapidly down the road in pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7093"/>I then started after the men who had dashed by me so hurriedly, and who had been promptly joined by the man who had been with me, and ordered them to halt, assuring them that there were but <num value="3">three</num> <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName> in sight, and if they would stop there would then be <num value="5">five</num> of us to fight them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7094"/>But so badly demoralized were they that the bare suggestion of stopping to make a fight seemed only to accelerate their flight, and with my late companion well up with them, they kept on at the top of their horses' speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7095"/>We soon came in sight of the house at which <persName n="Tribble,Captain,,,," id="n0123.0085.00515.06434" reg="nearbymention:Tribble,Alexander,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Tribble</surname></persName> had stopped, and I commenced calling to him to come and join us. He recognized me at once, but thought the <num value="4">four</num> men flying along in front of me were <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>, whom I was pursuing, and although about to put a halter on the horse, for which he had gone, and which he had just succeeded in getting hold of, he dropped his game, mounted his own horse, and with the man he had taken along to assist him, started as rapidly as possible for the road-gate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7096"/>The <num value="4">four</num> demoralized Rebels, who were making <pb id="p.516" n="516"/>such good time in front of me, dashed by this gate, and kept straight on in the direction of <placeName reg="New Market, Marion, Kentucky" key="tgn,2040494">New Market</placeName>, passing by the lane at which they should have turned off in order to get back to our command, and, so so far as I know, I never saw either of them again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7097"/>I reached the gate at which <persName n="Tribble,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00516.06435" reg="nearbymention:Tribble,Alexander,,,"><surname>Tribble</surname></persName> must come out into the road, perhaps a minute before he did, and stopped there in order to hold it free for him to get into the road, but before he had reached it, the <num value="3">three</num> Federals who were pursuing, having gotten within <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> of me, halted in the road and fired <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> shots at me, which I returned, in order to hold them in check.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7098"/>This I did, until <persName n="Tribble,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00516.06436" reg="nearbymention:Tribble,Alexander,,,"><surname>Tribble</surname></persName> and his man reached the road and passed through the gate, and our respective parties then numbered <num value="3">three</num> on each side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7099"/><num value="2">Two</num> of our enemies had, besides their side arms, carbines, with which they were firing at me, while neither of us had anything but pistols.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7100"/>Tribble at once called my attention to this disadvantage under which we were placed as long as we were in the open road, and suggested that we must get to the woods, where we would be able to bring our enemies within shorter range, and be on an equal footing with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7101"/>Accordingly we all <num value="3">three</num> started in a run down the lane, which would take us back to the place where we left the command, and as soon as our horses' heads were turned, our opponents, as we had anticipated, started in pursuit of us, firing an occasional shot at us, which we would return, in order to keep up their interest in the chase.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7102"/>We had gone this way for perhaps half a mile, running just fast enough to encourage our pursuers to follow us, without trying to run entirely away from them, and had not yet found the trees for which we were looking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7103"/>As we thus galloped along this lane, I suddenly discovered, as I thought, the very place for our purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7104"/>I saw that we were approaching a small, sluggish stream which crossed our road, that on the side from which we were approaching, the road, which had evidently been used for many years, was cut or worn down quite deep; that the fence on <num value="1">one</num> side of the road did not extend entirely down to this stream, forming the corner of an old field, and leaving an unenclosed space, perhaps <num value="30">thirty</num> or <measure n="40feet" type="distance">forty feet</measure> wide, between the fence and the edge of the creek.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7105"/>I discovered that by turning our horses squarely around this corner into the unenclosed space spoken of, we would be entirely out of sight of our pursuers until they should come within a few paces of us. I therefore turned as abruptly as possible into this open space, and called to <persName n="Tribble,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00516.06437" reg="nearbymention:Tribble,Alexander,,,"><surname>Tribble</surname></persName> to do the same; but before he understood my purpose his horse had carried him into the little stream above referred to. The man who was with <persName n="Tribble,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00516.06438" reg="nearbymention:Tribble,Alexander,,,"><surname>Tribble</surname></persName> and me, <pb id="p.517" n="517"/>ran straight on without making a atop, and afterwards said as I was informed, that <hi rend="italics">his horse was running away with him</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7106"/>We had scarcely time to face about, when the front man of our pursuers, who afterwards proved to be an orderly on <persName n="Halisey,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00517.06439" reg="nearbymention:Halisey,Dennis,J.,,"><surname>Halisey</surname></persName>'s staff, by the name of <persName n="Edwards,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00517.06440" reg="mostcommon:Edwards,nomatch:0"><surname>Edwards</surname></persName>, dashed around the corner, and though he endeavored at once to check his horse, he did not succeed in doing so until he had run squarely up to <persName n="Tribble,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00517.06441" reg="nearbymention:Tribble,Alexander,,,"><surname>Tribble</surname></persName>, who was then facing him. A pistol shot was exchanged between them, but neither touched the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7107"/><persName n="Tribble,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00517.06442" reg="nearbymention:Tribble,Alexander,,,"><surname>Tribble</surname></persName>, who had fired <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, attempted to shoot the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time, being so near that the muzzle of his pistol was against <persName n="Edwards,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00517.06443" reg="mostcommon:Edwards,nomatch:0"><surname>Edwards</surname></persName>'s body, but this time his pistol snapped, and left him apparently at the mercy of his antagonist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7108"/>With the quickness of a tiger, however, he grappled with <persName n="Edwards,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00517.06444" reg="mostcommon:Edwards,nomatch:0"><surname>Edwards</surname></persName> before the latter could fire again, and being a powerful man, and a magnificent horseman, succeeded in dragging him backwards from his horse, and landed him sprawling in the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7109"/>Each man dropped his pistol in this struggle, but <persName n="Edwards,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00517.06445" reg="mostcommon:Edwards,nomatch:0"><surname>Edwards</surname></persName> being down in the water with <persName n="Tribble,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00517.06446" reg="nearbymention:Tribble,Alexander,,,"><surname>Tribble</surname></persName> over him, surrendered and announced himself <persName n="Tribble,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00517.06447" reg="nearbymention:Tribble,Alexander,,,"><surname>Tribble</surname></persName>'s prisoner.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7110"/>In the meantime, and not a horse's length behind <persName n="Edwards,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00517.06448" reg="mostcommon:Edwards,nomatch:0"><surname>Edwards</surname></persName>, <persName n="Halisey,Colonel,,,," id="n0123.0085.00517.06449" reg="nearbymention:Halisey,Dennis,J.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Halisey</surname></persName> came around the corner, and reining in his horse more success-fully than <persName n="Edwards,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00517.06450" reg="mostcommon:Edwards,nomatch:0"><surname>Edwards</surname></persName> had done, turned into the open space spoken of above within perhaps <num value="10">ten</num> paces of me I at once fired at him and demanded his surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7111"/>He returned my fire, and urging my horse a little nearer to him, I fired again, and saw the dust fly from the shoulder of his overcoat, though, as I afterwards discovered, the shot did not wound him. He then fired again; and spurring my horse towards him, I was within perhaps <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure> of him, and having my pistol levelled on him, was about to fire again, when he threw up his hand and surrendered to me, saying twice, <quote>I am your prisoner, sir; I am your prisoner!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7112"/>In getting within reach of him, my horse being very restive, had faced around in the other direction, thus bringing us side by side, with our horses' heads in the same direction, and he being on my left side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7113"/>While in this position, and with my left leg touching his right leg, I extended my hand and demanded his pistols.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7114"/>Instead, however, of giving them up, he dropped his bridle rein, and reaching over with his left hand, grabbed me in the collar, and, at the same time, without taking special aim, firing under his left arm, because of our being so near together, and with the muzzle of his pistol almost touching my cheek, fired at me again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7115"/>The discharge burned and blackened my face, and the flash for an instant blinded me, but <pb id="p.518" n="518"/>almost instinctively, and at the same moment, I grappled with him, and putting my pistol firmly against his temple, fired again.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7116"/>In the excitement caused by the unexpected shot in my face, I held on to <persName n="Halisey,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00518.06451" reg="nearbymention:Halisey,Dennis,J.,,"><surname>Halisey</surname></persName>'s body for a moment, though I saw the last shot was instantly fatal, and both horses being loose, moved side by side down into the pool of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7117"/>Here I released him to reach for the bridle of his horse, but missing this, <persName n="Halisey,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00518.06452" reg="nearbymention:Halisey,Dennis,J.,,"><surname>Halisey</surname></persName>'s lifeless body fell over against me and down between his horse and mine into the water, which was, perhaps, a foot or <measure n="18inches" type="distance">eighteen inches</measure> deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7118"/>In the fall, his head caught in my bridle rein, which was hanging loose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7119"/>This kept his head out of the water, but jerked my horse up and made him plunge around, dragging <persName n="Halisey,,,,," id="n0123.0085.00518.06453" reg="nearbymention:Halisey,Dennis,J.,,"><surname>Halisey</surname></persName>'s body through the pool, until we reached the other bank, where it became disentangled.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7130"/>In presenting to the <name>Society</name> our <num value="8" type="ordinal">Eighth</num> Report, your committee have reason to offer cordial congratulations on what has been accomplished in the past, and on the hopeful outlook for the future of which we have to tell.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7131"/>A year ago the <name>Society</name> was so burdened with an old debt, which <pb id="p.521" n="521"/>had <hi rend="italics">lapped over</hi> from <dateStruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></dateStruct>, and which had become very pressing, that it seemed a very serious question whether we could continue our work without risking the loss of out archives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7132"/>Now we have the pleasure of reporting that we have not only been able to continue the regular issue of our <hi rend="italics">Papers</hi>, and make our current receipts meet expenses, but that the generous aid of interested friends, and the sale of back volumes, has enabled us to liquidate nearly the whole of the old debt, and to make arrangements by which we confidently expect to be able to report on the <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="2">first</day></dateStruct> of next month, that we have not only paid the last dollar of our indebtedness, but have in our treasury the nucleus of a permanent endowment fund.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7133"/>We have not lost sight of the fact that a main object of our Society has been the</p> 
<div1 id="c.8.86.150" type="section" n="c.8.86.150"> 
<head>Collecting of material for the future historian,</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7134"/>and we have steadily prosecuted that object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7135"/>Our notices from time to time in our <hi rend="italics">Papers</hi>, and reports, and other Mss. which we have published have shown the great value of many accessions to our material which we have had. We do not hesitate to declare that our collection is now <num value="1">one</num> of the fullest, and most valuable in existence, and that in certain important directions our material is absolutely indispensable to any true history of the great <quote>War between the <name>States</name>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7136"/>This is coming to be appreciated more and more every year by historians both in this country, and in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and we are constantly giving most valuable help to seekers after the truth of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7138"/>A distinguished Federal soldier writing to the <rs>Secretary</rs> about this book says that <quote><persName n="Mangold,Major,,,," id="n0123.0087.00521.06465" reg="mostcommon:Mangold,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Mangold</surname></persName> had evidently had access to ample <hi rend="italics">Confederate</hi> material,</quote> and desires to know where the reports, etc., which he quotes can be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7139"/>The simple reply was: <quote><persName n="Mangold,Major,,,," id="n0123.0087.00521.06466" reg="mostcommon:Mangold,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Mangold</surname></persName> has been for several years in correspondence with our office and we have furnished him, as we are most happy to furnish <hi rend="italics">any</hi> seeker after truth, all of the material which he needed.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7140"/>But we have reason to know that there yet remains in the hands of individuals all through the country, most valuable material, and we appeal to them (and we beg our friends to appeal to them) to send to our office (as <hi rend="italics">a loan</hi> if they are not willing to donate it) <hi rend="italics">anything</hi> and <hi rend="italics">everything</hi> which can shed the slightest light on our grand history. </p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7142"/>We have been able to place these volumes in a large number of the great Libraries at the <rs>North</rs>, and find an increasing demand for them among army officers and others who take interest in historic matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7143"/>We believe that we now have the <name>Magazine</name> on a safe basis &mdash; that our receipts from it each year will meet the expense of publication &mdash; and it is certain that we do not mean to go in debt again, but will, if need be, suspend the publication whenever it ceases to pay expenses.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7144"/>And yet there are <num value="1000">thousands</num> of Confederates--many of them gallant and distinguished soldiers &mdash; all over the <rs>South</rs> who praise our work, but fail to send us the <measure n="3dollars" type="currency">$3</measure> per annum necessary to sustain it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7145"/>In the judgment of your committee the time has come when we should make a vigorous effort to secure a <hi rend="italics">permanent endownment</hi> which shall be safely invested, and only the interest on which shall be expended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7146"/>We do not argue here the necessity of this as we are sure that it commends itself to all who have given the subject a moment's consideration.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7147"/>To purchase books, documents, and manuscripts &mdash; to employ necessary clerical force to put in shape the vast material we have collected, and conduct properly the large correspondence of the office &mdash; to provide for the security of our archives and make them more accessible to those who desire to consult them &mdash; to provide more efficient means for collecting material now scattered all through the land &mdash; to be somewhat independent of the fluctuations of annual subscriptions and receipts &mdash; in a word, to put our Society on a footing somewhat akin to the great historical societies of the country, and to enable it to do efficiently its noble work &mdash; we <hi rend="italics">must</hi> have a permanent endowment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7148"/>Your committee have keenly felt this all along; but neither the circumstances of our people, nor the condition of the <name>Society</name> seemed to justify any very decided effort in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7149"/>Now, however, when fruitful seasons, plenteous harvests and returning prosperity have come to bless our Southern land, we feel that the time has come when <pb id="p.523" n="523"/>we may, with confidence, appeal to our friends to help us place our grand enterprise on a basis of permanency, so that our children may have the means of vindicating the truth of history after the actors in the great struggle shall have passed away.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7150"/>We really do not know how better some <num value="1">one</num> of large means could invest money for coming years and hand his name down to posterity as a public benefactor than by linking it with this effort to preserve the history of our people.
