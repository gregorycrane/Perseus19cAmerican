<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>It was erected many years ago, but is comparatively little known, and because of its location in a sparsely settled section, and of the contour of the hill on which it stands, is rarely seen by the numerous passers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>It is composed of quarried stone and boulders, with a single block of dressed granite at the top of the southern face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>This cap-stone is smoothly dressed on its face and top side, with <num value="3">three</num> circular projections of <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of an inch on the former, the central <num value="1">one</num> being slightly smaller than the other <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>In that paper I stated that I was firmly convinced that we have now all the records of the <rs type="place">Town of Medford</rs> that ever existed (<persName n="Brooks,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0024.00077.00804" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Ebenr,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName> and <persName n="Usher,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0024.00077.00805" reg="mostcommon:Usher,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Usher</surname></persName> to the contrary notwithstanding), and gave my reasons for this belief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>I find my contention ably seconded in the excellent article of <persName n="Hooper,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0024.00077.00806" reg="nearbymention:Hooper,John,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hooper</surname></persName>, in which he says, <q direct="unspecified">The loss of early town records, so often lamented, may be largely due to the fact that they never existed,</q> and this may well apply to the statement so often made relative to our own.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>Tonight I propose to talk about the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> volume of our records, which covers the period from <dateStruct value="1718-02-12"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg="12">12</day>, <year reg="1718">1718</year></dateStruct>, to <dateStruct value="1735-06-23"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="23">23</day>, <year reg="1735">1735</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>The paper is of the quality made <measure n="200years" type="date">two hundred years</measure> ago, substantial and strong, but roughly finished and evidently destitute of any wood pulp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>The ink used by the town clerks in writing the records was of a permanent character and would satisfy the present law relative to ink for official records.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>The entries are as clear and readable as if made within a day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>More than half of the pages of the book are used in the lists of the taxes levied for various purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>It was the custom whenever a town meeting was held and money <pb id="p.79" n="79"/> appropriated for any purpose, to order a tax levied to meet the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>If the minister's salary had to be provided, each person was assessed his relative share.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>If a school was to be kept, the expense must immediately be raised by a tax. So we find separate lists in the same year providing for a <q direct="unspecified">Province Tax,</q> a <q direct="unspecified">Town Rate</q> (levied semi-annually), a <q direct="unspecified">County Rate,</q> a rate for the <q direct="unspecified">Town Stock of ammunition,</q> a rate for money for a school, and a rate for the minister's salary every <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, making <num value="8">eight</num> tax bills per year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>It occurred to me, as I was looking over these lists, that if this custom should now prevail there might be more difficulty in collecting taxes even than there is now. These lists are divided into <num value="2">two</num> and frequently <num value="3">three</num> columns, at the top of which is written <q direct="unspecified">Heads,</q> <q direct="unspecified">Real,</q> <q direct="unspecified">Personal Estate,</q> and the amounts are entered in pounds, shillings and pence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> list in the book contains <num value="86">eighty-six</num> names and the last <num value="1">one</num> one <num value="118">hundred and eighteen</num> names, an increase of over <num value="0.37">thirty-seven per cent.</num> in <measure n="18years" type="date">eighteen years</measure>. This, of course, practically shows the percentage of increase in the population during the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>This book, as also the <num value="1">one</num> preceding and the <num value="1">one</num> immediately following, in which are entered similar lists of those assessed for taxes covering the years from <dateStruct value="1673--"><year reg="1673">1673</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1781--"><year reg="1781">1781</year></dateStruct>, inclusive, and containing <num value="1000">thousands</num> of names, have all been completely indexed by the card system, giving a reference to every name and to every place which appears in either volume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>These lists, you can readily see, practically give a census of the adult male inhabitants during those years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>Scattered through the book are entries of the finding of stray cattle of all kinds, which the law required should be recorded in the town records and a description of the animal found, entered therein.
