<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>While <orgName n="army"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0031.0003.00013.00003" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> lay in front of <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, he determined to send his cavalry on a raid to the enemy's rear, to destroy their railroad communication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>So, on <dateStruct value="1864-07-27"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="27">27th</day>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Stoneman,General,,,," id="n0031.0003.00013.00004" reg="mostcommon:Stoneman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stoneman</surname></persName> moved eastward to pass around the flank of the rebel army, and <persName n="McCook,General,Edward,,," id="n0031.0003.00013.00005" reg="default:McCook,Edward,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName n="Edward">Ed.</foreName> <surname>McCook</surname></persName>, at the same time, started to pass around the left. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/><orgName n="command"><persName n="McCook,,,,," id="n0031.0003.00013.00006" reg="nearbymention:McCook,Edward,,,"><surname>McCook</surname></persName>'s command</orgName> numbered about <num value="2000">2,000</num> men, well mounted and equipped, of which the writer was <num value="1">one</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>We all knew the nature of the mission on which we were sent, and felt that it was <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> difficult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>For it is not easy for <num value="2000">two thousand</num> men to go behind a hostile army of <num value="60000">sixty thousand</num>, and do any damage, andget back. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Early on that bright, hot <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> morning, the bugle called us into line &mdash; an inspection was made, and all lame horses or sick men ordered back to camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>We consoled those who had to stay behind with the promise that we would bring them a plug of tobacco when we came back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/><hi rend="italics">When we came back</hi>? We shall see. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Thus relieved of all that would encumber us, we moved out on the road and started westward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>We crossed the <rs>Chattahoochee</rs> at <placeName reg="Sandtown, Baldwin, Georgia" key="tgn,2642967">Sandtown</placeName>, and passed down on the west side about <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure> to the vicinity of Campbelltown, when the command was ordered to rest under cover of the woods, and scouts sent out to find a place at which to cross the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The different scouting parties returned with reports that all the fords and ferries were fortified and guarded by rebel infantry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>About midnight we again mounted, and under cover of the darkness, with no sound <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> but the tread of our horses on the sandy road, we crept down the river about <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> farther, to an old, deserted ferry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/><num value="2">Two</num> companies were stationed at this point, and they had a picket-post on our side of the river; <num value="4">four</num> men and an officer were on guard, but thinking the <name>Yanks</name> were far away they had set their guns against a tree, built a little fire to smoke off the mosquitoes, and were quietly snoozing when our scouts crept up, moved the guns from the tree, and then, with their own guns cocked and ready, waked up the pickets and told them to keep very quiet, as we wished to cross the river without disturbing any <num value="1">one</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We halted on the river bank, our pontoon wagons were ordered up, and we had <num value="2">two</num> boats made and launched in a few minutes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>For many of our readers, I will state that the pontoons taken by the cavalry on their raids were light frames that could be put together or taken apart in a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>When the frame or skeleton was put together, a cloth of thick canvas was <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> stretched over it, fastened at the corners, and it was ready to launch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The material for a boat <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure> long, <num value="6">six</num> wide, and <num value="2">two</num> deep, could be carried in a very small space. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/><num value="4">Four</num> companies crossed, and deployed along the east bank; the rest drew up in line on the west shore and waited for day. As soon as it was light enough, the troops on the east side surrounded the rebel camp, and they surrendered without firing a gun. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Preparations were at once begun for crossing the river, but it was almost noon before the entire command was across. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>From here the pontoon wagons were sent back under a guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Our prisoners were turned loose because we had no way of taking care of them, and we started rapidly across the country in search of the <orgName n="Atlanta and West Point Railroad" type="railroad">Atlanta &amp; West Point railroad</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>When we left the river, after seeing our bridge taken out on the other side, we recognized that we were no longer a part of the great army before <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, but a <orgName n="Detached Brigade" type="brigade">detached brigade</orgName> in the enemy's land, with <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> a powerful army between us and our campground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The news of the raid would spread like a prairie fire; we would be headed off, followed up, and harrassed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Our safety lay in rapid movement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>We traveled well that afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>At about <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time>, in the midst of a thunder shower, we came upon the railroad near the town of <placeName key="tgn,2020752" n="1.000 1" reg="palmetto, manatee, florida">Palmetto</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>We deployed a skirmish line and moved on the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>A company of rebel cavalry fired <num value="1">one</num> volley and fled, and we posted a heavy picket to prevent surprise, and went to work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The rain ceased by the time we were fairly at work, and the stars came out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>We tore down the telegraph wire, wound up <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile of it, and sunk it in a pond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>We tore up as much railroad track, made fires of the ties, and piled the rails on them, so as to heat and bend them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>There were <num value="0.5">a half</num>-dozen freight cars on the side track, and a large quantity of bacon in the depot, and <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> warehouses filled with baled cotton near the track.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>These were fired-and what a terrible <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> fire they made!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The whole town and surrounding country were lit up by the red glare. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The clouds overhead reflected the light and shone like red sunset.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The fire became so hot that no <num value="1">one</num> would pass along the street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It spread to adjacent buildings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The citizens were seen scampering in all directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Even women &mdash; some of them in their night clothes, with white, scared faces-flitted from alley to street and from street to alley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Palmetto at sunset knew that there was war in the land, but she lay down secure in the feeling that she had a grand army in front of her to defend her from invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Before <time value="12am">midnight</time> she realized that war-destructive, terrible, cruel &mdash; was in her midst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The next morning arose upon a blackened ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>It was the track of war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>A little before <time value="12am">midnight</time> our work was done, and we swept out of town toward the east.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Just east of town we passed a plantation where <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="300">three hundred</num> negroes, of all ages and sexes, were sitting on the fence watching the red glare of the burning <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The light was bright enough to make everything distinct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>As we rode by, <num value="1">one</num> old <quote>aunty</quote> raised her hands toward heaven and cried aloud, <quote><persName n="Lord,,Bress,,,de" id="n0031.0003.00019.00007" reg="expanded:Lord,Bress,,,"><foreName>Bress</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Lord</surname></persName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/></p> 
<p>At about <time value="3am">three o'clock A. M.</time>, we came upon a large park of army wagons; we were told that there were <num value="800">eight hundred</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>We took the mules, burned the wagons, and turned the drivers loose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>At about <time value="7oclock">seven o'clock</time> that morning we struck the <orgName n="Macon Railroad" type="railroad">Macon railroad</orgName> near <placeName reg="Lovejoy station">Lovejoy station</placeName>, where we expected to form a junction with <persName n="Stoneman,,,,," id="n0031.0003.00019.00009" reg="mostcommon:Stoneman,nomatch:0"><surname>Stoneman</surname></persName>, who had started around the other way. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>We treated this road like we did the other; captured and destroyed a train of cars, and sent out scouts in all directions to feel for <persName n="Stoneman,,,,," id="n0031.0003.00019.00010" reg="mostcommon:Stoneman,nomatch:0"><surname>Stoneman</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Some of our scouts came back to tell us that there was rebel cavalry near us. Some did not come back at all.

We feared <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> he was in trouble, or <quote>gone up,</quote> but we wanted some word. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>But as evidence multiplied that the <name>Johnnies</name> were thickening around us, we all became impatient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/><persName n="Croxton,,,,," id="n0031.0003.00020.00012" reg="mostcommon:Croxton,nomatch:0"><surname>Croxton</surname></persName> and <persName n="Brownlow,,,,," id="n0031.0003.00020.00013" reg="mostcommon:Brownlow,nomatch:0"><surname>Brownlow</surname></persName> were chafing like caged tigers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>They felt that waiting was fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>(I have always believed that <persName n="Croxton,,,,," id="n0031.0003.00020.00014" reg="mostcommon:Croxton,nomatch:0"><surname>Croxton</surname></persName> could have taken us out of the scrape.) But <persName n="McCook,,,,," id="n0031.0003.00020.00015" reg="nearbymention:McCook,Edward,,,"><surname>McCook</surname></persName> was loth to leave without <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> learning the fate of <persName n="Stoneman,,,,," id="n0031.0003.00020.00016" reg="mostcommon:Stoneman,nomatch:0"><surname>Stoneman</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>About <time value="2pm">two o'clock P. M.</time> he gave it up. By this time the rebs had surrounded us, and were just waiting to see how we would try to get out. We skirmished with them for an hour, feeling their line on the <name>west</name> and <name>south</name>, and losing <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> men killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>We then massed our forces, and charging up a ravine, broke their line and fled; and all that afternoon, and the night following, we had a running fight, they crowding our rear the whole time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Whenever they would get too close, <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> companies of our command would be deployed to skirmish with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>This would cause them to halt and form for <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> attack, and thus give us a little time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>True, these companies were often captured, but they were sacrificed to save the rest of the command. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Twice during the afternoon they pressed our rear so closely that we were obliged to deploy a skirmish line and show fight, in order to gain time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>But after dark, we rode on without hearing or seeing anything of our pursuers, and the hope that they had encamped for the night was struggling for a place in our minds; though, really, our knowledge of our pursuers (<orgName n="cavalry"><persName n="Wheeler,,,,," id="n0031.0004.00022.00017" reg="mostcommon:Wheeler,nomatch:0"><surname>Wheeler</surname></persName>'s cavalry</orgName>) gave us small room for hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/><pb id="p.23" n="23"/> </p> 
<p>The night was warm; there was no wind, and a haze crept up, till the only stars visible were those near the zenith. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>About midnight we came to a little river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>We approached it, coming down a sloping hillside for perhaps <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure>, through a scrubby growth of oak, known as oak barrens, which is common in many parts of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>The road had been changed about on this hillside till there were <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> parallel tracks and ditches running among the brush. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>A bridge of Southern style spanned this river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Let me describe it: <num value="3">Three</num> cribs, or pens of logs, 6x16 feet, and <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure> high: are placed about <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure> apart in the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>These are connected with each other and with the shore by <num value="4">four</num> round <quote>sleepers</quote> to each span.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The bridge is then floored with split slabs, or puncheons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The banks of the river were about as high as the cribs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>After crossing this bridge the road runs across a bottom of about <num value="50">fifty</num> or <measure n="60yards" type="distance">sixty yards</measure>, and then turns an oblique angle to the right, and keeps along the foot of the <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> hill for awhile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>A field fills up the bottom land between the road and the river, reaching down to the bridge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>When we came to this bridge, my company (C) was ordered to remain behind and guard it for half an hour, in order to let our stragglers get across, and then to bum it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>These stragglers were men whose horses had failed in the run of the <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> and nights since we started, till they couldn't keep up. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Our company flanked out, and as soon as the rest of the command filed past, we dismounted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Number fours took our horses up around the turn in the road, about <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile, and held them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>This left us <num value="46">forty-six</num> men to guard and burn the bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/><persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> B-was detailed to go to the top of the hill in the barrens, and stand picket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>The rest of us pulled down <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="15">fifteen</num> panels of railfence, and carried the rails onto the bridge for kindling, and built up a good fire on the ground to have plenty of brands to stick into it when the word should be given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/><pb id="p.25" n="25"/> </p> 
<p>The memory of that night forms a clear, distinct picture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>As our fire burned in the road, lighting up the bridge and shining against the trees, and throwing dark shadows on the muddy waters in the river, <num value="45">forty-five</num> men stood and looked each other in the face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Not a solitary straggler had come to the bridge since we stopped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>What did it mean?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>We stuck our fire among the rails and retreated to the bend in the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Just around the turn the road was washed out into a kind of ditch, and by lying down <pb id="p.26" n="26"/> in it, we had a full sweep of the bridge through the bottom crack of the railfence.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>They had crept up and formed in silence, and were pouring a deadly fire into the thicket that lined the south bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>In my last I gave you a <rs n="General Description" type="misc">general description</rs> of the <name>Andersonville</name> pen. The guard who took us from <placeName reg="East Point, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,2022774">East Point</placeName> to the prison were <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> soldiers-<orgName type="regiment" key="9TNInfantry">Ninth Tennessee Infantry</orgName>, I think.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>They were old soldiers, and they treated us well. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>I noticed while in the army, and have marked it since, that soldiers who were, <hi rend="italics">in the front</hi>, on either side, respect each other; while the post guards and others who are always in the rear of the real battle line, have a great contempt for the prowess of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/><pb id="p.41" n="41"/> </p> 
<p>When our train came to a stop at the <rs type="place">Andersonville depot</rs>, we saw about <num value="20">twenty</num> men, dressed in what had once passed for Confederate uniform, but so ragged and dirty as to be past recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>They were loading wagons, and occasionally <num value="1">one</num> of them passed close to the train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>They never looked at us, but as they passed close by they were repeating over and over, as though they would forget it, this song: <quote>If you have any money, hide it. If you have any valuables, hide them.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/></p> 
<p>We took it as a sign and acted on it. Some ripped a small hole and slipped money in the hem and collars of blouses, some in boots-every safe place you could think of. I had <num value="1">one</num> <num value="10">ten</num>-dollar bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>I folded it small, peeled off the outside leaf of a plug of <quote>Ole Verginny,</quote> wrapped it carefully around my bill, and laid it in my cheek.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>I didn't chew that quid very vigorously. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>As the rebs had to detail a guard of militia after we got there, we had ample time for all this hiding, and our <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> guards paid no attention to our efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/><pb id="p.42" n="42"/> </p> 
<p>About <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> the guard came and took us off the cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>They marched us through the rebel camp, and about half way between it and the pen, on a sloping plain of bright yellow sand, they halted us and opened us into single ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>After waiting awhile here, the sun roasting our heads and the sand stewing our feet, old <persName n="Wirtz,,,,," id="n0031.0006.00042.00034" reg="mostcommon:Wirtz,nomatch:0"><surname>Wirtz</surname></persName> came out with a squad of men to search us. This was my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> view of that notorious <persName n="Switzer,,,,," id="n0031.0006.00042.00035" reg="mostcommon:Switzer,nomatch:0"><surname>Switzer</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>He was dressed in a suit of white duck, with a Panama hat, and riding a white horse. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>He rode down our lines and cursed us for being raiders; then gave his commands so that all could hear: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> </p> 
<p>If any man stoops down, or sits down, or tries to hide anything, shoot him!</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/></p> 
<p>I would not write this last sentence if I thought there was anything profane about it; but after a few month's suffering in that horrid pen, I concluded the old <rs>Dutchman</rs> had not even used the hyperbole, but had simply stated a fact in strong language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/><pb id="p.43" n="43"/> </p> 
<p><num value="2">Two</num> large boxes were brought to put the plunder in, and the search was begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>They made us take off all our clothes and lay them out in front of us, and stand there naked while they searched them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>They turned all the pocket's, then felt all the seams and hems, and if they felt a lump, they would throw that garment on their pile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>They took and kept all watches, rings, knives, money, pipes, and even pictures of wives and sweethearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/><num value="1">One</num> boy tried to make out that he could not get his ring off. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/><quote>If the ring no come off, <hi rend="italics">take te finger</hi>,</quote> said <persName n="Wirtz,,,,," id="n0031.0006.00043.00036" reg="mostcommon:Wirtz,nomatch:0"><surname>Wirtz</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>After they were satisfied with their examination, they would throw back such garments as they allowed us to have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>If we had any extras about our clothes they kept them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>I went through and retained shirt, blouse and pants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>My blouse and pants were pretty good, my shirt was well worn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>They kept my boots, but allowed me the hat I received from the <rs>Texan</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>I learned afterwards that they did not always strip prisoners quite so closely as they <pb id="p.44" n="44"/> did us. A whole brigade, captured at <placeName reg="Plymouth, Washington, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076159">Plymouth, N. C.</placeName>, and called by the other prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/><quote><placeName reg="Plymouth, Washington, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076159">Plymouth</placeName> pilgrims,</quote> came into the pen with their blankets and overcoats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>Their good luck was exceptional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>The Western troops were stripped worse than the <rs>Eastern</rs>, and cavalry worse than infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Their excuse for this was that the <rs>Western</rs> cavalry was always raiding and destroying their property. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>After being searched, we were taken to the north gate; a door was opened in the gate-pen (a kind of ante-room, <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure> square), and <num value="90">ninety</num> men were crowded into it. The door was then closed, and another door was opened into the prison, and we were counted again as we passed through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Then a new <num value="90">ninety</num> were let in and counted through, and so on to the end. I never knew why they kept us in nineties, but they did. Each <num value="90">ninety</num> was counted every day, and we drew rations from that count. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>Thus we entered <placeName reg="Andersonville prison">Andersonville prison</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Remember it was about <num value="36">thirty-six</num> by <num value="50">fifty</num> rods, containing about <measure n="11acres" type="area">eleven acres</measure>, with a <pb id="p.45" n="45"/> wall <measure n="12feet" type="distance">twelve feet</measure> high around it, and a little brook running through it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>About <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure> from the wall, ran a row of stakes with a slender rail tacked on them; this was the <quote>dead line.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>In some places the rail had been knocked off, and only the stakes marked the boundary between life and death; for if any <num value="1">one</num> crossed the line, he was shot without warning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>This leads me to make a remark on the <quote>dead-lines,</quote> which were common to all Southern prisons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>Sometimes this line was as at <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName>, within a stockade, and the guard were stationed upon the wall upon the alert to pick off any unfortunate who was so incautious as to step over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>In some cases the prisons were temporary, and had not even a stockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>A rope was drawn; and if any prisoner, for the sake of wood, water, or any other cause, stepped beyond it, an instantaneous shot warned all others to beware of his untimely fate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>When our command got in, there were <hi rend="italics"><num value="33000">thirty-three thousand</num> men in that pen</hi>! Can you realize that fact?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>Take the entire population of <num value="2">two</num> average counties in <placeName reg="Iowa, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007253">Iowa</placeName> <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> or <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, and crowd them onto <measure n="11acres" type="area">eleven acres</measure>, and you have not enough then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Reduce it, and you find that you have about <num value="18">eighteen</num> men to the square rod, Some of these men had a little shelter of their own providing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>Some took <num value="2">two</num> sticks about <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure> long, stuck them in the ground about <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> apart, fixed a little pole from <num value="1">one</num> to the other, fastened <num value="1">one</num> edge of a blanket to the pole, and, drawing the other edge back till it was straight, piled sand enough on it to hold it, or took wooden pins and pinned it to the ground. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>Such a tent, or shade, answered for <num value="4">four</num> men. I have known <num value="6">six</num> to occupy <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Of course they could not all lie down under it, but they could all squat under it to keep off the sunshine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>If a party had no blanket, they could sometimes make a substitute by ripping up pants, shirts, jackets, etc., and sewing them together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>These garments were obtained by stripping the dead. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>If a man had money, he could buy sacks (made of strong, coarse cotton cloth) of the quartermaster who issued our rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>At the time of our capture, sacks <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> <pb id="p.48" n="48"/> wide and <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> long cost <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">two dollars</measure> each in greenbacks, or <num value="8">eight</num> in confed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Thread to sew with was obtained by raveling out a piece of sack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>Sometimes we drew rations in these sacks, and could keep them until ration time the next day. When this was the case, we were bound to return the sack or lose our next ration; but we could cut off the bottom of it <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3inches" type="distance">three inches</measure> and not be detected, if we sewed it up as it had been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>These strips furnished thread for the <num value="90">ninety</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>About <measure n="200" type="prisoners">two hundred prisoners</measure> were tailed outside, on parole, to help handle rations, to cook, and to dig trenches to bury in, etc. It was they who warned us to hide our money at the depot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>They slept in the gate, or ante-room, of nights-at least part of them did. Through them we obtained the stakes and poles to put up our meager tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>When the inside door would be opened of a morning, they would pitch them in beyond the dead-line to their friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>If you had no friend out on parole, the set, <num value="2">two</num> stakes <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure> long, and a pole <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> long, would cost you <measure n="50cents" type="currency">fifty cents</measure>. <pb id="p.49" n="49"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>The <quote><placeName reg="Plymouth, Washington, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076159">Plymouth</placeName> pilgrims</quote> nearly all had blanket tents, such as I have described, and a good many others had something that would at least partly keep the sun off; but the majority of that vast crowd had no shelter of any kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>They entered there stripped and robbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>The dew beaded their hair and beard at night, and they sweltered under that burning sun, and groveled in that roasting sand by day. <hi rend="italics">What had they done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>Answered their country's call, and followed its flag</hi>. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>All the space was claimed and occupied before we got there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>Just imagine <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of those half-faced tents on every square rod, and <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> men without shelter claiming room on the same. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Some <num value="1">one</num> claimed every foot.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/><num value="4">Four</num> of us determined to stick together, and after hunting <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> we found a place <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> square, about the <pb id="p.51" n="51"/> middle of the south side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/><num value="5">Five</num> men had owned it, but <num value="3">three</num> were dead, and the other <num value="2">two</num> were willing to vacate for a small consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>We bought <measure n="3sacks" type="mass">three sacks</measure> and made us a shelter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>It took a week to get used to the horrid place. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>During this crowded period we drew cooked rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Our bread was made of unsifted meal and water, without salt, or anything to lighten it; baked in large sheets about <measure n="2inches" type="distance">two inches</measure> thick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>When cut up into single rations, each man received a piece about <measure n="6squareinches" type="area"><measure n="2feet" type="distance">two</measure> by <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three inches</measure></measure>, and as thick as the sheet or loaf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>In addition to this, we received about half a pint of cooked beans or peas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>They were raised in the <rs>South</rs> to feed slaves, and were called the <quote>nigger peas,</quote> but I think they are really a species of coarse black bean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>There is <num value="1">one</num> thing in favor of the <quote>Pea</quote> theory, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>They were almost invariably full of bugs, and as issued to us, the bugs were the only seasoning they had. Once in a while a small ration of rice was given in place of the beans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>About twice a week we received a small ration of meat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>If pork, about <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.52" n="52"/> <pb id="p.53" n="53"/> ounce per man; if beef, about <num value="2">two</num> ounces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Sometimes in place of the meat, we drew about <num value="2">two</num> spoonfuls of molasses per man. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>We drew our rations from <num value="2">two</num> to <time value="3pm">three o'clock P. M.</time> Whatever we got we ate at once, and then fasted until that hour the next day. We were hungry all the time:even just after we had eaten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>This hunger colored our conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Drop into a group of talkers, and you would hear some <num value="1">one</num> describing a feast he had enjoyed; or drawing on his imagination for <num value="1">one</num> he intended to order, if he ever got out alive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/><num value="1">One</num> poor boy who lay near us would wind up every such talk with: <quote>Fried pork, sausage, and pancakes is good enough for me.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Even in our sleep we were not free; but our rest was full of dreams of loaded tables, with always something to prevent us from partaking of their viands, till we would wake up. Like the old toper who dreamed he had a pint of whisky, and thought to make a hot punch, but while his water was heating he woke up. He turned over, smacked his lips, and remarked: <quote>What a fool I was not to drink that cold!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/><pb id="p.54" n="54"/> </p> 
<p>At least <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of the men were sick, Half of them had diarrhea, and our coarse rations aggravated the disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>Among the older prisoners scurvy was common.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>About <num value="5000">five thousand</num> men were past helping themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>They were lying all over the pen, many of them half naked, under a burning sun, and stinking in their filth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>They could not help it, poor boys; and we could do nothing for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>We had no means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>The whole camp literally swarmed with vermin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>The sand was full of fleas, all alive with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>Lice crawled every-where.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>Flies swarmed in myriads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Blow-flies were upon the helpless, the dying and the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>When the sun went down mosquitoes came in clouds from the swamps below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/><num value="1">One</num> mercy amid this woe was that soon after a man became too weak to help himself he generally became unconscious. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>As soon as a man was dead he was carried to the south gate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> they had a shed made of brush outside of the stockade, and the dead were carried out there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>But <num value="1">one</num> day an old scurvy skeleton <hi rend="italics">played</hi> dead, and was carried out and laid with the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/><pb id="p.55" n="55"/> He watched his chance and tried to crawl off and escape, but was caught and brought back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>After that there was no more carrying outside, but we piled them up by the dead-line at the south gate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>We had a rule that whoever carried out a corpse should have what was on it. That looks bad, but it was all the chance to keep the living from going naked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>The average mortality during <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> was <num value="130">one hundred and thirty</num> per day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Every forenoon lay at the south gate that <num value="130">hundred and thirty</num> naked, haggard, and horribly discolored bodies, putrifying in the sun. It was a sight to sicken the stoutest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>About <num value="10">ten</num> or <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time> they would come in with a wagon and pile those corpses into it, like cord-wood, and haul them to the old red field, where they were laid side by side in a long trench.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>After <time value="12pm">noon</time> that same wagon would bring in our rations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>The little brook flowed with a gentle current <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure> wide and <measure n="4inches" type="distance">four inches</measure> deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Just below the dead-line, where it entered, we had a place scraped out <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure> wide, by <num value="20">twenty</num> long, and nearly <num value="2">two</num> <pb id="p.56" n="56"/> deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>We kept that pool as clean as we could, to drink from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>It was not clean even then, as the filth of the town and rebel camp washed into it from above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Below this were a number of circular pools <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="12feet" type="distance">twelve feet</measure> in diameter, and <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> deep in the center, to wash in. There was always a crowd about these pools, from early morning till late at night; and yet I believe half the men in that pen never washed at all. So many were discouraged by their afflictions, and losing all hope, lost decency and self-respect with it, and laid down in their filth and died. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>Near the brook, on each side, were a good many holes, or shallow wells, dug down to its level.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>The water in these, being filtered through the sand, was thought to be purer than the brook water, though none of it was good. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Below the wash pools, which did not extend half way down, this little brook became the privy sink for the whole camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>I have studied for a week how I might write a description of our sufferings and leave this out; but my chapter of horrors would <pb id="p.57" n="57"/> not be complete without it. <num value="30000">Thirty thousand</num> men, most of them sick, had to use about <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure> of this branch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>Gradually the filth clogged up the opening in the stockade, making a dam. As filth accumulated it rose and spread out over the banks, until it became <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure> deep-spread <measure n="40feet" type="distance">forty feet</measure> wide, and backed up the stream <num value="75">seventy-five</num> yardsmak-ing in our midst a lake, the horror of which made other troubles seem light by comparison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>It was worked over and over by masses of great, slimy maggots an inch long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>The sun pouring his heat into it all day generating poisonous gases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>At night the damp air was loaded with a stench that cried to heaven for vengeance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>It became so poisonous that if any <num value="1">one</num> having a sore, if only a mosquito bite, should by accident step into the nasty mass, it would cause gangrene. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>I have seen men, weak and sick, stagger down to that place during the hot part of the day. The foul odors and the heat would overcome them, and they would faint and fall into the reeking mass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>Some <num value="1">one</num> would <pb id="p.58" n="58"/> drag them out onto the dry ground, and they would lie there and die in the filth, those great slimy maggots crawling over them, even in their nostrils and mouths before they were dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>I saw <num value="5">five</num> men die thus in <num value="1">one</num> day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>If I alone knew these things I would be afraid to tell them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>They would be hard to believe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>But the survivors of that prison are scattered all over the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/></p> 
<p>For a while we could hold interesting chats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>But we soon wore out all the interesting incidents of our lives, exhausted our supply of anecdotes and stories; and were left with nothing to talk of, except to describe different dishes of food that we wanted, or to curse the rebels for their treatment, and to grumble at our Government for not exchanging us. These were standard themes; they could be repeated, in the same words, every day in the month, and <pb id="p.60" n="60"/> every hour in the day, and always be interesting. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>Among all those crowds a good laugh was seldom heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>Our gayest, jolliest soldiers soon became gloomy and silent; and wit and humor took on the morbid form of saying grotesque and horrid things about our misfortunes. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>The study of human nature there would fill with sadness any who love the race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>The best elements seemed to die, and the worst held high carnival in our souls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>Men were brutal, selfish, cross and mean to each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>The strongest struggled for life, and the weak died without pity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>A dying man might ask a dozen for a drink before he would find <num value="1">one</num> to bring it to him, unless he had comrades who had known him before he got into the pen. Of course there were a few exceptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Too few. Yet these men were not Modocs, nor Australian bushmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>Some of them belonged to the rough classes, but many were refined, cultivated gentlemen, the light of the social circle, the pride of an enlightened home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>But they were treated by their foes worse than brutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>Time dragged heavily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>We marked out a place on the ground for a board, and made our set of men by notching sticks so that we would know them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>There were church privileges for those who wanted them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>They sang old-fashioned hymns, like <quote>O thou fount,</quote> or <quote>Rock of ages,</quote> --hymns that are as much a part of our civilization as the steam engine is.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>About <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="15">fifteen</num> took active part, but they usually had a large audience of respectful listeners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>I used to frequently attend as a listener.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>There was no attempt to preach any doctrine except faith in <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>The Scripture lessons were usually from Psalms, and some of <persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName>'s prayers for his enemies sounded so much like cursing the rebels that even the carnal-minded could say <quote>Amen.</quote>

<p>While writing of the religious exercises, I will not omit the ministry of a Catholic priest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>He visited the prison regularly, giving the consolations of his church to the sick, shriving the dying, and sprinkling holy water on the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/></p> 
<p>About the last of the month (I had no way to keep dates and can't remember them exactly), it came up suddenly, about midday, accompanied by vivid lightning and loud thunder, and a rain-fall such as is called the bursting of a water-spout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>With the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> dash, we were drenched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>In a few minutes the ground was covered with water, and great streams were rushing down the hillsides, washing deep gullies <pb id="p.64" n="64"/> <pb id="p.65" n="65"/> through our beds, and in other places almost burying the helpless in sand and water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>And still it rained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>The lightning seemed to dance over the ground, and the thunder roared like a park of artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>The brook began to raise, and was soon too large to get through the vents made for it in the stockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>It dammed up at both walls till it almost reached the top.

When it struck the lower wall, it, too, fell with a crash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>A <num value="100">hundred</num> brave men rushed into the boiling flood to ride out on it. A shell from the battery fizzed over our heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>The long roll sounded, and the whole guard rushed to the openings, and stood in the rain along that rushing stream with fixed bayonets, to keep us in. The storm finally spent itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>Clouds rolled away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>The sun came out. The angry waters subsided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>The rebs went to work to repair the walls. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/><quote>What of it?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>That reeking, pestilential lake of filth, that I described in the last chapter, was gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>The stream had formed a new channel for itself, and the rest of it was washed out to the very bottom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>The whole camp was washed; the sand next day looked bright and clean every-where.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>But that was not all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>Between the dead-line and the stockade, and about half-way between the north gate and the brook, there was a <hi rend="italics">spring</hi>. It was noticed soon after the storm by some of the boys who lay near by; but they, knowing the ground had always been dry there, thought it was a kind of wet-weather spout, started into life by the big rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>But after a few days, seeing it did not abate, they tied their cups to a tent-pole, and reaching over the dead-line, clipped and drank, and called it the best water in the pen. Others fixed dippers, and soon there was a goodly number there all the time, for a drink of the bright, pure water. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>At last some <num value="1">one</num> showed it to the <rs>Quartermaster</rs> who issued our rations, and interested him in the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>He gave us boards and nails to make a <quote>V</quote> trough, <pb id="p.67" n="67"/> which we fixed in the spring, and brought the water inside the dead-line. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>We received very little reliable news from the outside world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>When a squad of new prisoners were brought in they gave us the latest and most reliable news from the department of the army to which they belonged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>If the rebels won a victory anywhere, the <rs>Quartermaster</rs> would bring in a paper at ration time, and read us the account of it, and make us feel as bad as he could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>The effect of these reports on the prisoners gave me a chance to study human nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>If he read a report of rebel success in the <rs>East</rs>, the prisoners from the army of <pb id="p.69" n="69"/> the <rs>Potomac</rs> were filled with blues and despondency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/></p> 
<p>I think the reason for this was that the <rs>Eastern</rs> army had been whipped so often that they had learned to expect it; while in <orgName n="army"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0031.0009.00069.00040" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, <quote>to fight</quote> and <quote>to whip</quote> were synonymous. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>As soon as I felt solid ground beneath my feet, and realized that I was not seriously hurt &mdash; the guard were all in confusion and out of place &mdash; the thought came to me like an inspiration, <quote>Now is the time to escape!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/></p> 
<p>I started on the impulse, almost without thinking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>I rushed past the engine into the darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>I must have run <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure>; I knew I was outside the guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>The moans of the dying and shrieks of the wounded sounded a good distance off. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>He may be killed or crippled in the wreck.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>I hesitated-stopped short.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>I was not willing to go on without Jess, or at <pb id="p.75" n="75"/> least a knowledge of his fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>I ran back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>Men were getting out of all the cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>I reached ours, and called.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/></p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>I was excited, nervous, vexed, impatient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>I felt like every minute was worth a lifetime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>Jess was trying to get hold of the meat that had not been divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>That was what he was doing under the car when I came up. He seemed so indifferent, that I said to him: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>He went under the car and soon returned with a good piece of bacon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>I took it and started.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>But alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>while I dallied with Jess, the guard recovered from its panic, and had formed a line around the wreck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>Just below the engine I was halted and ordered back. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>My disappointment was hard to bear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>Oh, how I wished that I had kept on when I was free, and had left Jess to his fate! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>I went back to the wreck, and went to work with all my might to help rescue the maimed and dead from the debris.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>We did not get all the dead out till daylight next morning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>A construction train came down next morning, unloaded its gang of men, took up the wounded, and returned to <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>It returned about noon, and after getting the debris out of the way, and getting all the cars that could be run on the track, they took us back to the pen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/><num value="1">One</num> of the smashed cars was covered with <pb id="p.78" n="78"/> a tin roof, of which I secured a piece about 20x24 inches, and after getting into prison, I made me a nice pan, by turning up about <measure n="4inches" type="distance">four inches</measure> all around.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>It proved to be a very valuable piece of property after we began to draw our rations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>When the train came back after taking the wounded, they brought the bloodhounds and took a circuit around the wreck before we left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>This gave Jess the exquisite happiness of saying, <quote><hi rend="italics">I told you so</hi>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/></p> 
<p>Of course, in such a crowd, there were always men studying plans of escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>When the camp was new, and only <num value="1">one</num> stockade stood between the prisoner and freedom, there were many attempts to tunnel out. To do this required much caution and labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>A well was dug about <num value="8">eight</num> or <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure> deep, and from the bottom of this a tunnel was run horizontally to pass under the wall, and then rise to the surface.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>The work had to be done by night, and the hole kept hid by day. The best tools that we could obtain were a case-knife and half of an unsoldered canteen for digging, and a haversack to carry out the dirt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>A good substitute for <pb id="p.79" n="79"/> the haversack, and <num value="1">one</num> often used, was a pants-leg tied up at <num value="1">one</num> end. To prevent caving in, the hole was made as small as possible &mdash; I think about <measure n="20inches" type="distance">twenty inches</measure> in diameter, just large enough for a man to crawl through. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>After a tunnel was well under way, a man with such an outfit, with <num value="2">two</num> strings to his sack as long as the tunnel, would, by feet and elbows, work his way to the end of the hole, pick the dirt loose with his knife, and with the half canteen scrape it into the sack; then a comrade at the mouth would pull the sack along by <num value="1">one</num> string, he keeping the end of the other to pull it back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/><num value="0.33">A <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> man would take the dirt away in another sack, pants-leg or blouse-sleeve, and scatter it where it would not be noticed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>A man could hardly get his breath in the tunnel; and owing to the sandy nature of the ground, there was always danger of caving in. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>It was hard to keep it secret, for there were men in the pen mean enough to tell the rebels of any such attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>There was <pb id="p.80" n="80"/> a fellow (he died at <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>) who wore a large <quote>T</quote> on his forehead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>He informed on a tunnel company when they were nearly through, and they made the <quote>T</quote> with a hot railroad spike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>After that, when a sneak reported on his fellow-prisoners, the rebs took him out of the pen, and we saw him no more. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>If all these dangers and difficulties were surmounted, and the tunnel was opened, the rebs would find the hole the next day, and start the bloodhounds from it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>Oh, those hounds!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>How we dreaded them!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>Let the beast's once catch the scent of a poor fugitive, and he was <quote>gone up.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/></p> 
<p>After the outer stockade was built, it greatly increased the difficulty of tunneling, as it would require a length of about <measure n="225feet" type="distance">two hundred and twenty-five feet</measure> to safely pass under both walls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>Still there were men desperate enough to attempt it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/><num value="1">One</num> company, after weeks of toil and danger, on a rainy night in <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, opened their hole, and crawled to the outer world.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>The gang of Johnnies that came every morning to count the nineties, found the deficit and reported it. We were notified from headquarters that we would get no rations till those men were found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>We did not believe it; we thought it was done to scare us. We only got <num value="1">one</num> scanty little feed each day anyhow, and we didn't think we could live if we missed that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>As the hour when they fed us drew near, <num value="1000">thousands</num> of hungry men watched the gate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>The hour passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>What terrible suspense as the next hour dragged along!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>Slowly the sun went down behind the dark pines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>I thought I would try to describe our feelings as that day went out; but I can't. I shall not try it. I have no words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>I give you the bare fact-<num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> men, already in a starving condition, fasted <measure n="48hours" type="date">forty-eight hours</measure> to gratify the malice of those officers, because <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num> men had outwitted them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>The next day they were brought back, <pb id="p.82" n="82"/> some of them badly torn and mangled by the bloodhounds. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>There were some other plans of escape tried, but they were almost invariably failures, and are not worth mention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>I did refer to <num value="1">one</num>--the man who was taken out as dead. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>There was a drummer boy, whose smooth face and childish voice called for sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>He was rapidly wasting away, and his friends were anxious to save him. The beans were brought in barrels, which were set on the ground to be emptied, and the empty barrels taken out in the last wagon that came in. <num value="1">One</num> day a barrel was turned over on its side to scrape out all the beans; the boy squatted at its mouth, and when the <rs>Quartermaster</rs>'s back was turned, it was turned bottom-upward over him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>The boy got out all right, but was caught and brought back next day. He didn't last long after that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>That time we knew that he would never be sent back. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>My experience the night of the wreck set me thinking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>I knew it was next to impossible to get away from the pen. But they would probably ship more prisoners away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>Could a man jump from a train and escape?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>I believed it could be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>That thought once in my mind, stayed there. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>I hunted up several men who, at sundry times and in divers manners had tried to reach our lines and failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>From them I learned of the dangers to be encountered after getting out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>The South lived in a constant dread of a slave insurrection, and to guard against it the whole country was kept under vigilant surveillance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>If a stranger was seen, he was at once arrested, and made to account for himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>At night the roads were all patrolled by mounted provost guards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>A man to be safe, would have to keep well hid by day, and keep away from all traveled roads at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>To travel <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="500miles" type="distance">five hundred miles</measure> and comply with these conditions is a bigger <pb id="p.84" n="84"/> job than it looks to be till you have worked at it for a week or <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>The question of subsistence makes the problem still harder. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>After getting all the knowledge and hints I could, I told Cudge S., and asked him to go with me. He would not risk it. I tried Tom B. He heard my plan, and gave me his hand on it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>Our plan was to be taken out, if possible, so as to leave in the evening, so that night would be on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> part of the road; to jump off at some point before we reached <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName>; then to travel northwest until we reached the <rs>Chattahoochee</rs>, and reached the high mountainous divide between it and the waters of the <rs>Tombigbee</rs>; thence north till we would reach our lines, somewhere between Big Shanty and <placeName key="tgn,2024046" n="1.000 167" reg="resaca, gordon, georgia">Resaca</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>The guard had braced himself against <num value="1">one</num> side of the open door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>There were no lights on the train except on the engine and caboose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>All the rest was dark as any other freight train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/><persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> and I worked ourselves over close to the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>We stood and looked out at the star-light night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>We tried to seem indifferent, and growled for room, like the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>But I felt strangely depressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>Some demon of cowardice would keep whispering to me: <quote>You will probably dash your brains out; or you will be seen by the guard and shot to death; or may be you will only break a few bones, so you can't get away, and you will linger and die a cripple, and your friends will never know what has become of you.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/></p> 
<p>These dark probabilities would keep presenting themselves, and I had to fight them back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>Finally we sat down in the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>We put our feet out-then drew them in, and squatted there; then hung them out again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>We talked of many things to those next to us; but all the time we <hi rend="italics">thought</hi> of only <num value="1">one</num> thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>We were sitting side by side on the floor, with our feet hanging out at the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/><pb id="p.87" n="87"/> The guard saw us, but paid no attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>He doubtless thought we had more sense than to jump off a running train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>We ran into a cut <num value="12">twelve</num> or <measure n="15feet" type="distance">fifteen feet</measure> deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>It was dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>I nudged <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>. He nodded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>I put my hands on the edge of the floor and dropped off. I struck in the ditch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>The motion of the train hurled me violently against the ground, but it was soft mud and water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>I lay very still till the train went by. When it got <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure> up the road I got up. I was not hurt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>All those presentiments of danger had miscarried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>My feelings arose accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>I was sure now that I would reach our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>I walked along the railroad in the direction the train had gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/><persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> was about <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> from where I fell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>I asked why he didn't jump out sooner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>He said the train seemed to him to go faster after I jumped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>He fell on harder ground, and had bruised his shoulder. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>We climbed out of the cut, sat on the fence, and looked at the north starthat friend universal of wandering man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>I was barefooted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>We each had a blouse and pants in tolerable preservation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>Our shirts were worn out. We had no baggage, no tools &mdash; not even a pocket-knife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/><hi rend="italics">We were outlaws</hi>. Not a crime in the catalogue would so surely alienate us from everybody and debar us from sympathy, as the fact that we were U. S. soldiers in Dixie. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>We jumped off the fence and started.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>Our hearts were stout, if our legs were a little shaky.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>We traveled across corn and cotton fields till gray light streaked the eastern horizon, then entered a thicket, and as it grew light we worked our way into it. It proved to be a large cypress swamp, surrounded by a dense thicket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>By the edge of the oozy swamp we broke off twigs and branches of trees, and made us a bed, and as the sun mounted up the sky, we stretched our weary limbs and slept. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>We agreed to watch and sleep by turns; but I think the watcher slept as soundly as the sleeper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>The <num value="1">one</num> thing we dreaded was <pb id="p.89" n="89"/> the possibility of prowling hounds tracking us up and calling attention to us by their bark; but here we felt safe, for on a log, not more than <measure n="50feet" type="distance">fifty feet</measure> away in the swamp, lay an alligator about <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure> long, and we knew no hound would care to hunt along the shore of that swamp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>The reptile lay there for <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> about the middle of the day, and we regarded him as a friend, although we did not desire any closer intimacy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>In the afternoon we ate <num value="1">one</num> ration of our bread, and before the sun went down we worked our way through the jungle to its northwest end; from which, as soon as it grew dark, we again set forth on our journey, crossing, fields, woods, roads and streams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>We traveled quietly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>When we came onto a road, we stopped, listened, and if we heard no sound we crossed it quickly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>During this <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> night we came onto a field of sweet potatoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>We did not make many miles headway that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>We came across a tree full of ripe persimmons, and ate a large mess There is a good deal of food in this fruit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>While we were making efforts to flank the swamp, the sky was overcast with clouds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>It became so dark that we could not see at all, so we were compelled to stop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>We felt around in the dark and ran against a large tree, at the root of which we reclined and waited for day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>As the darkness began to turn to a leaden gray, it began to rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>Slowly and in small drops at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, but soon gaining till it rained hard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>All the leaves were dripping, and we were soaked and chilled in a short time; <pb id="p.93" n="93"/> and yet the rain showed no sign of quitting. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>We took the blues and grumbled, murmured and were on the point of quarreling with each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>Everything was wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>We had not found a thing to eat all nighthad no hope of finding anything in that jungle; and if the rain and clouds continued we could not leave it the coming night, for we would have no guide for our course unless the sun or stars should appear, and by the next morning we would probably be too weak to walk. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>When <persName><foreName>Elijah</foreName></persName> ran into the wilderness to escape the idolatrous <rs>Jezebel</rs>, he took the blues, and thought, he had better be dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>Instead of reasoning with him, <hi rend="italics"><name n="God" type="God">God</name> fed him</hi>. And while <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> and I sat dripping, chilled and empty in that swamp, I think our despondency belonged more to our physical than to our mental condition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>As we reclined at the root of the tree, a large green frog came hopping through the wet leaves and moss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>We did not philosophize and draw a lesson from his progress, as the <rs>Tartar</rs> chieftain did from the ant; <pb id="p.94" n="94"/> neither did we draw the <rs>Christian</rs>'s lesson of trust, that if <name n="God" type="God">God</name> feeds the frog in the jungle, he will care for us. But <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> said, <quote>let's have him,</quote> and falling his length, covered the reptile with his broad palm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>To divide him with our thumb nails was the work of an instant; to eat him took but a minute more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>There were no fragments to be taken up after the meal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/><num value="1">One</num> frog could not satisfy our appetite, but it stopped the gnawing of the stomach and the ringing in the head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>We liked it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>The rain ceased, and after <time value="12pm">noon</time> the sun appeared occasionally through the clouds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>We flanked the swamp, waded a wide, sluggish creek, waist deep, and worked through a canebrake before night. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>We came to a cornfield, and about sundown we climbed the fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>The corn had been gathered, but we searched till we found <num value="1">one</num> ear that had been missed, which we ate. We found some dry beans also among the cornstalks, and ate a few of them, but they were not palatable in their new state: and, as we had no means to cook them, we ate but few. <pb id="p.95" n="95"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>We crossed corn and cotton fields that night, following the rows to keep from being turned from our course, as the stars did not show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>We estimated the distance across these fields at <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure>. The country was level, and the fields were muddy from the rain; so, by the time we had crossed them and run into a canebrake on the west side, we were tired enough to lie down. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>The next morning was foggy, and stands out in memory as eminently <hi rend="italics">the</hi> morning that we fought gallinippers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>That pest of the swamp seemed determined to take what little blood we had, and we fought to save it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>After a while the fog floated off, and the sun shone brightly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>We picked a place and lay in the sun till we dried our clothes, which had been wet for <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>On the other side of this canebrake was a cornfield, in which we found <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> ears, and ate a good mess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>We followed the cane to where it merged into a thicket, in which we found wild grapes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>This thicket was in a narrow slough running between <pb id="p.96" n="96"/> cleared fields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>It was not more than <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> wide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>While we were gathering the grapes we heard a gun not very far away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>We crept into the thickest bushes near, and lay flat on the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>Soon a man, carrying a gun, passed along the edge of the field, not more than <measure n="20yards" type="distance">twenty yards</measure> from us. He was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> human being we had seen since we left the train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>The sight made us nervous for awhile; but after hearing <num value="2">two</num> shots a good distance up the thicket, and waiting awhile, we crept out and continued our journey down the slough. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>Traveling in a thicket is slow work,creeping under, climbing over, crowding through the vine-tied bushes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>But we kept at it till all at once we stood on the bank of a broad, smooth-flowing river. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>What river is it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>We ransacked our meager knowledge of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> geography.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>We started up stream under cover of this growth, hunting for driftwood to build a raft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>We found a little path, and followed it till it turned down the bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>We kept on our course by night, and hid by day. When we could find nothing to eat in the fields, we were forced to try at negro cabins to beg of their scanty fare. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>We spent the <num value="14" type="ordinal">fourteenth</num> day of our pilgrimage in a little thicket on the border of a large plantation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>It was not a swamp, but a patch of briars and brambles allowed to grow along the fence, because of the slovenly method of farming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>We felt uneasy on account of the insecurity of our hiding-place, and did not dare to move about in search of food, lest we expose ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>We wanted him to go and bring us out something, but he refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>There it was, and we could get it ourselves if we wanted it. We sat down in the dark shadow of the fence, and quietly discussed the chances of starving or getting food elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>It was several miles to another plantation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>We decided that this was our best chance; and cautiously approached and silently entered the kitchen.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>From the night that we jumped off the cars till we, all damp with the night's dews, crept into this thicket, our hope had grown higher and higher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>I raised up and sat erect, all attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>Yes, I could hear it better now. Every nerve was strained to listen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>The blood seemed to all rush into my heart-my heart into my throat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>I shuddered, and turned sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>It looked pretty and homelike in the moonlight, as we entered the yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>We saw none of the family that night except the host, a pleasant old gentleman, with white hair and beard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>He <pb id="p.111" n="111"/> listened with interest to the captain's account of our capture, and asked us a number of questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>He made the servants prepare supper for the guard and us; and told us that we were welcome to all we could eat, but advised us to be careful not to eat too much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>He then ordered beds prepared for the whole party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/><persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> and I told him we were not fit to sleep in a bed, but he insisted; so we washed and went to bed.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>I have often thought of their careful watch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>Yet such was their caution that they sat up by twos to guard us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>We did not sleep much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>We were too blue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>Our future looked dark.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>In the morning after we were up and washed, our host came in, and, with Southern hospitality, set before us a big black bottle, a sugar-bowl, and tumblers.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>He then led us and our guard out to breakfast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>It had been a long, long time since <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> or I had sat at table with ladies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>Even in our lines, in campaign from <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> to <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, we had no such privileges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>As we entered the dining room the host gave us some sort of a general introduction to <num value="3">three</num> ladies-his wife and daughters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>It is fashionable for men to accuse the other sex of vanity; but we have our full share.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/><pb id="p.113" n="113"/> When I looked across the table at those well-dressed ladies, and down at my tattered pants, and swollen, discolored feet, I felt bashful and awkward; and as I drew my blouse more closely about my neck and breast, the desire for giddy display so overcame me that for <num value="1">one</num> brief moment I wished I had a shirt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>I sat down embarrassed by the feeling that I was not fit to be there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>But the table talk turned at once upon the war and its current campaigns, and the boastful manner in which they spoke of the prowess of their armies, and the skill of their generals, soon aroused my combativeness and put me at my ease. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>Their greatest boast was the skill of <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n0031.0014.00113.00054" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>To <num value="1">one</num> who remembers the campaign of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, in which <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0031.0014.00113.00058" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName> fell back before <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0031.0014.00113.00059" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> till he got everything ready, and then utterly <pb id="p.114" n="114"/> <pb id="p.115" n="115"/> crushed the life out of his army, this boasting has its moral. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>Of course <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> and I entered into the discussion-much of it was addressed to us. They charged many hard things against the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">U. S. Government</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>Some of them we denied, some we could defend, and some we couldn't. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>They said we could never whip them in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>We said the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would govern the country or make a wilderness of it, and we didn't care which. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>We spoke bitterly of <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName>, and told them-and we thought so then-that we could not live through the coming winter if they sent us back there, and we hoped our Government would retaliate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>That if we could be sure that for every man who languished in <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName> <num value="1">one</num> would freeze in <placeName reg="Camp Douglass">Camp Douglass</placeName>, we would go and bravely die and rot there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>We were <hi rend="italics">not a bit</hi> excited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>Only earnest and warm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>Maybe it was the <quote>sanguin</quote> juice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/><num value="1">One</num> standard subject for hard feeling in those days was the enlistment of the negro into the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>It was seldom that we <pb id="p.116" n="116"/> ever got into a discussion with the rebels that they did not refer to that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/></p> 
<p>So we had it up and down during the entire breakfast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>The old captain allowed us full freedom of speech, if not of person, and we indulged ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>I have given these hard speeches and ruffled feelings thus fully because of what followed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>After breakfast was over, while the provost were getting ready to start with us, the mistress of the house gave <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> and me an old quilt to be owned in common, a small sack filled with provisions for us to eat on the way, and to each of us a pair of home-spun and home-knitted <rs n="cotton socks" type="product">cotton socks</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>I felt as though I could not take the gifts, after all that had passed, and I told the woman, <quote><rs type="role2">Madam</rs>, we are here as your enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>I was surprised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>The water was clear and comparatively pure, as there was no camp on the creek above the pen. The trees along this creek were left for <pb id="p.131" n="131"/> shade, making probably <measure n="3acres" type="area">three acres</measure> of timber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1178"/>Had there been nothing between us and liberty except that guard, we could have broken through and escaped; but the memory <pb id="p.151" n="151"/> of those wide rivers and dreary swamps, and the fact that it was now winter, made us hesitate to run a gauntlet of hounds and patrolmen, and probable starvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1179"/>Then, too, the fact that they built no wall around us, and no quarters for themselves, made us think they did not intend to keep us there very long. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1185"/>Of course wherever <pb id="p.152" n="152"/> he could succeed in being counted he took a <quote>mess number,</quote> and drew a ration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1186"/>When the rations came in he had to have a chum to assist him, and usually <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> divided the extra ration thus obtained. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1231"/>It was now the dead of winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1232"/>It rained about <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> of a week, and was cloudy and damp nearly all the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1233"/>Heavy east winds prevailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1234"/>We seldom saw the sun shine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1235"/>Our sack-tent, that never did keep the rain out, was now rotten and torn till we had to patch it nearly all over with such scraps of old shirts, pants, or blankets, as we could find. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1236"/>The rebel authorities allowed a detail of <num value="3">three</num> men from each <num value="100">hundred</num> to go outunder guard &mdash; to the woods to pick limbs <pb id="p.158" n="158"/> and such other pieces of wood as we could find, for fuel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1237"/>There was an abundance of good wood all around us, but we had no axes with which to prepare it, and had to content ourselves with such scraps as old Time and Storm had prepared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1238"/>The best of it was where pine logs had rotted and left the knots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1239"/>These, being full of tar, burned freely in the dampest weather. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1240"/>In this way about <num value="200">two hundred</num> men went out every day, and returned with an armfull or a shoulder-load of wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1241"/>We soon picked up all that we could get, near the stockade, and had to go farther and farther into the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1242"/>I think most of our wood was carried <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of a mile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1243"/>We were too weak to carry a large load so far, but we did our best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1244"/>I know that when I got out I carried in a load that gave me the thumps. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1245"/>When we got our wood home, with a railroad spike for a wedge, and a pine knot for a maul; we split it; and broke it up fine so as to make it go as far as possible-and even then we were without wood most of the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1246"/><pb id="p.159" n="159"/> </p> 
<p>Think of it!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1247"/><num value="3">Three</num> men from a <num value="100">hundred</num> go out every day. If you get out to-day, it will be <measure n="33days" type="date">thirty-three days</measure>-or nearly <measure n="5weeks" type="date">five weeks</measure>-before your turn comes again!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1248"/>It would take a strong man to carry wood enough to keep him dry and warm for <measure n="5weeks" type="date">five weeks</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1249"/>Here, again, the strong took advantage of the weak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1250"/>If a man was sick and weak, some stronger man would give him a chew of tobacco, or a spoonful of rice, for his <quote>turn</quote> to go for wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1251"/>Then, with onefourth his load of wood he could buy <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> times as much rice or tobacco as he paid for the <quote>turn;</quote> and very likely in the course of a week or <num value="2">two</num>, when a cold rain had fallen all night, you would find the weak man, in a hole in the sand, doubled up like a jackknife, chilled to death! </p>

<p><num value="1">One</num> way we had to keep warm, those damp, chilly days, was to dig a funnelshaped hole in the sand, about <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure> in diameter, and <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1256"/><num value="4">Four</num> of us would sit in this hole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1257"/>Our feet would be together in the bottom; our knees together in the center; then leaning forward till our heads were almost together, we would spread our blanket over the pile, and draw it down close to the edges-thus keeping in the heat of our bodies and the warmth of our breath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1258"/>I have sat in such a hole frequently all day, except time enough to draw and eat my rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1259"/>Some dug these holes larger and deeper than the <num value="1">one</num> I have described, and <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> would get into them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1260"/>Those were dreary days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1261"/>It rained almost constantly during <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1262"/>There was plenty of timber all around us. We would have gladly cut and carried it, and built huts and fires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1263"/>There is no apology for not letting us do so. Hundreds chilled to death for want of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1264"/>They were <hi rend="italics">mur</hi>-dered-brutally, in cold blood! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1265"/>Once in a while we would have a clear <pb id="p.161" n="161"/> day, and we would dry our clothes and blankets, take down our tents, and let the sun dry the sand on which we slept, pull off our clothes and kill the vermin on themand feel comparatively comfortable and happy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1266"/>About the <dateStruct value="-01-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> a few prisoners were brought in, who told us that <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0031.0021.00161.00089" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> had reached the sea, at <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, and had turned northward into <placeName reg="Carolina City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2222249">Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1267"/>So the last lingering hope that he would rescue us died within us. A few days later a squad of prisoners came in from the <orgName n="Military Division of the West" type="army">western division</orgName> of the army, and brought the news of the <rs n="Battle of Nashville" type="battle">battle of Nashville</rs>, and told us how <quote>Pap</quote> <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0031.0021.00161.00090" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName> had utterly crushed <orgName n="army"><persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0031.0021.00161.00091" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1268"/>Among these prisoners, was <num value="1">one</num> called <quote>Old beard</quote> --a <hi rend="italics">nomme de querre-of</hi> my own regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1269"/>He brought us much news from our comrades who escaped when we were captured, and gave us a history of subsequent campaigns, such as only <num value="1">one</num> soldier can give to another. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1270"/>This was the last reliable news we received till it was all over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1271"/>I can't describe <pb id="p.162" n="162"/> the suspense, the anxiety, that almost consumed us, and I will not try. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1272"/>During the winter the guard relaxed much of its sternness and rigor, and many of the men who composed it were willing to enter into conversation and traffic with us, when their officers were not in sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1273"/>This gave rise to several manufacturing industries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1274"/><num value="1">One</num> was carving pipes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1275"/>Some of the boys, when they got out for wood, would dig greenbriar-roots, and from these, and other kinds of wood, finely-carved pipes were made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1276"/>Frequently <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> labor was expended on a single pipe, which was then sold for <num value="0.5">a half</num> gallon of <quote>nigger peas,</quote> a quart of meal, or <measure n="3dollars" type="currency">three dollars</measure> <quote>Confed.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1277"/></p> 
<p>Another branch of business was carving toothpicks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1278"/>These were made from the bones of meat that we drew, and, like the pipes, they were valuable in proportion to the amount of labor bestowed on them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1279"/>Bob Mc made toothpicks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1280"/>His kit of tools consisted of a piece of an old caseknife, <num value="1">one</num> side of it cut full of notches for a saw; a brick-bat, which he used for grindstone, <pb id="p.163" n="163"/> file, and polisher; and a piece of coarse needle fastened into a bone handle, and ground flat-pointed, which served as a drill or boring machine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1281"/>With such a set of tools, if he had favorable weather, he could turn out <num value="2">two</num> good toothpicks per month. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1282"/>Still another branch of <hi rend="italics">business</hi> (?) carried on at this time, was <quote>raising</quote> Confederate notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1283"/>Confederate money was poorly made, both in design and execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1284"/>The <quote>ones</quote> and <quote>twos,</quote> and <quote>tens</quote> and <quote>twenties</quote> were almost alike, except in the figures that told their denomination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1285"/>If a man could get a <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num>-dollar bill, he knew where to take it and have it converted into a <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num>-<quote>All work done in the best style of art and warranted to pass.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1286"/>In buying beans or meal with this money, we always aimed to trade so as to get <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> small bills in change so that we could make another <quote>raise.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1287"/>I expect that good brother who thought we stole the sacks from the quartermaster, will think this looks like counterfeiting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1288"/>It does look that way, and had those <persName n="Yanks,,,,," id="n0031.0021.00163.00092" reg="mostcommon:Yanks,Specks,,,:1"><surname>Yanks</surname></persName> been <pb id="p.164" n="164"/> caught at it, they might have been sent to <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName>!-the worst imprisonment I can think of-and sentenced to remain there as long as Confederate money had a value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1291"/>During the month of <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> the rebels furnished material, and detailed a lot of prisoners-giving them extra rations-and had <num value="3">three</num> sheds erected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1292"/>These sheds were about <measure n="25feet" type="distance">twenty-five feet</measure> wide, by <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> long; about <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> high at the eaves, and <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="12feet" type="distance">twelve feet</measure> high in the center-roofed with boards, and left open on all sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1293"/>They were designed for a shelter for those who had no blankets or tents of any kind; and during a hard rain <num value="1000">one thousand</num> men <pb id="p.166" n="166"/> would crowd under each shed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1294"/>When it was not raining most of the men preferred to remain outside, on account of the vermin-especially fleas &mdash; which were so much worse in the dry sand under these roofs than in other parts of the prison. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1295"/>In the different narratives of <placeName reg="Andersonville prison">Andersonville prison</placeName> life, I have never seen any account of the building of these sheds; but I am glad to give to the notorious <rs>Winder</rs> and <rs>Wirtz</rs> credit for this much humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1296"/>Perhaps the reader thinks it was no great thing to build such sheds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1297"/>True. And yet they were a blessing to a number of wretched prisoners who were almost naked, and had there been more of them, and had they been built in the fall, they would have saved many lives. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1298"/>Thus the winter wore away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1299"/><dateStruct><month>March</month></dateStruct> came; and looking over the stockade toward the forest, we could see the burst buds and tender leaves, telling of springtime and a new year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1300"/>We heard no news from the war, in which we were so intensely interested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1301"/>What was <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0031.0022.00166.00093" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> doing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1302"/>Where was <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0031.0022.00166.00094" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1303"/>What had <pb id="p.167" n="167"/> become of <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0031.0022.00167.00095" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName> since his victory at <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1304"/>These questions were often asked-but as they were never answered, to ask them only intensified our sadness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1305"/>But the great question &mdash; the <num value="1">one</num> that took precedence over all others, was: Why don't our Government exchange prisoners and get us out? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1306"/>It was a hard strain on our patriotism to feel that we were neglected by our own Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1307"/>For we believed then, as we learned certainly afterward, that we could have been exchanged had those in charge of our armies so desired. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1308"/>Many of the men lying on the wet ground by night, and sitting on it by day, had contracted colds that settled on their lungs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1309"/>Hundreds had that peculiar cough and that brightness of the cheek and eye, that told us that consumption had set in; and that if they were not soon exchanged they would be beyond the reach of cartel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1310"/>Many who had despaired of ever getting well, were anxious to go home that they might die among friends. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1311"/><num value="1">One</num> day, early in <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, an order was <pb id="p.168" n="168"/> read at the gate, that declared that a general exchange of prisoners had been agreed upon, and that they would begin at once and empty the prisons in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Carolina City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2222249">Carolina</placeName> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and would probably reach <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName> in <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure>, or <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1312"/>This news threw the camp into a wild excitement, though I must confess that many of us did not believe it. We had been deceived too often, and this sounded so good that we suspected it was being done to make us docile while they were moving us somewhere else. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1313"/>But in a few days they gave us copies of papers that contained accounts of the release of prisoners from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and <persName n="Saulsbury,,,,," id="n0031.0022.00168.00096" reg="mostcommon:Saulsbury,nomatch:0"><surname>Saulsbury</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1314"/>Then we began to believe and to grow feverish with excitement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1315"/>In due time rebel officers came in and began to enroll names, putting down rank and regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1316"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> call was to take out all the sick: but they gave us the wink, and told us that if any <num value="1">one</num> had any greenbacks, or gold, they would enroll him as sick, and take him out on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> train. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1317"/><persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> C--, Cudge S-and I were partners <pb id="p.169" n="169"/> in the sack-tent, and had been bunk-mates during the whole of our prison life, except when I ran away. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1318"/><persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> had a gold breast-pin that cost <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3dollars" type="currency">three dollars</measure> before the war, which somehow had escaped all the searchings and had remained in his possession till then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1319"/>He took it out of its hiding-place, examined and polished it, and said, <quote>Boys, I am going to see what I can do with this; for as likely as not they will not get out more than <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> train-loads till something will happen to break the cartel, and we will be left again.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1320"/></p> 
<p>He went; but soon came back with the news that they had all they could take that day. But they told him there would be another train in a day or <num value="2">two</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1321"/>So we had to wait a day or <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1322"/>Then they came again, and <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> went to buy his liberty with the breast-pin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1323"/>He came back and said- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1324"/><quote>Boys, I tried to take you both out on my breast-pin, but couldn't. I can take <num value="1">one</num>--which shall it be?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1325"/></p> 
<p>Cudge and I looked at each other, and <pb id="p.170" n="170"/> both sprang to our feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1326"/>As soon as we could speak without choking, we both told him we would leave it to him. We all <num value="3">three</num> sat down and began to talk of homehow long it would take to go; how glad we would be to get there; how glad others would be to see us returned at last, alive!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1327"/>Oh, those dear ones!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1328"/>Could it be possible that we would see them once more!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1329"/>We talked rapidly-excitedly-almost wildly; but every little while Cudge and I would look at each other and choke down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1330"/>We knew that <num value="1">one</num> must remain behind, for only <num value="1">one</num> could go. I went away for a short time, and when I returned <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> looked at me and said, <quote>I reckon I will take Cudge.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1331"/></p> 
<p><quote>So you leave me to die and rot by myself!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1332"/></p> 
<p>They both tried to cheer me, by telling me that I would soon follow them; but I wouldn't be cheered &mdash; I knew something would happen; the exchange would be stopped, and I would languish and die. I felt very much as I did when I was recaptured after my run-away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1333"/><pb id="p.171" n="171"/> </p> 
<p>With a heart full of gloomy forebodings and bitterness, I went with them to the gate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1334"/>I made Cudge promise to write a letter to my folks at home, telling them that I was alive at that date.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1335"/>I told him to fix it up as good as he could, so as not to cause mother more sorrow than was actually necessary. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1336"/>The whole prison was crowded around the gate; and as the names were called by a loud-voiced rebel, some countenance would light up with joy as he answered, <quote>Here!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1337"/>and you would see him struggle through the crowd to the gate and disappear through the wicket. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1338"/>We <num value="3">three</num> stood together, near the deadline.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1343"/>I staggered back through the crowd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1344"/>They were gone!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1345"/>I had no farther interest in the gate or in the crowd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1346"/>I was alone!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1347"/>My comrades had left me to die!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1348"/>Blinded <pb id="p.172" n="172"/> by my tears, and sick through the intensity of my feelings, I reached our tent-my tent, now-and lay down. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1349"/>Our talk of home had given me the blues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1350"/>I could see nothing but darkness and sorrow, misery and death!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1351"/>I was unreasonable-mad at everything and everybody, because I could not get out. Like <persName><foreName>Job</foreName></persName>'s wife, I was ready to <quote>curse <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and die.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1352"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1356"/>There was <num value="1">one</num> train-load taken after the <num value="1">one</num> that took my comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1433"/>The weather was so pleasant that we hardly needed clothing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1434"/>I had gone without a shirt all winter, using my blouse instead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1435"/>It had now become so rotten and ragged that it was not worth picking the lice off for all the protection it afforded, so I threw it away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1436"/>My wardrobe then consisted of pants, ending in a neat (?) fringe about the knee, and a leathern gun-sling, which did duty as a suspender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1437"/>From the waist, upward, I was smoked and tanned to the complexion of well-cured bacon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1438"/>Do not think that I was not as welldressed as was fashionable, for the poor did <pb id="p.182" n="182"/> not enjoy a gun-sling to hold their pants up. <persName><foreName>Bob</foreName></persName> had a pair of pants, and a shirt, minus the sleeves, that he had made out of a blouse and piece of sack; he also had a piece of pants-leg, which he used for a hat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1449"/>Next morning we were up by times, and were soon all ready and waiting to see what would happen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1453"/>The colonel who had command of our general then made us a speech. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1454"/>He told us that they were tired of guarding us. They knew our time was out, and that we were anxious to get home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1455"/>They were going to the front to fight, and so had decided to turn us loose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1456"/>He advised us to go home, and stay there; and to tell our friends at the <rs>North</rs> that we <quote>could never whip the rebels in the world!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1465"/>It was like a dream!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1466"/>It was so sudden-so unexpected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1467"/>Our minds were not prepared for it. We could hardly realize it. We felt like shouting!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1468"/>A great load had been suddenly lifted-but how?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1469"/>What had become of it? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1470"/>I do not remember how far we had to travel.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1477"/>We went as far as we could that day, and hid in the palmettos at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1478"/>We were actually afraid the rebels would change their minds, and come on and overtake us; hence we hid carefully. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1479"/>The next morning we were up bright and early.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1480"/>A goodly number of us were on the road, trudging eastward, by sun-up.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1481"/>About noon we came to a creek, whose waters bore the dark tea-color of the swamp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1482"/>As it flowed smoothly over a sandy bed, and we were tired, we stopped and bathed, and were much refreshed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1483"/>About the middle of the afternoon we saw an object that looked like a man on horseback, a mile or so down the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1484"/>When we came nearer it was gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1485"/>We <pb id="p.187" n="187"/> came to the place and there, sure enough, was the sign of a picket-post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1486"/>But what had become of him?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1487"/>We did not go far till we saw a troop of cavalry coming toward us. They were too far for us to distinguish their uniform, so we halted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1488"/>Stragglers kept closing up till we had quite a company, uncertain what to do. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1489"/>The cavalry halted, and drew up in line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1490"/>Then <num value="2">two</num> men were sent toward us to see what we were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1491"/>They doubtless judged by our unmilitary appearance that we were not very formidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1492"/>When the <num value="2">two</num> soldiers came near enough for us to see their uniform, a wild shout rent the air. It was taken up by stragglers in the rear, and carried to others still farther back &mdash; to be repeated again and again,--giving new vigor to weary limbs that had almost refused to do duty longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1493"/>That shout doubtless reached <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> back along that road. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1497"/>If we were glad to see their clothes, they were <hi rend="italics">mad</hi> when they saw ours. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1498"/>When the commander of that troop found out who we were, and looked at our rags and our wretchedness, he stood up in his stirrups and swore a terrible oath of vengeance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1499"/>And scarcely <num value="1">one</num> of those bearded, swarthy troopers but turned away his face to hide the tears that would come up, as he looked in amazement at our haggard countenances, meager skeletons and filthy rags. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1500"/>The captain told us that it was but <placeName><distance reg="3miles">three miles</distance> to <placeName reg="Jacksonville, Duval, Florida" key="tgn,7013804">Jacksonville</placeName></placeName>, and that he would go and have tents and rations ready for us. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1501"/>We came to the infantry picket-line, and there dropped down for a few minutes' rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1502"/>There were probably <num value="300">three hundred</num> of us together, forming the head of our column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1503"/>While we were resting we asked the officer of the guard for news, and he told us that <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> had fallen,--that <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0031.0024.00188.00112" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> had <pb id="p.189" n="189"/> surrendered,--that <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0031.0024.00189.00113" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> had surrendered to <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0031.0024.00189.00114" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>,--that the <rs>Confederacy</rs> had gone to staves, and that <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0031.0024.00189.00115" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was dead</hi>! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1504"/>It is no use trying to describe the effect of this news on men in our condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1505"/>My readers would not understand it-language is too feeble. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1506"/>We did not need rest after we heard the news.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1658"/>It is nothing but a railroad station, and the only other thing besides the railroad which characterizes the spot, is the immense <placeName reg="Union Cemetery">Union Cemetery</placeName>, of some <measure n="20acres" type="area">twenty acres</measure>, over which floats the <orgName n="Star Spangled Banner" type="newspaper">Star-Spangled Banner</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1662"/>There is not much attempt made to ornament this city of our martyred dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1666"/>Sentiments of passionate denunciation are more frequent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>Occasionally a man who was in the stockade turns up among the visitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>These men, whatever their natural temper, the <rs>Superintendent</rs> says, can almost be distinguished by the effects of fear, dread, and vivid recollection, which come back like a shock into their faces as they again stand on the now quiet and sunlit scene of their war experiences. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1671"/>A square marble block with the word <quote>Unknown,</quote> is repeated about <num value="1000">one thousand</num> times in the <rs type="place">Cemetery</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>There was no necessity for the contractor to swell his bill with mule-bones in filling up this burial-place.
