<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>I must find some fault with the statement which has been made of the events at <placeName reg="Alton, Madison, Illinois" key="tgn,7015715">Alton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>It has been hinted that, from hasty and ill-judged excitement, the men within the building provoked a quarrel, and that he fell in the course of it, <num value="1">one</num> mob resisting another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Recollect, Sir, that they did act with the approbation and sanction of the <rs>Mayor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>In strict truth, there was no executive to appeal to for protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>The <rs>Mayor</rs> acknowledged that he could not protect them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>They asked him if it was lawful for them to defend themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>He told them it was, and sanctioned their assembling in arms to do so. They were not, then, a mob; they were not merely citizens defending their own property; they were in some sense the <foreign lang="la">posse comitatus,</foreign> adopted for the occasion into the police of the city, acting under the order of a magistrate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>It was civil authority resisting lawless violence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>Where, then, was the imprudence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>Is the doctrine to be sustained here, that it is <hi rend="italics">imprudent</hi> for men to aid magistrates in executing the laws?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Men are continually asking each other, Had <persName n="Lovejoy,,,,," id="n0188.0003.00005.00070" reg="nearbymention:Lovejoy,E.,P.,,"><surname>Lovejoy</surname></persName> a right to resist?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>He did not throw himself back on the natural right of self-defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>He did not cry anarchy, and let slip the dogs of civil war, careless of the horrors which would follow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>Sir, as I understand this affair, it was not an individual protecting his property; it was not <num value="1">one</num> body of armed men resisting another, and making the streets of a peaceful city run blood with their contentions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>It did not bring back the scenes in some old <persName n="Italian,,,,," id="n0188.0003.00005.00072" reg="mostcommon:Italian,nomatch:0"><surname>Italian</surname></persName> cities, where family met family, and faction met faction, and mutually trampled the laws under foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>No; the men in that house were regularly <hi rend="italics">enrolled</hi>, under the sanction of the <rs>Mayor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>There being no militia in <placeName reg="Alton, Madison, Illinois" key="tgn,7015715">Alton</placeName>, about <num value="70">seventy</num> men were enrolled with the approbation of the <rs>Mayor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>These relieved each other every <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> other night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>About <num value="30">thirty</num> men were in arms on the night of the <dateStruct value="--6"><day reg="6">sixth</day></dateStruct>, when the press was landed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>It was, therefore, you perceive, Sir, the police of the city resisting rioters,--civil government breasting itself to the shock of lawless men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>Here is no question about the right of self-defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>It is in fact simply this: Has the civil magistrate a right to put down a riot?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Some persons seem to imagine that anarchy existed at <placeName reg="Alton, Madison, Illinois" key="tgn,7015715">Alton</placeName> from the commencement of these disputes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Till then the law, represented in his person, sustained itself against its foes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>He took refuge under the banner of liberty,--amid its folds; and when he fell, its glorious stars and stripes, the emblem of free institutions, around which cluster so many heart-stirring memories, were blotted out in the martyr's blood.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>It has been stated, perhaps inadvertently, that <persName n="Lovejoy,,,,," id="n0188.0003.00006.00076" reg="nearbymention:Lovejoy,E.,P.,,"><surname>Lovejoy</surname></persName> or his comrades fired <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>I rejoice to see so large an audience gathered to consider this momentous subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>It was well described by <persName n="Rose,Mrs.,,,," id="n0188.0004.00013.00097" reg="mostcommon:Rose,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Rose</surname></persName> as the most magnificent reform that has yet been launched upon the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>It is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> organized <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> protest against the injustice which has brooded over the character and the destiny of <num value="0.5">one half</num> of the human race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Nowhere else, under any circumstances, has a demand ever yet been made for the liberties of <num value="1">one</num> whole half of our race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>It is fitting that we should pause and consider so remarkable and significant a circumstance; that we should discuss the question involved with the seriousness and deliberation suitable to such an enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>It strikes, indeed, a great and vital blow at the whole social fabric of every nation; but this, to my mind, is no argument against it. The time has been when it was the duty of the reformer to show cause why he appeared to disturb the quiet of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>But during the discussion of the many reforms that have been advocated, and which have more or less succeeded, <num value="1">one</num> after another,--freedom of the lower classes, freedom of food, freedom of the press, freedom of thought, reform in penal legislation, and a <num value="1000">thousand</num> other matters,--it seems to me to have been proved conclusively, that government commenced in usurpation and oppression; that liberty and civilization, at present, are nothing else than the fragments of rights which the scaffold and the stake have wrung from the strong hands of the usurpers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Every step of progress the world has made has been from scaffold to scaffold, and from stake to stake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>It would hardly be exaggeration to say, that all the great truths relating to society and government have been <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> heard in the solemn protests of martyred patriotism, or the loud cries of crushed and starving labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>The law has been always wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Government began in tyranny and force, began in the feudalism of the soldier and bigotry of the priest; and the ideas of justice and humanity have been fighting their way, like a thunder-storm, against the organized selfishness of human nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>And this is the last great protest against the wrong of ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>It is no argument to my <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> mind, therefore, that the old social fabric of the pat is against us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Neither do I feel called upon to show what woman's proper sphere is. In every great reform, the majority have always said to the claimant, no matter what he claimed, <quote>You are not fit for such a privilege.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>The answer was, <quote>Let us try.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>That <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france">France</placeName> is not, as <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, utterly crushed beneath the weight of a <measure n="1000years" type="date">thousand years</measure> of mis-government, is the answer to those who doubt the ultimate success of this experiment.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>It grew out of the hope to be <persName n="Caesar,,,,," id="n0188.0004.00016.00100" reg="mostcommon:Caesar,Julius,,,:1"><surname>Caesar</surname></persName> or <placeName key="tgn,2050078" n="1.000 4" reg="marlborough, middlesex county, massachusetts">Marlborough</placeName>,--out of <placeName reg="Slavkov u Brna, Jihomoravsky, Ceska Republika" key="tgn,7006925">Austerlitz</placeName> and <placeName reg="Jena, Gera, Thuringen" key="tgn,7005973">Jena</placeName>,--out of his battle-fields, his throne, and all the great scenes of that eventful life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Centuries alone can lay any fair basis for argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>I believe that, on this point, there is a shrinking consciousness of not being ready for the battle, on the part of <hi rend="italics">some</hi> of the stronger sex, as they call themselves; a tacit confession of risk to this imagined superiority, if they consent to meet their sisters in the lecture-hall or the laboratory of science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>My proof of it is this: that the mightiest intellects of the race, from <persName n="Plato,,,,," id="n0188.0004.00016.00101" reg="mostcommon:Plato,nomatch:0"><surname>Plato</surname></persName> down to the present time, some of the rarest minds of <placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, have successively yielded their assent to the fact that woman is, not perhaps identically, but equally, endowed with man in all intellectual capabilities.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>But I wish especially to direct your attention to the precise principle which this movement undertakes to urge upon the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>We do not attempt to settle what shall be the profession, education, or employment of woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>We have not that presumption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>What we ask is simply this,--what all other classes have asked before: Leave it to woman to choose for herself her profession, her education, and her sphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>We deny to any portion of the species the right to prescribe to any other portion its sphere, its education, or its rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>We deny the right of any individual to prescribe to any other individual his amount of education, or his rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>The sphere of each man, of each woman, of each individual, is that sphere which he can, with the highest exercise of his powers, perfectly fill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>The highest act which the human being can do, that is the act which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> designed him to do. All that woman asks through this movement is, to be allowed to prove what she can do; to prove it by liberty of choice, by liberty of action, the only means by which it ever can be settled how much and what she can do. She can reasonably say to us: <quote>I have never fathomed the depths of science; you have taught that it was unwomanly, and have withdrawn from me the means of scientific culture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>I have never equalled the eloquence of <persName n="Demosthenes,,,,," id="n0188.0004.00017.00102" reg="mostcommon:Demosthenes,nomatch:0"><surname>Demosthenes</surname></persName>; but you have never quickened my energies by holding up before me the crown and robe of glory, and the gratitude which I was to win.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Welcome me, henceforth, brother, to your arena; and let facts &mdash; not theories &mdash; settle my capacity, and therefore my sphere.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>We are not here to-night to assert that woman will <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> enter the lists and conquer; that she will certainly achieve all that man has achieved; but this we say, <quote>Clear the lists, and let her try.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>Some reply, <quote>It will be a great injury to feminine delicacy and refinement for woman to mingle in business and politics.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>I am not careful to answer this objection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Of all such objections, on this and kindred subjects, <persName n="President,Mrs.,,,," id="n0188.0004.00018.00103" reg="mostcommon:President,Webster,,,:1"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>President</surname></persName>, I love to dispose in some such way as this: The broadest and most far-sighted intellect is utterly unable to foresee the ultimate consequences of any great social change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Ask yourself, on all such occasions, if there be any element of right and wrong in the question, any principle of clear natural justice that turns the scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>If so, take your part with the perfect and abstract right, and trust <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to see that it shall prove the expedient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>The questions, then, for me, on this subject, are these: Has <name n="God" type="God">God</name> made woman capable-morally, intellectually, and physicallyof taking this part in human affairs?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Then, what <name n="God" type="God">God</name> made her able to do, it is a strong argument that he in tended she should do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>that the being whose industry government is to burden should have a voice in fixing the character and amount of that burden?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Then, while woman is admitted to the gallows, the jail, and the tax-list, we have no right to debar her from the ballot-box.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/><quote>But to go there will hurt that delicacy of character which we have always thought peculiarly her grace.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>I cannot help that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>Let Him who created her capable of politics, and made it just that she should have a share in them, see to it that these rights which he has conferred do not injure the being he created.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Is it for any human being to trample on the laws of justice and liberty, from an alleged necessity of helping <name n="God" type="God">God</name> govern what he has made?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>I cannot help <name n="God" type="God">God</name> govern his world <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> by telling lies, or doing what my conscience deems unjust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>How absurd to deem it necessary that any <num value="1">one</num> should do so!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>When Infinite Wisdom established the rules of right and honesty, he saw to it that justice should be always the highest expediency.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>The evil, therefore, that some timid souls fear to the character of woman, from the exercise of her political rights, does not at all trouble me. <quote>Let education form the rational and moral being, and nature will take care of the woman.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Neither do I feel at all disturbed by those arguments addressed to us as to the capacity of woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>I know that the humblest man and the feeblest has the same civil rights, according to the theory of our institutions, as the most gifted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Intellect, even though it reach the <name>Alpine</name> height of a Parker,--ay, setting aside the infamy of his conduct, and looking at him only as an instance of intellectual greatness, to the height of a Webster,--gets no tittle of additional civil right, no <num value="1">one</num> single claim to any greater civil privilege than the humblest individual, who knows no more than the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> elements of his alphabet, provided that being is a &mdash; man (I ought to say, a <hi rend="italics">white</hi> man). <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0188.0004.00019.00104" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, then, that woman is intellectually inferior to man,--it settles nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>She is still a responsible, tax-paying member of civil society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>We rest our claim on the great, eternal principle, that taxation and representation must be co-extensive; that rights and burdens must correspond to each other; and he who undertakes to answer the argument of this Convention must <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> answer the whole course of English and American history for the last <measure n="150years" type="date">hundred and fifty years</measure>.

If the tailors could find only <num value="500">five hundred</num> women to sew, they would be obliged to pay then whatever they asked But let the case be, as it usually is, that there are <num value="5000">five thousand</num> women waiting for that work, unable to turn to any other occupation, and doomed to starve if they fail to get a share of that; we see at once that their labor, being a drug in the market, must be poorly paid for. She cannot say, as man would, <quote>Give me so much, or I will seek another trade.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>She must accept whatever is offered, and often underbid her sister, that she may secure a share.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>Any article sells cheap, when there is too much of it in the market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>Woman's labor is cheap because there is too much of it in the market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>All women's trades are overcrowded, because they have only <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> to choose from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>But open to her, now, other occupations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>Open to her the studio of the artist,--let her enter there; open to her the office practice, at least, of the lawyers,--let her go there; open to her all in-door trades of society, to begin with, and let women monopolize them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>Take from the crowded and starved ranks of the needle-women of New York some for the arts of design, some for the counter, some to minister in our public libraries, some for our public registries, some to keep merchants' accounts, and some to feel the pulse; and the consequence will be, that, like every other independent laborer, like their male brethren, they may make their own terms, and will be fairly paid for their labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>It is competition in too narrow lists that starves women in our cities; and those lists are drawn narrow by superstition and prejudice.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>Woman is ground down, by the competition of her sisters, to the very point of starvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>Heavily taxed <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> ill-paid, m degradation and misery, is it to be wondered at that she yields to the temptation of wealth?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>It is the same with men; and thus we recruit the ranks of vice by the prejudices of custom and society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>We corrupt the whole social fabric, that woman may be confined to <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> employments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>How much do we suffer through the tyranny of prejudice!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>When we penitently and gladly give to the energy and the intellect and the enterprise of woman their proper reward, their appropriate employment, this question of wages will settle itself; and it will never be settled at all until then.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>This question is intimately connected with the great social problem,--the vices of cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>You who hang your heads in terror and shame, in view of the advancing demoralization of modern civilized life, and turn away with horror-struck faces, look back now to these social prejudices, which have made you close the avenues of profitable employment in the face of woman, and reconsider the conclusions you have made!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>Look back, I say, and see whether you are surely right here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>Come up with us and argue the question, and say whether this most artificial delicacy, this childish prejudice, on whose Moloch altar you sacrifice the virtue of so many, is worthy the exalted worship you pay it. Consider a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>From what sources are the ranks of female profligacy recruited?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>A few mere giddiness hurries to ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>Their protection would be in that character and sound common-sense which a wider interest in practical life would generally create.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>In a few, the love of sensual gratification, grown over-strong, because all the other powers are dormant for want of exercise, wrecks its unhappy victim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>The medicine for these would be occupation, awaking intellect, and stirring their highest energies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>Give any <num value="1">one</num> an earnest interest in life, something to do, something that kindles emulation, and soon the gratification of the senses sinks into proper <pb id="p.33" n="33"/> subordination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>It is idle heads that are tempted to mis chief: and she is emphatically idle half of whose nature is unemployed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>Why does man so much oftener than woman surmount a few years or months of sensual gratification, and emerge into a worthier life?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>It is not solely because the world's judgment is so much harder upon her. Man can immerse himself in business that stirs keenly all his faculties, and thus he smothers passion in honorable cares.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>An ordinary woman, once fallen, has no busy and stirring life in which to take refuge, where intellect will contend for mastery with passion, and where virtue is braced by high and active thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>Passion comes back to the <quote><hi rend="italics">empty</hi>,</quote> though <quote>swept and garnished</quote> chambers, bringing with him more devils than before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>But, undoubtedly, the great temptation to this vice is the love of dress, of wealth, and the luxuries it secures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>Facts will jostle theories aside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>Whether we choose to acknowledge it or not, there are many women, earning <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3dollars" type="currency">three dollars</measure> a week, who feel that they are as capable as their brothers of earning hundreds, if they could be permitted to exert themselves as freely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>Fretting to see the coveted rewards of life forever forbidden them, they are tempted to shut their eyes on the character of the means by which a taste, however short, may be gained of the wealth and luxury they sigh for. Open to man a fair field for his industry, and secure to him its gains, and <num value="999">nine hundred and ninety-nine</num> men out of every <num value="1000">thousand</num> will disdain to steal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>Open to woman a fair field for her industry, let her do anything her hands find to do, and enjoy her gains, and <num value="999">nine hundred and ninety-nine</num> women out of every <num value="1000">thousand</num> will disdain to debase themselves for dress or ease.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>Of this great social problem &mdash; to cure or lessen the vice of cities &mdash; there is no other solution, except what this movement offers you. It is, to leave woman to choose her own employments for herself, responsible, as w <num value="3">3</num> are. <pb id="p.34" n="34"/> to the common Creator, and not to her fellow-man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>I exhort you, therefore, to look at this question in the spirit in which I have endeavored to present it to you. It is no fanciful, no superficial movement, based on a few individual tastes, in morbid sympathy with tales of individual suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>It is a great social protest against the very fabric of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>It is a question which goes down &mdash; we admit it, and are willing to meet the issue &mdash; goes down beneath the altar at which you worship, goes down beneath this social system in which you live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>And it is true --no denying it &mdash; that, if we are right, the doctrines preached from <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> pulpits are wrong; it is true that all this affected horror: at woman's deviation from her sphere is a mistake,--a mistake fraught with momentous consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>Understand us. We blink no fair issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>We throw down the gauntlet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>We have counted the cost; we know the yoke and burden we assume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>We know the sneers, the lying frauds of misstatement and misrepresentation, that await us. We have counted all; and it is but the dust in the balance and the small dust in the measure, compared with the inestimable blessing of doing justice to <num value="0.5">one half</num> of the human species, of curing this otherwise immedicable wound, stopping this overflowing fountain of corruption, at the very source of civilized life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>Truly, it is the great question of the age. It looks all others out of countenance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>It needs little aid from legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>Specious objections, after all, are not arguments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>We know we are right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>We only ask an opportunity to argue the question, to set it full before the people, and then leave it to the intellects and the hearts of our country, confident that the institutions under which we live, and the education which other reforms have already given to both sexes, have created men and women capable of solving a problem even more difficult, and meeting a change even more radical, than this. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>We are apt to feel ourselves overshadowed in the presence of colossal institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>We are apt, in coming up to a meeting of this kind, to ask what a few <num value="100">hundred</num> or a few <num value="1000">thousand</num> persons can do against the weight of government, the mountainous odds of majorities, the influence of the press, the power of the pulpit, the organization of parties, the omnipotence of wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>At times, to carry a favorite purpose, leading statesmen have endeavored to cajole the people into the idea that this age was like the past, and that a <quote>rub-a-dub agitation,</quote> as ours is contemptuously styled, was only to be despised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>Its foundations are laid far back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>The child feels; he grows into a man, and thinks; another, perhaps, speaks, and the world acts out the thought.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>I am, however, strongly impressed with the conviction, that the friends of the cause and the fugitives among us need some advice; and that we cannot make a better use of this occasion than to discuss what that advice shall be. <persName n="Garrison,Mister,,,," id="n0188.0007.00072.00277" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName>'s amendment seems to me too ambiguous; it contents itself with announcing an important principle, but suggests nothing, and advises nothing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>Why, <persName n="Chairman,Mister,,,," id="n0188.0007.00072.00278" reg="mostcommon:Chairman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chairman</surname></persName>, do we assemble here on such a melancholy occasion as the present?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>This, instead of last <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>, should be our Fast Day, if there were any reason for us to <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> at all,--for on this day, <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> ago, the <name>Abolitionists</name> of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> suffered a great, a melancholy defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>On that day, unexpectedly to many, a man was carried back to slavery from the capital of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>It was an event which surprised some of our fellow-citizens, and all the rest of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, which relied too fondly on the reputation <rs>Massachusetts</rs> had won as an antislavery community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>Either the flavor of our old religion, or some remnant of the spirit of <dateStruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct>, had made the city of the <name>Puritans</name> a house of refuge to the fugitive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>They had gathered here, and in our neighborhood, by hundreds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>There are traditions of attempts to seize <num value="1">one</num> now and then,--sometimes of trials in open court; and it is possible that, in the general indifference, a few may have been carried back quietly by some underling official, though we have no certain knowledge <pb id="p.73" n="73"/> of any case where the victim was not finally saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/><persName n="Sims,,Thomas,,," id="n0188.0007.00073.00279" reg="default:Sims,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Sims</surname></persName> is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> man that the city of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> ever openly bound and fettered, and sent back to bondage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>I have no heart to dwell on so horrible an outrage:--that sad procession, in the dim morning, through our streets,_ the poor youth,--his noble effort to break his chains,--mocked with <num value="1">one</num> short hour of freedom, and then thrust back to the hell he had escaped, by brother men, in the prostituted names of justice and religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>We sit down with the single captive, and weep with him as the iron enters into his soul,--too sad to think, for the moment, of the disgrace of our city, or even the wickedness of its rulers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>Pity swallows up indignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>We might be forgiven if for the moment we mistook our sadness for despair, and even fancied the event disastrous to others than the victim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>But not so. Liberty knows nothing but victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>In a cause like ours, to which every attribute of the <rs>Most High</rs> is pledged, <quote>everything helps us.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>Selfish commerce, huckstering politics, and the mocking priest, might turn from such a scene and congratulate each other, saying, , <quote>Our mountain stands strong</quote> ; but we knew that emotions were stronger than statutes, more lasting than ledgers, and not to be frozen down even by creeds, and that all <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> would erelong gather itself to answer the last sad question of this hapless victim, as he stepped on the piratical deck of the <rs>Acorn</rs>,--<quote>Is this <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> liberty?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>What, then, is the use of such a celebration as this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>It seems to me the only possible use that could, in any circumstances, be made of such an occasion, would be to record our protest against the deed, with an indignant rebuke of its perpetrators, and to direct our eyes forward to see what we can now do for men in like jeopardy with <persName n="Sims,,,,," id="n0188.0007.00073.00280" reg="nearbymention:Sims,Thomas,,,"><surname>Sims</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>Our protest and our rebuke have been already uttered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>It is needless to repeat them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>The individuals who so infamously <pb id="p.74" n="74"/> misused their little brief authority <sic>nave</sic>, some of them, faded from the public eye,--melted back into the mass of their fellow-slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>Their names are not worth recalling, for they are not of mark enough to point a moral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>Let them pass, all of them ;--the judge who stood head and shoulders above the rest in brutal bearing and the arts of a demagogue; the commissioner, whom the atmosphere of noble enthusiasm about him never betrayed, during all that eventful week, into even the semblance of an honorable emotion; the counsellor who pledged a word, till then undoubted, to that lie for which no guaranty but his could have won even a momentary credence, and the belief of which snapped the last tiny thread of hope that bound the hapless victim to the altar of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> criminal law.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>Yes, let them pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>The few whom charity may hope sinned, unable to <quote>discern between their right hand and their left hand,</quote> and the many who did just right enough to prove they knew their duty, but wallowed in the wrong so greedily as to show how much they loved it. Let History close the record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>Let her allow that <quote>on the side of the oppressor there was power,</quote> --power <quote>to frame mis chief by a law</quote> ; that on that side were all the <hi rend="italics">for</hi>e;<num value="8">8</num> of law, and behind those forms, most of the elements of control: wealth, greedy of increase, and anxious for order, at any sacrifice of principle,--priests prophesying smooth things, and arrogating to themselves the name of Christianity,--ambition, baptizing itself statesmanship,--and that unthinking patriotism, child of habit and not of reason, which mistakes government for liberty and law for justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>And, on the other hand, let her allow that, though the <name>Abolitionists</name> were heedful of the hour, and fearless against the prelates of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>, <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/></p><l part="F">to plead her cause,</l> <l>And from our judge vindicate the laws,</l></quote> <pb id="p.75" n="75"/> while they <quote>did not spare the tyrant <num value="1">one</num> hard word,</quote> they were strictly law-abiding citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>While judges and executives deserted their posts, the <name>Abolitionists</name> violated no law. They begged for nothing but the law,--they wearied themselves to obtain the simple legal rights guaranteed to them and to all by the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>The city government, in direct defiance of the statute of <dateStruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></dateStruct>, aided, both directly and indirectly, in the arrest and detention of a person claimed as a slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>To effect this purpose, they violated the commonest rights of the citizens,--shut them out of their own court-house,--subjected them from day to day to needless, illegal, and vexatious arrests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>Judges were <quote>Artful <persName n="Dodgers,,,,," id="n0188.0007.00075.00281" reg="mostcommon:Dodgers,nomatch:0"><surname>Dodgers</surname></persName>,</quote> and sheriffs refused all processes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>The Abolitionists exhausted every device, besieged every tribunal, implored the interference of every department, to obtain the tare execution of the law of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>And let History say beside, that meantime they fearlessly declared that resistance would be better than submission; while not so absurd as to throw <num value="1">one</num> man, or a score of men, against a government in arms, they proclaimed that they would have been glad to see the people rise against the law,--that nothing which a handful of men could do for such an end was wanting,--that they denounced the church sanctioning the deed as <quote>a synagogue of Satan,</quote> and the law, whether constitutional or not, as mere tyranny and wickedness, its executioners worse than murderers,--that, knowing the value of a true law and real order, they said and believed, that rather than <num value="1">one</num> man should be sent back to slavery, better, far better, human laws should be trampled under foot, and the order of society broken every day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>When the pulpit preached slave-hunting, and the law bound the victim, and society said, <quote>Amen I this will make money,</quote> we were <quote>fanatics,</quote> --<quote>enthusiasts,</quote> --<quote>seditious,</quote> --<quote>disorganizers,</quote> --<quote>scorners of the pulpit,</quote> <pb id="p.76" n="76"/> <quote>traitors.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>Genius of the <rs>Past</rs> drop not from thy tablets <num value="1">one</num> of these honorable names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>We claim them all as our surest title-deeds to the memory and gratitude of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>We indeed thought man more than constitutions, humanity and justice of more worth than law. Seal up the record l If <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> is proud of her part, let her rest assured we are not ashamed of ours!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>All this has been said so often, that it is useless to dwell on it now. The best use that we can now make of this occasion, it seems to me, is to look about us, take our bearings, and tell the fugitives, over whom yet hangs this terrible statute, what course, in our opinion, they should pursue.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>And, in the first place, it is neither frank nor honest to keep up the delusive idea that a fugitive slave can be protected in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>I hope I am mistaken; I shall be glad to be proved incorrect; but I do not believe there is any such antislavery sentiment here as is able to protect a fugitive on whom the government has once laid its hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>We were told this afternoon, from this platform, that there were <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> men in <num value="1">one</num> town ready to come with their muskets to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>,--all they waited for was an invitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>I heard, <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> before the <name>Sims</name> case, that there were a <num value="100">hundred</num> in <num value="1">one</num> town in <placeName key="tgn,7014423" n="1.000 3" reg="plymouth, massachusetts, united states">Plymouth County</placeName> pledged to shoulder their muskets in such a cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>We saw nothing of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>I heard, <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> after the <name>Sims</name> rendition, that there were <num value="200">two hundred</num> more in the city of <placeName reg="Worcester, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014647">Worcester</placeName> ready to have come, had they been invited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>We saw nothing of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>On such an occasion, from the nature of the case, there cannot be much previous concert; the people must take their own cause into their own hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>Intense earnestness of purpose, pervading large classes, must instinctively perceive the crisis, and gather all spontaneously for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> act which is to organize revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>When the <rs type="place">Court</rs> was in pursuit of <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> <pb id="p.77" n="77"/> <persName n="Hampden,,,,," id="n0188.0007.00077.00282" reg="mostcommon:Hampden,nomatch:0"><surname>Hampden</surname></persName>, we are not told that the <num value="2000">two thousand</num> men who rode up to <persName n="London,,,,," id="n0188.0007.00077.00283" reg="mostcommon:London,nomatch:0"><surname>London</surname></persName> the next morning, to stand between their representative and a king's frown, waited for an invitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>They assembled of their own voluntary and individual purpose and <hi rend="italics">found</hi> themselves in <placeName reg="London, Madison, Ohio" key="tgn,2080432">London</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>Whenever there is a like determination throughout <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, it will need no invitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>When, in <dateStruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></dateStruct> the <rs>British</rs> turned their eyes toward <placeName reg="Lexington, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013888">Lexington</placeName>, the same <hi rend="italics">invitation</hi> went out from the <orgName n="Vigilance Committee" type="committee">Vigilance Committee</orgName> of Mechanics in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, as in our case of <dateStruct value="1851-04-"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1851">1851</year></dateStruct>. <num value="2">Two</num> lanterns on the <orgName n="North Church" type="church">North Church</orgName> steeple telegraphed the fact to the country <rs>Revere</rs> and <rs>Prescott</rs>, as they rode from house to house in the gray <hi rend="italics">light</hi> of that <dateStruct><month>April</month></dateStruct> morning, could tell little what others would do, they flung into each house the startling announcement, The red-coats are coming I, and rode on. None that day issued orders, none obeyed aught but his own soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>Though <placeName key="tgn,7007517" n="1.000 161" reg="massachusetts">Massachusetts</placeName> rocked from <placeName reg="Barnstable, Barnstable, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014989">Barnstable</placeName> to <placeName reg="Berkshire, Berkshire, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049407">Berkshire</placeName>, when the wire flashed over the land the announcement that a slave lay chained in the <rs type="place">Boston court</rs>-house, there was no answer from the antislavery feeling of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>It is sad, therefore, but it seems to me honest, to <hi rend="italics">say</hi> to the fugitive in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, or on his way, that, if the government once seize him, he cannot be protected here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>I think we are bound, an common kindness and honesty, to tell them that there are but <num value="2">two</num> ways that promise any refuge from the horrors of a return to bondage: <num value="1">one</num> is to fly,--to place themselves under the protection of that government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>which, with all her faults, has won the proud distinction that slaves cannot breathe her air,--the fast-anchored isle of empire, where tyrants and slaves may alike find refuge from vengeance and oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/><emph>And <hi rend="italics">this</hi> is the course I would advise every man to adopt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>This, unless there are, in his particular case, imperative reasons to the contrary, is his duty</emph>. If this course be impossible, <pb id="p.78" n="78"/> then the other way is to arm himself, and by resistance secure in the <rs>Free States</rs> a trial for homicide,--trusting that no jury will be able to crush the instincts of humanity as not to hold him justified.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>But some <num value="1">one</num> may ask, Why countenance, even by a mention of it, this public resistance,--you, whose whole enterprise repudiates force?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>Because this is a very different question from that great issue, the abolition of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>On that point, I am willing to wait.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>I can be patient, no matter how often that is defeated by treacherous statesmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>The cause of <num value="3000000">three millions</num> of slaves, the destruction of a great national institution, must proceed slowly; and, like every other change in public sentient, we must wait patiently for it, and there the best policy is, beyond all question, the policy of submission; for that gains, in time, on public sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>But this is a different case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>Who can ask the trebling, anxious fugitive to stop and submit patiently to the overwhelming chances of going back, that his fate may, in some indirect manner, and far-off hour, influence for good the destiny of his fellow-<num value="1000000">millions</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>Such virtue must be self-moved Who could stand and ask it of another?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>True, <persName n="Sims,,Thomas,,," id="n0188.0007.00078.00284" reg="default:Sims,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Sims</surname></persName> returned is a great public event, calculated to make Abolitionists; but the game sickens me when the counters are living men. We have no right to use up fugitives for the manufacture of antislavery sentiment There are those who hang <num value="1">one</num> man to benefit another, and to ceate a wholesome dread of crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>I shrink from using human life as raw material for the production of any state of public opinion, however valuable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>I do not think we have a right to use up fugitive slaves in this pitiless way, in order to extend or deepen an antislavery sentiment At least, I have no right to use them so, without their full consent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>It seems to me, therefore, we are bound to tell those who have taken refuge under the laws of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, <pb id="p.79" n="79"/> what they must expect here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1223"/>This would be not only a sanction, but an encouragement, of illegal detention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1224"/>But, in several of these cases, the man has been seized on some false pretence, known to be a sham, and then the authorities allowed those having him in custody to waive the prosecution of the pretended claim, and serve upon him the real warrant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1225"/>The same disgraceful proceeding was allowed in the <name>Latimer</name> case in this city, his master arresting him as a thief, and afterwards dismissing that process, and claiming him as a slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1334"/>I claim, before you who know the true state of the case,--I claim for the antislavery movement with which this society is identified, that, looking back over its whole course, and considering the men connected with it in the mass, it has been marked by sound judgment, unerring foresight, the most sagacious adaptation of means to ends, the strictest self-discipline, the most thorough research, and an amount of patient and manly argument addressed to the conscience and intellect of the nation, such as no other cause of the kind, in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 7" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> or this country, has ever offered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1335"/>I claim, also, that its course has been marked by a cheerful surrender of all individual claims to merit or leadership,--the most cordial welcoming of the slightest effort, of every honest <pb id="p.106" n="106"/> attempt, to lighten or to break the chain of the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1336"/>I need not waste time by repeating the superfluous confession that we are men, and therefore do not claim to be perfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1337"/>Neither would I be understood as denying that we use denunciation, and ridicule, and every other weapon that the human mind knows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1338"/>We must plead guilty, if there be guilt in not knowing how to separate the sin from the sinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1339"/>With all the fondness for abstractions attributed to us, we are not yet capable of that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1340"/>We are fighting a momentous battle at desperate odds,--<num value="1">one</num> against a <num value="1000">thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1344"/>The cause is not ours, so that we might, rightfully, postpone or put in peril the victory by moderating our demands, stifling our convictions, or filing down our rebukes, to gratify any sickly taste of our own, or to spare the delicate nerves of our neighbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1355"/>What is the denunciation with which we are charged?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1356"/>It is endeavoring, in our faltering human speech, to declare the enormity of the sin of making merchandise of men,--of separating husband and wife,--taking the infant from its mother, and selling the daughter to prostitution,--of a professedly <name>Christian</name> nation denying, by statute, the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> to every <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> man and woman of its population, and making it illegal for <quote><num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num></quote> to meet together, except a white man be present!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1357"/>What is this harsh criticism of motives with which we are charged?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1358"/>It is simply holding the intelligent and deliberate actor responsible for the character and consequences of his acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1359"/>Is there anything inherently wrong in such denunciation or such criticism?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1360"/>This we may claim,--we have never judged a man but out of his own mouth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1416"/>They are obliged to assert this, in order to justify their past indifference or hostility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1417"/>At present, when it suits their purpose to give it some attention, they endeavor to explain the change by alleging that now it has been taken up by men of thoughtful minds, and its claims are urged by fair discussion and able argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1418"/>My claim, then, is this: that neither the charity of the most timid of sects, the sagacity of our wisest converts, nor the culture of the ripest scholars, though all have been aided by our <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> experience, has yet struck out any new method of reaching the public mind, or originated any new argument or train of thought, or discovered any new fact bearing on the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1419"/>When once brought fully into the struggle, they have found it necessary to adopt the same means, to rely on the same <pb id="p.112" n="112"/> arguments, to hold up the same men and the same measures to public reprobation, with the same bold rebuke and unsparing invective that we have used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1420"/>All their conciliatory bearing, their painstaking moderation, their constant and anxious endeavor to draw a broad line between their camp and ours, have been thrown away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1421"/>Just so far as they have been effective laborers, they have found, as we have, their hands against every man, and every man's hand against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1968"/>There are, as I just intimated, <num value="2">two</num> ways of removing a judge known to the <rs>Constitution</rs>: <num value="1">one</num> is, by impeachment; and the other <pb id="p.158" n="158"/> is, by address of the <name>Legislature</name> to the <rs>Governor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1969"/>A judge who commits a crime, whether in his official capacity or not, may be punished by indictment, precisely as any other man may,--this principle may be left out of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1973"/>Why? Because they do not come here to say that he has been guilty of <hi rend="italics">official misconduct</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1975"/>It is enough that the act violates the principles of the common law. All authorities agree in this, and some would seem to lay down the rule still more broadly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1979"/>But the <rs>Constitution</rs> provides another form, which is, that a judge may be removed from office by address of both Houses to His <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> the <rs>Governor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1980"/>In the first place, Gentlemen, let me read to you the source of this power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1981"/><quote>All judicial officers, duly appointed, commissioned, <pb id="p.159" n="159"/> and sworn, shall hold their offices during good behavior, excepting such concerning whom there is a different provision made in this Constitution: <hi rend="italics">Provided</hi>, nevertheless, the <rs>Governor</rs>, with consent of the <name>Council</name>, may remove them upon address of both Houses of the <name>Legislature</name>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1982"/>(Const. of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Mass.</placeName>, Chap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/><num value="3">III</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1984"/>Art. <num value="1">1</num>.) <quote><hi rend="italics">Provided, nevertheless</hi>, the <rs>Governor</rs>, with consent of the <name>Council</name>, may remove them upon the address of both Houses of the <name>Legislature</name>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1985"/>Now, Gentlemen, looking on the face of this, it would be naturally inferred that, notwithstanding his <quote>good behavior,</quote> and without alleging any violation of it, a judge could, nevertheless, be removed by address; that an <quote>address</quote> need not be based on a charge of official misconduct,--that an <quote>address</quote> need not be based on a charge of illegal conduct, in any capacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1986"/>This seems so clear, that I should have left this point without further remark, if <persName n="Loring,Mister,,,," id="n0188.0009.00159.00562" reg="nearbymention:Loring,Edward,Greely,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Loring</surname></persName> had not placed upon your files a remonstrance against the prayer of these petitioners, which remonstrance (I shall not occupy your time by reading it) is based upon the principle, that it would be a hard and unjust procedure if either house should address the <rs>Governor</rs> against him, seeing that he has not violated any State law, or done anything that was illegal, or that was prohibited by the laws of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, and alleging that he has only acted in conformity with the official oath of all officers of the <rs>State</rs> to support the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1987"/>The defence of the remonstrant, as far as we are informed of it, is, that he ought not to be removed, because he has violated no <hi rend="italics">law</hi> of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1988"/>To that plea, Gentlemen, I shall simply reply: the method of removing a judge by <quote>address</quote> does not require that the <rs type="place">House</rs> or Senate should be convinced that he has violated any law whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1989"/><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0188.0009.00159.00563" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> all <persName n="Loring,Mister,,,," id="n0188.0009.00159.00564" reg="nearbymention:Loring,Edward,Greely,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Loring</surname></persName> states in his remonstrance,--that he has broken no law, that he stands legally impeccable before you; which, in other <pb id="p.160" n="160"/> words, is simply to say that he cannot be indicted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1990"/>If he had violated a law, he could be indicted; he comes to this house and says, in effect, <quote>Gentlemen, I cannot be indicted; <hi rend="italics">therefore</hi>, I ought not to be removed.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1991"/>The reply of the petitioners is, A man may be unfit for a judge long before he becomes fit for the state-prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1992"/>Their reply is, (leaving for the time all question of impeachment,) It is not necessary that a judge should render himself liable to indictment, in order to be subject to be removed by <quote>address.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1993"/>He can be removed (as my brother who preceded me [<persName n="Webb,,Seth,,," id="n0188.0009.00160.00565" reg="default:Webb,Seth,,,"><foreName>Seth</foreName> <surname>Webb</surname>, <genName n="junior">Jr.</genName></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>] has well said) for any cause which the <name>Legislature</name>, in its discretion, thinks a fitting cause for his removal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1994"/>Even if he has not violated any law of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, written or unwritten, still he may be removed, if the <name>Legislature</name> thinks the public interest demands it. The matter is entirely within your discretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1995"/>My proof of this is, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the language of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1996"/>The Constitution says: <quote>The Senate shall be a court with full authority to hear and determine all impeachments made by the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> against any officer or officers of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, for misconduct and mal-administration in their offices.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1997"/>(Chap. I. <rs type="role">Sec.</rs> <num value="2">2</num>, Art. <num value="8">8</num>.) Now, suppose it true, as some claim, that such <hi rend="italics">misconduct</hi> must amount to a violation of positive law, that nothing short of that will justify impeachment; the mere fact that the <rs>Constitution</rs> provides another way would be <hi rend="italics">prima facie</hi> evidence that it meant to lay a broader foundation for removal; else, why <hi rend="italics"><num value="2">two</num></hi> methods?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1998"/>If, in his office, he had outraged the laws of the <rs>State</rs>, he could be impeached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1999"/>Is not <num value="1">one</num> remedy sufficient?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2000"/>Why does the <rs>Constitution</rs> provide another?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2001"/>Because the people, through their Constitution, meant to say, <quote>We will not have judges that cannot be removed unless they have violated a statute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2002"/>We will provide, that in case of any misconduct, any unfitting character, <pb id="p.161" n="161"/> any incapacity or loss of confidence, the supreme power of the <name>Legislature</name> may intervene and remove them.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2003"/>If impeachment applies only to <hi rend="italics">official</hi> misconduct, expressly prohibited by statute, as seems to be claimed, then, from the existence of another additional method in the <rs>Constitution</rs>, <num value="1">one</num> would naturally infer that this other power referred to misconduct <hi rend="italics">not</hi> official, and <hi rend="italics">not</hi> expressly prohibited by statute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2004"/>In addition to the mere letter of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and the inference from the fact of <num value="2">two</num> powers being granted, we have the action of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> in times past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2005"/>I have not time for historical details, but the power of address, whenever it has been used in this Commonwealth, has been used to remove judges who had not violated any law. <persName n="Bradbury,Judge,,,," id="n0188.0009.00161.00566" reg="mostcommon:Bradbury,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Bradbury</surname></persName> was removed, I think, for mental incapacity, resulting from advancing age. Of course, intellectual inefficiency is not impeachable; it is not such <quote>misconduct or maladministration</quote> as renders a man liable to impeachment; but the <rs>Constitution</rs>, in order to cover the whole ground, has left with the <name>Legislature</name> the power to remove an inefficient judge, -a judge who has grown too old to perform his duties.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2006"/>But it happens that this clause of the <rs>Constitution</rs> has been passed upon,--not, indeed, by the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>, but I may say by equally high authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2007"/>It has been expounded by some of the ablest men the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> ever knew, and in circumstances which preclude the idea of prejudice or passion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2008"/>It is fortunate for these petitioners, in regard to this claim of the power of the <name>Legislature</name> (which it is said <persName n="Loring,Mister,,,," id="n0188.0009.00161.00567" reg="nearbymention:Loring,Edward,Greely,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Loring</surname></persName>'s friends intend to deny, and which his remonstrance does practically deny),--it is fortunate for them, that in the <orgName n="Constitutional Convention" type="convention">Constitutional Convention of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName></orgName>, in <dateStruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></dateStruct>, this clause of the <rs>Constitution</rs> was deliberately discussed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2009"/>It was discussed, Gentlemen, not when there was a case before the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, when men were divided into parties, when personal sympathy <pb id="p.162" n="162"/> or antipathy might bias men's judgments, but when the debaters were in the most unimpassioned state of mind;--statesmen, endeavoring to found the laws of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> on the best basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2010"/>The discussion was long and able.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2011"/>I shall read you the sentiments of different gentlemen who took part in that discussion, for this purpose,--to show you that this Legislature has an unlimited power of removal for any cause,--whether the law has been violated or not,--whether acts were done by a judge in his official capacity or any other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2012"/>Allow me to remind you, Gentlemen, that there are <num value="2">two</num> questions you are bound to ask. The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is, <hi rend="italics">Can</hi> we remove a judge who is not guilty of any <hi rend="italics">official misconduct</hi>, of any violation of statute law, in any capacity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2013"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> is, If we have the power, <hi rend="italics">ought</hi> we to exercise it in the present case?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2016"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2017"/>Ought we to exercise it?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2018"/>I propose to read you extracts from the speeches in the <orgName n="Massachusetts Convention" type="convention">Massachusetts Convention</orgName> of <dateStruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></dateStruct>, to show that the <name>Legislature</name> has, in the judgment of our ablest lawyers and statesmen, an unlimited authority to ask the removal of judges whenever it sees fit, and for any cause the <name>Legislature</name> thinks sufficient; that the people, the original source of all power, have not parted with their sovereignty in this respect,--did not intend to part with it, and did not part with it. When I have convinced you, if I shall succeed in convincing you, that you have this authority, I shall, with your permission, say a few words to enforce the other point, that you ought to exercise it according to the prayer of the petitioners.</p>

<p>By the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> article of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, any judge may be removed from his office by the <rs>Governor</rs>, with the advice of the <name>Council</name>, upon the address of a bare majority of both Houses of the <name>Legislature</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2024"/>The committee are of opinion that this provision has a tendency materially to impair the independence of the judges, and to destroy the efficacy of the clause which declares they shall hold their offices during good behavior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2025"/>The tenure of good behavior seems to the committee indispensable to guard judges, on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, from the effects of sudden resentments and temporary prejudices entertained by the people, and, on the other hand, from the influence which ambitious and powerful men naturally exert over those who are dependent upon their good-will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2026"/>A provision which should at once secure to the people a power of removal in cases of palpable misconduct or incapacity, and at the same time secure to the judges a reasonable permanency in their offices, seems of the greatest utility; and such a provision will, in the opinion of the committee, be obtained by requiring that the removal instead of being upon <pb id="p.164" n="164"/> the address of a <hi rend="italics">majority</hi>, shall be upon the address of <hi rend="italics"><num value="2">two</num> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></hi> of the members present of each House of the <name>Legislature</name>.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2028"/>Observe, even this committee, although they say they think it dangerous, do not advise it should be stricken out; but they advise it should be limited by requiring a <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> vote, and this is all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2029"/>Remember, Gentlemen, that I read the following extracts, not to show the opinion of this Convention as to the value or the danger of this power; I merely wish to show you that, in the opinion of the ablest lawyers of the <rs>State</rs>, the <rs>Constitution</rs>, as it then stood, (and <hi rend="italics">it stands now precisely as it stood then</hi>,) gave to this Legislature unlimited authority to remove judges, for any cause they saw fit; and that, while all the speakers were fully aware of its liability to abuse, no speaker denied its unlimited extent, or proposed to strike the power from the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2162"/>The <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> is the grand inquest,--they are tried by the <name>Senate</name>, and have the right of being heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2163"/>But the <rs>Constitution</rs> admits that there may be cases in which judges may be removed without supposing a crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2164"/>But how is it to be done by this resolution?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2167"/>He would suppose the case, not of mental disability, but the loss of public confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2168"/>He knew that such cases were not to be anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2169"/>But he would look to times when the principle might be brought into operation, when the judge, by indulging strong party feelings, or from any other cause, should so far have lost the confidence of the community that his usefulness should be destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2170"/>He ought in such cases to be removed; but if witnesses were to be summoned to prove specific charges, it would be impossible to remove him. A man may do a vast deal of mischief, and yet evade the penalty of the law,--a judge may act in such a manner that an intelligent community may think their rights in danger, and yet commit no offence against any written or unwritten law. Men are more likely to act in such manner as to render themselves unworthy to be trusted, than so as to subject themselves to trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2171"/>The great argument for the amendment is, that it is necessary to secure the independence of the judiciary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2196"/>The people voted on that amendment, voted nay, and declined to insert it in the <rs>Constitution</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2197"/>Now, Gentlemen, what is my argument?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2198"/>Here is a debate on this clause, not by men heated with passion, not by men with party purposes to serve, but by men acting as statesmen, in the coolest, most deliberate, and temperate mood,--men of various parties, Whig and -<pb id="p.174" n="174"/> Democratic,and every <num value="1">one</num> of them asserts, without a dissenting voice, that this provision is inserted for the purpose of giving the <name>Legislature</name> the power to remove a judge, when he has not violated any law of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2199"/>In addition to this, Gentlemen, I will read the remark of <persName n="Shaw,Chief-Justice,,,," id="n0188.0009.00174.00620" reg="nearbymention:Shaw,Lemuel,,,"><roleName n="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</roleName> <surname>Shaw</surname></persName>, when he was counsel for the <rs type="place">House</rs> against <persName n="Prescott,Judge,,,," id="n0188.0009.00174.00621" reg="nearbymention:Prescott,William,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Prescott</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Groton, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049856">Groton</placeName>, who was removed on impeachment, you will recollect, in <dateStruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2200"/>On that occasion, <persName n="Shaw,Judge,,,," id="n0188.0009.00174.00622" reg="nearbymention:Shaw,Lemuel,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Shaw</surname></persName> was counsel for the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, and made some comments on this provision, which, as his opinion has a deserved weight in matters of constitutional law, it is well to read here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2201"/>He says:--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2202"/><quote>It is true, that, by another course of proceeding, warranted by a different provision of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, any officer may be removed by the <rs>Executive</rs>, at the will and pleasure of a bare majority of the <name>Legislature</name>; a will which the <rs>Executive</rs> in most cases would have little power and inclination to resist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2203"/>The Legislature, without either allegation or proof, has but to pronounce the <foreign lang="la">sic volo, sic jubeo</foreign>, and the officer is at once deprived of his place, and of all the rank, the powers and emoluments, belonging to it. And yet, perhaps, this provision (whether wise or not I will not now stop to consider) is hardly sufficient to justify the extraordinary alarm which has been so eloquently expressed for the liberty and security of the people, or to affix upon the <rs>Constitution</rs> the charge of containing features more odious and oppressive than those of Turkish despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2204"/>The truth is, that the security of our rights depends rather upon the general tenor and character, than upon particular provisions of our Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2205"/>The love of freedom and of justice,--so deeply engraven upon the hearts of the people, and interwoven in the whole texture of our social institutions,--a thorough and intelligent acquaintance with their rights, and a firm determination to maintain them,--in short, those moral and intellectual qualities without which social liberty cannot exist, and over which despotism can obtain no control,--these stamp the character and give security to the rights of the free people of this <pb id="p.175" n="175"/> Commonwealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2206"/>So long as such a character is maintained, no danger perhaps need be apprehended from the arbitrary course of proceeding, under the provision of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, to which I have alluded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2207"/>But, Sir, we have never for a moment imagined that the proceedings on this impeachment could be influenced or affected by that provision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2208"/>The <num value="2">two</num> modes of proceeding are altogether distinct, and, in my humble apprehension, were designed to effect totally distinct objects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2209"/>No, Sir; had the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> expected to attain their object by any means short of the allegation, proof, and conviction of criminal misconduct, an address, and not an impeachment, would have been the course of proceeding adopted by them.</quote></p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2211"/>The people of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> have always chosen to keep their judges, in some measure, dependent on the popular will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2212"/>It is a Colonial trait, and the sovereign State has preserved it. Under the <rs>King</rs>, though he appointed the judges, the people jealously preserved their hold on the bench, by keeping the salaries year by year dependent on the vote of the popular branch of the <name>Legislature</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2213"/>This control was often exercised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2214"/>When <persName n="Oliver,Judge,,,," id="n0188.0009.00175.00624" reg="mostcommon:Oliver,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Oliver</surname></persName> took pay of the <rs>King</rs>, they impeached him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2217"/>This proposition the <rs>Convention</rs> refused to accept; the utmost the <rs>Convention</rs> would recommend to the people was, that the judge should have notice and liberty to defend himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2218"/>Even this limitation on your power the people refused to adopt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2219"/>They were fully warned, and deliberately, on mature reflection, decided that it was safe and wise to intrust you with <hi rend="italics">unlimited discretion</hi> in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2220"/>With such a page in our history, it is not competent for the press or the friends of <persName n="Loring,Judge,,,," id="n0188.0009.00176.00627" reg="nearbymention:Loring,Edward,Greely,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Loring</surname></persName> to argue that no such power ought to have been given you, and that it is too dangerous to be used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2221"/>The people alone have the right to decide that question, and <hi rend="italics">they have decided it</hi>. When, after full deliberation, they gave you the power, they said, in effect, that occasions might arise requiring its exercise, and on such fitting occasions they wished it exercised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2222"/>Doubtless, Gentlemen, this is a grave power, and <num value="1">one</num> to be used only on important occasions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2223"/>We are bound to show you, not light and trifling reasons for the removal of <persName n="Loring,Judge,,,," id="n0188.0009.00176.00628" reg="nearbymention:Loring,Edward,Greely,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Loring</surname></persName>, but such grave and serious reasons, such weighty cause, as will justify your interference, and make this use of your authority strengthen rather than weaken the proper independence of the bench.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2224"/>Indeed, the power is in itself a wise, good, and necessary <num value="1">one</num>, and should be lodged somewhere in every government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2225"/><placeName reg="The Boston">The Boston</placeName> papers, in all their arguments on this point, take it for granted that the people are to be always under guardianship,--that government is a grand <placeName reg="Probate Court">Probate Court</placeName> to prevent the people &mdash; the insane and always under-age people &mdash; from wasting their own property and cutting their own throat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2226"/>Not such is the theory of republican institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2227"/>The true theory is, that the people came of age on the <dateStruct value="1776-07-4"><day reg="4">fourth</day> day of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year>1776</year>,</dateStruct> and <hi rend="italics">can be</hi> <pb id="p.177" n="177"/> rusted to manage their own affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2228"/>The people, with their practical common-sense, instinctive feeling of right and wrong, and manly love of fair play, are the true conservative element in a just government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2229"/>It is true, the people are not always right; but it is true, also, that the people are not often wrong,--less often, surely, than their leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2230"/>The theory of our government is, that the purity of the bench is a matter which concerns every individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2231"/>Whenever, therefore, guilt, recklessness, or incapacity shield themselves on the bench, by technical shifts and evasions, against direct collision with the law, it is meant that the reserved power of the people shall intervene, and save the <rs>State</rs> from harm.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2232"/>It is easy to conceive many occasions for the exercise of such a power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2807"/>There was another charge brought against them,--it was, that they had no reverence for dignitaries.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2980"/>Gentlemen: Now that the press has ceased its ridicule of your homage to Morphy at the <rs type="place">Revere House</rs>,--a criticism of little importance,--I wish to present the scene to you in a different light.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2981"/>You, <rs type="role" reg="Mister-Chief-Justice">Mr. Chief Justice</rs>, represent <hi rend="italics">the law</hi> of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>; to you, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, is committed the moral guardianship of the young men of her University.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2982"/>Yet I find you both at a table of revellers, under a roof whose chief support and profit come from the illegal sale of intoxicating drink, and which boasts itself the champion and head of an organized, flagrant, and avowed contempt of the laws of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2983"/>No <num value="1">one</num> was surprised to see at your side a Mayor who owes his office to the votes of that disorderly band whose chief is the <rs type="place">Revere House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2984"/>Few wondered at the presence of a Professor placed by private munificence to watch over the piety and morals of your College, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>; though a manly protest against fashionable vice might do something to redeem <pb id="p.238" n="238"/> the office from seeming only an eaves-dropping spy on the opinions and manners of young men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2985"/>But you, <rs type="role" reg="Mister-Chief-Justice">Mr. Chief Justice</rs>, know that <num value="3">three</num> quarters, if not <num value="4">four</num> <num value=".2">fifths</num>, of all crime result from habits of intoxication; that <num value="9">nine</num> <num value=".1">tenths</num>, at least, of all the murderers you have sent to the gallows had never been murderers had they not <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> been drunkards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2986"/>You can look round you, and back for <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>, and see places at the bar and on the bench, once filled by genius and hope, now vacant,--their tenants in drunkards' graves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2987"/>You know how fearful the peril which modern civilization, and especially popular institutions, encounter from the cheapness of liquor, and the habits of indulgence in all our great cities; you know the long and earnest labors of noble men, for <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>, in both hemispheres, against this evil, and the momentous experiment they are trying of legal prohibition to arrest it, resulting here in a stringent law against the sale of intoxicating drinks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2988"/>You know also that the <rs type="place">Revere House</rs> is the insolent leader of that heartless and selfish faction which, defeated before the people, seeks, by unblushing defiance of law, to overbear opinion and statute.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2989"/>And you, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, the moral guardian of the young men of our University, well know its venerable statutes and unceasing efforts to prevent the use of wine within its walls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2990"/>You know how many, often the brightest, names on your catalogue, too early marked with the asterisk of death, owe their untimely end to wine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2991"/>Both of you know that the presence of men holding such offices as yours goes as far as recreant office and reputation can to make a bad roof respectable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2992"/>Yet I find you both at a midnight revel, doing your utmost to give character to a haunt which boasts its open and constant defiance of the moral sense of the <rs>State</rs>, solemnly expressed in its statutes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2993"/>No <num value="1">one</num> denies, Gentlemen, your right to indulge what <pb id="p.239" n="239"/> social habits you please in the privacy of your own dwellings; or, in travelling, to use the customary accommodations of an inn, even though intoxicating drink is sold on its premises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2994"/>Few will care to criticise, if, choosing some decent roof, you join your fellows and mock the moral sentiment of the community by a public carousal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2995"/>But while you hold these high offices, we, the citizens of a Commonwealth whose character you represent, emphatically deny your right to appear at illegal revels in a gilded grog-shop, which, but for the sanction of such as you, had long ago met the indictment it deserves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2996"/>How can we expect the police to execute a law upon which the <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</rs> pours contempt by his example?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2997"/>How shall the grand jury indict the nuisance of which the <rs>Supreme Bench</rs> has, for an hour, made a part?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2998"/>We, the citizens, have a right to claim that, should public opinion, by our labors, reach the point of presenting these gorgeous grog-shops at the criminal bar, we shall not find their frequenters on the bench.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2999"/>Again and again, <rs type="role" reg="Mister-Chief-Justice">Mr. Chief Justice</rs>, have I heard you, at critical moments, in a voice whose earnest emotion half checked its utterance, remind your audience of the sacred duty resting on each man to respect and obey the law; assuring us that the welfare of society was bound up in this individual submission to existing law. How shall the prisoner at the bar reconcile the grave sincerity of the <hi rend="italics">magistrate</hi> with this heedless disregard by the <hi rend="italics">man</hi> of most important laws?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3000"/>If, again, the times should call you to bid us smother justice and humanity at the command of statutes, we may remind you with what heartless indifference you treated the law you were sworn and paid to uphold, and <num value="1">one</num> on which the hearts of the best men in the <rs>State</rs> were most strongly set. Was it not enough that you let History paint you bowing beneath a slave-hunter's chain to enter your own court-room?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3001"/>but must you also <pb id="p.240" n="240"/> present yourself in public, lifting to your lips the wine-cup, which, by the laws of the <rs>State</rs> over whose courts you preside, it is an indictable offence and a nuisance to sell you?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3002"/>And let me remind you, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, that even your young men sometimes pause amid scenes of temptation, or in our streets, where every <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> door opens to vice,--pause at some chance thought of home or rising regard for the sentiment of the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3003"/>And, Sir, should such frail purpose of even <num value="1">one</num> youth falter before the sight of his <rs type="role2">President</rs> in a circle of wine-bibbers, and that fall lead to an unhonored grave, you will be bound to remember that, in the check and example you promised and were expected and set to hold upon him, you wholly failed; that in the most impressible moments of his life he saw the virtue of the <rs>State</rs> struggling with its sensual indulgence, its lust of dishonorable gain, its base pandering to appetite, already too strong; and in that struggle he saw your weight ostentatiously thrown into the scale of open and contemptuous disregard of the moral sense of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3004"/>I well remember when, from a pulpit constantly boasting that its new creed had thrown away a formal and hollow faith and brought in the wholesome doctrine of works, you painted, so vividly, how hard it is for young men to say <quote>No.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3005"/>Is this, Sir, the method you choose to illustrate the practical value of the new faith, and this the help you extend to the faltering virtue of your pupils, giving the sanction of <num value="4">four</num> character and office to the prince of rum-sellers and law-breakers, and flinging insult on <num value="1">one</num> of the noblest reforms of the age?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3006"/>I admit the right and duty of minorities to disregard immoral or unconstitutional laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3007"/>But no <num value="1">one</num> ever though the prohibitory law immoral, and you, <rs type="role" reg="Mister-Chief-Justice">Mr. Chief Justice</rs>, have affirmed its constitutionality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3008"/>Neither do I now arraign you, Gentlemen, for your private habit of wineing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3009"/><pb id="p.241" n="241"/> I do not complain that a judge, who sees so much crime come from it, still gives it his countenance; that a clergyman &mdash; the chief apostle of whose faith declared he would eat no meat while the world stood, if so doing made his brother to offend-still throws that stumbling-block in the way of his pupils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3010"/>But I arraign the <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</rs> of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, and the <rs>President</rs> of <orgName n="Harvard University" type="university">Harvard University</orgName>, because, when the rum interest of the <rs>State</rs> is marshalling its strength to beat down a good and constitutional law by gross, open, and avowed disobedience, they are found lending their names, character, and office to give respectability to the grog-shop whose wealth enables it to lead that dishonorable and disloyal effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3011"/>As a citizen, I claim that you disgraced your places, if not yourselves; and I hope the day will come when such insult by such high officers to any statute of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, much more to <num value="1">one</num> representing its highest moral purpose, will be deemed cause enough to impeach the <num value="1">one</num> and remove the other.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3021"/>Appreciating the lyceum system as I do, looking upon it as <num value="1">one</num> of the departments of the national school, truly American in its origin, and eminently republican in its character and end, I feel how eloquently his voice would have done it justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3029"/>For decent justice has not been done to woman, in regard to her influence, either upon literature or society; and I welcome with inexpressible delight the inauguration of a course of lectures national and American in the proper sense of the words.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3030"/>There are men who prate about <quote>nationality,</quote> and <quote>the empire,</quote> and <quote>manifest destiny,</quote> --using brave word, when their minds rise no higher than some petty mass of white States making money out of cotton and corn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3031"/>My idea of American nationality makes it the last best growth of the thoughtful mind of the century, treading under foot sex and race, caste and condition, and collecting on the broad bosom of what deserves the name of an empire, under the shelter of noble, just, and equal laws, all races, all customs, all religions, all languages, all literature, and all ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3032"/>I remember, a year or <num value="2">two</num> ago, they told us of a mob at Milwaukie that forced a man to bring out the <pb id="p.244" n="244"/> body of his wife, born in <placeName key="tgn,1000004" n="1.000 95" reg="asia">Asia</placeName>,--which, according to the custom of her forefathers, he was about to burn,--and compelled him to submit to American funeral rites, which his soul abhorred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3033"/>The sheriff led the mob, and the press of the <rs>State</rs> vindicated the act. This is not my idea of American civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3034"/>They will show you at <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> the stately column of <persName><roleName n="Emperor">the Emperor</roleName> <foreName>Trajan</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3036"/>Just such is my idea of the empire, broad enough and brave enough to admit both sexes, all creeds, and all tongues in the triumphal procession of this great daughter of the west of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3037"/>[Loud applause.] That is the reason why I hail this step in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>,--the brain of the <rs>Union</rs>,--saying to the negro and to woman, <quote>Take your place among the teachers of American Democracy.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3038"/>[Applause.] I said justice had never been done to woman for her influence upon literature and society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3039"/>Society is the natural outgrowth of the New Testament, and yet nothing deserving of the name ever existed in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> until, <measure n="2centuries" type="date">two centuries</measure> ago, in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france">France</placeName>, woman called it into being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3040"/>Society,--the only field where the sexes have ever met on terms of equality, the arena where character is formed and studied, the cradle and the realm of public opinion, the crucible of ideas, the world's university, at once a school and a theatre, the spur and the crown of ambition, the tribunal which unmasks pretension and stamps real merit, the power that gives government leave to be, and outruns the lazy Church in fixing the moral sense of the age,--who shall fitly describe the lofty place of this element in the history of the last <measure n="2centuries" type="date">two centuries</measure>? Who shall deny that, more than anything else, it <pb id="p.245" n="245"/> deserves the name of the most controlling element in the history of the <measure n="2centuries" type="date">two centuries</measure> just finished?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3041"/>And yet this is the realm of woman, the throne which, like a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> conqueror, she founded and then filled.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3042"/>So with literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3043"/>The literature of <measure n="3centuries" type="date">three centuries</measure> ago is not decent to be read: we expurgate it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3044"/>No need now to expurgate all you read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3045"/>Woman, too, is now an author; and I undertake to say that the literature of the next century will be richer than the classic epochs, for that cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3046"/>Truth is <num value="1">one</num> forever, absolute; but opinion is truth filtered through the moods, the blood, the disposition, of the spectator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3047"/>Man has looked at creation, and given us his impressions, in <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> literature and <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0188.0013.00245.00903" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num>-sided, half-way, all awry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3048"/>Woman now takes the stand to give us her views of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> works and her own creation; and exactly in proportion as woman, though equal, is eternally different from man, just in that proportion will the literature of the next century be doubly rich, because we shall have both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3049"/>You might as well plant yourself in the desert, under the changeless gray and blue, and assert that you have seen all the wonders of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> pencil, as maintain that a male literature, Latin, <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName>, or Asiatic, can be anything but <num value="0.5">a half</num> part, poor and <num value="1">one</num>-sided; as well develop only muscle, shutting out sunshine and color, and starving the flesh from your angular limbs, and then advise men to scorn <persName><foreName>Titian</foreName></persName>'s flesh and the <name>Apollo</name>, since you have exhausted manly beauty, as think to stir all the depths of music with only half the chords.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3050"/>[Applause.] The diapason of human thought was never struck till <name>Christian</name> culture summoned woman into the republic of letters; and experience as well as nature tells us, <quote>what <name n="God" type="God">God</name> hath joined, let not man put asunder.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5318"/>Very briefly let me state the points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5319"/>No government provides ft r its own death; therefore there can be no constitutional right to secede.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5320"/>But there is a revolutionary right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5321"/>The <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> establishes, what the heart of every American acknowledges, that the people &mdash; mark y u, the people!--have always an inherent, paramount, his alienable right to change their governments, whenever they think &mdash; whenever <hi rend="italics">they</hi> think &mdash; that it will minister to their happiness.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5492"/>I know, Ladies and Gentlemen, that actions-deeds, not words &mdash; are the fitting duty of the hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5493"/>Yet, still, cannon think in this day of ours, and it is only by putting thought behind arms that we render them worthy, in any degree, of the civilization of the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5500"/>We are to show the world, <pb id="p.416" n="416"/> if it be indeed so, that democratic institutions are strong enough for such an hour as this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5501"/>Very terrible as is the conspiracy, momentous as is the peril, Democracy welcomes the struggle, confident that she stands like no delicately-poised throne in the Old World, but, like the <name>Pyramid</name>, on its broadest base, able to be patient with national evils,--generously patient with the long forbearance of <num value="3">three</num> generations,--and strong enough when, after that they reveal themselves in their own inevitable and hideous proportions, to pronounce and execute the unanimous verdict,--Death!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5502"/>Now, Gentlemen, it is in such a spirit, with such a purpose, that I come before you to-night to sustain this war. Whence came this war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5503"/>You and I need not curiously investigate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5510"/>A party victory may have been the <hi rend="italics">occasion</hi> of this outbreak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5512"/>If you will look upon the map, and notice that every Slave State has joined or tried to join the rebellion, and no Free State has done so, I think you will not doubt substantially the origin of this convulsion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5513"/>Now, Ladies and Gentlemen, you know me &mdash; those of you who know me at all &mdash; simply as an Abolitionist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5514"/>I am proud and glad that you should have known me as such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5515"/>In the <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure> that are gone,--I say it with no wish to offend any man before me,--but in the quarter of a century that has passed, I could find no place where an American could stand with decent self-respect, except in constant, uncontrollable, and loud protest against the sin of his native land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5516"/>But, Ladies and Gentlemen, do not imagine that I come here to-night to speak simply and exclusively as an Abolitionist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5517"/>My interest in this war, simply and exclusively as an Abolitionist, is about as much gone as yours in a novel where the hero has won the lady, and the marriage has been comfortably celebrated in the last chapter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5518"/>I know the danger of political prophecy,--a kaleidoscope of which not even a Yankee can guess the next combination,--but for all that, I venture to offer my opinion, that on this continent the system of domestic slavery has received its death-blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5519"/>[Loud and long-continued applause.] Let me tell you why I think so. Leaving out of view war with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 7" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, which I do not expect, there are but <num value="3">three</num> paths out of this war. <num value="1">One</num> is, the <rs>North</rs> conquers; the other is, the <rs>South</rs> conquers; and the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> is, a compromise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5520"/>Now, if the <rs>North</rs> conquers, or there be a compromise, <num value="1">one</num> or the other of <num value="2">two</num> things <pb id="p.418" n="418"/> must come,--either the old Constitution or a new <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5521"/>I believe that, so far as the slavery clauses of the <rs>Constitution</rs> of <dateStruct value="1889--"><year reg="1889">1889</year></dateStruct> are concerned, it is dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5522"/>It seems to me impossible that the thrifty and painstaking North, after keeping <num value="600000">six hundred thousand</num> men idle for <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, at a cost of <measure n="2000000dollars" type="currency">two million dollars</measure> a day; after that flag lowered at <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>; after <persName n="Baker,,,,," id="n0188.0021.00418.01708" reg="mostcommon:Baker,nomatch:0"><surname>Baker</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lyon,,,,," id="n0188.0021.00418.01709" reg="mostcommon:Lyon,nomatch:0"><surname>Lyon</surname></persName> and <persName n="Ellsworth,,,,," id="n0188.0021.00418.01710" reg="mostcommon:Ellsworth,nomatch:0"><surname>Ellsworth</surname></persName> and <persName n="Winthrop,,,,," id="n0188.0021.00418.01711" reg="mostcommon:Winthrop,Robert,C.,,:1"><surname>Winthrop</surname></persName> and <persName n="Putnam,,,,," id="n0188.0021.00418.01712" reg="mostcommon:Putnam,nomatch:0"><surname>Putnam</surname></persName> and <persName n="Wesselhoeft,,,,," id="n0188.0021.00418.01713" reg="mostcommon:Wesselhoeft,nomatch:0"><surname>Wesselhoeft</surname></persName> have given their lives to quell the rebellion; after our <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> boys, hurrying from ploughed field and workshop to save the capital, have been foully murdered on the pavements of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, -I cannot believe in a North so lost, so craven, as to put back slavery where it stood on the <dateStruct value="-03-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5523"/>[Cheers.] But if there be reconstruction without those slave clauses, then in a little while, longer or shorter, slavery dies,--indeed, on any other basis but the basis of <dateStruct value="1889--"><year reg="1889">1889</year></dateStruct>, she has nothing else now to do but to die. On the contrary, if the <rs>South</rs>--no, I cannot say conquers &mdash; my lips will not form that word &mdash; but if she balks us of victory, the only way she can do it is to write Emancipation on her own banner, and thus bribe the friends of liberty in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to allow its aristocrats and traders to divide the majestic republic whose growth and trade they fear and envy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5524"/>Either way, the slave goes free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5525"/>Unless <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 7" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> flings her fleets along the coast, the <rs>South</rs> can never spring into separate existence, except from the basis of negro freedom; and I for <num value="1">one</num> cannot yet believe that the <rs>North</rs> will consent again to share his chains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5526"/>Exclusively as an Abolitionist, therefore, I have little more interest in this war than the frontiersman's wife had in his struggle with the bear, when she did n't care which whipped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5527"/>But before I leave the <name>Abolitionists</name>, let me say <num value="1">one</num> word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5528"/>Some men say we are the cause of this war. Gentlemen, you do us too much honor!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5529"/>If it be so, we have reason to be proud of it; for in my heart, as an American, I believe <pb id="p.419" n="419"/> this year the most glorious of the <rs>Republic</rs> since <dateStruct value="1876--"><year reg="1876">1876</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5530"/>The <rs>North</rs>, craven and contented until now, like <placeName reg="Mammon">Mammon</placeName>, saw nothing even in heaven but the golden pavement; to-day she throws off her chains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5531"/>We have a North, as <placeName reg="Daniel Webster">Daniel Webster</placeName> said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5532"/>This is no epoch for nations to blush at. <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 7" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> might blush in <dateStruct value="1620--"><year reg="1620">1620</year></dateStruct>, when Englishmen trembled at a fool's frown, and were silent when <persName><foreName>James</foreName></persName> forbade them to think; but not in <dateStruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></dateStruct>, when an outraged people cut off his son's head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5534"/>In my view, the bloodiest war ever waged is infinitely better than the happiest slavery which ever fattened men into obedience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5535"/>And yet I love peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5536"/>But it is real peace; not peace such as we have had; not peace that meant lynch-law in the <name>Carolinas</name> and mob-law in New York; not peace that meant chains around <placeName reg="Boston Court-House">Boston Court-House</placeName>, a gag on the lips of statesmen, and the slave sobbing himself to sleep in curses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5537"/>No more such peace for me; no peace that is not born of justice, and does not recognize the rights of every race and every man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5538"/>Some men say they would view this war as white men. I condescend to no such narrowness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5539"/>I view it as an <orgName n="American Citizen" type="newspaper">American citizen</orgName>, proud to be the citizen of an empire that knows neither black nor white, neither <persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0188.0021.00419.01715" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> nor <address><street n="Indian burial">Indian</street></address>, but holds an equal sceptre over all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5605"/>What shall we do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5606"/>The answer to that question comes partly from what we think has been the cause of this convulsion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5921"/>I quite agree with the view which my friend (<persName n="Conway,Reverend,M.,D.,," id="n0188.0022.00448.01819" reg="default:Conway,M.,D.,,"><roleName n="Reverend">Rev.</roleName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Conway</surname></persName>) takes of the present situation of the country, and of our future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5922"/>I have no hope, as he has not, that the intelligent purpose of our government will ever find us a way out of this war. I think, if we find any way out of it, we are to stumble out of it by the gradual education of the people, making their own way on, a great mass, without leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5923"/>I do not think that anything which we can call the <hi rend="italics">government</hi> has any <hi rend="italics">purpose</hi> to get rid of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5924"/>On the contrary, I think the present purpose of the government, so far as it has now a purpose, is to end the war and save slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5925"/>I believe <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0188.0022.00448.01820" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is conducting this war, at present, with the purpose of saving slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5926"/>That is his present line of policy, so far as trustworthy indications of any policy reach us. The Abolitionists are charged with a desire to make this a political war. All civil wars are necessarily political wars, -they can hardly be anything else.

He knows as well as we do at this moment, as well as every man this side of a lunatic hospital knows, that, if he wants to save lives and money, the way to end this war is to strike at slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5928"/>I do not believe that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0188.0022.00448.01822" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> himself is mad or idiotic enough to have avoided that idea, even if he had tried to <pb id="p.449" n="449"/> do so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5930"/>It was not to save rations, it was not to get rid of individuals; it was to conciliate New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5931"/>It was a political move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5932"/>When <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0188.0022.00449.01827" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, by an equivocal declaration, nullifies <persName n="Hunter,General,,,," id="n0188.0022.00449.01828" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName>, he does not do it because he doubts either the justice or the efficiency of <persName n="Hunter,,,,," id="n0188.0022.00449.01829" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><surname>Hunter</surname></persName>'s proclamation; he does it because he is afraid of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> on the right hand, and the <orgName n="Daily Advertiser" type="newspaper">Daily Advertiser</orgName> on the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5933"/>[Laughter.] He has not taken <num value="1">one</num> step since he entered the <name>Presidency</name> that has been a purely military step, and he could not. A civil war can hardly be anything but a political war. That is, all civil wars are a struggle between opposite ideas, and armies are but the tools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5934"/>If <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0188.0022.00449.01830" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> believed in the <rs>North</rs> and in Liberty, he would let our army act on the principles of Liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5935"/>He does not. He believes in the <rs>South</rs> as the most efficient and vital instrumentality at the present moment, therefore defers to it. I had a friend who went to <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>, went among the negro huts, and saw the pines that were growing between them shattered with shells and cannonballs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5936"/>He said to the negroes, <quote>When those balls came, were you here?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5937"/><quote>Yes.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5938"/><quote>Did n't you run?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5939"/><quote>No, massa, we knew they were not meant for us.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5940"/>It was a sublime, childlike faith in the justice, the providence, of the <name>Almighty</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5942"/>For they know he is fighting a political war, as all of us must; the only question is, In the service of which political idea shall the war be waged,--in the service of saving the <rs>Union</rs> as it was, or the <rs>Union</rs> as it ought to be?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5943"/><persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0188.0022.00450.01832" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> dare not choose between these <num value="2">two</num> phrases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5944"/>He is waging a war which he dare not describe, in the service of a political idea that he dare not shape into words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5945"/>He is not fighting vigorously and heartily enough even to get good terms in case of a treaty,--not to talk of victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5946"/>All savages call clemency cowardice; they respect nothing but force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5947"/>The Southern barbarians mistake clemency for cowardice; and every act of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0188.0022.00450.01833" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, which he thinks is conciliation, they take for evidence of his cowardice, or his distrust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5948"/>I do not say that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0188.0022.00450.01834" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> is a traitor, but I say this, that if he had been a traitor from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, he could not have served the <rs>South</rs> better than he has done since he was commander-in-chief [applause]; he could not have carried on the war in more exact deference to the politics of that side of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5949"/>And almost the same thing may be said of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0188.0022.00450.01835" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>,--that if he had been a traitor, he could not have worked better to strengthen <num value="1">one</num> side, and hazard the success of the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5950"/>There is more danger to-day that <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0188.0022.00450.01836" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:4"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> will be taken than <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5951"/><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> is besieged more truly than <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> is. After <measure n="15months" type="date">fifteen months</measure> of war, such is the position of the strongest nation on the globe; for the <num value="19">nineteen</num> Northern States, led by a government which serves their ideas, are the strongest nation on the face of the globe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5952"/>Now, I think, and if I were in the <name>Senate</name> I should have said to the government, that every man who under the present policy loses his life in the swamps of the <rs>South</rs>, and every dollar sent there to be wasted, only prolongs a murderous and wasteful war, waged for no purpose whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5953"/>This <pb id="p.451" n="451"/> u my meaning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5954"/>In this war, mere victory on a battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5955"/>field amounts to nothing, contributes little or nothing toward ending the war. If our present policy led to decisive victories, therefore, (which it does not,) it would be worth little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5956"/>The war can only be ended by annihilating that oligarchy which formed and rules the <rs>South</rs> and makes the war,--by annihilating a state of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5957"/>No social state is really annihilated, except when it is replaced by another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5958"/>Our present policy neither aims to annihilate that state of things we call <quote>the <rs>South</rs>,</quote> made up of pride, idleness, ignorance, barbarism, theft, and murder, nor to replace it with a substitute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5959"/>Such an aimless war I call wasteful and murderous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5960"/>Better that that South should go to-day, than that we should prolong such a war. To keep <num value="500000">500,000</num> men in the field, we must have <num value="560000">560,000</num> men on the rolls, for there are <num value="58000">58,000</num> or <num value="60000">60,000</num> men necessarily invalid in an army of half a <num value="1000000">million</num>; and to keep that <num value="560000">560,000</num> good, you must have a fresh recruiting every year of <num value="123000">123,000</num> men. This nation is to give, year by year, while this war lasts, <num value="123000">123,000</num> men to the army, and that number are to fall out of the ranks, according to the experience of the last <measure n="16months" type="date">sixteen months</measure>, by death either from disease or the sword; or, if not death, then wounds so serious as to make a man's life only a burden to himself and the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5961"/>A <num value="123000">hundred and twenty-three thousand</num> men a year, and, I suppose, a <num value="1000000">million</num> of dollars a day, and a government without a purpose I!</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5970"/>Exasperated by suffering, grown haughty by success, the moment she goes off, is such a neighbor likely to treat us any better, with our imaginary line between us, than she has treated us for <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure> while she held the sceptre?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5971"/>The moment we ask for terms, she counts it victory, and the war in another shape goes on.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5972"/>A large army, immense expenses, a foreign party encamped among us, a despotic government, using necessarily despotic war powers,--that is the future until slavery is destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5975"/>Now, therefore, until this nation announces, in some form or other, that this is a war, not against <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0188.0022.00452.01838" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, but against the system; until the whole nation indorses the resolution of the New York <orgName n="Chamber of Commerce" type="org">Chamber of Commerce</orgName>, <quote>Better every rebel die than <num value="1">one</num> loyal soldier,</quote> [applause,] and begs of the government, demands of the government, to speak that word which is victory and peace,--until we do that, we shall have no prospect of peace.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6098"/>Sir: You misrepresent me when you say that I discourage enlistments in the <rs>Union</rs> armies; though, for aught I know, the garbled extracts and lying versions of New York papers may make me do that and many other things I never thought of. You know, by experience, that the <rs>American</rs> press, in general, neither tries nor means to speak truth about Abolitionists of any type.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6099"/>I have never discouraged enlistments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6100"/>In the <rs>Union</rs> army are my kindred and some of my dearest friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6101"/>Others rest in fresh and honorable graves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6102"/>No <num value="1">one</num> of these ever heard a word from me to discourage his enlisting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6103"/>I had the honor, last <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, to address the <orgName type="regiment" key="MA14">Fourteenth Massachusetts</orgName> at <placeName key="tgn,7013034" n="1.000 10" reg="Fort Albany,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America">Fort Albany</placeName>, and, this very week, the <orgName type="regiment" key="MA33">Thirty-third Massachusetts</orgName> at <placeName reg="Camp Cameron">Camp Cameron</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6104"/>No man in either regiment heard anything from my lips to discourage his whole-souled service of the <rs>Union</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6105"/>Allow me to state my own position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6106"/>From <dateStruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, I was a Disunionist, and sought to break this Union, convinced that disunion was the only righteous path, and the best <num value="1">one</num> for the white man and the black.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6107"/>I sought disunion, not through conspiracy and violence, but by means which the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself warranted and protected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6108"/>I rejoice in those efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6110"/><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> changed the whole question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6116"/>Believing these <num value="3">three</num> things, I accept <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0188.0023.00465.01906" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Daniel,,,:1"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>'s sentiment, <quote>Liberty and Union, now and forever, <num value="1">one</num> and inseparable.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6117"/>Gladly would I serve that Union,--giving it musket, sword, voice, pen,--the best I have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6118"/>But the <rs>Union</rs> which has for <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure> barred me from its highest privileges by demanding an oath to a proslavery Constitution, still shuts that door in my face; and this administration still clings to a policy which, I think, makes every life now lost in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and every dollar now spent there, utter waste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6119"/>I cannot conscientiously support such a Union and administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6129"/>Where, then, is my post, especially under an administration that avowedly sits waiting, begging to be told what to do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6130"/>I must educate, arouse, and mature a public opinion which shall compel the administration to adopt and support it in pursuing the policy I can aid. This I do by frankly and candidly criticising its present policy, civil and military.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6539"/>I have been requested to speak to you to-day on the subject of a <orgName n="Metropolitan Police" type="government">Metropolitan Police</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6540"/>That plan has already been presented, <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> ago, to this community, and, of late, very elaborately and eloquently argued before a <orgName n="Legislature committee" type="committee">committee of the Legislature</orgName>, by <persName n="Peirce,,Edward,L.,," id="n0188.0025.00495.02059" reg="default:Peirce,Edward,L.,,"><foreName>Edward</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Peirce</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, and still more comprehensively and in detail by <persName n="Ellis,,Charles,M.,," id="n0188.0025.00495.02060" reg="default:Ellis,Charles,M.,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Ellis</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>; but it is <num value="1">one</num> of vital importance to the welfare and progress of our city, and, until the object be achieved, it can never be too frequently considered and urged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6541"/>Other cities have led the way in this path, years ago. The capital of the civilized world, <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, many years ago, found herself utterly unable to contend with the evils of accumulated population,--found municipal machinery utterly inadequate for the security of life or property in her streets; and the national government, by the hand of <persName n="Peel,Sir,Robert,,," id="n0188.0025.00495.02061" reg="default:Peel,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName> <surname>Peel</surname></persName>, assumed the police regulation of that cluster of towns which we commonly call <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, though the plan does not include the city proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6542"/>New York, on our continent, about <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> ago, followed the example; <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> and <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName> have done likewise to a greater or less extent, and so also have some of the other Western cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6543"/>The experience of all great accumulations of property and population <pb id="p.496" n="496"/> reads us a lesson, that the execution of the laws therein demand extra consideration and peculiar machinery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6544"/>The self-organized Safety Committees of <placeName reg="San Francisco, San Francisco, California" key="tgn,7014456">San Francisco</placeName> and other cities prove the same fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6545"/>Indeed, great cities are nests of great vices, and it has been the experience of republics that great cities are an exception to the common rule of self-governed communities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6546"/>Neither New York, nor New Orleans, nor <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> &mdash; none of the great cities &mdash; has found the ballot-box of its individual voters a sufficient protection, through a police organization Great cities cannot be protected on the theory of republican institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6547"/>We may like it or not,--<measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure> have tried the experiment, and, so far, it is a failure; and if there is no resource outside of the city limits, then a self-governed great city is, so far as my experience goes, the most uncomfortable which any man who loves free speech can live in. It is no surprise, therefore, that we ask you no longer to let the police force represent the voters of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6548"/>Hitherto, the police regulations in the city of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> have been modelled on those of a small town; that is, the inhabitants themselves have called into existence a body of constables, in fact, to execute the laws of the <rs>State</rs> and the by-laws of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6549"/>Our text, in presenting this subject to you, is this: in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, as everywhere else, where large numbers are brought together and great masses of property are found, a police force appointed by the voters of the place cannot be relied on to execute the laws; and, in order to secure their full and impartial execution, it has been found necessary elsewhere, and I shall attempt to show you that it is necessary here, to put the control of the police force into other hands than those of the voters of the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6550"/>That is our claim,--that the men of the peninsula, like those of other great cities, are not to be trusted with the execution of the <rs>State</rs> laws, but that executive power must be based on <pb id="p.497" n="497"/> broader foundations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6551"/>Such a course is no uncommon machinery in democratic institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6552"/>We put the interpretation of the laws &mdash; the judiciary-not into the hands of any local municipal body, but the interpretation of the <rs>State</rs> laws is in the hands of persons appointed by the whole State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6553"/>I invoke the same principle for their execution,--following old republican precedents, as I shall shortly show.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6554"/>In order to sustain this claim before you, I ought to show <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6555"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, that in important particulars--<hi rend="italics">important</hi> particulars-the law has failed of execution; that good and vitally important laws have failed of execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6556"/>Secondly, I ought to show you that this failure is due to the machinery which the city puts in motion for the execution of the laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6557"/>Thirdly, that a better machinery may be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6558"/>And, fourthly, that it is important for the welfare of the <rs>State</rs> that the attempt <num value="10">10</num> find a better machinery should be made.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6559"/>My <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> point is to show you that in important particulars, where great and grave interests are involved, the laws have failed of execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6560"/>You perceive that this involves, in fact, an indictment against the city government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6561"/>It is, in reality, arraigning the government of the city for failure to do its duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6562"/>Before I pass to it, therefore, let me make <num value="1">one</num> protest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6563"/>I do not come here to find fault with individual policemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6564"/>I think our body of police is as good, on the average, as that of any great city I know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6565"/>I think upon all trying occasions they have done their duty, as far as they have been permitted, and have always shown full capacity to do their whole duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6566"/>Neither do I come here to arraign the individuals of the city government; not, however, on account of the same excuse, but because I deem it unnecessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6567"/>They are mere puppets, fluttering before us for a little while; they are only victims of a great system, which they did not originate and cannot control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6568"/><pb id="p.498" n="498"/> Looking over the last dozen years, considering that the <rs>Mayor</rs> and Aldermen during those years have been, in the aggregate, only a standing committee appointed by the grog-shops of the peninsula, it has been no honor, but a shame, to hold <num value="1">one</num> of those offices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6569"/>No man with a full measure of self-respect could accept such an office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6570"/>All politics necessitates questionable compliances; but this serfdom touches a base depth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6571"/>It is not however necessary, and certainly not within my plan to-day, to arraign individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6572"/>I am merely criticising a system which throws up into unfitting places and undue importance men who have no real right to the power which they are wholly unable or unwilling to use.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6573"/>To return now to my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> point, I am to show you that, in many important particulars, the laws have failed of execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6574"/>I shall take, in the first place, temperance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6575"/>Some men look upon this temperance cause as whining bigotry, narrow asceticism, or a vulgar sentimentality, fit for little minds, weak women, and weaker men. On the contrary, I regard it as <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> only to <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> others of the primary reforms of this age, and for this reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6576"/>Every race has its peculiar temptation; every clime has its specific sin. The tropics and tropical races are tempted to <num value="1">one</num> form of sensuality; the colder and temperate regions, and our <persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0188.0025.00498.02062" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> blood, find their peculiar temptation in the stimulus of drink and food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6577"/>In old times our heaven was a drunken revel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6578"/>We relieve ourselves from the over-weariness of constant and exhausting toil by intoxication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6579"/>Science has brought a cheap means of drunkenness within the reach of every individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6580"/>National prosperity and free institutions have put into the hands of almost every workman the means of being drunk for a week on the labor of <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure>. With that blood and that temptation, we have adopted democratic institutions, where the law has no sanction but the purpose and virtue of the masses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6581"/>The <pb id="p.499" n="499"/> statute-book rests not on bayonets, as in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, but on the hearts of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6582"/>A drunken people can never be the basis of a free government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6583"/>It is the corner-stone neither of virtue, prosperity, nor progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6584"/>To us, therefore, the title-deeds of whose estates and the safety of whose lives depend upon the tranquillity of the streets, upon the virtue of the masses, the presence of any vice which brutalizes the average mass of mankind, and tends to make it more readily the tool of intriguing and corrupt leaders, is necessarily a stab at the very life of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6585"/>Against such a vice is marshalled the <rs>Temperance Reformation</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6586"/>That my sketch is no mere fancy picture, every <num value="1">one</num> of you knows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6587"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> of you can glance back over your own path, and count many and many a <num value="1">one</num> among those who started from the goal at your side, with equal energy and perhaps greater promise, who has found a drunkard's grave long before this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6588"/>The brightness of the bar, the ornament of the pulpit, the hope and blessing and stay of many a family,--you know, every <num value="1">one</num> of you who has reached middle life, how often on your path you set up the warning, <quote>Fallen before the temptations of the streets!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6589"/>Hardly <num value="1">one</num> house in this city, whether it be full and warm with all the luxury of wealth, or whether it find hard, cold maintenance by the most earnest economy, no matter which,--hardly a house that does not count, among sons or nephews, some victim of this vice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6590"/>The skeleton of this warning sits at every board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6591"/>The whole world is kindred in this suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6592"/>The country mother launches her boy with trembling upon the temptations of city life; the father trusts his daughter anxiously to the young man she has chosen, knowing what a wreck intoxication may make of the house-tree they set up. Alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6593"/>how often are their worst forebodings more than fulfilled!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6594"/>I have known a case &mdash; and probably many of you can recall some almost equal to it &mdash; where <num value="1">one</num> worthy <pb id="p.500" n="500"/> woman could count father, <rs type="role" n="Brother">brother</rs>, husband, and son-in law, all drunkards,--no man among her near kindred, except her son, who was not a victim of this vice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6595"/>Like all other appetites, this finds resolution weak when set against the constant presence of temptation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6596"/>This is the evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6597"/>How are the laws relating to it executed in this city?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6598"/>Let me tell you.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6599"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, there has been great discussion of this evil,--wide, earnest, patient discussion, for <measure n="35years" type="date">thirty-five years</measure>. The whole community has been stirred by the discussion of this question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6600"/>Finally, after various experiments, the majority of the <rs>State</rs> decided that the method to stay this evil was to stop the open sale of intoxicating drink.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6601"/>They left moral suasion still to address the individual, and set themselves as a community to close the doors of temptation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6602"/>Every man acquainted with his own nature or with society knows that weak virtue, walking through our streets, and meeting at every <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> door (for that is the average) the temptation to drink, must fall; that <num value="1">one</num> must be a moral <persName n="Hercules,,,,," id="n0188.0025.00500.02063" reg="mostcommon:Hercules,nomatch:0"><surname>Hercules</surname></persName> to stand erect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6603"/>To prevent the open sale of intoxicating liquor has been the method selected by the <rs>State</rs> to help its citizens to be virtuous; in other words, the <rs>State</rs> has enacted what is called the <rs>Maine Liquor Law</rs>,--the plan of refusing all licenses to sell, to be drunk on the spot or elsewhere, and allowing only an official agent to sell for medicinal purposes and the arts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6604"/>You may drink in your own parlors, you may make what indulgence you please your daily rule, the <rs>State</rs> does not touch you there; there you injure only yourself, and those you directly influence; that the <rs>State</rs> cannot reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6605"/>But when you open your door and say to your fellow-citizens, <quote>Come and indulge,</quote> the <rs>State</rs> has a right to ask, <quote>In what do you invite them to indulge?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6606"/>Is it in something that helps, or something that harms, the community?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6607"/>I will try to show you, in a moment, on what grounds <pb id="p.501" n="501"/> the <rs>State</rs> decided that these numberless open doors harmed the community, and that the method to be adopted was to shut them up. The majority, after full argument in district school-houses, the streets, and the <rs>State-House</rs>, from pulpits, lyceum platforms, and everywhere else, decided that prohibition of the traffic was the only effective method.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6608"/>The law was put upon the statute-book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6609"/>A reluctant minority went to the <name>Legislature</name>, and endeavored to repeal or amend it, alleging that this was not a good law; and they were voted down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6610"/>Again they went,--were voted down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6611"/><num value="0.33">A <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> time they went,--and were voted down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6612"/>They then appealed to the courts, and said, <quote>This is not a constitutional law.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6613"/>The courts said, <quote>It is.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6614"/>If anything ever had the decided, unmistakable sanction of a majority of the people of this Commonwealth, the <rs>Maine Liquor Law</rs> has it. After <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a century of discussion, it was enacted; <num value="3">three</num> times assailed, it was maintained; subjected to the crucible of the court, it came out pure gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6615"/>We have a right to say that it is the matured, settled purpose of the majority of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>; if the majority have a right to govern, that law is to govern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6616"/>Is it not so?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6617"/>If not, let the minority assail again the <name>Gibraltar</name> of the statute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6618"/>But meanwhile it, like all other laws not immoral, is to be obeyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6619"/>I have not, therefore, to argue to-day whether the law is good or not, whether it is wise or not. That is settled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6620"/>It is good and wise in the opinion of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6621"/>The era of <hi rend="italics">public opinion</hi> is finished, that of <hi rend="italics">law</hi> has commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6622"/>This is the history of all legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6623"/>Do not find fault with us for enacting, in due time, public opinion into a statute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6624"/>Where did all statutes come from?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6625"/>Hundreds of years ago, men argued the question, <quote>Shall <num value="1">one</num> man own a separate piece of land?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6626"/>They argued it, and settled that he should.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6627"/>That became a statute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6628"/>They then began to argue the question, <quote>Shall he transmit to his children by will?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6629"/>They argued that for centuries, <pb id="p.502" n="502"/> then said, <quote>Yes,</quote> and enacted it. Nobody now goes behind those statutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6630"/>Hundreds of years ago, our race argued the question, <quote>Shall a man have <num value="1">one</num> wife or <num value="3">three</num>?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6631"/>We settled that he should have but <num value="1">one</num>; it is the law of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6632"/>The era of discussion and opinion is over; the era of legislation has come,--the time when the minority sits down and obeys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6633"/>With all great questions, covering important interests, there is a time when public opinion stereotypes itself into statutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6634"/>Land, harvests, marriage, the laws against burglary and theft, settled themselves years ago. If I raise a harvest, it is mine; that is the law of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6635"/>There was a time when it was a question; it is not a question now. So with temperance and the <rs>Maine Liquor Law</rs>. Time was when the question whether a man had a right to sell liquor openly, licensed or not, was discussed; we have passed that point, and reached the time when the majority &mdash; in other words, the <rs>State</rs>--decrees that these shops shall be shut.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6636"/>Now let me show you, in a few words, <hi rend="italics">why</hi> it should decree that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6637"/>In order more clearly to show this, let me go back a little, and ask how did the <rs>Mayor</rs> and Aldermen, the <rs type="place">City</rs>, meet this <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName> Liquor Law?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6638"/>They said, <quote>You may decree it if you please, we won't execute it. You say we shall not license anybody, but we will effect the same thing, for we will let everybody sell, except just those whom we should not have licensed.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6639"/>These are the exact words of the order to the police some years ago. The <rs type="role" reg="Chief of Police">Chief of Police</rs> replied to a question from the <orgName n="Massachusetts Temperance Society" type="society">Massachusetts Temperance Society</orgName>, <quote>We have directions never to prosecute a liquor-seller, unless he be <num value="1">one</num> who would not have received a license under the old license act.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6640"/>In other words, the <rs>State</rs> says, <quote>On mature consideration, I prohibit the sale.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6641"/>The <rs type="place">City</rs> says, <quote>I shall allow it,--help yourself!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6642"/>Those whom it would not <pb id="p.503" n="503"/> have licensed are <quote>nuisances,</quote> as it calls them;--houses vulgar, noisy, disorderly; kept, as the <name>Dogberry</name> of the <orgName n="Aldermen Board" type="board">Board of Aldermen</orgName> told us at the <rs type="place">State House</rs>, by <quote>imbecile old men and ancient women,</quote> --as the constable of <persName n="Shakespeare,,,,," id="n0188.0025.00503.02064" reg="mostcommon:Shakespeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakespeare</surname></persName>'s play arrested all <quote>vagrant men.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6643"/>That is the position of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6644"/>The law is intentionally and avowedly set aside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6645"/>The city government announces that it does not intend to obey it; makes no effort, and never has made any, to enforce it. What is the result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6646"/>The result is, that there are at least <num value="3000">three thousand</num> places in the city where liquor is publicly and continually sold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6658"/>Poverty, wholesome poverty, is no unmixed evil; it is the motive power that throws a man up to guide and control the community; it is the spur that often wins the race; it is the trial that calls out, like fire, all the deep, great qualities of a man's <pb id="p.504" n="504"/> nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6660"/>The father is a drunkard; the mother often imitates him; the self-respect of the family is lost; the home is gone; it is a scene of quarrel and degradation; the children are thrown neglected on the streets, with no food, no education, no moral sense developed,--the frightful and fruitful source of every vice known to the civil code.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6689"/>I only ask of any man an honest effort; I only ask for evidence that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step is taken in that direction,--that there is a willingness, a disposition, to do it. A great deal could be prevented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6697"/>What does it come from?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6698"/>I am not to charge it on any particular corporation; I am to charge it to a system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6699"/>It is the massing up of <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the capital of the <rs>State</rs>, and <num value="1">one</num> <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> the population on this peninsula.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6700"/>That makes a new order of things, <num value="1">one</num> calling for a new machinery to check crime,--a hot-bed, where all the tendencies to crime become doubled and trebled, where the dangerous classes of the community get undue power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6701"/>It is because of this peculiarity that we need a different system from what the country does.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6702"/>Up to a certain point <pb id="p.507" n="507"/> our city government has always acknowledged this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6703"/>For instance, in a small country town of a few <num value="1000">thousand</num> inhabitants they have <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> constables.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6704"/>Nobody knows who they are. You might visit half a dozen houses, and they could not tell you. Only once or twice in a year, on some festive or other occasion, a town meeting, a picnic, or something of the kind, is he ever seen or needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6705"/>He may execute a writ once in a while.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6706"/>If there is any disorder in the town, a citizen takes notice of it, reports it to a justice of the peace, and the difficulty is cured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6707"/>That is a sufficient machinery for a small town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6708"/>But when you have a large and dense population, great wealth invested in certain dangerous and tempting forms, you cannot trim the execution of the laws to the volunteer efforts of the citizens; you must have a large body of police constantly in the streets, ever on the alert, with grave and extraordinary powers, to watch criminals and follow them up. That has been found necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6709"/>Now the question is whether something further is not necessary also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6710"/>The returns for <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> show that <num value="0.42">forty-two per cent</num> of the average population of this county was arrested for crime, while, in other counties, the number arrested was only <num value="1">one</num>, <num value="2">two</num>, or <num value="0.03">three per cent.</num> Why this difference?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6711"/>Because a city necessarily induces greater temptations, greater dangers, and more frequent crimes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6712"/>It needs, therefore, a more stringent machinery to execute the laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6713"/>Instead of that, in regard to this temperance law, the city government defy it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6714"/>Let me leave this question a moment, and turn to another,--free speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6715"/>Free speech is so vital an element of civil life, so important a privilege, that the framers of our government were not willing to leave it to the law,--they enshrined it in the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6716"/>It was so fundamental, that it could not be left to annual legislation; it was grouted and dovetailed into the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stratum of the foundation of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6717"/>Now, the class of men who have had the ordering of city affairs have never, for the last <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>, attempted to protect free speech on this peninsula.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6718"/>Let me tell you what I mean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6719"/>If a man like the editor of the <orgName n="Boston Post" type="newspaper">Boston Post</orgName>, like <persName n="Everett,the Honorable,Edward,,," id="n0188.0025.00508.02067" reg="default:Everett,Edward,,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">the Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Edward</foreName> <surname>Everett</surname></persName>, like <persName n="Sumner,Mister,,,," id="n0188.0025.00508.02068" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,Charles,,,:8"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName>, any popular person in the community, wished to hold a meeting on this peninsula, he could always do it; but if any set of men who are unpopular wanted to hold a meeting here, it depended entirely upon the mood of the mob that month whether they could hold it or not. These very walls could testify, if they had voice, how many dozen times they have seen their occupants, paying an honest price for a day's use of them, disturbed hour after hour, and finally, perhaps, in some instances, the meeting broken up, by a crowd of boys that the right hand of <num value="1">one</num> policeman could have quelled; and when individuals, the very lessees of this hall, would take <num value="1">one</num> of these disturbers to the courts, he was set free, and the persons who interfered threatened with a suit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6720"/>You know that the trustees of the hall from which you have just removed for a season sat on <num value="1">one</num> occasion until <pb id="p.509" n="509"/> midnight, to decide whether they would dare to risk their Property when the <rs>Mayor</rs> of the city had let it be known that he did not intend to defend it against the mob of the streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6721"/>You know too, or you might know, that the same anxious scene of consultation went on among the trustees of the <rs type="place">Tremont Temple</rs>, again and again, whether they would dare to risk their building, when the city authorities had unblushingly and publicly declared that they would not protect free speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6722"/>You know also, that, when the <rs>Massachusetts Antislavery Society</rs> was mobbed out of its hall by the <rs>Mayor</rs> of the city, the members of the <name>Legislature</name> refrained from offering the <name>Society</name> the use of the <rs>State-House</rs>, though wishing to do so, because the <rs>Executive</rs> informed them that he had no means to protect the <rs>State</rs>'s property against the grog-shops of the peninsula.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6724"/>It was when that class of the community found that the <rs>Mayor</rs> was willing to lead them, and that they could riot in the most fashionable drinking-saloons free of expense, that your Governor dared not trust the <rs>State-House</rs> to an orderly and legal assemblage of the citizens of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6726"/>The difficulty was not that it could not be quelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6727"/>That class which <persName n="Macaulay,,,,," id="n0188.0025.00509.02070" reg="mostcommon:Macaulay,nomatch:0"><surname>Macaulay</surname></persName> describes never faces the law until it has bribed it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6728"/><num value="1">One</num> of the <rs>Aldermen</rs> of the <pb id="p.510" n="510"/> city said recently, in the <rs>State-House</rs>, that these mobs were only <quote>watermelon frolics,--the pounding of men with the soft side of a cushion</quote> ; but it was a cushion that the <rs>Governor</rs> dared not trust to touch the <rs>State-House</rs>; it was a mob which the <rs>Mayor</rs> said, in excuse for inefficiency, that he had not force enough to control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6729"/>Perhaps it would not be disrespectful to ask that these several city dignitaries would arrange beforehand, and make their lame excuses at least consistent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6730"/>There is a class of whom an old proverb affirms that it needs to have <quote>long memories.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6731"/>Fellow-citizens, for the last <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure>, I have been able to make in New York, in perfect quiet, with the unsolicited protection of the police, the same speech which I could not make to you without being surrounded by <num value="50">fifty</num> armed friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6732"/>Again and again have I proved this, during the last <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6733"/>But at the same time, in our own city, of <num value="1">one</num> quarter part of the inhabitants, it was impossible, without the aid of armed friends, to utter the same words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6734"/>Why is this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6735"/>It is no fault of individuals, as I said before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6736"/><placeName reg="Three thousand places">Three thousand places</placeName> where drink is sold!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6737"/>Do I exaggerate when I say that each <num value="1">one</num> of those places represents a voter?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6739"/>I am <pb id="p.511" n="511"/> going to speak of the voters which they send to the polls, and I certainly shall not exaggerate if I say, that each <num value="1">one</num> of them influences <num value="1">one</num> voter,--the owner of the shop, the keeper, the tender, or the frequenter of it. Such liquor-sellers are generally voters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6740"/>If not, every <num value="1">one</num> has a father, <rs type="role" n="Brother">brother</rs>, servant, barkeeper, landlord, men of whom he buys his supplies, frequenters of his bar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6741"/>There are <num value="3000">three thousand</num> voters,--indeed, I should not exaggerate if I said <num value="5000">five thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6742"/>About <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> voters on this peninsula usually go to the polls, sometimes <num value="22000">twenty-two thousand</num>, though very rarely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6743"/>Now, <num value="3000">three thousand</num> voters could always hold the balance in such a constituency,--Republican, Democratic, Catholic, Protestant,--crumbled up as an independent community necessarily is. With all these inevitable varieties of opinion and purpose, <num value="3000">three thousand</num> men, bound together by <num value="1">one</num> idea, <num value="1">one</num> interest, with <num value="1">one</num> purpose in view, and demanding <num value="1">one</num> thing, and nothing more, who know what they want, stand together for it, and throw their whole weight to secure it, can always hold the balance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6744"/>There never was a city election which that number of votes massed together could not control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6745"/>I say, therefore, without the slightest wish to be personally offensive, that the liquor-shops of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> choose our Mayors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6746"/>What is the result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6747"/>The result is, that it is as much a bargain as if <num value="2">II</num> were recorded in the registry of deeds, that the prominent aspirants for city office shall not execute the laws against the liquor-shops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6748"/>I make no special charge against the <rs>Mayor</rs> and Aldermen,--they are as good as most of us. They want votes; it is the <rs>American</rs> failing,--most men want votes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6750"/>Very <pb id="p.512" n="512"/> well; here stand the party that want something, and there stand the party that have something to sell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6751"/>They have their votes to give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6752"/>It is understood that they will give them to the man who will do the least to execute the <rs>Maine Law</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6753"/>The liquor-dealers say, <quote>This is the condition: shut your eyes upon us!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6754"/>The consequence is, that both parties, all parties, are obliged to bow their necks to that yoke, and, with rare exceptions, there cannot be an Alderman nor a Mayor of the city elected, who is not understood to be willing to shut his eyes to that crime, and leave the law of the <rs>State</rs> unexecuted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6755"/>It has been so, it always must be so while these elements of civic strength exist, and are thus tempted to exert themselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6756"/>The reason why the law is not executed in favor of free speech is germane and sister to this; it is, that the men who are interested in these drinking-shops, and the men whose votes they can command, are of the class which hates progress and freedom,--is naturally antagonistic to them; and any designing leader can stir up such a mass, and fling it at virtue and order and liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6757"/>Hence these consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6758"/>Their agents, of their own natural bias, run greedily to do such agreeable work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6759"/>For the last <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="13years" type="date">thirteen years</measure>, this has been the character of the city government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6760"/>They have said to the <rs>State</rs>, <quote>We will not execute your law.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6761"/>Now, law consists of <num value="4">four</num> things,--a statute, a policeman to arrest the offender, a jury to try him, and a judge to sentence him. The Constitution says, we shall have judges as <quote>impartial as the lot of humanity admits.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6762"/>We have them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6763"/>Appointed, how?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6764"/>By the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6765"/>The other end <pb id="p.513" n="513"/> of the telegraph is a man to bring the offender before the judge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6766"/>What is the use of a judge?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6767"/>He cannot move of himself; he is powerless if you do not bring the criminals before him. But the city government of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, chosen by this machinery I have spoken of, says to its police officers, <quote>Don't you furnish that judge with any criminals; shut your eyes upon them!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6768"/>Then, again, if <num value="1">one</num> is arrested, by any accident, what more?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6769"/>Why, this: the statute says that our jurymen shall be drawn from a box, in which the names of citizens of good moral character and sound judgment, free from all legal exceptions, are put. The city weeds out the jury-box on another plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6770"/>In all trials that had antislavery or temperance in them, you might be certain of <num value="1">one</num> thing,--you would never see an Abolitionist nor a temperance man on the jury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6771"/>If he got there, it was an accident, and there were always enough to neutralize him. It is just like the black element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6772"/>We have several <num value="1000">thousand</num> black men in our community; you have never seen a black man on a jury but once, and that was an accident, and he was not allowed to sit, though he had been regularly drawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6773"/>Many of them are of good moral character, but their names never get into the box; or, if they get in, never come out. So of a man known distinctively as an Abolitionist; if his name goes in, it never comes out. So of a man known as a temperance man; rarely does his name come out. But liquor-dealers have always been abundant on juries; no jury was trusted alone without them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6774"/>If the <rs>State</rs> furnishes good judges, and the city, at the other end, furnishes no criminals, or, when <num value="1">one</num> is by chance caught, fortifies him with a jury that will disagree on his side, how is the law to be executed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6775"/>As long as the city government is chosen by men whose interest is on that side, how can it be otherwise?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6776"/>How is the law to be executed, when you have entrusted its execution to men who do not wish or mean <pb id="p.514" n="514"/> to execute it,--who were elected expressly not to execute it, and have the strongest motive not to do so?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6867"/>The Governor complained then, as I am told he does now, that in the whole county he had not <num value="1">one</num> single officer whom he could command to execute the law. Who shall say that it is not for the interest, for the <pb id="p.520" n="520"/> peace, for the prosperity, of the <rs>State</rs> to make this great centre of wealth and population independent of such base control?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6870"/>It is too important a machinery to be left in the hands of the dangerous classes.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6885"/>We do not claim that drunkenness can be wholly rooted out. But we do claim that this law can be executed as perfectly as other laws are, if its execution be intrusted to competent and faithful hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6886"/>No crime is wholly prevented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6887"/>Our crowded prisons prove that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6888"/>No law is perfectly executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6889"/>But there is nothing in the <rs>Maine Liquor Law</rs> that distinguishes it from other statutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6890"/>No man claims that the <hi rend="italics">use</hi> of intoxicating drink can be wholly <pb id="p.521" n="521"/> stopped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6891"/>But it is idle and ridiculous to say that the <hi rend="italics">public sale</hi> of it cannot be stopped, as much as the indiscriminate keeping of gunpowder, or the opening of shops on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, or the firing of muskets in crowded streets, whenever magistrates shall really wish and mean to do their duty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6892"/>A <orgName n="Metropolitan Police" type="government">metropolitan police</orgName> has been necessary in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, and now its streets are the safest in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6893"/>In New York it has saved the city from convulsion and bloodshed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6894"/><num value="1">One</num> of its prominent citizens said to me a short time ago, <quote>You do not know how near we have been to an outbreak in this very street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6895"/>But for our police, the attempt would have been made to surrender us to Southern dictation.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6896"/>That same civil disorder may impend over us. What is the remedy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6897"/>Let the <rs>State</rs> hold her hand on the vices of the peninsula,--claim her old democratic right to execute the laws she has made,--to execute them if the city cannot, or if, <hi rend="italics">if</hi> her constitution of government, she will not try to execute them faithfully.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6898"/>Our plan is to have Commissioners--<num value="3">three</num> or fiveappointed by the <rs>Governor</rs> or by the <name>Legislature</name>, whichever seems best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6899"/>Let them hold their offices for <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure>; they appoint, rule, and remove the members of the police force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6900"/>Such a Commission would be removed, as far as anything in our civil system is or ought to be, from the control of party politics, and would be largely independent of the <quote>dangerous classes.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6901"/>This peninsula needs it immediately,--the neighboring towns and cities will need it soon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6902"/>The members of such a police force should hold their places during good behavior, and be removed only on charges stated in writing, to which they may have a chance of replying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6903"/>Now, every fall, the liquor-dealer or other criminal, whom an honest policeman has troubled, holds up his warning finger to the</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6905"/>What officer can be expected to do his duty in such circumstances?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6906"/>Fellow-citizens, during the <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> preceding our city elections, we have, practically, no police,--none that dares execute a law disagreeable to any influential class.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6907"/>The moment the liquor interest of the city see that their mixing in city elections will not secure a police force in their interest, they will probably leave the election of <rs type="role2">Mayor</rs> and Aldermen to the natural action of ordinary politics, as they did in New York, and then we shall have as good officers as our system will secure, with the present level of education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6908"/>Such Mayors and Aldermen will, probably, no longer prostitute the jury-box to defend rum and shield mobs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6909"/>They will have no interest to do so. They cannot so wholly corrupt the jury-box as to protect the liquor-seller.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6910"/>The liquor once poured into the street, according to the statute, by an honest policeman, he must be sued by its owner before a jury of the county.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6911"/>No <rs type="role2">Mayor</rs> could make up a jury wholly of liquor-dealers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6912"/><num value="2">Two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> honest men on it suffice to disagree, and no verdict, in that case, is in effect a verdict for the officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6913"/>Disagreement of juries now, which a servile <rs type="role2">Mayor</rs> arranges for, protects the indicted grog-seller; then, to use a common proverb, <quote>the boot would be on the other leg,</quote> and disagreement of juries executes the law. But if this change be not an entire relief, we must press forward, and find a remedy for that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6914"/>I have full faith in democratic institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6915"/>Work on, and we shall yet lift them up to much higher perfection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6916"/>The future is sure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6917"/>Honest men rule in the end. Only show them their interest and duty, and, in due time, they will rally to do it. <measure n="10years" type="date">Ten years</measure> ago, I made an antislavery speech, painting Southern despotism, and demanding that the <rs>North</rs> should rouse herself against her tyrants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6918"/>The next day, meeting the oldest statesman of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, he said to me, <pb id="p.523" n="523"/> <quote>Your speech was all true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6925"/>Ladies and Gentlemen: I understand this is a ward meeting,--the <orgName type="division" n="Ward 16">Sixteenth Ward</orgName> of New York, the banner ward for radical Republicanism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6926"/>[Applause.] A very good-sized meeting for a ward meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6927"/>[Laughter.] I am glad, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in my life, to be adopted into the politics of <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York city</orgName>, and to address a ward meeting in behalf of justice and liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6928"/>The text of my address is, Patience and Faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6929"/>Possess your souls in patience, not as having already attained, not as if we were already perfect, but because the whole nation, as <num value="1">one</num> man, has for more than a year set its face Zionward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6930"/>Ever since <dateStruct value="-09-22"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="22">22d</day></dateStruct> of last year, the nation has turned its face Zionward; and ever since <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n0188.0026.00524.02096" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> drew his sword in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, we have moved toward that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6931"/>[Cheers.] Now, a nation moving, and moving in the right path,--what reason is there for doubt?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6932"/>what occasion for despair?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6933"/>We have found out at last the method, and we are in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6934"/>Patience, all the passion of great souls, makes victory certain; when the human heart is once capable of this greatest courage, no matter what clouds may be on the horizon, now and then <name n="God" type="God">God</name> lifts the cloud so as to show us the blue sky behind; no <pb id="p.525" n="525"/> matter how dark political mistake or treachery may lower, the moment comes when the <rs>North</rs> says that it is all a phantasmagoria, and behind, the great heart of the nation beats true to its destiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6935"/>[Cheers.] When I stood on this platform <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure> ago, men said: <quote>You must not be surprised if blood flows in the streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6936"/>Traitors are trying to take the great Capital of the <rs>North</rs> out of our arms, and the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> of the <rs>State</rs> is behind them.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6937"/>But <num value="1">one</num> fine morning there was prudent hesitation in the leading Democrat of <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName>, and the <rs>Mayor</rs> of New York defeated him on his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6938"/>[Cheers.] When the counties came to be represented, the leaders found an army with officers and no rank and file.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6939"/>And the <name>Goliath</name> of <placeName reg="Connecticut" key="tgn,7007159">Connecticut</placeName> Copperheads has been killed, not by a stripling, but by a girl.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6940"/>[Applause.] Or if we must add to her merits that of <persName n="Hamilton,General,,,," id="n0188.0026.00525.02097" reg="mostcommon:Hamilton,Alexander,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hamilton</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, the eloquent champion of the <rs>Union</rs>, then we can almost say that out of the mouths of girls and slaveholders <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is perfecting liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6941"/>[Applause.] Now I neither doubt nor despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6942"/>Gradually, <num value="1">one</num> after another, the shams of the <rs>North</rs> fall away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6943"/>It is to be a long fight, no local struggle,--only <num value="1">one</num> part of the great fight going on the world over, and which began ages ago,--only <num value="1">one</num> grand division, <num value="1">one</num> <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> doing its duty in the great battle between free institutions and caste institutions, the world over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6944"/>Freedom and Democracy against the institutions that rest upon classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6945"/>We may be the centre or only the outskirts of that struggle, but wherever caste lives, wherever class power exists, whether it be on the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,1130793" n="1.000 1" reg="thames,ontario,canada,north and central america">Thames</placeName> or the <name>Seine</name>, whether by the side of the <rs>Ganges Jr</rs> the <rs>Danube</rs>, there the <rs>South</rs> has an ally, just as the surgeon's knife gives pain when it touches the living fibre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6946"/>[Cheers.] And against this mighty marshalling of everything that is strong in human selfishness the democracy of the <rs>North</rs> does battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6947"/>Some of our friends are anxious <pb id="p.526" n="526"/> that able and earnest men shall go to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 7" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, make the real state of the case known there, and so, they think, avert national collision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6949"/>The ruling classes of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 7" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> understand our quarrel only too well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6950"/>They feel that victory for the <rs>North</rs> is ultimate ruin for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6951"/>The more of the truth you show them, the more their hearts lean to the <rs>Southern</rs> side,--their side.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6952"/>Every proud man who hates his brother is our enemy, every idle man too lazy to think is our enemy, every loafer who seeks a living without working for it is our enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6953"/>[Applause.] Every honest man, asking only for his own, and willing fairly to do his part, is our ally, whether he eats rice on the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7001674" n="1.000 10" reg="Ganges,Asia">Ganges</placeName> or is enrolled in the army under <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n0188.0026.00526.02099" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName>: never till honest men realize this can there be peace or union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6954"/>Till that time union means a submission to the old slavocracy, as bitter and more relentless than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6955"/>The South counted on <num value="2">two</num> allies in the ranks of her Northern enemy: <num value="1">one</num> was hatred of the negro,--the other Copperhead Democratic sympathy with the aristocracy of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6956"/>She counted confidently on these allies, but found she had reckoned without her host.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6957"/>We have been accustomed to say on this platform, for the last <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>, that if circumstances should ever rouse to an antislavery purpose the rank and file of the <name>Democracy</name>, the victory for freedom would be as sure as the existence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6958"/>The Abolitionists have always claimed that they had an invincible ally in that democratic prejudice against wealth and rank, and the ineradicable love which man has at the core for the rights of his fellow-man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6959"/>[Applause.] When the war broke out, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blow the <rs>South</rs> aimed at the <rs>Union</rs>, as if according to chemical law, crystallized that level of democracy into an antislavery mould, and from that hour to this it is the sheet-anchor of the <rs>Union</rs>, and <pb id="p.527" n="527"/> while it holds the future is certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6960"/>The only reason why this element did not grope its way at once to victory was because it was led by men who did not intend to conquer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6961"/>Our statesmen were only ready for the shibboleth, <quote>Freedom, if necessary to save the <rs>Union</rs></quote> ; it was a contingent freedom,--not freedom for itself and in any event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6962"/>No <num value="1">one</num> of them welcomed the war as a <name n="God" type="God">God</name>-given opportunity to do justice, and secure for the nation lasting, immutable peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6963"/>Under that sort of leadership we went to battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6964"/>The generals and the <rs>Cabinet</rs> meant no more than to play a part in the great drama of justice for which their hearts were not ready.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6965"/><persName><foreName>Lucian</foreName></persName> tells us of an exhibition in <placeName reg="Rome, Oneida, New York" key="tgn,7014359">Rome</placeName> in which monkeys had been trained to take part in a play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6966"/>They played their parts perfectly, for a while, before an audience composed of the beauty and fashion of the city, but in the midst of the performance some <name>Roman</name> wag flung upon the stage a handful of nuts, and immediately the actors were monkeys again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6967"/>Our statesmen went to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> monkeys in human attire, determined to compromise if possible; the <rs>South</rs> flung nuts among them for <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure>, and they were on all fours for the temptation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6968"/>[Laughter and applause.] That epoch is ended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6969"/>As in <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0188.0026.00527.02100" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>'s day they sloughed off such effete elements as <placeName reg="Essex, England, United Kingdom" key="tgn,7008131">Essex</placeName> and <persName n="Fairfax,,,,," id="n0188.0026.00527.02101" reg="mostcommon:Fairfax,nomatch:0"><surname>Fairfax</surname></persName>, we should slough off generals and statesmen; and never can we be successful till routine <placeName reg="West Point, Orange, New York" key="tgn,7014609">West Point</placeName> and rotten Whiggery have been made to put on decent attire, or sent back to private life, and those put in their places who believe in absolute, uncompromising war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6970"/>This real democratic element in the <rs>North</rs> is strong enough, were it <num value="1">one</num> and united, to have crushed all its foes on this continent in <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure>. There never was a time since the commencement of the struggle when, if the <rs>North</rs> lad been a unit, the war might not have been ended in <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>; and, so ended, it would have left slavery <pb id="p.528" n="528"/> where it found it. But the <rs>North</rs> has never been a unit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6971"/>With the <rs>North</rs> as a unit, democratic, intelligent, resolved, in earnest, the <rs>South</rs> never would have risked the struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6972"/>But she knew that the <rs>North</rs> was divided into <num value="3">three</num> great parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6973"/><num value="1">One</num> was routine, <placeName reg="West Point, Orange, New York" key="tgn,7014609">West Point</placeName>, too lazy to think.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6974"/>[Great applause.] I resolve hunkerism into indolence and cowardice, too lazy to think,--and too timid to think.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6975"/>The man of the past is the man who got his ideas before he was <num value="20">twenty</num>, and had rather think as his father thought than take the labor of thinking himself: he is a hunker, and he will probably die such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6976"/>[Laughter.] And the <rs>North</rs> had a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> element, negrophobia, the <rs>Saxon</rs> contempt for a black skin, disgust with the question of the negro, hatred of him as another race, contempt for him as a slave, and weariness of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6977"/>Outside of that was the democrat of the <rs>North</rs>, in the good sense of the term,--the man who believes in the manhood of his brother the world over, and is willing he should have his rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6978"/>Against such a North the <rs>South</rs> rebelled,--<num value="1">one</num> of our hands tied up by negro hatred, and the other by constitutional scruples, and <placeName reg="West Point, Orange, New York" key="tgn,7014609">West Point</placeName> on our shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6979"/>Against such a North the <rs>South</rs> rebelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6980"/>You remember it well,--the <rs>North</rs> that never dared to apply the line and the plummet to the ethics of its civilization,--that never dared to have a logic which would know no black, no white, when it studied its duties,--the <rs>North</rs> that, both in pulpit and in civil life, believed and obeyed the old proverb: <quote>When the monkey reigns, let every man dance before him.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6981"/>[Laughter.] As long as a wicked, contemptible institution had honors and wealth and fashion to bestow, so long the pregnant knee was crooked before it. That <name>North</name> the <rs>South</rs> met in battle, and she mistook, as we Abolitionists did, (that is, the issue will show whether we did mistake, we hope it is so,) how far the canker had gone, how great hold this routine of hunkerism <pb id="p.529" n="529"/> had on the body of the people: that <name>North</name> rallied for the struggle, poured out her money like water, and her sons with ever-growing willingness for the great battle betwixt democracy and slavery, betwixt <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the <name>Devil</name>, for the world and the century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6982"/>The government was equally in the dark, equally undecided, equally uncertain what course to pursue, and for a long time we stumbled together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7098"/>And <placeName key="tgn,7007517" n="1.000 161" reg="massachusetts">Massachusetts</placeName> put in her land and character and brains, and we made a <quote>hodge-podge,</quote> as the <rs>English</rs> law says, a general mess, a bowl of punch [laughter], of all the institutions of the nation, and we said, <quote>There is the free press, untrammelled, for <num value="1">one</num> element, and whatever cannot bear that must be thrown away.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7099"/>[Applause.] For <num value="2">two</num> generations, the experiment went on; and when <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0188.0026.00537.02120" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> went to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> saw the handwriting on the wall,--the handwriting as of old,--that the free press had conquered, and that slavery was sinking, like a dead body, to the bottom; and she said, practically: <quote>I know I made the bargain, but I cannot abide it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7120"/>The old conflict,--a new weapon, that is all. The South thought because once, twice, thrice, the spaniel <rs>North</rs> had gotten down on her knees, that this time, also, poisoned by cotton-dust, she would kiss her feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7135"/>What good would that do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7136"/>An imaginary line will not shut out ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7137"/>But she must bar out those ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7138"/>That is the programme in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7139"/>He imagines he can broaden his base by allying himself with a weaker race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7146"/>His plan, therefore, is to mould an empire so strong, so broad, that it can control <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> and New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7147"/>He is not only to found a slaveholding despotism, but he is to make it so strong that, by traitors among us, and hemming us in by power, he is to cripple, confine, break down, the free discussion of these Northern States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7148"/>Unless he does that he is not safe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7149"/>He knows it. Now I do not say he will succeed, but I tell you what I think is the plan of a statesmanlike leader of this effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7150"/>To make slavery safe, he must mould <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, not into being a slaveholding Commonwealth, but into being a silent, unprotesting Commonwealth; that <placeName key="tgn,7007516" n="1.000 5429" reg="maryland">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, the <name>Carolinas</name>, and <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, may be quiet, peaceable populations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7151"/>He is a wise man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7159"/>In other words, carry Northern civilization all over the <rs>South</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7162"/>I may seem tedious in this analysis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7163"/>But it seems to me that the simple statement includes the whole duty and policy of the hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7164"/>It is a conflict which will never have an end until <num value="1">one</num> or the other element subdues its rival.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7165"/>Therefore we should be, like the <rs>South</rs>, penetrated with an idea, and ready with fortitude and courage to sacrifice everything to that idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7171"/>Otherwise the elements of the struggle are unequal.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7172"/>Our object is to subdue the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7173"/>What right has our civilization to oust out the other?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7174"/>It has this right: We are a Union,--not a partnership,--a marriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7175"/>We put our interests all together in <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7176"/>We joined our honor and our wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7178"/>It is to be looked at in the broad light of national statesmanship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7179"/>Our fathers, if they were honorable men, as we believe, accepted slavery as a part of their civil constitution on the ground that it was put into a common lot with freedom, with progress, with wealth, with education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7180"/>If it stood its own, well; if it went by the board, so. It was an intelligible, if not an honest, bargain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7181"/>They consented to be disgraced by the toleration of slavery; they consented to let the fresh blood of the young, vigorous free labor of many States build it up into longer and firmer life, only on condition that it should take its chances with all the other great national interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7182"/>It was with this fundamental understanding that the nation commenced, and the great special interests of the country are based upon it. For instance, the <rs>Illinois</rs> farmer, when he bought of the <rs>Union</rs> a <measure n="1000acres" type="area">thousand acres</measure> in the <rs>Northwest</rs>, he did not buy a <measure n="1000acres" type="area">thousand acres</measure> isolated in the <rs>Northwest</rs>; he bought a <measure n="1000acres" type="area">thousand acres</measure> with New Orleans for his port of entry and New York for his counting-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7183"/>And it was as much a part of the deed as if it had been so written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7184"/>Now, if <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> can show that <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> and New York have broken the deed, she has a right of revolution; that is, she has a right to reject it.
