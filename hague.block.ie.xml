<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>On a glorious sunshiny morning in the early summer of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> I was on my way to the school-house on the plantation of a gentleman who lived near <placeName reg="Eufaula, Barbour, Alabama" key="tgn,7014121">Eufaula, Alabama</placeName>, and in whose service I remained during the period of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>As I was nearing the little school-room on a rising knoll, all shaded with great oaks and sentineled with tall pines, I heard skipping feet behind me, and <num value="1">one</num> of my scholars exclaiming, <quote>Here is a letter for you, <rs type="role2">Miss</rs> A--! It has just been brought from the office by <q direct="unspecified">Ed</q> </quote> --the negro boy who was sent every morning for the mail. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>A glance at the handwriting gave me to know it was from my father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>I soon came to a pause in the school path: for my father wrote that my brothers were preparing to start for <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond, Virginia</placeName>, as <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> soldiers of our new formed <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>As he wished to have all his children united under his roof, before the boys went away, my father earnestly desired me to ask leave of absence for a few days, so that I might join the home circle also. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>The suspending of the school was easily arranged, and I was soon at home assisting in preparing my brothers for military service, little dreaming they were about to enter into a <num value="4">four</num>-years' conflict! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>But oh, how clearly even now I read every milestone of that convulsed period, as I look back upon it after <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a century!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Our soldiers, in their new gray uniforms, all aglow with fiery patriotism, fearing ere they should join battle that the last booming cannon would have ceased to reverberate among the mountains, hills, and valleys of <quote>Old Virginia.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The blue cockades streaming in the wind, while Southern songs, inspirations of the moment, were heard on all sides: <quote>We conquer or die,</quote> and <quote>Farewell to <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName>,</quote> leading with fervent ardor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>While the war was in progress, it so happened that I was far removed from the seaboard and border States, in southern <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, where our people, encompassed and blockaded by the <rs>Federal</rs> forces, were most sadly straitened and distressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>It is of the exigencies of that stormy day, as hydra-headed they rose to view, that I have to write; of the many expedients to which we were reduced on our evernar-rowing territory, daily growing not only smaller, but less and less adequate for the sustenance of ourselves, our soldiers, and the <rs>Northern</rs> prisoners who were cast upon us by the fortunes of war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Blame us not too severely, you who fought on the <rs>Union</rs> side; we, too, loved the <rs>Union</rs> our great and good <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0020.0001.00003.00001" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> bequeathed us: with what deep devotion <name n="God" type="God">God</name> knoweth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>But, as Satan sagely remarks in the <rs>Book</rs> of <persName><foreName>Job</foreName></persName>, <quote>all that a man hath will he give for his life.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Also a writer of profane history has truly said that <quote>a man's family is the nearest piece of his country, and the dearest <num value="1">one</num>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Need there be any wonder that, when a <orgName n="Political Party" type="party">political party</orgName>, with no love in its heart for the <rs>Southern</rs> white people, came into power, a party which we believed felt that the people of the <rs>South</rs> were fit only for the pikes hidden at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, we should have <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> cried out, <quote>What part have we in <persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>to your tents, O <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It is cheering to know that our deeds and intentions have <num value="1">one</num> great <rs type="role2">Judge</rs>, who will say, <quote>Neither do I condemn thee.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/></p> 
<p>I well remember the day when word came with lightning speed over the wires, <quote>The <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">State of Georgia</placeName></quote> --my native State, <num value="1">one</num> of the original <num value="13">thirteen</num> of revolutionary fame--<quote>is out of the <rs>Union</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>I also remember that we were by no means elated at the thought that our own noble commonwealth had seceded from the sisterhood of states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Feelings of sadness, rather, somewhat akin to those of the <rs>Peri</rs> outside the gate of Paradise, overcame us, but we thought and said, Come weal or woe, success or adversity, we will willingly go down or rise with the cause we have embraced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>And at that moment an unpleasant recollection rushed to mind, which caused me to think that perhapsafter all, secession was not so very bad. I remembered a temperance lecturer from <num value="1">one</num> of the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States, who came to our settlement and who was kindly received and warmly welcomed in our Southern homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>There was nothing too good for this temperance <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> lecturer from the far <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>He was given earnest and attentive audiences, with never a thought that in the guise of the temperance reformer his <num value="1">one</num> sole purpose was to make a secret survey of our county, to ascertain which settlements were most densely populated with slaves, for the already maturing uprising of the blacks against the whites. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>After the failure of the insurrection at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, we saw with sorrow deepfelt that the <num value="3">three</num> places in our own county which were known to all too well to be most thickly peopled with slaves were marked on <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0020.0001.00005.00002" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>'s map of blood and massacre, as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> spots for the negro uprising for the extermination of the <rs>Southern</rs> whites. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>When my brothers had left for <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, I started again for <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659"><rs type="direction">southern</rs> Alabama</placeName>, to renew my school duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>As the train sped onward through the tall, long-leaved pines and funereal cypress-trees rising here and there on either side, a feeling of homesick desolation gathered as a thick mist around me, with vague and undefined forebodings of sorrows in store for us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>To add to the depression, clouds dark <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> and lowering were slowly looming up and spreading themselves over the nether heavens, while low and distant thunder dying plaintively away seemed never before to have fallen so mournfully on my ear. As I looked from the window of the speeding train to the dark green gloom of the almost unbroken forest, the low wail of the wind in the tops of the pines, the lowering dark clouds dimly outlined through the shaded vista, pressed down my heart as with a great sorrow; the far-away mutterings of thunder, the low moan of the wind as it rocked to and fro the tops of the pines,came to me as the <rs>Banshee</rs>'s lonely wail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>All seemed to presage some dire affliction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Could it be that my father's household had joined together for the last time in their earthly home?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/><persName n="Poe,,,,," id="n0020.0001.00006.00003" reg="mostcommon:Poe,nomatch:0"><surname>Poe</surname></persName>'s ghastly, grim, and ancient raven seemed to speak the <quote>Nevermore;</quote> and, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>nevermore did we children of that happy circle ever meet again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>As the train gathered itself up in the village of <placeName reg="Hurtsboro, Russell, Alabama" key="tgn,2004008">Hurtville</placeName>, the inky black clouds, flashes of almost blinding lightning, and heavy peals of rolling thunder told that the tempest was unchained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/><pb id="p.7" n="7"/> </p> 
<p>I still had a distance of <num value="14">fourteen</num> or <measure n="15miles" type="distance">fifteen miles</measure> to travel by the hack before I should reach my school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>But as the storm began to increase so much in violence, I deemed it advisable to remain in <placeName key="tgn,2004008" n="1.000 1" reg="hurtsboro, russell, alabama">Hurtville</placeName> for the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>On inquiring for a place to stop at for the night I was directed to <persName n="Hurt,Mrs.,,,," id="n0020.0001.00007.00004" reg="mostcommon:Hurt,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Hurt</surname></persName>, whose spacious mansion and large and beautiful flower yard and grounds stood fair to view from the little village depot. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Hitherto I had passed the village by, in my trips home and back to school again during my vacation days, so that I was altogether a stranger in the home of <persName n="Hurt,Mrs.,,,," id="n0020.0001.00007.00005" reg="mostcommon:Hurt,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Hurt</surname></persName>, but on making her acquaintance was pleased to find her most kind and generous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>My quiet satisfaction was further augmented by a loved school companion stepping into the room most unexpectedly, ere I had been seated half an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>It was a glad surprise for both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Her father and mother lived in the village, and as the violent wind and rain storm had made roads and bridges impassable for the time being, I accepted the invitation of my friend to spend the time of my detention with her. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/><num value="1">One</num> pleasing episode of that visit yet <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> clings to memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It so happened that <num value="1">one</num> of the negro girls of the house was to be married the very week I was detained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Preparations in various ways had been making for several days before the celebration of the ceremony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Dear <persName><foreName>Winnie</foreName></persName>, if still a sojourner here, and you chance to see these lines, I know your memory with mine will turn back on the wheels of time to that afternoon, when we were seated on the colonnade of your father's house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>With flowers scattered all around, our laps and hands full, we twined the wreath for the negro girl, the bride elect for the evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>When twilight had deepened into darkness, the bride was called into your room to make ready for the marriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>When fully robed in her wedding garment, she was inspected by each and every member of the household, and judged to be quite <hi rend="italics">au fait</hi>. But <persName><foreName>Winnie</foreName></persName> pulled off her own watch and chain, together with her bracelets, and with these further adorned the bride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>She was married in the wide hall of her master's house, for having been raised in the house almost from her cradle, her marriage taking place in <num value="1">one</num> of the cabins was not to be thought of. <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Directly under the supervision of the mistress of the house, a supper that would have been pleasing to the taste of an epicure was served on tables placed out in the smooth gravelly yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Then after the feasting was over, a round of merry plays, interspersed with the merrier songs and dance, followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Perhaps no happier beings existed that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It was like a vision of fairy-land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The full moon chosen for the occasion rode in silent majesty across the star-gemmed heavens; fleecy white clouds flitted like shadowy phantoms across its silvery path; the dark pines, half in shadow, half in sheen, loomed vast and giant-like on the outskirts of the village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>In the deeper forest could be heard the weird notes of the whip-poor-wills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The pleasing strains of the violin, the thrumming of the banjo, accompanied by many negro voices, awoke the sleeping echoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>From the front colonnade, before us lay the slumbering village all so quietly under the starry firmament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>We listened there to the mellow peals of negro laughter, to their strange songs, mingling with the strains of the violin, and the low breathing of the night wind in the forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/><pb id="p.10" n="10"/> </p> 
<p>As we roam back in the past, events of earlier days rise in bright view to mind; <num value="1">one</num> link in memory's chain runs into another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>I cannot forbear here referring to an incident which occurred a few years before the civil war. There came to our settlement from the <rs>North</rs>, <num value="3">three</num> cultured, refined, and educated ladies as schoolteachers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Sabbath of worship in the <rs>South</rs> was at the <rs type="place">Mount Olive</rs> <orgName n="Baptist Church" type="church">Baptist church</orgName>, in <placeName reg="Harris, Georgia, United States" key="tgn,2000363">Harris County, Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The pastor of the church, for some unknown cause, failed to appear at the hour appointed for service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>We waited for some time and still no preacher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Then the good old deacon, known by all as <quote><persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Billy</foreName></persName></quote> <persName n="Moore,,,,," id="n0020.0001.00010.00006" reg="mostcommon:Moore,nomatch:0"><surname>Moore</surname></persName>, who had lived by reason of strength beyond the allotted threescore and <num value="10">ten</num>, arose, and said, as the hour for service was passing, as the minister's arrival seemed doubtful, and as the congregation had all assembled, he would suggest that <persName n="Mitchell,Uncle,Sol,,," id="n0020.0001.00010.00007" reg="default:Mitchell,Sol,,,"><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Sol</foreName> <surname>Mitchell</surname></persName>, an old and honored negro, preach for us, as he was present, and a member and preacher in good standing in the <rs type="place">Mount Olive church</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>There was not even a shadow of an objection to the negro slave's occupying the pulpit, <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> as our friends from the far <rs>North</rs> were witness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Ah, friends of the <rs type="place">Green Mountain</rs> and Bay State, you will, if yet in the flesh, remember with me that Sabbath so long ago in the <rs>South</rs>, when the negro slave walked up to the pulpit, opened the hymn-book, and announced the old sacred song: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/></p><l>When I can read my title clear, </l><l>To mansions in the skies.</l></quote> I remember how loudly my dear father tried to sing-though only a poor singer --just because <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Sol</foreName></persName> was going to preach; how <persName n="Sol,,,,," id="n0020.0001.00011.00008" reg="mostcommon:Sol,nomatch:0"><surname>Sol</surname></persName> gave the verses out by couplets to be sung, as was the custom then in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>All joined in singing that sacred song, and bowed the knee when <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Sol</foreName></persName> said, <quote>Let us pray.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>I am very sure I have never knelt with more humble devotion and reverence than on that Sabbath morning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Roads and bridges having been made passable after the storm, I said the <quote>Good-by</quote> to the friends I had found in the pleasant country village, and resumed my journey. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>It was a pleasing ride that balmy summer morning, ennobling to the soul, as <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> nature's great book unrolled its series of beautiful scenes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Far in the azure blue the great white banks of clouds seemed to lie at anchor, so slow of sail were they; the gloom of the dense forest, gently waving its boughs to the morning breeze, would greet the eye; the dulcet murmur of gurgling streams would break on the ear never so gently; quiet cottages, surrounded with flowers and fruits, seemed the abodes of peace and content.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/><placeName reg="Grass-green">Grass-green</placeName> marshes all flecked with flowers of varied tints, with here and there a tall pine or sombre cypress standing as sentinels of the blooming mead; song-birds caroling their sweet lays as they flitted from bough to bough, or lightly soaring in space; fields of deadened trees, all draped with the long gray Spanish moss, reminded <num value="1">one</num> of the ancient <rs>Romans</rs> mantled with the toga, as they were silhouetted against the sky; groups of great oaks, with clusters of the mistletoe pendent, calling to mind the ancient <rs>Britons</rs> with their strange and terrible religion of the <name>Druids</name>, when they met together in their sacred groves for the celebration of mystical rites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Now an open field of corn, green of blade, gently billowed by the wind, <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> an old gray-haired farmer plowing, seemingly oblivious to all surrounding objects, and singing, as if from the fullness of a glad soul, the refrain, <quote>I have some friends in glory.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Ah, honest farmer, thought I, many of us will join that sad refrain ere this strife is ended!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>On, past a large plantation all in cotton, the clashing of the many hoes, in the hands of slaves, in unison with the merry songs that floated far on the gentle zephyrs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The lone country church gleaming white from a wilderness of foliage, with its grass green mounds, so quiet and still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>At times the winds came floating past, laden with the resinous odor of myriad pines, and filled the surrounding atmosphere with a sweetness of perfume surpassing the far-famed incense of <placeName key="tgn,1012700" n="1.000 23" reg="arabian peninsula">Arabia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>In the near distance the home of my generous employer rose to view, in every respect the characteristic Southern home, with its wide halls, long and broad colonnade, large and airy rooms, the yard a park in itself, fruits and flowers abounding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Here there was little or nothing to remind us of the impending conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>We were far from the border States and remote from <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> the seaboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>We had surmised that our sequestered vale must have been the spot where the <rs>Indian</rs> chief and his braves thrust their tomahawks deep down in the soil, with their <quote><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, here we rest!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>But soon it came home to us, as the earnestness of the strife began to be realized, and when we found ourselves encompassed by the <rs>Federal</rs> blockade, that we had to depend altogether upon our own resources; and no sooner had the stern facts of the situation forced themselves upon us, than we joined with zealous determination to make the best of our position, and to aid the cause our convictions impressed on us as right and just.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>And if up to that time, in the <rs>South</rs>, many had engaged in work purely as a matter of choice, there were none, even the wealthiest, who had not been taught that labor was honorable, and who had very clear ideas of how work must be done; so when our misfortunes came, we were by no means found wanting in any of the qualities that were necessary for our changed circumstances. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Surely there was work enough to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Our soldiers had to be fed and clothed; our home ones had to be fed and <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> clothed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>All clothing and provisions for the slaves had to be produced and manufactured at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Leather had to be of our own tanning; all munitions of war were to be manufactured inside the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>The huge bales of kerseys, osnaburgs, and boxes of heavy brogan-shoes, which had been shipped from the <rs>North</rs> to clothe and shoe the slaves, were things of the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Up to the beginning of the war we had been dependent on the <rs>North</rs> for almost everything eaten and worn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Cotton was cultivated in the <rs>South</rs> almost universally before the war, it was marketed in the <rs>North</rs>, it was manufactured there, and then returned in various kinds of cloth-material to us. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> great pressing needs were food and clothing.

<p>When the blockade had inclosed the <rs>South</rs>, our planters set about in earnest to grow wheat, rye, rice, oats, corn, peas, pumpkins, and ground peas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The chufa, a thing I had never heard of before, now came to the front, and was soon generally cultivated, along with the ground pea, as our position necessitated the production of cheap food for swine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>The chufa was easily cultivated, and on fresh sandy or porous soil produced large crops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Every available spot was planted with the chufa, ground peas, and peas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Even in orchards the interstices between the fruit-trees were filled with these nutritious ground nuts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>The tubers were dropped about every <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure>, in furrows <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> apart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>The owners of that orchard said the feed for their poultry had cost them nothing that season, as the whole brood of fowls lived among the chufas from the time they left the perch in the morning till they were called to be <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> housed for the night, and that never before had poultry been so well fitted for the table, never before had the flesh been so white or so well flavored. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>Ground peas were rarely grown before the war, and were generally called <quote>goobers.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>I do not remember that I knew them by any other name; so <num value="1">one</num> day in school hours, when <num value="1">one</num> of the little scholars called to me that <quote><persName><foreName>Hetty</foreName></persName>'s got my pindars,</quote> I was somewhat mystified as to what a <quote>pindar</quote> was, and when I called the little girl to fetch the pindars to me, she laid <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> goobers in my hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>They were to be seen on all sides, branching out in all directions, in patches large and small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Many planters in giving their corn and cotton the <quote>laying-by</quote> plowing, as it was called, would plant in the middle furrows ground peas, chufas, and cuttings from the sweet potato vines, which required very slight additional labor in harvesting the crops; and by the time the crops had all been gathered in and frost appeared, the tubers were well matured, and were great helps in fattening pork, thereby enabling the planter to preserve more corn for the use of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/><pb id="p.19" n="19"/> </p> 
<p>Beside growing the ground pea for help in fattening pork, a good supply was housed for seed and the use of the family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>I have pleasant recollections of the many winter evenings when we would have the great oven brought into the sitting-room, placed on the hearth, with glowing red coals underneath, filled with white sand, in which we parched the pindars nice and brown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>Or perhaps the oven would be filled partly with our home-made syrup, with raw ground peas hulled and dropped into the boiling syrup.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Properly cooked, what nice peanut candy that made!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Oil from the peanuts was also expressed for lamps and other uses during war times.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>Many planters who had never grown wheat before were surprised at the great yield of grain to the acreage sown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>I well remember hearing a brother of <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> G-- , who lived in <placeName reg="Troy, Pike, Alabama" key="tgn,2005533">Troy, Alabama</placeName>, tell of very highly fertilizing <num value="1">one</num> acre of already rich soil, as a test of what he really could reap from an acre thus treated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The yield <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> went far beyond his most sanguine expectations, for that <num value="1">one</num> acre yielded <num value="70">seventy</num>five bushels of wheat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Another wealthy planter, living in the village of <placeName reg="Glenville, Russell, Alabama" key="tgn,2003675">Glennville, Alabama</placeName>, had his overseer single out and lay off <num value="1">one</num> acre of very rich hammock land, which was only lightly fertilized, from which he reaped <num value="50">fifty</num> measured bushels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>Of course this was only testing what good uplands, or hammocks rich in soil, would yield in wheat by highly or lightly fertilizing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/><rs type="role">Mr.</rs> G-- had sown quite heavily in wheat when all avenues for its entrance to the <rs>South</rs> had been closed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>I remember <num value="1">one</num> <measure n="12acres" type="area">twelve acres</measure> of hammock land that <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> G-- had sown in wheat, so rich of soil that no fertilizing was necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>Morning, noon, and night that <num value="12">twelve</num>-acre hammock in wheat was a topic of conversation at the table during our meal hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>In <num value="1">one</num> of our afternoon rides, when school hours were over for the day, we made haste to view this paragon of a field, and as we halted our horses on the crest of a hill from which we could <quote>view the landscape o'er,</quote> what a grand panorama came into view!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>There, not the <quote>fields arrayed in living green,</quote> but wave <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> on wave of long amber wheat gently rolling in the wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>A large stream of water bounded <num value="2">two</num> sides of the hammock, and heavy green foliage formed a background in vivid contrast to the golden heads whose every culm seemed on a level.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>We slid almost unconsciously from our saddles, hitched the horses, and were soon standing in the midst of the wheat, with eyes scarcely able to peer over that vast plain of golden-yellow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>We took off our hats and gave them a sail on the already ripening grain,--for it was near harvest time, --and there they lay without perceptibly bending the stalks of wheat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>We plucked some of the grain, rubbed it in our hands to free and winnow it, and found it sweet and palatable Backward flew our thoughts to that field of wheat near <placeName reg="Lake Tiberias, Erath, Texas" key="tgn,2720788">Lake Tiberias</placeName> through which <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0020.0002.00021.00009" reg="mostcommon:Christ,nomatch:0"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> and his disciples passed on the <name>Sabbath</name> day and plucked the <quote>ears of corn</quote> and did eat, for they hungered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>The yield of the hammock was estimated to be at least <num value="500">five hundred</num> bushels; but a rainy spell set in just as the reaping began, and it rained in showers, light and heavy, more or less for <measure n="27days" type="date">twenty-seven days</measure>. As <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> the means then for harvesting wheat were of a primeval order, the reaping was slow and tedious, so that most of the grain was badly damaged, and some was entirely spoiled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>There was great bother when it came to threshing the wheat; many and varied were the means employed for freeing the chaff from the grain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>Some planters threshed and fanned the wheat at their gin-houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>I remember a portable thresher came into our settlement, and traveled from plantation to plantation, threshing for a percentage of the grain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Others, whose sowing and reaping was on a small scale, resorted to ruder methods to free the grain,meth-ods which called to mind the rural life and manners of ancient times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>Sometimes the wheat was threshed with the rudest sort of home-made flails. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>A woman, whose husband and <num value="2">two</num> sons were in the army, lived near our settlement in a cottage which stood some little distance from the roadside, in a cluster of oaks, whose foliage almost hid the house from passers-by.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>While yet some rods from the dwelling, <num value="1">one</num> day, there came to our ears a succession of regular thwacks, <pb id="p.23" n="23"/> the meaning of which we could not define by the sound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>As the woman was a neighbor, we turned aside to investigate, and opened wide our eyes when we beheld the woman seated in a chair, with a common sized barrel just in front of her, within good striking distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>There she sat, a sheaf of wheat held with both hands, and with this she was vigorously belaboring the barrel, at every stroke a shower of wheat-grains raining down upon quilts and coverlets which had been arranged to catch it. By this simple process she flailed as much as a bushel or <num value="2">two</num> at <num value="1">one</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>She then spread the sheets out on the ground, in the open air, and poured the wheat on them in a continuous stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>The wind acted as a great <quote>fan,</quote> the grain by its own weight falling in <num value="1">one</num> place, while the chaff was carried off by the wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>When that threshing was ground at the flouring mill and used up, the same rude flailing was repeated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>Another contrivance for threshing wheat, even more unique, was that of a woman whose husband also was in our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>She was left with <num value="5">five</num> small children, but managed to cultivate a small farm with those of <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> the <num value="5">five</num> children who had grown enough to give a little help.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>She raised a small plat of wheat year by year as the war went on. She had in her smoke-house a large trough that was used for salting pork when killed in the winter; indeed, nearly all smokehouses then had large troughs, some as many as <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num>, hewn and dug out from the stocks of trees, and sometimes <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure> long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>They were very useful in holding salted pork, salt, soap, and dried bacon packed down in leached ashes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>The woman cleaned her trough nicely, untied the sheaves of wheat, and placed them in the trough, not quite brimming, so as to lose none of the grains; then with heavy sticks and little wooden mauls she had roughly shaped, she and her little children would beat the grain free of the husks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>It was then winnowed the same way as was the woman's who threshed over the barrel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>Hundreds during the war resorted to such devices for freeing their grain of chaff; yet flour was very scarce, although the <rs>South</rs> put forth her best energies to cultivate wheat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>After delivering the government tithe, and sharing with our home ones, <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> the crop rarely lasted till another harvest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>It was quite amusing to hear the neighbors as they met in social gatherings, or perhaps when separating from service at church, press their friends to come and see them, or come and have dinner, <quote><hi rend="italics">For we have got a barrel of flour</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>It was even more amusing to have friends sit at the <rs n="dining table" type="product">dining-table</rs>, and, when a waiter of brown, warm biscuits was passed round, to see them feign ignorance of what they were. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>Bolted meal, when obtainable, made a very good substitute for flour, though millers said it injured their <rs n="bolting cloth" type="product">bolting-cloth</rs> to sift the <rs n="corn meal" type="product">corn meal</rs> through it; yet nearly every household, in sending its grist to be ground, would order a portion of the meal to be bolted for use as flour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Such bolted meal, when sifted through a thin muslin cloth and mixed up with scalding water to make it more viscid and adhesive, was as easily moulded into pie crust with the aid of the rolling-pin as the pure flour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Nice muffins and waffles were made of bolted meal, and we also made a very nice cake of the same and our home-made <rs n="brown sugar" type="product">brown sugar</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>All the moist and marshy places in the <pb id="p.26" n="26"/> fields that had hitherto been thought fit for naught as to the growing of farm products, were utilized for rice and sugar-cane patches, and were found to yield plentifully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Some people, not having dank or moist spots suitable for rice on their farms, planted rice on the uplands, and were surprised to find they had an average yield with those who had planted the moist spots; and thus it has come about that even now in the <rs>South</rs> rice is planted on the uplands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>Some few rude rice mills were hastily put up for stripping the coarse brown husks from the rice, but as they were distant from most of the planters in our settlement, wooden mortars had to be temporarily improvised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>A tree of proper size would be cut down; from the stock a length suitable would be cut or sawed; a cavity would be hollowed with an adze in the centre of the block endwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>For the want of better polishing tools the cavity would be made smooth by burning with fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>The charred surface was then scraped off and made even, the hollow cleared free of all coal dust, and the pestle, made, perhaps, from a bough of the same tree, completed the primitive rice mill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>Rough rice <pb id="p.27" n="27"/> pounded in such a mortar and winnowed by the wind was clean and white.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>The only objection to it was that it was more splintered than if it had gone through a better mill. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>In our settlement only the <quote>green</quote> and <quote>ribbon</quote> cane were grown, which, like the cereals, were never cultivated before the war. What cane had been grown was in patches owned by slaves, and for the saccharine juice alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>Wooden cylinders had to be used, as those of iron were not easily obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>With these cylinders all of the juice could not be expressed, but our farmers contented themselves with the thought that there was no great loss after all, as their swine could draw from the crushed cane all the juice that was left before it was hauled to fill ditches and gullies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>In case <num value="1">one</num> was so fortunate as to secure a sugar mill with iron cylinders, it used to go the rounds of its immediate vicinity, as the portable threshers did. <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> <num value="1">one</num> and then another of the neighbors would use it till their crop of cane was <pb id="p.28" n="28"/> ground and made into syrup and sugar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>The furnaces for sugar and syrup making were built of rocks, if bricks were not convenient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>They held <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> kettles, according to the quantity of cane to be ground and of juice to be boiled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>A couple or more of long wooden troughs hollowed from trees were necessary for containing the syrup when boiled to the proper degree of density, before turning into the barrels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>That designed for sugar, after being turned into the troughs, was usually beaten with wooden paddles, and dipper after dipper was filled with the thick syrup and poured back into the sugar trough, till all was changed into sugar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>Of course there were mishaps now and then, as evaporators could not be had, and the planters were not experts in syrup and sugar making.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>I remember.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/><num value="1">one</num> gentleman, whose <quote>green</quote> and <quote>ribbon</quote> cane had been exceptionally fine for the season, who had engaged a man who was said to be something of an expert to supervise his sugar boiling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>Another had boiled his juice too much for either sugar or syrup, so that he had a whole barrel full of dark-brown solid candy, which had to be chipped out with a hatchet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>The syrup that was made later, as the war went on, was all that could be desired,--thick, clear, and pure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>The sugar was necessarily brown, as appliances for refining at that time could not be had. The planters would place smooth oak splits and switches in the barrels of sugar, and just the length of the barrel, to aid the dripping, and to better free the sugar from moisture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>It was not uncommon to see planters, when they called upon each other, draw from their pockets small packages wrapped in our <pb id="p.30" n="30"/> own manufactured brown paper, which packages contained samples of their make of sugar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>A woman whose husband and <num value="1">one</num> son were in our army had raised, with the help of her few slaves, among other farm products, a surplus of watermelons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>The season had been propitious, and her melons were large, well flavored, and very juicy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>So <num value="1">one</num> day she determined to make a trial of the juice of the watermelons for syrup.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>She gathered those which were thought to be ripe enough for use, prepared a large tub with a sack hanging over it, sliced up the melons, and scraped all the meat and juice into the sack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>From what dripped into the tub through the sack when pressed, she managed to get several gallons of bright juice, which she placed for boiling in her large iron kettle-generally known in the country as the <quote>wash pot,</quote> and which was always left out of doors, in a shady, convenient place, for washing clothes, making soap, or drying up lard in hog-killing time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>She built her fire, boiled <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> the juice slowly, carefully taking off all the scum, and was rewarded with syrup of a flavor as fine, or even finer, than that made from the sugar-cane.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Flushed with success, she essayed sugar, also, from watermelon juice, and cakes as nice as those from the sap of the maple were the outcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>The balance of her melon crop was converted into sugar and syrup. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>Inasmuch as syrup and sugar had to be placed in barrels, barrel-making was another industry that was forced upon the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>Soon several coopers' shops were built here and there, and it seemed queer enough for us to have home-made barrels, casks, tubs, and piggins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>They were manufactured of oak, pine, cypress, and juniper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>Those in use for syrup or sugar were generally of oak, as it was thought they gave a more pleasant taste to their contents. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>As we had no rollers <pb id="p.33" n="33"/> to crush the beans, rude mortars were resorted to, in which they were well crushed, the oil passing, as it was expressed, through an orifice in the side of the mortar, near its base.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>Water was then added to the oil, and the whole was boiled, or rather raised to the boiling point, which caused all the impurities to rise to the top, when it was strained and the oil dipped from the top of the water.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>Shoes and leather soon became very high-priced, bringing home to us the fact that we had indeed entered on troublous times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>All our planters were reduced to the necessity of tanning leather for their own use, and also in order to aid in supplying the soldiers of our Confederacy with shoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>The home process of tanning among the lesser planters was perhaps as crude as that practiced in the earliest ages; for although there were many rude <pb id="p.34" n="34"/> tanneries set in operation during the war, and still ruder modes of grinding the red oak bark for the vats were in vogue in some places, planters on a small scale did not care to carry the few hides they had the long distances to the tanyards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>With them the question was how best to tan at their homes, and as the necessity was urgent, it was not long ere they had devised a plan. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>The hides were placed in a trough or barrel and covered with water, in which a small quantity of weak lye, that was made to answer the purpose of lime, had been mingled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>When the hides had soaked the required length of time, they were taken from the trough, and with but little difficulty and labor the hair was removed and they were ready for the next stage of the process.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>A pit, of size suitable for the number of hides to be tanned, was dug in the ground near a spring or stream of running water; the bottom and sides were lined with boards riven from the stock of a tree; the seams were calked tightly with lint cotton, to prevent the tan-ooze from escaping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>Then the red oak bark, which had been peeled in long strips from the trees, having <pb id="p.35" n="35"/> arrived, a layer of the bark was placed smooth and even in the bottom of the vat, a layer of hides was stretched over the bark, another layer of bark was put in position, then another of hides, and so on, until the rough vat was filled with hides and bark,--the bark being used just as it came from the trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Water was poured into the vat, and its contents were left to steep from <num value="3">three</num> to <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, according to the fancy of the tanner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>I heard many planters say they had never bought better leather than that which they had tanned by this simple process. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>Of course, when neighbor called upon neighbor, the leather that was hometanned used to be displayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>They would double it over and over again, and often pronounce it the best they ever saw. It made a soft, peculiar noise when pressed with the hands, and was very pliant and supple, answering every purpose for which leather is adapted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>Its chief usefulness lay in its furnishing shoes for our soldiers and for those at home, but gear of all kinds used on plantations was mended or made anew from this product; harnesses for farm use or for equipping army saddles or <pb id="p.36" n="36"/> ambulance trains were manufactured and repaired out of home-tanned leather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>And to meet our pressing wants, the hides of horses, mules, hogs, and dogs were all utilized. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>This fall the cholera epidemic had been so fatal that there was scarcely a planter in all the neighborhood but lost a great many swine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>They would feed at night and seem to be perfectly well, and be dead by morning; or seemingly well in the morning, and dead by night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>As this happened in war time, the loss was felt heavily. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>We needed leather so badly that the hogs were flayed as soon as dead, and their hides were tanned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>The best and heaviest leather was used for making shoes for the slaves, as their work was out of doors as a rule, and heavy brogans could not be bought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>But leather from the hides of swine fell to our lot also, for winter shoes; <pb id="p.37" n="37"/> and many other white families were obliged to use it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>They were made of leather which <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> G-himself had had tanned, and, except that the pores were very large and wide apart, it looked like ordinary leather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>We had consented with some reluctance to have these shoes made, for, although we were willing to immolate ourselves on the altar of our <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, it had fallen rather severely on us to think that we must wear hog-skin shoes!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>They were made, however, at a cost of <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollars</measure> a pair, we furnishing the leather from which to make them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>But swine-skin leather was very extensible, and our shoes spread out quite flat by the time we had worn them a day or so.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>As no shoe-blacking or polish could be bought during the blockade, each family improvised its own blacking, which was soot and oil of some variety (either cottonseed, <pb id="p.38" n="38"/> ground peas, or oil of compressed lard) mixed together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The shoes would be well painted with the mixture of soot and oil, with brushes made of the bristles of swine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>Then a thin paste made of flour, bolted meal, or starch, was applied all over the blackened shoe with another brush, which paste, when dry, gave the shoe as bright and glossy an appearance as if <quote>shined</quote> by the best of bootblacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>The obtaining of salt became extremely difficult when the war had cut off our supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>This was true especially in regions remote from the sea-coast and border States, such as the interior of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> and <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Here again we were obliged to have recourse to whatever expedient ingenuity suggested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>All the brine left in troughs and barrels, where pork had been salted down, was carefully dipped up, boiled down, and converted into salt again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>In some cases the salty soil under old smokehouses was dug up and placed in hoppers, which resembled backwoods ash-hoppers, <pb id="p.39" n="39"/> made for leaching ashes in the process of soap-manufacture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Water was then poured upon the soil, the brine which percolated through the hopper was boiled down to the proper point, poured into vessels, and set in the sun, which by evaporation completed the rude process.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>Though never of immaculate whiteness, the salt which resulted from these methods served well enough for all our purposes, and we accepted it without complaining. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Before the war there were in the <rs>South</rs> but few cotton mills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>These were kept running night and day, as soon as the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> was organized, and we were ourselves prevented by the blockade from purchasing clothing from the factories at the <rs>North</rs>, or clothing imported from <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> or <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>The cotton which grew in the immediate vicinity of the mills kept them well supplied with raw material.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Yet notwithstanding the great push of the cotton mills, they proved totally inadequate, after the war began, to our vast need for clothing of every kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>Every household now became a miniature factory in itself, with its <rs n="cotton card" type="product">cotton, cards</rs>, spinning-wheels, warping-frames, looms, and so on. Wherever <pb id="p.40" n="40"/> <num value="1">one</num> went, the hum of the spinningwheel and the clang of the batten of the loom was borne on the ear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>Great trouble was experienced, in the beginning, to find dyes with which to color our stuffs; but in the course of time, both at the old mills and at smaller experimental factories which were run entirely by hand, barks, leaves, roots, and berries were found containing coloring properties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>I was well acquainted with a gentleman in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248"><rs type="direction">southwestern</rs> Georgia</placeName> who owned a small cotton mill, and who, when he wanted coloring substances, used to send his wagons to the woods and freight them with a shrub known as myrtle, that grew teeming in low moist places near his mill.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>That the slaves might be well clad, the owners kept, according to the number of slaves owned, a number of negro women carding and spinning, and had looms running all the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Now and then a planter would be so fortunate as to secure a bale or more of white sheeting and osnaburgs from the cotton mills, in exchange for farm products, which would be quite a lift, and <pb id="p.41" n="41"/> give a little breathing-spell from the almost incessant whirr, hum, and clang of the spinning-wheel and loom. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Wide unbleached sheeting was also used for making dresses, and when dyed a deep solid color and tastefully made up the effect was quite handsome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, when <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> G-- had been fortunate in getting a bale of unbleached factory sheeting, <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> G-- gave to me, to her <num value="2">two</num> oldest daughters, and a niece of hers, who was as <num value="1">one</num> of the family, enough of the sheeting to make each <num value="1">one</num> of us a dress.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>I have often joined with neighbors, when school hours for the day were over, in gathering roots, barks, leaves, twigs, sumach berries, and walnuts, for the hulls, which dyed wool a beautiful dark brown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Such was the variety we had to choose from, to dye our cloth and thread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>We used to pull our way through the deep tangled woods, by thickly shaded streams, through broad fields, and return laden with the riches of the <rs>Southern</rs> forest!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>Not infrequently clusters of grapes mingled, with our freight of dyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>The pine-tree's roots <pb id="p.42" n="42"/> furnished a beautiful dye, approximating very closely to garnet, which color I chose for the sheeting for my dress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>A strong decoction of the roots of the pine-tree was used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Copperas of our own production was was used as the mordant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>A cask or some small vessel was set convenient to the dwelling-house and partly filled with water, in which a small quantity of salt and vinegar had been mingled; then pieces of rusty, useless iron, such as plows too much worn to be used again, rusty broken rails, old <rs n="horse shoe" type="product">horse-shoes</rs>, and bits of old chains were picked up and cast into the cask.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>The liquid copperas was always ready, and a very good substance we found it to fix colors in cloth or thread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>The sheeting for the dress was folded smoothly and basted slightly so as to keep the folds in place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>It was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thoroughly soaked in warm soapsuds, then dipped into the dye, and afterwards into a vessel containing liquid lye from woodashes; then it went again into the dye, then the lye, and so on till the garnet color was the required shade.

<p>Many of the planters in <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659"><rs type="direction">southern</rs> Alabama</placeName> began to grow wool on quite a large scale, as the war went on and no <rs n="woolen goods" type="product">woolen goods</rs> could be had. All the woolen material that could be manufactured at the cotton mills was used to clothe our soldiers, so that all the varied kinds of <rs n="woolen goods" type="product">woolen goods</rs> that hitherto had been used with us had now to be of home hand-make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>In this we achieved entire success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>All kinds of <rs n="woolen goods" type="product">woolen goods</rs>-flannels both <rs type="color">colored</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs>, plaids of bright colors, which we thought equal to the famed Scotch plaids; balmorals, which were then in fashionwere woven, with grave or gay borders as suited our fancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Woolen coverlets and blankets were also manufactured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>The woolen blankets were at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> woven with the warp of cotton thread, but a woman of our settlement improved on that by weaving some blankets on the common house loom, both warp and woof of wool, spun by her own hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>The borders were bright <rs type="color">red</rs> and <rs type="color">blue</rs>, of texture soft and yielding; they were almost equal to those woven at a regular woolen mill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>The process of weaving all-wool blankets with warp and woof hand-spun was quite tedious, yet it <pb id="p.44" n="44"/> was accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>Various kinds of twilled woolen cloth were also woven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>In weaving coverlets, the weaver had the <quote>draught</quote> before her, to guide her in tramping the pedals and throwing the design of flower, vine, leaf, square, or diamond on the right side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>Beautiful carpets also were made on the same plan as coverlets. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>Many of the planters, after the shearing of their sheep, used to carry the wool to the nearest cotton mill and have it carded into rolls, to facilitate the making of woolen cloth; and often large quantities of lint cotton were hauled to the factories, to be carded into rolls to be spun at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>But carding rolls by common hand-cards was a rather slow and tiresome process. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>There was some pleasant rivalry as to who should be the most successful in producing the brightest and clearest tinge of color on thread or cloth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>Most of the women of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659"><rs type="direction">southern</rs> Alabama</placeName> had small plats of ground for cultivating the indigo bush, for making <quote>indigo blue,</quote> or <quote>indigo mud,</quote> as it was sometimes called.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>The indigo weed also grew abundantly in the wild state in our vicinage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Those who did not care to bother with indigo cultivation used to gather, from the woods, the weed in the wild state when in season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Enough of the blue was always made either from the wild or cultivated indigo plant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>We used to have our regular <quote>indigo churnings,</quote> as they were called.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>When the weed had matured sufficiently for making the blue mud, which was about the time the plant began to flower, the plants were cut close to the ground, our steeping vats were closely packed with the <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> weed, and water enough to cover the plant was poured in. The vat was then left <num value="8">eight</num> or <measure n="9days" type="date">nine days</measure> undisturbed for fermentation, to extract the dye. Then the plant was rinsed out, so to speak, and the water in the vat was churned up and down with a basket for quite a while; weak lye was added as a precipitate, which caused the indigo particles held in solution to fall to the bottom of the vat; the water was poured off, and the <quote>mud</quote> was placed in a sack and hung up to drip and dry. It was just as clear and bright a blue as if it had passed through a more elaborate process. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>The woods, as well as being the great storehouse for all our <rs n="dye stuffs" type="product">dye-stuffs</rs>, were also our drug stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>The berries of the dogwood-tree were taken for quinine, as they contained the alkaloid properties of cinchona and <rs n="peruvian bark" type="product">Peruvian bark</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>A soothing and efficacious cordial for dysentery and similar ailments was made from blackberry roots; but ripe persimmons, when made into a cordial, were thought to be far superior to blackberry roots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>An extract of the barks of the wild cherry, dogwood, poplar, and wahoo trees was used for chills and agues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>For coughs and all lung diseases <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> a syrup made with the leaves and roots of the mullein plant, globe flower, and wild-cherry tree bark was thought to be infallible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>Of course the castor-bean plant was gathered in the wild state in the forest, for making <rs n="castor oil" type="product">castor oil</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Many also cultivated a few rows of poppies in their garden to make opium, from which our laudanum was created; and this at times was very needful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>The manner of extracting opium from poppies was of necessity crude, in our hedged-around situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>It was, indeed, simple in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>The heads or bulbs of the poppies were plucked when ripe, the capsules pierced with a large-sized sewing-needle, and the bulbs placed in some small vessel (a cup or saucer would answer) for the opium gum to exude and to become inspissated by evaporation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>The soporific influence of this drug was not excelled by that of the imported article. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>Bicarbonate of soda, which had been in use for raising bread before the war, became <quote>a thing of the past</quote> soon after the blockade began; but it was not long ere some <num value="1">one</num> found out that the ashes of corncobs possessed the alkaline property essential <pb id="p.48" n="48"/> for raising dough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Whenever <quote>soda</quote> was needed, corn was shelled, care being taken to select all the red cobs, as they were thought to contain more carbonate of soda than white cobs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>When the cobs were burned in a clean swept place, the ashes were gathered up and placed in a jar or jug, and so many measures of water were poured in, according to the quantity of ashes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>When needed for bread-making, a teaspoonful or tablespoonful of the alkali was used to the measure of flour or meal required. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Another industry to which the need of the times gave rise was the making of pottery, which, although not food or clothing, was indispensable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Of course, our earthenware was rough, coarse, and brown; and its enameling would have caused a smile of disdain from the ancient <rs>Etruscans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Nevertheless, we found our brownglazed plates, cups and saucers, washbowls and pitchers, and milk crocks exceedingly convenient and useful as temporary expedients, as no tin pans could be had; and we were thankful that we could make this homely ware. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>All in our settlement learned to card, <pb id="p.49" n="49"/> spin, and weave, and that was the case with all the women of the <rs>South</rs> when the blockade closed us in. Now and then, it is true, a steamer would &mdash; run the blockade, but the few articles in the line of merchandise that reached us served only as a reminder of the outside world and of our once great plenty, now almost forgotten, and also more forcibly to remind us that we must depend upon our own ingenuity to supply the necessities of existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Our days of novitiate were short.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>We soon became very apt at knitting and crocheting useful as well as ornamental woolen notions, such as capes, sacques, vandykes, shawls, gloves, socks, stockings, and men's suspenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>The clippings of lambs' wool were especially used by us for crocheting or knitting shawls, gloves, capes, sacques, and hoods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Our needles for such knitting were made of seasoned hickory or oakwood a foot long, or even longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Lambs' wool clippings, when carded and spun fine by hand and dyed bright colors, were almost the peer of the zephyr wool now sold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>To have the hanks spotted or variegated, they were tightly braided or plaited, and so dyed; when the <pb id="p.50" n="50"/> braids were unfolded a beautiful dappled color would result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Sometimes corn husks were wrapped around the hanks at regular or irregular spaces and made fast with strong thread, so that when placed in the dye the incased parts, as was intended, would imbibe little or no dye, and when knit, crocheted, or woven would present a clouded or dappled appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Handsome mittens were knit or crocheted of the same lambs' wool dyed jet black, gray, garnet, or whatever color was preferred; a bordering of vines, with green leaves and rosebuds of bright colors, was deftly knitted in on the edge and top of the gloves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Various designs of flowers or other patterns were used for gloves, and were so skillfully knitted in that they formed the exact representation of the copy from which they were taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>For the bordering of capes, shawls, gloves, hoods, and sacques the wool yarn was dyed <rs type="color">red</rs>, <rs type="color">blue</rs>, <rs type="color">black</rs>, and <rs type="color">green</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Of course, intermediate colors were employed in some cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>The juice of poke berries dyed a red as bright as aniline, but this was not very good for wash stuffs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>A strong decoction of the bark of the hickory-tree made a clear, bright green <pb id="p.51" n="51"/> on wool, when alum could be had as a mordant; sometimes there were those who, by some odd chance, happened to have a bit of alum. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>There grew in some spots in the woods, though very sparsely, a weed about a foot and <num value="0.5">a half</num> high, called <quote>the queen's delight,</quote> which dyed a jet black on wool.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>We have frequently gone all of <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> from our home, and, after a wide range of the woods, would perhaps secure only a small armful of this precious weed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>We did not wonder at the name, it was so scarce and rare, as well as the only <num value="1">one</num> of all the weeds, roots, bark, leaves, or berries that would dye jet black.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>Here again a pleasant rivalry arose, as to who could form the most unique bordering for capes, shawls, and all such woolen knit or crocheted clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>There were squares, diamonds, crosses, bars, and designs of flowers formed in knitting and in crocheting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Some <num value="1">one</num> had learned to knit slippers, and it was not long before most of the women of our settlement had a pair of slippers on the knitting needles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>They were knit of our homespun thread, either cotton or wool, which was, for slippers, generally dyed a dark brown, gray, or black.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>When taken off the needles, the slippers or shoes were lined with cloth of suitable texture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>The upper edges were bound with strips of cloth, of color to blend with the hue of the knit work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>A rosette was formed of some stray bits of ribbon, or scraps of fine bits of merino or silk, and placed on the uppers of the slippers; then they were ready for the soles. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>We explored the seldom-visited attic and lumber-room, and overhauled the contents of old trunks, boxes, and scrap-bags for pieces of cassimere, merino, broadcloth, or other heavy fine twilled goods, to make <pb id="p.53" n="53"/> our <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> shoes, as we could not afford to wear shoes of such fine stuff every day; home-woven jeans and heavy, plain cloth had to answer for every-day wear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>When <num value="1">one</num> was so fortunate as to get a bolt of osnaburgs, scraps of that made excellent shoes when colored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>What is now called the <quote>base-ball shoe</quote> always reminds me of our war-time colored osnaburgs, but ours did not have straps of leather like those which cross the base-ball shoe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Our slippers and shoes which were made of fine bits of cloth, cost us a good deal of labor in binding and stitching with colors and thread to blend with the material used, before they were sent to the shoemaker to have them soled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>Sometimes we put on the soles ourselves by taking wornout shoes, whose soles were thought sufficiently strong to carry another pair of uppers, ripping the soles off, placing them in warm water to make them more pliable and to make it easier to pick out all the old stitches, and then in the same perforations stitching our knit slippers or cloth-made shoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>We also had to cut out soles for shoes from our hometanned leather, with the sole of an old shoe <pb id="p.54" n="54"/> as our pattern, and with an awl perforate the sole for sewing on the upper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>I was often surprised at the dexterity with which we could join soles and uppers together, the shoe being reversed during the stitching, and when finished turned right side out again; and I smile even now when I remember how we used to hold our selfmade shoes at arm's length and say, as they were inspected: <quote>What is the blockade to us, so far as shoes are concerned, when we can not only knit the uppers, but cut the soles and stitch them on?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Each woman and girl her own shoemaker; away with bought shoes; we want none of them!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>For very fine sewing-thread great care had to be used in drawing the strand of cotton evenly, as well as finely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>It was a wearisome task, and great patience had to be exercised, as there was continual snapping of the fine hand-spun thread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>From broaches of <pb id="p.55" n="55"/> such spun sewing-thread balls of the cotton were wound from <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="3">three</num> strands double, according as coarse or fine thread was needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>The ball was then placed in a bowl of warm soapsuds and the thread twisted on to a bobbin of corn husks placed on the spindle of the wheel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>During the process of twisting the thread a miniature fountain would be set playing from the thread as it twirled upon the spindle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>Bunch thread from the cotton mill, <num value="12">number twelve</num>, made very strong sewingthread, but little could we afford of that; it was exceedingly scarce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>When the web of cloth, especially that of factory bunch thread, had been woven as closely up as the sley and harness would permit the warp opening for the shuttle to pass through, the ends of the weaver's threads, or thrums, generally a yard long when taken from around the large cloth beam, would be cut from the cloth and made into sewing-thread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>We spent many evenings around the fire, if winter time, or lamp if summer weather, drawing the threads singly from the bunch of thrums and then tying together <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> strands, as the thread was to be coarse or fine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>There were rude frames in most people's yards for making rope out of cotton thread spun very coarse, and quite a quantity of such rope was made on these roperys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>The bonnets were cut in shape and lined with tarlatan. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>The skirt of the <name>Shaker</name> was made of single sleyed cloth, as we called it. In common woven heavy cloth <num value="2">two</num> threads of warp were passed through the reeds of the sley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>For the skirts of our bonnets we wanted the cloth soft and light, hence only <num value="1">one</num> thread was passed through the reeds, and that was lightly tapped by the batten; it was then soft and yielding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>When the cloth was dyed with willow bark, which colored a beautiful drab, we thought our bonnets equal to those we had bought in days gone by. There was variety enough of material to make hats for both men and women, palmetto taking the lead for hats for <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> wear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>The straw of oats or wheat and corn husks were braided and made into hats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>Hats which were almost everlasting, we used to think, were made of pine straw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>Hats were made of cloth also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>I remember <num value="1">one</num> in particular of gray jeans, stitched in small diamonds with black silk thread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>It was as perfect a hat as was ever moulded by the <pb id="p.59" n="59"/> hatter, but the oddness of that hat consisted in its being stitched on the sewingmachine with silk thread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>All sewingma-chines in our settlement were at a standstill during the period of the war, as our home-made thread was not suited to machines, and all sewing had to be done by hand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>We became quite skilled in making designs of palmetto and straw braiding and plaiting for hats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>Fans, baskets, and mats we made of the braided palmetto and straw also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>Then there was the <quote>bonnet squash,</quote> known also as the <quote>Spanish dish-rag,</quote> that was cultivated by some for making bonnets and hats for women and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>Such hats presented a fine appearance, but they were rather heavy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>Many would make the frame for their bonnets or hats, then cover it with the small white feathers and down of the goose, color bright red with the juice of poke berries, or blue with indigo mud, some of the larger feathers, and on a small wire form a wreath or plume with bright-<rs type="color">colored</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs> feathers blended together; or, if no wire was convenient, a fold or <num value="2">two</num> of heavy cloth, or paper doubled, was used to sew <pb id="p.60" n="60"/> the combination of feathers on for wreath, plume, or rosette.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Tastefully arranged, this made a hat or bonnet by no means rustic looking. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>Willow wickerwork came in as a new industry with us. We learned to weave willow twigs into baskets of many shapes and sizes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>A woman of our settlement wove of willow switches a beautiful and ornate body for her baby carriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>As much, she said, to show what she could make out of willow withes, as for the real use of her baby. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>The switches were gathered when the willows were flowering, and stripped of bark and leaves; what was not wanted for immediate use was put by in bundles, to be used in our leisure hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>When placed in warm water the withes were soon as flexible as if freshly gathered and peeled, and were as easily woven into varied kinds of wickerwork. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/><rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> G---had a flock of <num value="60">sixty</num> or <num value="70">seventy</num> head of geese.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>A large stream of clear water ran within a stone's throw of the rear of the dwelling, through what was the <pb id="p.62" n="62"/> main pasture-lot for the geese.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>Clear pools of water, caused by the sudden bend of the stream, rocks, or perhaps a fallen tree, were formed as the stream wound through the pasture-lot, in which the geese were nearly all the time swimming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>This kept their feathers snowy white.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>Wishing a finer grade of fans than we had made of braided palmetto or woven rushes or pasteboard, it was not long ere we had learned to put the secondary wing-feathers of geese to that use. When the feathers were <quote>ripe</quote> we would pluck them, being very careful in the plucking to string on a strong thread the feathers <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> as they were taken out. All the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName>-feathers were placed on <num value="1">one</num> string, the <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName>-feathers on another separate string, so that when we were ready to arrange the feathers for making fans, each feather would be in its proper place, just as drawn from the wing of the goose, and would therefore have the fitting curve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>The secondary feathers of both wings were used to make <num value="1">one</num> fan. Its handles were of cedar or pine wood and were sometimes made on the <quote>turner's machine,</quote> but oftener we whittled them out of cedar or pine wood ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/><pb id="p.63" n="63"/> They were always covered with scraps of velvet, silk, cassimere, or merino, and bits of old faded ribbon dyed some bright color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>We soon became adepts in the art of making fans out of the wing-feathers of geese, and beside those for our own use we made and sold many in the city of <placeName reg="Eufaula, Barbour, Alabama" key="tgn,7014121">Eufaula</placeName> for <num value="10">ten</num>, <num value="15">fifteen</num>, and <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">twenty dollars</measure> apiece. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>A sister of <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> G--, who lived some little distance from us, and who owned a large flock of pea-fowls, often favored her sister with the more valuable dark olivegreen wing-feathers of her magnificent birds, and they made superb fans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>I was remembered by <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> G--, and was given a select pair of wing-feathers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>I gave my best skill to this fan, for it was to be a present to my mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>The handle I covered with a piece of dark green silk velvet for which I exchanged a scrap of silk of a different color, so as to have an exact blending of the feathers and silk velvet for covering the handle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>On either side where I had joined the handle and feathers, I placed a rosette made of the small <rs type="color">green</rs> and <rs type="color">blue</rs> variegated feathers that adorn the neck and breast of the pea-fowl.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/><num value="2">Two</num> buttons cut out of pasteboard and covered <pb id="p.64" n="64"/> with a bit of the silk velvet, saved from covering the handle, were placed in the centre of the rosettes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>I think it would have been difficult to have singled out that fan as not imported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>I was offered <measure n="30dollars" type="currency">thirty dollars</measure> for it as soon as it was completed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/><num value="1">One</num> would scarcely believe how beautiful our snow-white fans of geese feathers were, with their large rosettes on either side, made of the <rs type="color">blue</rs> and <rs type="color">green</rs> small feathers that grace the neck of the peacock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>We made fans also of gray goose feathers, and from feathers out of turkeys' wings and tails were made strong substantial fans, for every-day use in summer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>An amusing incident happened <num value="1">one</num> day while we were making fans of the feathers of the geese.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>We had been told by some <num value="1">one</num> that if we would tie a strip of scarlet cloth around a goose's neck, it would fly away and never return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>Late <num value="1">one</num> afternoon the oldest daughter of the house and I were strolling all alone in the pasture-lot where the geese were feeding on the luxuriant grass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>At sight of the sleek, glossy flock feeding <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi>, the impulse arose on the instant to put to the test the romantic hearsay, and we quickly caught a goose <pb id="p.65" n="65"/> of snowy whiteness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>My companion then took off her crimson silk belt (a relic of ante-bellum days). We tied it around the anser's neck, kneeling on the soft carpet of grass, <num value="1">one</num> holding the goose by the wings, while the other adjusted the belt; then we loosed it, expecting to see the spread of wings that was to bear it from our sight forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>But nothing of the kind happened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>It stepped cautiously around with its neck gracefully curved as if endeavoring to divine the mystery of the crimson streamer, while the entire flock without a single exception set up a hissing and cackling that was almost deafening, and with necks extended began to chase the goose with the scarlet pennant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>The loud cackling of the flock awoke the quiet of the house, and soon a negro girl came running, sent by her mistress, to see what was disturbing the geese.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>The legend had proved false; but we wondered not, as we retraced our steps, that the loud cackling of a flock of geese in <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> betrayed the presence of the <name>Gauls</name> who were about to storm the citadel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/><rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> G &mdash; promised her <num value="2">two</num> older daughters, her niece, and myself a new <pb id="p.66" n="66"/> home-woven, home-spun dress, just so soon as we should jointly finish the make &mdash; up of the slaves' <rs type="season">fall</rs> and <rs type="season">winter</rs> clothing, which we joined hands forthwith in cutting out. <num value="2">Two</num> suits apiece of <rs n="heavy goods" type="product">heavy goods</rs> were made for their winter wear, and <num value="2">two</num> suits apiece of material not so heavy for their <rs type="season">spring</rs> and <rs type="season">summer</rs> wear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>It usually took from <num value="6">six</num> to <measure n="8weeks" type="date">eight weeks</measure> of cutting out and sewing to get all the slaves into their new garments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>We were ever willing to lend our aid in the make &mdash; up of the negroes' clothing, yet the promise of a new homespun dress, to be dyed and woven as best pleased us <num value="4">four</num>, aroused our latent energy, and we soon completed the task without once knowing fatigue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>Then our homespun dresses came to the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>There was much consulting, advising, and draughting by the <num value="4">four</num>, before we had decided as to the color, check, or stripe we should have our dresses dyed or woven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>I well remember the color, stripe, and checktogether with the spangles that were woven in the meshes of thread &mdash; that we each made choice of. The warp was the same for all <num value="4">four</num> dresses,--nearly solid drab, with the exception of a narrow stripe of <pb id="p.67" n="67"/> <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">blue</rs> threads in a group, for every <num value="12">twelve</num> or <num value="14">fourteen</num> threads of drab, running parallel to each other the whole length of the warp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>The drab was dyed with the bark of the willow-tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>The hanks of thread for the woof of my dress were closely plaited and dyed a deep, clear blue with our home-made indigo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>When woven it presented the appearance of <quote>cirro-cumulus</quote> clouds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>The niece and <num value="1">one</num> of the daughters betook them to the garret to rummage amongst antique silk and woolen garments much <quote>the worse for wear.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>Part of an old black silk, and some red scraps of merino, and a remnant of an old blue scarf, was what they decided upon as spangles for their dresses, and both were to be just alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>The black silk and <rs type="color">red</rs> and <rs type="color">blue</rs> were cut into narrow strips; the strips were again cut into bits from <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> to half an inch in length and woven in the meshes of thread the whole length of their dresses. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>The <rs type="color">black</rs>, <rs type="color">blue</rs>, and <rs type="color">red</rs> bits of color were placed in by hand, varying from an inch to <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3inches" type="distance">three inches</measure> apart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>Sometimes the bits of bright color were placed in so as to form a square, diamond, or cross; <pb id="p.68" n="68"/> sometimes no order or method was heeded, but they were placed in on the <quote>crazy</quote> plan; yet when all the tiny bits had been placed in and when the material was made up into the dress, it presented quite a spangled appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>The other daughter had hers woven of solid drab, of willow-bark dye, and with a narrow stripe of <rs type="color">blue</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs> running the length of it in the warp; and this was just as pretty as the rest of our dresses, that had given a deal of trouble. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>Buttons for our dresses were our next consideration, and we had quite a debate on this weighty subject, as our substitutes for buttons and material for making them were many and varied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>It was something bewildering for us to determine finally what sort of buttons we should adopt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>Rude machines were devised for making buttons of wood as the war went on, and we were thrown more and more upon our own resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>The buttons made of wood were of various sizes, and were strong and lasting for <rs n="heavy goods" type="product">heavy goods</rs>, especially the clothing for the slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>Sometimes we would get the wood buttons, polish them with a bit of sandpaper, and varnish <pb id="p.69" n="69"/> them with a little of the copal varnish that happened to be on hand when the war began, and which was being carefully husbanded; our buttons thus polished and varnished exhibited some likeness to those we had been wont to buy in palmier days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>Many a household manufactured its own buttons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>They were made of cloth cut round, and of as many ply as was necessary for firmness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>Thick, heavy buttonhole stitches were worked all around the edge with thread coarser than the cloth of which the button was made, and when these were stitched on firmly there was no worry about the washerwoman's breaking or washing them off. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>Thread that we spun at home was used for making buttons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>The process was simple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>A small reed, or, if that was wanting, a large-sized broom-straw, could be used; around this the thread for such buttons would be wound till of sufficient bulk; it was then slid from the reed; the buttonhole stitch was used here again, and was thickly worked around the eyelet made by the reed; the eyelet was crossed with thread stronger than that of which the button was formed, for the purpose of attaching <pb id="p.70" n="70"/> it to the garment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>Persimmon seeds were also used for buttons with very good success, for being of such a tenacious and solid substance they could be put on clothing that required washing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>Very nice buttons were also shaped out of pine bark, and were covered or not, just as <num value="1">one</num> liked, but these were useless on garments for wash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>The shell of the common gourd was almost universally used at the <rs>South</rs> for buttons during the period of the war; when covered with strong homespun cloth they could stand washing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>Pasteboard was also used to make buttons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>We have often cut in different shapes and sizes pasteboard and the shell of the gourd for buttons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>We would have them round, oval, square, or diamond shaped, then cover neatly with cloth, with scraps of silk, or with fine pieces of colored <rs n="woolen goods" type="product">woolen goods</rs>, to match whatever material was used for dress or basque. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>Our pasteboard was made in our own homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>I smile even now when I think of that crude process.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>We used old papers and worn garments and a paste made of flour, or bolted meal sifted through fine cloth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>A paper was spread on a table, <pb id="p.71" n="71"/> paste was spread evenly and smoothly over the surface of the paper, a layer of cloth just the width and length of the paper was laid on, another coating of the paste followed, and so on, alternating with paper, paste, and cloth, until the required thickness was reached; then with a hot smoothing-iron the whole was pressed till perfectly dry, smooth, and glossy, and we had pasteboard adapted for all household needs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>But to return to our buttons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>They were made of drab thread, and after we had thickly worked the button-hole stitch around the eyelet, each took thread colored to blend with the warp and woof and again lightly overcast the button, so that the drab showed only as the background.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>The older daughter and I overcast ours with blue thread; the other <num value="2">two</num> overcast theirs with red thread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>It was then fashionable to place straps on the shoulder seams of ladies' dresses, with generally from <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="6">six</num> buttons on the straps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>We placed straps on ours, trimmed with the buttons which we had made, and they added not a little to the finish. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>We had intended to wear our new homespuns to the village church the <name>Sunday</name> <pb id="p.72" n="72"/> after completing them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>Perhaps there was the least bit of vanity in our thoughts of how we should appear in church in our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> home-woven suits; palmetto hats that we had braided and made with our own hands; slippers that we had knit, with soles cut out of our home-tanned leather, and on which we had with our own hands joined uppers and soles together.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>While we were all at the supper-table that <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, <persName><foreName>Ben</foreName></persName>, as usual, was <pb id="p.74" n="74"/> making the round of the rooms, replenishing all the fires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>He reached our room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>It being <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, he expected that we could not have the much-soiled dresses ready for <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>'s wear, even if we should discover the smut that evening. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>When we went back to our rooms from the supper-table our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> glance was toward our much-valued dresses, which appeared to hang just as we had left them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>I remember that <num value="70">seventy</num> rolls carded evenly and smoothly, if of medium size, would reel <num value="1">one</num> cut of thread.

<p>Steadily all that <name>Saturday</name> was heard the tramp, tramp, as we marched up and down the floor beside our spinning-wheels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>Our broaches had to be placed in a basket for the thread to be run off as it listed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>There was <quote>a scientific way</quote> of running the thread on to the bobbins, which were of corn-husks or thick paper, and placed on the spindle of the wheel for the thread to be run on to form the broach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>Any <num value="1">one</num> at all experienced in spinning could so run the thread on the broach that in reeling, the broach being held at the base by the hand, the thread would run smoothly off the apex of the broach without ever a break or tangle to the very last strand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>We had not run our thread on the broaches with the same amount of skill we had shown in spinning, hence there was much difficulty in reeling, but before we had finished the <measure n="36yards" type="distance">thirty-six yards</measure> of cloth our broaches ceased to give annoyance. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>As no muslin could be bought for summer wear, and our home-made cloth was very heavy and warm for hot weather, we women of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659"><rs type="direction">southern</rs> Alabama</placeName> devised a plan for making muslin out of our own homespun thread; and the fact that it was made of this thread added not a little to its excellence in our estimation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>In the weaving of all heavy, thick cloth, whether plain or twilled, <num value="2">two</num> threads, sometimes <num value="3">three</num>, were always passed through the reeds of the sley, when the warp was put in the loom for weaving the web of cloth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>The experiment for muslin, and it proved quite a success, was to draw the threads of warp singly through the reeds of the sley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>In the process of making muslin, both warp and woof were sized with sizing made of flour, to make the threads more smooth and unbending; whereas plain cloth had only the warp sized, and that with sizing made of Indian-meal <pb id="p.90" n="90"/> When thread for the muslin was beamed, and <num value="1">one</num> single thread passed through the reeds of the sley, and only a slight tap of the batten given as the shuttle passed through the opening with its quill of sized thread, the texture was thin and gauze-like, and stood out like any real muslin stiffened with starch. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>The thread for our muslins was dyed a deep plum color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>In the case of each of our <num value="4">four</num> dresses, the warp was the same: <num value="12">twelve</num> or <num value="14">fourteen</num> threads of the plum color and <num value="3">three</num> threads of white alternating with the plum color and white thread the width and length of the cloth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>The older daughter and I had ours filled in solid with plum color, which, with the narrow white stripes in the warp, made a very neat dress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>The <num value="2">two</num> other girls had theirs checked with white, so as to form a square with the white stripe in the warp; then small bits of crimson merino were placed in the centre of the square.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>Our muslins reminded me of <quote><rs n="swiss muslins" type="product">Swiss muslins</rs>,</quote> with their raised flowers of silk or fine wool thread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>Soon after completing and wearing our <pb id="p.91" n="91"/> home-made muslins, news came into our settlement that a steamer had run the blockade, and that the city of <placeName reg="Eufaula, Barbour, Alabama" key="tgn,7014121">Eufaula</placeName> had secured some bolts of prints and other notions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>The <rs>Saturday</rs> following the report, <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> G-- ordered <persName><foreName>Ben</foreName></persName> to harness up the horses, and we were driven to <placeName key="tgn,7014121" n="1.000 4" reg="eufaula, barbour, alabama">Eufaula</placeName>, not to buy, but simply to have a look at these imports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>Sure enough, on the shelves in the store that had long lain empty, there were tastefully disposed a few bolts of <name>English</name> prints, some ladies' straw hats, a bolt or <num value="2">two</num> of fine bleached stuff, some calico, and a few pairs of ladies' shoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>These were the magnets which had drawn us <measure n="11miles" type="distance">eleven miles</measure>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>Yet so it was, for when the merchant unfolded to our view his brandnew prints, looking so fresh and novel, we <num value="4">four</num> had <measure n="9yards" type="distance">nine yards</measure> apiece cut off, paying <measure n="12dollars" type="currency">twelve dollars</measure> per yard for it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>I bought the same day a plain brown straw hat, paying <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">one hundred dollars</measure> for it, and <num value="0.5">a half</num> quire of small white note-paper for <measure n="40dollars" type="currency">forty dollars</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>Our neighbors, as soon as it was noised about in that quiet settlement (where it seemed almost impossible for tidings of <pb id="p.93" n="93"/> the outside world to come) that we had new store-bought calicoes, all paid us a visit in order that they might see how a new print looked amidst so much home-woven cloth; and a bit of the scraps left was given each visitor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>I sent a small scrap of my new calico-our war-time calicoes, as we then and afterward called them &mdash; in a letter to my relatives in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>Whenever an) <num value="1">one</num> was so fortunate as to secure a new print, small scraps of it were sent in letters to friends and relatives, so rare were new calicoes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>Indeed, it was not at all uncommon for friends or relatives to send small samples of new homespun cloth to <num value="1">one</num> another in letters whenever what was thought to be a particularly good pattern had been devised, or the colors were exceptionally brilliant. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>A woman who was a neighbor of ours made herself what really was an elegant dress for the times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>The material was an old and well-worn black silk dress, altogether past renovating, and fine white lint cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>The silk was all ripped up, and cut into narrow strips, which were all raveled and then mixed with the lint cotton and passed through the <rs n="cotton card" type="product">cotton cards</rs> <pb id="p.94" n="94"/> <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> times, so as to have the mixture homogeneous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>It was then carded and spun very fine, great pains being taken in the spinning to have no unevenness in the threads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>Our neighbor managed to get for the warp of her mixed silk and cotton dress a bunch of <num value="12">number twelve</num> thread, from cotton mills in <placeName reg="Columbus, Muscogee, Georgia" key="tgn,7013643">Columbus, Georgia</placeName>, <measure n="50miles" type="distance">fifty miles</measure> from our settlement, and generally a <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> trip.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>She dyed the thread, which was very fine and smooth, with the barks of the sweet-gum and maple trees, which made a beautiful gray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>Woven into cloth, it was soft and silky to the touch, and of a beautiful color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>It was corded with the best pieces of the worn silk, and trimmed with pasteboard buttons covered with some of the same silk. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>Some very rich-appearing and serviceable winter woolen dresses were made of the wool of white and brown sheep mixed, carded, spun and woven just so; then long chains of coarser spun wool thread dyed <rs type="color">black</rs> and <rs type="color">red</rs> were crocheted and braided in neat designs on the skirt, sleeves, and waist of these brown and white mixed dresses of wool.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/><pb id="p.95" n="95"/> </p> 
<p>Of course braid and tape could not be bought, nor could we weave that sufficiently narrow to make a neat appearance on <rs n="dress goods" type="product">dress goods</rs>; but we soon found that long chains of crochet-thread would answer nicely for braiding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>Balls of it were crocheted of various colors; <rs type="color">black</rs>, <rs type="color">white</rs>, <rs type="color">red</rs>, <rs type="color">blue</rs>, and dark brown were the colors most used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>It was braided on in various ways; sometimes singly, at times we would sew <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> chains together of colors to blend, making the tape an inch or more wide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>And thus it was placed upon our dresses. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>The extent and variety of our cloth manufacture, our fertility in making designs, our different ways of weaving, were really remarkable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>We made cloth in stripes broad and narrow, and in checks wide and small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>We made plain cloth, twilled cloth, jeans, and salt-and-pepper cloth, the latter by alternating <num value="1">one</num> thread of white and <num value="1">one</num> thread of black the width and length of the warp, and the same in the woof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>This was a slow process, as the shuttles, with the quills of <rs type="color">black</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs> thread, were changed at every tap of the batten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>Plaids were woven both of wool and cotton thread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>They required <num value="3">three</num> <pb id="p.96" n="96"/> and <num value="4">four</num> shuttles and as many varieties of color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>We had <quote>dice</quote> --woven homespun, or <quote>basket plait,</quote> as some would call it, which required <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> treadles and as many different ways of tramping them to form the plait.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>When the warp was dyed a solid red or deep garnet and filled in with blue, or perhaps purple, slate, or black, as <num value="1">one</num> wished, or when the warp was dyed blue and filled in with whatever other color pleased the eye, such cloth we called our <quote>chambrey.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/></p> 
<p>Sometimes lint cotton was dyed a deep and a pale blue, and then carded and spun as dyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>If the warp was of deep blue the woof would be pale blue; or the woof would be deep blue thread and the warp pale blue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>It was woven solid and tipped with bright bits of silk, cassimere, merino, or other fine woolen scraps, which, cut in small pieces, were woven in the meshes of thread. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>Cloth was woven with <num value="2">two</num>, <num value="3">three</num>, <num value="4">four</num>, and <num value="5">five</num> treadles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>An ingenious way the weaver had of tramping the treadles would throw up on the right or upper side of the cloth whatever design was placed in front of the weaver's eye. Some beautiful carpets <pb id="p.97" n="97"/> of wool, dyed a variety of bright colors, were woven on our common house-loom; and large woolen coverlets as well as woolen and cotton flannels were made in the same manner. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>I often wonder how we were able so quickly to adapt ourselves to the great changes rendered necessary in our modes of life by the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>But be it remembered that the <name>Southerners</name> who were so reduced and so compelled to rely entirely upon their own resources belonged to the <name>Anglo</name>-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0020.0007.00097.00019" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> race, a race which, despite all prating about <quote>race equality,</quote> has civilized <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>The reflection to which memory gives rise when I recall war times in the <rs>South</rs> is this, that <quote>blood will tell.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/></p> 
<p>As to our cotton flannel, while it was rather heavy for every-day wear, it was just the thing for capes and cloaks, and was often made into blankets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>The filling was spun rather coarse and very softly twisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>If it was to be used for capes or cloaks the raw cotton was dyed whatever color was made choice of before carding and spinning; if the flannel was to be used for blankets the lint cotton was carded and <pb id="p.98" n="98"/> spun white.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>When placed in the loom for weaving the treadles were tramped in a manner which threw up the coarse, soft spun woof very nearly all on the upper side of the cloth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/><num value="2">Two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> heavy beats of the batten were given to pack the filling close and dense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>When so much had been woven and was still smoothly and tightly drawn over the breast-beam, <num value="1">one</num> of a pair of <rs n="cotton card" type="product">cotton-cards</rs> was used by the hand to raise the lint of the coarse, softtwisted, tightly-packed filling, till it was perfectly smooth and downy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>It would then be passed over the cloth-beam, and again so much would be woven; then it left the loom-bench, and with the card the lint was raised again in the same manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>And so the process of weaving and stopping to raise the lint with the cards would go on to the end of the warp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>It was a slow and tedious way of making cotton flannel, but a large quantity was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>That which was dyed a very dark brown, and with which great pains had been taken in raising the lint, was, at some little distance, sometimes mistaken for sealskin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>So much for the ingenuity of the women of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659"><rs type="direction">southern</rs> Alabama</placeName>. <pb id="p.99" n="99"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>Soon after we had finished our selfim-posed task of carding and spinning the warp and woof for our <num value="4">four</num> dresses, and it had been noised far and wide in our neighborhood that we had had patience to hold out until the task was completed, <num value="1">one</num> of our acquaintances, a young lady, set to to excel us, in that she was not only going to card and spin the warp and woof for a new homespun, but was herself going to weave the thread she had spun into cloth for her dress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>She finally arrived at the loom with her warp and woof and commenced with great joy the weaving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>Her homespun warp proved to be quite defective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>There were more or less broken threads to mend in the run of any warp, even that spun at the cotton mills, which was always stronger than hand-spun warp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, when the threads of warp would break on either the cloth-beam or thread-beam side, she would leave the loom-bench and mend the broken threads; but she became impatient and wearied at the oft-breaking threads (sometimes <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> would snap asunder at once), and by the time she had woven <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4yards" type="distance">four yards</measure> she had tired altogether of mending and piecing, <pb id="p.100" n="100"/> so she began to leave the threads hanging wherever they happened to snap apart, and soon a thick fringe of thread was hanging from the sides and middle of the cloth on both sides the harness and sley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>She kept on weaving, however, saying she had enough for the plain skirt, and, as it narrowed, that would cut the waist, and if it narrowed yet more, why that would make the sleeves; but the more threads that broke the fewer were there to sustain the remaining ones, so that the cloth, from being a good yard wide at the beginning, narrowed to less than half a foot, and after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3yards" type="distance">three yards</measure> was useless for any purpose, and there ended that homespun that was to be the wonder of the settlement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>We felt nowise inclined to exult over our friend's failure, for we no doubt would have suffered defeat had we attempted to weave our spun warp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>It required no little patience to work with warp the threads of which were every now and then breaking, for every thread had to be mended as soon as it broke, or if not, thin, flimsy places would occur all through the web, and the cloth would not wear long enough to pay for the trouble of carding, spinning, and weaving. </p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/><num value="1">One</num> of our most difficult tasks was to find a good substitute for coffee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>This palatable drink, if not a real necessary of life, is almost indispensable to the enjoyment of a good meal, and some Southerners took it <num value="3">three</num> times a day. Coffee soon rose to <measure n="30dollars" type="currency">thirty dollars</measure> per pound; from that it went to <num value="60">sixty</num> and <measure n="70dollars" type="currency">seventy dollars</measure> per pound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>Good workmen received <measure n="30dollars" type="currency">thirty dollars</measure> per day; so it took <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> hard labor to buy <measure n="1l." type="pounds"><num value="1">one</num> pound</measure> of coffee, and scarcely any could be had even at that fabulous price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>Some imagined themselves much better in health for the absence of coffee, and wondered why they had ever used it at all, and declared it good for nothing any way; but <quote>Sour grapes</quote> would be the reply for such as they.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>Others saved a few handfuls of coffee, and used it on very important occasions, and then only as an extract, so to speak, for flavoring substitutes for coffee. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>There were those who planted long rows <pb id="p.102" n="102"/> of the okra plant on the borders of their cotton or corn fields, and cultivated this with the corn and cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>The seeds of this, when mature, and nicely browned, came nearer in flavor to the real coffee than any other substitute I now remember.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>Yam potatoes used to be peeled, sliced thin, cut into small squares, dried, and then parched brown; they were thought to be next best to okra for coffee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>Browned wheat, meal, and burnt corn made passable beverages; even meal-bran was browned and used for coffee if other substitutes were not obtainable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>We had several substitutes for tea which were equally as palatable, and, I fancy, more wholesome, than much that is now sold for tea. Prominent among these substitutes were raspberry leaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>Many during the blockade planted and cultivated the raspberry-vine all around their garden palings, as much for tea as the berries for jams or pies; these leaves were considered the best substitute for tea. The leaves of the blackberry bush, huckleberry leaves, and the leaves of the holly-tree when dried in the shade, also made a palatable tea. </p>

<p>Each household made its own starch, some of the bran of wheat flour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>This process was very simple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>The grated substance was placed to soak in a large tub of water; when it had passed through the process of fermentation and had risen to the surface, the grated matter was all skimmed off, the water holding the starch in solution was passed through a sieve, and then through a thin cloth to free altogether from any foreign substance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>A change of clear water twice a day for <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> was made to more thoroughly bleach the starch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>It would then be put on white cloth, placed on scaffolds in the yard, and left to drip and dry. Starch of wheat bran was made in the same manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>It was as white and fine as any ever bought. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>A good makeshift had soon been devised for putty and cement, and the artlessness of it will perhaps cause a smile to flit across the face of glaziers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>But no cement could be bought, and this was useful in many ways, as panes of glass had to be set in, or a break to be mended; the handle broken from a pitcher to be placed on <pb id="p.104" n="104"/> anew, or repairing done to table ware.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>When it was necessary to repair any such breaks, a Spanish potato (none other of the species of that esculent root answered so well) was roasted in hot ashes, peeled while yet hot, immediately mashed very fine, and mixed with about a tablespoonful of flour; it was then, while warm, applied to whatever need there was. This paste, when it had become hardened, remained fixed and firm, and was as durable as putty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>In place of kerosene for lights, the oil of cotton seed and ground peas, together with the oil of compressed lard, was used, and served well the need of the times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>For lights we had also to fall back on moulding candles, which had long years lain obsolete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>When beeswax was plentiful it was mixed with tallow for moulding candles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>Long rows of candles so moulded would be hung on the lower limbs of wide-spreading oaks, where, sheltered by the dense foliage from the direct rays of the sun, they would remain suspended day and night until they were bleached as white as the <rs n="sperm candle" type="product">sperm candles</rs> we had been wont to buy, and almost as transparent as wax candles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>When <pb id="p.105" n="105"/> there was no oil for the lamps or tallow for moulding candles, which at times befell our households, mother-wit would suggest some expedient by which the intricate problem of light could be solved. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>In the absence of any of the ordinary materials for lighting, the good woman of the house had gone to the woods and gathered a basketful of round globes of the sweet-gum tree.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>At other times rude lamps or candles were improvised, anything but attractive in appearance, though the light was fairly bright.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>Medium &mdash; sized bottles (of course any proper sized bottle would answer) were <pb id="p.106" n="106"/> taken, and several strands of spun thread twisted together to form a wick <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3yards" type="distance">three yards</measure> long were well steeped in beeswax and tallow, and coiled around the bottle from base to neck closely and evenly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>When ready for lighting, <num value="1">one</num> or more of the coils of thread would be loosed from the bottle, raised above the mouth an inch or so, and pressed with the thumb to the neck of the bottle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>When the wick had burned to the bottle's mouth, the same process of uncoiling and pressing the wick to the bottle would be repeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>Wheels, cards, and cotton were all hauled in a wagon to the place appointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/><num value="1">One</num> of the ladies of our county devised a means of weaving the hoopskirt on the common house-loom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>It mattered not if the tapes were all broken, and the casing all worn off the steels, a new farthingale was warranted, if only the steels of the worn skirt came. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>There were raids made upon garrets for all old broken &mdash; up hoopskirts and pieces of steel belonging to such skirts, which we either carried or sent to the renovator of dilapidated hoopskirts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>Her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> move was to tightly wrap the steels <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.114" n="114"/> with homespun thread, <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> strands double, but not twisted, piecing the steels, when necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>An old hoopskirt not so worn was her guide as to the proper number and length of steels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>The thread for the warp of the skirt was passed through the harness eyes and reeds of the sley about an inch wide, which was to answer for the tape of the skirt; a space of threads, <num value="6">six</num> or more inches, was skipped in the harness and sley; the thread for the tape again passed through the harness and sley; another skip, and so on the length of the sley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>When ready for weaving, <num value="1">one</num> of the encased steels was placed in the openings of the narrow strips of warp, the steel projecting about <measure n="3inches" type="distance">three inches</measure> on each side of the outside tape; the steel was woven in; then about <measure n="2inches" type="distance">two inches</measure> or more of tape was woven; another steel was placed in; the same length of tape woven; another steel, and so on till all the steels required for the skirt were woven in. The space of tape for the top of the skirt was then woven, and half of the skirt was finished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>The other half was woven in the same manner; the projecting ends of the steels were joined and closely wrapped, and the hoopskirt was <pb id="p.115" n="115"/> complete so far as the weaving was concerned. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>These skirts were neat and satisfactory when finished off by hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>The weaving was slow and difficult, however, because the shuttle could not make a clean shoot through the narrow openings of warp, but had to be passed through each <num value="1">one</num> by hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>Fine white pillow-shams were cut up and <pb id="p.116" n="116"/> made into white waists, to wear with our heavy home-made skirts in the hot summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>Sometimes a family would happen to have a bundle of scraps of blue striped bedtick-ing, which would be divided around among the neighboring girls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>We would ravel it all up, taking care to save every blue thread (which was a fast color) to embroider flowers on the front, collar, and cuffs of our white waists, made of pillowshams and slips; and we did think them beautiful and prized them all the more highly because of the narrow pass to which we had arrived for fine material to tide us over till our cause should be won; and if we used up all the fine sheets, pillow-slips, and shams of ante-bellum days for our wear, soft home-spun, home-woven sheets took their place. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>Many of our women, when cotton was at its prime in opening, and before any rain had fallen on it, would select and pick themselves from the bolls that were the longest and fullest of the white fleecy staple, enough for their finest knitting purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>A night barbecuing was a weird scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>Blazing pine-torches heaped on the rude stands improvised for the occasion threw a ruddy glow out over the dark forest, giving an uncanny aspect to the long thick moss swaying sylphlike in the night breeze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>Some of the negroes would be tending the roasting flesh; some with the swab, basting with the seasoning; some laughing loud enough to wake the sleeping echoes; some lazily stretched out on the ground thinking of to-morrow's feast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>There was the same self-sacrifice, without a thought of murmuring for the luxuries enjoyed before the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>Northern journals often ask why it was that the <rs>South</rs> gave Northern prisoners nothing to eat; and I must say here, that there is a sorrow deep-felt at the knowledge that our soldiers and the <rs>Northern</rs> prisoners both suffered for the want of sufficient food to nourish; they suffered both as to quantity and quality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>But I ask in all candor, how could it be otherwise, hemmed in as the <rs>South</rs> was?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>My brothers wrote home (without murmur or discontent) that they were living the greater part of the time on parched corn, which they either bought or begged; that they were foraging around in the country, on the mountain sides, and in the valleys, for succulent roots, leaves, and berries to allay the pangs of hunger; sassafras bushes were stripped in a trice of leaves, twigs, and bark, and eaten ravenously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>They wrote that sometimes for <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> they never saw so much as a slice of bacon, and then perhaps for a week or <num value="2">two</num> a rasher of bacon the size of a pocket-knife would be issued to each man of their regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/></p> 
<p>Such a slice they held over the fire with bread underneath to catch the drippings, so as to lose none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>A brother-in-law of mine told me that he, as well as other soldiers of his division, lived on parched corn most of the time; sometimes they had roasting ears, either roasted in the ashes or eaten raw; that if they had money, they would buy the corn; if not, beg it; and at times they would be so crazed with hunger that if neither money nor begging would get it, they would steal it. At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the men were punished for stealing something to eat, but at last the sight of our hollow-eyed and ragged, emaciated soldiers appealed so to the sympathies of the officers that they could not find it in their hearts to punish their men for trying to keep soul and body together with pilfered corn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>Times were almost as hard with citizens all over the <rs>South</rs> the last year of the war, as with our soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>Corn was <num value="12">twelve</num> and <measure n="13dollars" type="currency">thirteen dollars</measure> per bushel, and our government's <pb id="p.135" n="135"/> pay to its soldiers was only <measure n="11dollars" type="currency">eleven dollars</measure> per month; so <num value="1">one</num> whole month's wages would not quite buy a bushel of corn. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>What could be grown of provisions, in the waning of our Confederacy, was shared equally and willingly between our soldiers and their Northern prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>I verily believe, in the pressing need of the times the prisoners had the greater share.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>That was little enough, to be sure, but in that narrow space that was left to us as the <rs>Northern</rs> army advanced, where we had to hold our prisoners, there was almost no food or forage to be had.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>We still had our merry social gatherings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>Now and then a homespun wedding would occur, in which the bride and all who were bidden would be in homespun out and out. We were invited to <num value="1">one</num> such marriage in our settlement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>I wore a homespun dress of my own labor, but I neither carded, spun, nor wove it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>The hank would weave <measure n="1yard" type="distance">one yard</measure> of cloth, and I could crochet <num value="2">two</num> capes per week, besides discharging my school duties faithfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>I thus made <measure n="2yards" type="distance">two yards</measure> of cloth clear, as the thread was furnished for whatever piece I crocheted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>More or less in cuts of thread were paid, according to the article I furnished, whether shoulder-cape, vandyke, shawl, or gloves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>At <num value="1">one</num> time I had so many hanks of homespun thread that they were quite a weight to lift, and I was proud of them, too, so proud that if a neighbor came to spend the afternoon, I always drew forth that bunch of thread from the large wardrobe where I kept it hanging, for her to view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>Beside having enough for another full homespun dress, and all my knitting and crocheting, I sent to my mother as many as <num value="20">twenty</num> hanks, that had been paid me for knitting and crocheting shawls, capes, vandykes, and similar articles for neighbors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>I had the thread for the dress just mentioned <pb id="p.139" n="139"/> dyed blue with our home-made indigo, and a deep garnet with a strong tea of pine-tree roots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>I cut the buttons out of a gourd shell, and covered them with scraps of red merino.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>We always took pains to take such buttons off when our homespuns required washing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>When the stuff had been starched and ironed, we stitched the buttons on again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/>The bride's dress was woven a solid light gray color, warp and woof; the buttons were made of gray thread, overcast with white thread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>Special pains had been taken with some white cotton flannel, <num value="3">three</num> rows of which, about <measure n="3inches" type="distance">three inches</measure> wide, were placed around the bottom of the skirt, with about <measure n="3inches" type="distance">three inches'</measure> space between each row. The cuffs, collar, and shoulder-cape were trimmed with this white cotton flannel; and from only across the room it appeared as if the bride wore a real fur-trimmed dress, and the effect was graceful in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/><pb id="p.140" n="140"/> </p> 
<p>Thread was often spun, both wool and cotton, with the band crossed, so as to knit and crochet with single thread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>The wheel-band was crossed only in twisting thread for sewing or knitting purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>In spinning the single strand the band was always uncrossed, unless we wanted to knit or crochet something very fine and soft, and did not want it double and twisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>Then it was spun with the band of the wheel crossed, so that in crocheting or knitting it would not become untwisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>The cotton thread was bleached by placing it on a line in the yard, where it hung for <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> in the sun and dew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>We had been entirely passed by, after all our tumult and apprehension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/><pb id="p.155" n="155"/> </p> 
<p>Yet in our great rejoicing that we had been passed by, our hearts went out in sympathy to our less fortunate neighbors, many of whom were despoiled of everything valuable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>I knew families that were bereft of everything; who had not so much left as would furnish <num value="1">one</num> meal of victuals; whose dwelling-houses, gin-houses, and bales of cotton were all left in smoking ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>Many of the planters, large and small, had turned their attention to stock-raising, among other industries needful and enforced by the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/><num value="1">One</num> man said, as bacon was so scarce and high priced, he was going to raise a herd of goats to help along.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>He got a few to begin with, and as he had a good range of piney woods for <pb id="p.156" n="156"/> them to graze in, he soon had a fine herd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>These the invading army passed by as utterly unworthy of their attention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>When the war closed there were some fine young colts, <num value="2">two</num> and <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> old, coming on in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>A planter who lived near us had several, which I remember were named after <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0020.0012.00156.00036" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:1"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, <quote><persName n="Stonewall,,,,," id="n0020.0012.00156.00037" reg="mostcommon:Stonewall,nomatch:0"><surname>Stonewall</surname></persName></quote> <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0020.0012.00156.00038" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, and other popular leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>This planter was very fond of his young daughter, who usually accompanied him when he walked out to his pasture-lot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>When the <rs>Federal</rs> army came, it so happened that this planter got the news only in time to be just disappearing down a hill near his house, with all his horses and mules, as the <rs>Yankees</rs> approached; his young colts being left in their pasture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>Finding no stock in the lot or outbuildings, the soldiers threatened to shoot a little negro boy who was in the yard, if he did not tell them where the stock were hidden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>Hearing the threat, the planter's daughter said, in the innocence of her heart, <quote>Papa's fine stock is over there,</quote> pointing to the field where the young colts were grazing.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>Great was the surprise of the soldiers, after making a sweep of the field, to find only a few small colts quietly feeding, unmindful that they were <quote>papa's fine stock.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>The soldiers returned furious with disappointment, and played sad havoc with all the buildings, burned the gin-house and barns, ransacked the dwelling from cellar to attic, broke up furniture, and appropriated whatever was valuable that could be easily carried with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>It really seemed as if the wreck was a greater blow than the loss of the stock would have been, and for a few days there was sore grief in that household.
