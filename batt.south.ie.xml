<head>Introduction.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>Although the following narrative sufficiently explains itself and is replete with evidence of the author's feeling, and of the point of view from which he has regarded the fratricidal strife still raging in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, it may be permitted him to remark in this place, that the impulse by which he was prompted in bearing arms for the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, was simply that inherent love of liberty which animates every <name>English</name> heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>With all to lose and naught to gain in opposing the tyranny of Federal rule, and with no legal or political tie to <name>North</name> or <name>South</name>, he could not, in manhood, stand idly by, and gaze upon the despotism which a blind and fanatical majority sought to thrust upon an unoffending and almost helpless minority. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Having travelled and resided long on the <rs>American</rs> continent, carefully studying national characteristics, he was not surprised by the inevitable disruption of the <rs>Union</rs>, nor at any time unaware of the causes tending to that result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Rather, his surprise has been that Southerners should so long have refrained from rising in arms against the accumulated insults and injuries which, for a long series of years, have been heaped upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>They would have been unworthy of their origin, and must have shown themselves less than men, had they longer submitted to the degradation of being deprived of free speech and action amongst a people whose prosperity had been fostered by their industry, and whose history they had ennobled by heroic deeds. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Apart from all untruthful bias, although serving in a cause he enthusiastically espoused, the author has followed the fortunes of Southern armies in this narrative with an honest intention to present facts, uncolored, and exact in detail, so far as space would allow or his position and facilities enabled <pb id="p.xii" n="xii"/> him to obtain them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Every statement he has made can be fully substantiated; he would esteem it unmanly, unsoldierly, and degrading, to speak untruly of these events. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>The real source of Northern prosperity has been misunderstood; so, in the author's opinion, has the real character of the <rs>Yankee</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The nasal-toned, tobacco-chewing, and long-limbed gentleman of the present day inhabiting the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New-England</placeName> States, speaks the <rs>English</rs> language, it is true, in his own peculiar way, but <address><street n="Indian burial">Indian</street></address>, <placeName reg="Canadian River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7019930">Canadian</placeName>, <persName n="Irish,,,,," id="n0004.0001.00000.00001" reg="mostcommon:Irish,nomatch:0"><surname>Irish</surname></persName>, <placeName reg="Dutch, Braxton, West Virginia" key="tgn,2302045">Dutch</placeName>, <persName n="French,,,,," id="n0004.0001.00000.00002" reg="mostcommon:French,nomatch:0"><surname>French</surname></persName>, and other bloods, course through his veins; and from his extraordinary peculiarities of habit and character displayed in this present war, it is extremely difficult to imagine which caste or shade predominates in him. He is a volatile, imaginative, superficial, theatrically-inclined individual, possessing uncommon self-confidence, and is very self-willed, arrogant, and boastful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>His self-conceit is boundless: any <num value="1">one</num> who disputes his ideas is a fool. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The peculiarities of <name>Yankee</name> character displayed during the present war are very amusing, but sometimes, it must be confessed, very offensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>When <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n0004.0001.00000.00003" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> was in chief command at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and promised to <quote>disperse the rebels within <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure>,</quote> the <rs>Northern</rs> editors were lavish and servile in praise of <quote>the great chief</quote> Columns upon columns of editorial flattery daily issued from their journals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>A <num value="1000">thousand</num> anecdotes and incidents were narrated of him when a precocious child, and, if remembered rightly, it was said his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> plaything was a cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>When the reports of the <rs>Washington Administration</rs> claimed a victory at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, the whole nation vociferously chaunted the praises of <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n0004.0001.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><surname>Scott</surname></persName> and <persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n0004.0001.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,nomatch:0"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName>; but when the truth leaked out the day following, not a newspaper in the whole country but vilified them both, calling the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> a stupid, ignorant old blockhead, and the latter a traitor. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Being from <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, (where none are found, of course, except men of extraordinary talents, genius, veracity, and bravery,) he was going forth from <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> to massacre or <quote>bag</quote> the entire Confederate force at Little Bethel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The press was in ecstasies; a swarm of reporters repaired to <pb id="p.xiii" n="xiii"/> headquarters, and <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n0004.0001.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Butler,Picayune,,,:1"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> could not sneeze but the fact was telegraphed North as something very ominous, and presaging no good to the rebels.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>None dared approach him save on tip-toe; dead silence prevailed wherever he went; reporters stretched their ears to catch the least word he uttered, which, after being highly ornamented and rendered very romantic, was blazoned forth to the <rs>North</rs> as the <quote>last</quote> good thing of the <quote>Young <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0004.0001.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,Louis,,,:1"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>All the world was supposed to be standing in breathless curiosity to know <quote>what was-coming next;</quote> artists of various illustrated journals sharpened their pencils, and anxiously yearned to sketch the rapid succession of victories which were promised to be forthcoming; but time jogged along, and even Northern journalists began to grow weary of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0004.0001.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s inactivity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>After a march of <measure n="7hours" type="date">seven hours</measure>, word was brought by our scouts that <persName n="Sigel,,,,," id="n0004.0004.00028.00231" reg="mostcommon:Sigel,Franz,,,:1"><surname>Sigel</surname></persName> was in front, with the number of troops <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reported, and <num value="8">eight</num> guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>Although much tired with our long march, and although several hundreds in our command had no weapons of any description, we instantly prepared for the attack, and, pushing ahead, drove in the enemy's pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>We had several old cannon, which had been picked up here and there on our route-pieces which had done no more than fire salutes on <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">fourth</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> celebrations and the like-but we were deficient in ammunition: these guns we were careful to place in commanding positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>Our small force of cavalry, after much discussion, was placed upon the wings, and hardly were these dispositions made, when <persName n="Sigel,,,,," id="n0004.0004.00029.00232" reg="mostcommon:Sigel,Franz,,,:1"><surname>Sigel</surname></persName>'s guns opened on us with great fury; nor was it possible for our cavalry to attack them either in flank or rear, as intended, for their constant cannonade frightened the horses and made them quite unmanageable. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>After more than an hour of indecisive fighting and <quote>bushwhacking,</quote> our officers, who were determined to bring the affair to a crisis, ordered a <quote>charge.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>As soon as we began to advance at the <quote>double-quick,</quote> the enemy broke and ran, crossing a broad creek in their rear, and destroying the bridge, leaving many score dead and wounded behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>We were badly circumstanced; for the enemy had obtained a splendid position; being concealed in the woods, their artillery could play upon us as we advanced through the open fields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>Our cavalry, finding their horses of little value in such an irregular fight, dismounted and assisted us as infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>Again closing up with the enemy, we fought them for about <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>, when they gave way, and made a running fight of more than <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>After some time, our numbers began to increase, and we determined to drive them from the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>Collecting all our strength, we again succeeded, by superior shooting, in driving them before us, and in our progress through the town captured many <num value="100">hundred</num> stand of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>Still following close after them, we chased them for several miles on the road to <placeName key="tgn,2060292" n="1.000 108" reg="rolla, phelps, missouri">Rolla</placeName>, and continued the pursuit until long <pb id="p.30" n="30"/> after sunset!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>Their killed and wounded amounted to <num value="600">six hundred</num> men, scattered up and down the road for a distance of <measure n="12miles" type="distance">twelve miles</measure> or more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>As we approached <placeName reg="McLean's Ford">McLean's Ford</placeName> through the woods, our outposts, horse and foot, were as thick as flies, and such was the danger of being fired into, that scouts had to be sent in advance to report our approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>Presently, several of our <orgName n="Light Battery" type="battery">light batteries</orgName> came galloping on the ground, and an artillery duel immediately ensued, with fluctuating fortune; our volunteers, however, seemed to have the advantage, for they worked their pieces with such rapidity, that the <rs>Federal</rs> regulars retired, and allowed their infantry to advance, which they did in fine style, and commenced to fan out in skirmishing order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>Ours did the same, and advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>Presently the skirmishers on both side fell back, and formed; then both sides advanced in line. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>Though a general pursuit was ordered, it was found impossible to overtake the enemy, so precipitate had been their flight; and as we advanced, the signs of the dreadful combat of that day seemed to multiply at every step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>The dead and dying are common to every battle-field; but here were broken cannon-wheels, deserted camps, overturned caissons, large supplies of commissary stores, files of prisoners, captured wagons, maimed and staggering animals, dead horses, cannons in the mud &mdash; innumerable proofs of the haste, confusion, and discomfiture of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>Now small squads of cavalry dashed in advance, then scattering musketry could be heard faintly in the distance; now a line of Federal wagons were found blocked up in the road, the traces cut and horses gone; again we came up with squads of <rs type="color">red</rs> and <rs type="color">blue</rs>-legged Yankee Zouaves marching good-humoredly to the rear; now a captured battery jingled along in the same direction; and as for the procession of stores, tents, wagons, ambulances, and private carriages, they seemed endless in number and variety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>Completely exhausted with our labors, the regiment countermarched and bivouacked in <num value="1">one</num> of the deserted camps, where barrels of excellent fresh crackers, hogsheads of hams and bacon, boxes of cheese, raisins, white sugar, coffee, tea, macaroni, well-fitted mess-chests, blankets, mattresses, and whiskey in abundance, soon made us forgetful of our late privations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>Our men were frantic with the glory of the day and the opportune discovery of such plentiful supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>The <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName> <pb id="p.53" n="53"/> had been lavish of expense in preparing for the <quote>trip to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>,</quote> and their accumulated luxuries had fallen into the hands of those who could appreciate them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>We found large numbers of beeves slaughtered and ready for butchering in their camps, but all the animals had been stolen from neighboring farms on their march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>In fact, the destruction of private property, generally, was so great, that farmers were raving &mdash; they had been despoiled of almost every thing, and nothing was paid for.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>Not a horse or mule was left in the country for miles around; the fugitives had seized and driven them off to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> &mdash; as many as <num value="3">three</num> being often seen bestraddling <num value="1">one</num> poor, jaded beast-so anxious were these invaders to escape us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>The prisoners taken were more dead than alive-men so pale and exhausted I never saw. Their uniforms were in tatters; they were, for the most part, shoeless, hatless, and literally gasping for water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>With hair dishevelled, powder-begrimed and dusty faces, bloodshot eyes, and unstrung nerves, they were more the objects of pity than derision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>As night came on, bodies of troops were moving in all directions; cavalry jingled by with strings of prisoners, and such were their pitiful appeals for water in passing, that several of our negroes were constantly employed in drawing it for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>Many of the wells we found choked up with all kinds of rubbish &mdash; some being filled with ammunition boxes, offal, and earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>Standing on the heights of <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName> the entire plain was made visible by the large number of camp-fires and bivouacs; and over all arose the busy hum of voices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>The incessant rumbling of batteries, wagons, and ambulances broke my slumbers, while ever and anon I started up half in fear: I was fighting the battle over in my dreams, and in this state of semi-consciousness experienced far more danger and adventure than I had done in the actual engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>Aroused by the crowing of cocks at twilight, I refreshed myself with a bath in <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, and found all kinds of clothing floating past, torn, muddy, and bloody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>Approaching <placeName reg="Stone Bridge, Clarke, Virginia" key="tgn,2114394">Stone Bridge</placeName>, my sight was pained by cornfields trodden down; meadows trampled to mud; farm-houses riddled by shot and shell, and orchards destroyed forever; chimneys and gables, stone fences and walls, were crumbling in ruins, while the dead, and sometimes the dying, lay in heaps as they had fallen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>Having crossed <placeName reg="Stone Bridge, Clarke, Virginia" key="tgn,2114394">Stone Bridge</placeName>, I perceived that the face of the whole country in front was disfigured, if not destroyed; and here numerous mounds of newly-turned earth bespoke the labors of fatigue-parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>The scene was too melancholy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>Recrossing, I proceeded up the stream, and passed the large and beautiful fields over which the <rs>Federals</rs> had marched in their flank movement and line of retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>As much as possible, this movement had been concealed from us by marching through the woods; but as I approached <placeName reg="Sudley Ford">Sudley Ford</placeName>, the proofs that great bodies of men had passed here were multiplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>The <rs type="place">Ford</rs> was not more than knee-deep; and as I crossed, every <pb id="p.55" n="55"/> step convinced me that the combat had begun in earnest the moment it was attempted by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>The old <placeName reg="Stone Church, Monmouth, New Jersey" key="tgn,2696286">Stone Church</placeName> and all the neighboring houses were perforated with shot, and the ground was thickly covered with branches of trees cut by shot and shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>All the houses, barns, and out-houses, and also the church here, were used as hospitals, not less than <num value="500">five hundred</num> of the enemy being under the treatment of their own and our surgeons. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1614"/>The enemy, who knew our weakness, would have succeeded in surrounding our left only for the destructive fire of a battery placed there, and the rapidity with which troops in support maintained their deadly volleys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1619"/>It was now found that our only battery had not a cartridge remaining, and most of the troops were similarly circumstanced; there was no alternative but to fall back until reenforcements should arrive from <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1626"/>The number of dead and dying that blocked up the landing-place was very great, and it seemed a matter of wonder to me how so many men could have successfully embarked and made their escape in so short a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1965"/>As we advanced, daylight began to appear, clouds of sharp-shooters fanned out in our front, and innumerable little puffs of smoke dotted the dark green landscape over which our lines were rapidly moving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/>I had noticed our infantry cautiously moving up through the woods on their flank, and orders came to cease firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1984"/>The enemy saw the danger and moved up their infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1985"/>Suddenly, up sprang several of our regiments, and, with their customary yell, ran across the open ground and up the slope, without firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1986"/>Though dozens of them were knocked over by artillery every moment, they pressed forward, their colonels and colors in front, until, as they drew near the enemy's infantry, volley upon volley of musketry met them with a savage greeting; yet they gallantly carried the position. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1987"/>The artillery fight lasted full half an hour, reenforcements went up rapidly, until at last the guns were silenced, a wild yell rent the air, and immediately the order came: <quote> Artillery to the front.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1988"/>We moved forward with all possible speed, and passed the scene of the fierce engagement I have described and found not less than <num value="12">twelve</num> guns deserted, as many more having been drawn off during the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1990"/>The enemy had received an awful lesson, but fought to the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1991"/>Our opponents at this point were Western men, fellows of true grit, who fought like heroes, disputing every inch of ground with great determination and valor.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1993"/> The fight was not over, however, by any means, as incessant musketry on our flanks fully proved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1994"/>It seemed, from the line of fire, that our wings were outflanking the enemy, or that they had been fighting too fast for us in the centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1995"/>After a little breathing-time, we commenced the onward movement <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> time-deserted camps being to the right, left, and on every side of us. The temptation of so much plunder led scores of our young troops to halt, on some excuse or other; and the result was, that hundreds were lost to their respective regiments, and hung behind for purposes of spoil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1996"/>I was sorry to see this, and remonstrated with many; but their excuses were so natural and plausible that little could be said; the majority had not been from home more than a month, and having beaten the enemy in their immediate front, thought the game was all over for that day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2006"/>The infantry were to creep up on all-fours, while we maintained a furious fire, and being concealed by the smoke, should wait until all our shot was concentrated on the caissons, when the infantry were to make a sudden rush, and secure the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2007"/>The plan succeeded admirably: we suddenly opened fire upon the caissons, and blew most of them up; but before the guns could be removed, the <pb id="p.156" n="156"/> infantry were upon them, and desperately engaged with opposing regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2008"/>The guns were ours, and proved to be of beautiful bronze, very elegant and costly. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2009"/> The line of the enemy was temporarily broken, but fresh troops came pouring in, and ultimately forced us to retire ; yet in strengthening <num value="1">one</num> part of their line, they weakened another, and, by a vigorous push, our infantry and artillery made a wide gap lower down to our left, and rushed through it like a torrent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2010"/>The fighting now became very confused; different sections of the enemy's line wavered and broke, and were crowded into a very small space by large masses in their rear, which seemed undecided which way to go, or what to do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2953"/>Busy as I was, dashing about from point to point, it was impossible to learn what regiments were yelling so much in this place, or keeping up such incessant musketry fire in that; all that I could perceive was, that their masses of infantry, though brought into action with much ability, precision, and neatness, never pretended to <pb id="p.241" n="241"/> offer us much resistance, but gradually fell back, or broke into confusion after a few volleys, when our men yelled and charged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3514"/><persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00286.01731" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:4"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was now anxiously watching the movements of <persName n="Shields,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00286.01732" reg="mostcommon:Shields,nomatch:0"><surname>Shields</surname></persName> and <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00286.01733" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName>, who from the <name>east</name> and <name>west</name> might cross the mountains, re-enter the valley, and cut off his retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3515"/>We had not lain idle more than a week, when it became known that both those commanders had turned the heads of their respective columns towards <placeName key="tgn,7014550" n="1.000 8" reg="strasburg, shenandoah, virginia">Strasburgh</placeName>, <hi rend="italics"><measure n="50miles" type="distance">fifty miles</measure> to our rear</hi>, and were rapidly marching to that point, thinking that, should they reach there in time, we might be compelled to accept battle from their joint forces (<num value="30000">thirty thousand</num>) or surrender at discretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3516"/>Thus menaced, it was obviously necessary for <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00286.01734" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:4"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> to hurry on his movements, and he did so with more than usual expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3517"/>Having destroyed all the baggage that could not be transported, he turned his column towards <placeName key="tgn,7014550" n="1.000 8" reg="strasburg, shenandoah, virginia">Strasburgh</placeName>, and commenced a backward movement in the last days of <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3518"/>The roads were in fair condition, and marching very rapidly, we drew near the town on the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> day. Little rest was allowed, and all pushed forward with remarkable celerity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3519"/>As we approached <placeName key="tgn,7014550" n="1.000 8" reg="strasburg, shenandoah, virginia">Strasburgh</placeName>, our advance cavalry were <pb id="p.287" n="287"/> opposed by the enemy on the <rs type="place">Pike</rs>, and were positively informed that <persName n="Shields,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00287.01735" reg="mostcommon:Shields,nomatch:0"><surname>Shields</surname></persName> and <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00287.01736" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName> were already there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3520"/>These commanders, however, had not formed a junction, but were in sight of each other &mdash; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-named on the east, and the latter on the west side of the <placeName key="tgn,2658280" n="1.000 17" reg="shenandoah river, united states, north and central america">Shenandoah River</placeName>, which at this point is not very wide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3521"/>So long as they had not joined their forces <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00287.01737" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:4"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> cared but little, feeling confident of soundly thrashing either of them; indeed, he would not have hesitated to attack both had they stopped his march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3522"/>We had destroyed all the bridges in our route, and as <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00287.01738" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName> could not well attack us on the flank, and <persName n="Shields,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00287.01739" reg="mostcommon:Shields,nomatch:0"><surname>Shields</surname></persName> was doomed to be a spectator for want of bridges to cross, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00287.01740" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:4"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> boldly marched forward, drove in <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00287.01741" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName>'s Dutch cavalry, took up a position between <num value="2">two</num> mountains, and offered battle to <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00287.01742" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName>, or to both, should they choose to join forces for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3523"/><persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00287.01743" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName> was mortified to find <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00287.01744" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:4"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> so strongly posted, and as he could not be flanked, and his troops were unreliable for a desperate attack in front, he deferred all movements for a few hours, hoping that in the mean time <persName n="Shields,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00287.01745" reg="mostcommon:Shields,nomatch:0"><surname>Shields</surname></persName> could devise means for crossing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3524"/>Those few hours' delay were ruinous to both Federal commanders, for during the night <rs>Jackson</rs> decamped, and in the morning <rs>Shields</rs> and <rs>Fremont</rs> looked in vain for him. The weather now proved unfavorable for fast marching, and rain began to pour in torrents, rendering the roads impassable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3525"/>Still, onward pushed our army down the <rs type="place">Pike</rs>, as hard as mortals could go; for there was no doubt our successes and escapes had greatly exasperated the enemy, and, numerous as they were, and perfectly fresh, they would leave nothing undone to overtake and punish us, <hi rend="italics">if they could</hi>. Dashing along the muddy roads as best we might, <persName n="Ashby,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00287.01746" reg="mostcommon:Ashby,Turner,,,:1"><surname>Ashby</surname></persName> and his cavalry in the rear skirmishing and bridge-burning, we endeavored to reach <placeName reg="Mount Jackson, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,2113137">Mount Jackson</placeName>, that point being considered a place of safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3526"/>It was surmised by some that <persName n="Shields,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00287.01747" reg="mostcommon:Shields,nomatch:0"><surname>Shields</surname></persName> might push through <placeName key="tgn,2565070" n="1.000 3" reg="page valley, virginia, united states">Page Valley</placeName> and appear in front, while <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00287.01748" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName> followed up the rear; and this he might have done, had he been daring enough to attempt it. Still marching as fast as possible, our wearied force at last reached the vicinity of a small village called <placeName key="tgn,7009546" n="1.000 31" reg="edinburgh, scotland, united kingdom">Edinburgh</placeName>, and, crossing the <rs>Shenandoah</rs>, burned the bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3527"/>We were now not far from <placeName reg="Mount Jackson, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,2113137">Mount Jackson</placeName>; but the <pb id="p.288" n="288"/> army was so fatigued with its long march over a muddy, rough, and hilly country, that a halt was absolutely necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3528"/><persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00288.01749" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName>'s pursuit was completely checked by the destruction of the bridge; and, as a further precaution, while the infantry were resting several miles beyond, <orgName n="cavalry"><persName n="Ashby,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00288.01750" reg="mostcommon:Ashby,Turner,,,:1"><surname>Ashby</surname></persName>'s cavalry</orgName> watched the banks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3529"/>The Federals were greatly disappointed to find the bridge gone, but manfully began to rebuild it. This was a work of several days &mdash; a respite gratefully improved by our exhausted men; but it becoming known that the enemy had again crossed, and were in pursuit, our main army took up the line of march to. wards <placeName reg="Harrisonburgh">Harrisonburgh</placeName>, while <persName n="Ashby,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00288.01751" reg="mostcommon:Ashby,Turner,,,:1"><surname>Ashby</surname></persName>, as usual, was in the rear with his cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3530"/>The enemy were far superior to us in horse &mdash; they were more numerous, and their animals in excellent condition, so that it required great exertions on the part of <persName n="Ashby,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00288.01752" reg="mostcommon:Ashby,Turner,,,:1"><surname>Ashby</surname></persName> to check their determined onslaughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3531"/>Every rise in the road was seized by our men, and held as long as practicable; each patch of timber concealed some of our horsemen; so that although the enemy evinced more ardor and courage than ever witnessed before, our frequent ambuscades cost them dearly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3532"/>From early morning until evening, all along the route, cavalry skirmishing was incessant, so that <orgName n="regiment"><persName n="Ashby,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00288.01753" reg="mostcommon:Ashby,Turner,,,:1"><surname>Ashby</surname></persName>'s regiment</orgName> of <num value="1000">one thousand</num> men was completely broken down with fatigue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3533"/>As we neared <placeName reg="Harrisonburgh">Harrisonburgh</placeName>, evening was fast approaching, and the column turned towards <quote><placeName reg="Brown's Gap">Brown's Gap</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3534"/>The enemy seemed to understand the importance of this movement, and pushed our <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear-guard</orgName> more fiercely than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3535"/>Our cavalry had charged the enemy, and driven their horsemen upon the infantry; but a full brigade came galloping forward, and we retired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3536"/>The <orgName>brigade of <persName n="Ashby,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00288.01754" reg="mostcommon:Ashby,Turner,,,:1"><surname>Ashby</surname></persName></orgName> now came up, and, with loud shouts, attacked the <rs>Yankees</rs> and completely routed them, killing and wounding many, capturing several; among the latter their brigadier-general, a fine, soldierly, and handsome Englishman, named <persName n="Wyndham,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00288.01755" reg="mostcommon:Wyndham,nomatch:0"><surname>Wyndham</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3537"/>This officer loudly cursed his command in unmeasured terms for cowardice, swearing roundly that he would never serve with them again; for although he had been urging them forward the whole day, and personally leading, he could make nothing of them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3538"/>Finding that the enemy's infantry were near at hand, <persName n="Ashby,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00288.01756" reg="mostcommon:Ashby,Turner,,,:1"><surname>Ashby</surname></persName> <pb id="p.289" n="289"/> sent information to <persName n="Ewell,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00289.01757" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,nomatch:0"><surname>Ewell</surname></persName>, who soon countermarched <num value="3">three</num> regiments, and made dispositions for attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3539"/>The enemy deployed their men right and left of the road, and advancing through the woods some distance without opposition, commenced cheering lustily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3540"/>Several open fields intervened, and their <q direct="unspecified">Bucktail Rifles</q> (<orgName type="mil" key="PAReserveCorps">Pennsylvania Reserve Corps</orgName>) came forward in fine style; but as they approached a strip of woods, on each side the road, our infantry rose up, and delivered a volley full in their faces, and charged upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3541"/>They broke and ran, and while doing so, out rushed <orgName n="cavalry"><persName n="Ashby,,,,," id="n0004.0031.00289.01758" reg="mostcommon:Ashby,Turner,,,:1"><surname>Ashby</surname></persName>'s cavalry</orgName>, and overtaking them in open ground, cut and thrust without mercy, driving them in confusion upon their reserves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3542"/>It was now so dark that, afraid of further ambuscades, the enemy halted, and we continued our retreat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3543"/> I have now a sad event to relate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3546"/>my friend, this was a sad blow to us, and to our cause, for he was the ablest and most dashing officer in the service-gentle and kind, brave to rashness, idolized by all ranks, and feared by all enemies.<note anchored="yes" id="n.289.1">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3552"/>When within a short distance the enemy's horse began to slacken their speed, only giving us time to render the salute due them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3553"/>Soon their ranks were broken, and in confusion they fled through the streets. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3554"/> Never before had I heard our noble general utter such a shout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3555"/>It was not <num value="1">one</num> caused by victory over a brave foe after a hard contested fight, but only seemed designed to shame an ignominious band for running before they were hurt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3560"/>An excuse, and even the necessity for a fight, soon became evident. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3561"/>The road was very bad, the train moved slowly, and the main body of the enemy's cavalry was only a mile from its rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4996"/>Foundries and workshops were kept busy night and day; timber was hewn on every side for breastworks, magazines, and hospitals; and, within a few days, formidable earthworks and rifle-pits were dug on every hand, the river-bank being lined with marksmen to sweep the decks should an enemy appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4997"/>The streets running parallel with, and at right angles to, the stream, were cleared of all combustible material, and orders were given for women and children to leave immediately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5005"/>Every thing ingenuity could devise was resorted to by chivalric dames to facilitate military preparations &mdash; expense, loss, fatigue, and danger were despised, and all were in rivalry to make sacrifices for the common cause, and even stripped sheets and blankets from beds for the use of the sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5020"/>Thus it continued for some time, without intermission &mdash; the gunboat throwing <measure n="11inch" type="distance">eleven-inch</measure> shell, and our batteries vomiting roundshot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5021"/>Though not disabled, it was clear the boat had been repeatedly struck; yet when rounding the point and getting out of danger, she gallantly presented her port-guns to the batteries, and, giving a parting broadside, was soon hid from view by the trees, and safely anchored with <persName n="Foote,,,,," id="n0004.0040.00414.02515" reg="mostcommon:Foote,nomatch:0"><surname>Foote</surname></persName>'s flotilla. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5022"/>It was now apparent that we could do but little with the enemy's iron-clads, for our shot glanced from their sides in showers of sparks, and damaged them but slightly: so that it was deemed necessary to erect a strong battery south of the town for the better reception of other visitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5025"/>The transports of the enemy now began to assemble rapidly, until a truly formidable fleet was gathered, and all imagined them heavily freighted with troops destined to cooperate on land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5026"/>Had the peninsula been less thickly timbered, our batteries could have played sad havoc among them, for the distance was not more than a mile in a direct line, yet every shell thrown by us was waste of ammunition, since the vessels were so close in shore, that it required more skill than our gunners possessed to clear the woods with nicety and drop shell among them, drawn up as they were in singles line, broadside to the beach. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5073"/>At this point of the action we could discern all that transpired from our batteries on the bluffs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5077"/>The <rs>Arkansas</rs> was silent, and nothing was seen but a rush of steam as the monster slowly entered the channel, which seemed to please her single enemy, who steamed up nearer and fired again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5079"/>This exasperated the fleet, which now opened with a terrific roar from both squadrons, until the side of the <rs>Arkansas</rs> looked like a mass of sparks floating between parallel lines of curling smoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5080"/>Few dared approach, however, and those who dared to do so received such a fearful handling that they immediately put back, and were content to fire at a distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5081"/>To us on the bluff, spectators of the scene, the slowness of the <rs>Arkansas</rs> was unaccountable, for she seemed encircled with fire and doomed to destruction ere emerging from the ordeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5085"/>This was not the case, however; her engines were worthless, and audacity alone was <pb id="p.420" n="420"/> carrying her through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5086"/>Still fighting at long range, the <orgName n="Federal Fleet" type="fleet">Federal fleet</orgName> slowly followed, and the nearer she approached the bluff the quicker the <rs>Arkansas</rs> fought, until finding her safely under our guns, the enemy gave up the chase, and amid our cheers on the bluff and a salvo of guns, the <rs>Arkansas</rs> slowly turned the <rs type="place">Point</rs> and was moored before the city! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5087"/>From the commotion visible among the enemy's vessels of all classes, the activity of small boats passing to and fro, and the succession of signals exchanged between commanders, it was evident that many of them were badly crippled, for several were towed to the banks, and run upon the sand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5088"/><num value="1">One</num> vessel had sunk, several were towed away, while the vigorous working of pumps among them testified that shots had penetrated in different quarters, and that they felt infinite relief in the escape of the <rs>Arkansas</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5090"/>It was vexatious to think that all the spoil was escaping us, and we felt particularly annoyed that the gunboat which had struck her colors to the <rs>Arkansas</rs> in the <rs>Yazoo</rs> should this easily escape, for it was the finest in the fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5091"/>It could not be helped, however, and when the truth became known, regarding the utter failure of our engines, and the danger to which the <rs>Arkansas</rs> had been exposed during her passage, we could only feel surprise that she had done so well and inflicted so much loss upon the enemy; had the fleets known the true cause of her slow progress, not a fragment of her would ever have floated down so majestically and triumphantly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5092"/> Towards evening, many of the enemy's transports moved up the river, and preparations were made on board the gunboats which seemed to indicate that powder and ball were intended for us in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5093"/>As night closed in, none expected an engagement of any kind, but alarm-guns warned the garrison to be on the alert, when, sooner than expected, several vessels appeared before our <orgName n="Upper Battery" type="battery">upper batteries</orgName>, and the engagement opened with great fury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5094"/>While the bluff batteries were contending <pb id="p.421" n="421"/> with most of the fleet, several of <orgName n="squadron"><persName n="Farragut,,,,," id="n0004.0040.00421.02526" reg="mostcommon:Farragut,nomatch:0"><surname>Farragut</surname></persName>'s squadron</orgName> ran past, and opened with an awful roar upon the-<placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, lying broadside to shore; while several boats from below engaged our guns south of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5095"/>Although the night was quite dark, so frequent and rapid were the flashes of the guns on both sides that every thing was distinctly visible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5096"/>The noise was astounding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5097"/>The bluff batteries above, and south batteries below, the town, seemed all on fire, while the <rs>Arkansas</rs>, engaged with several heavy gunboats and frigates, was rocking from the immense weight of metal hurled at her every moment; but as she was bound fast to shore, and the enemy could not remain stationary in the stream, their vessels slowly drifted past towards the <orgName n="Lower Battery" type="battery">lower batteries</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5098"/>For a long time this unearthly noise was maintained on both sides, and it was once supposed that <persName n="Farragut,,,,," id="n0004.0040.00421.02527" reg="mostcommon:Farragut,nomatch:0"><surname>Farragut</surname></persName>'s boats would grapple with the <rs>Arkansas</rs> and take her; but such was her steady and destructive fire, that they slunk off in the darkness to longer distance, and never seemed inclined to try it again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5099"/>The woods facing <placeName key="tgn,7018023" n="1.000 48" reg="vicksburg, warren, mississippi">Vicksburgh</placeName> were literally blown down by chance shots from our side, while the river was all afoam with hundreds of water-columns rising and falling every minute from the same cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5100"/>It is more than probable that if our batteries had not concentrated their fire upon the enemy engaged with our solitary iron-clad, it would have fallen into their hands; but such a shower of shot and shell assailed them from <num value="3">three</num> points, and so incessant was the storm of small-shot poured into their ports and decks, that it was impossible for a human being to appear without instant loss of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5101"/>After a fierce and obstinate engagement, the enemy's boats escaped down the river in a crippled condition, while the upper fleet moved up-stream with great expedition amid the prolonged and enthusiastic cheering of our garrison and citizens, who lined the works, making night hideous with their wild and defiant shrieks. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5310"/>Although still hard pressed by the heavy forces of the enemy, and obliged to give ground from physical weakness alone, this news was passed from brigade to brigade, and from regiment to regiment, with such rapidity that, although completely exhausted, they rent the air with such an outburst of enthusiasm as to drown almost the fearful din of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5311"/>Until night did this unequal contest last; but although we were forced to fall back some distance, this was effected with so much order and precision, that the movement appeared like a grand review.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5312"/>When the sun sank upon the scene, all was over; the enemy did not dare to pursue.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5317"/>Chatting round the camp-fire, of that day's events, I ascertained that the enemy might have made a stout resistance at <placeName reg="Thoroughfare Gap">Thoroughfare Gap</placeName>, but fled at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5322"/><quote>Well, we'll soon dislodge them, boys,</quote> and immediately ordered up several pieces of artillery, which, galloping forward, opened upon the enemy so furiously and with such accuracy, as to shelter our infantry and clear the summit of the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5323"/>This was quickly accomplished, but our artillery were not content &mdash; they rushed up the rise and began to shell the foe, who hastily retreated into open grounds beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5326"/>In what direction the blow might fall was uncertain; but the best disposition was made to meet it when our reenforcements took up a position which threatened the enemy's flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5327"/>Signal-rockets were continually ascending along the <rs>Federal</rs> front, and from the number of camp-fires, and the amount of noise within their lines, it was shrewdly conjectured that heavy forces were arriving and taking up positions during the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5328"/>The incessant passing and re-passing of pickets, in addition to other noises, effectually banished sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5329"/>Exhausted, sick, hungry, and annoyed, I rolled about, until a sergeant slapped me upon the <pb id="p.442" n="442"/> back, when I jumped to my feet, and proceeding to a cottage near by, found several secretaries hard at work, and was ordered off on business many miles to the rear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5330"/>Shaking myself together, so to speak, I rinsed my face and hands, watered my horse in a brook, and quickly saddled; strapped on a small bundle of fodder, in case of need, buttoned my old overcoat to the throat, lit my pipe, and slowly picked my way through long lines of recumbent troops, until I was far to the rear, journeying alone over a deserted country, without guide or compass, save the dark and rugged outline of distant mountains, or the bright constellations studding a light blue sky. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5331"/>As I slowly trotted forward along the well-beaten road, I occasionally came upon some small party of fatigued and exhausted stragglers, who, to the number of <num value="4">four</num> or half-a-dozen, had lit fires, and were for the most part asleep; yet, as soon as my horse's hoofs were heard approaching, some <num value="1">one</num> of the group would jump to his feet and <quote>halt</quote> me. I did not wonder at the stragglers I thus met, for their marches had been long and rapid, and were their numbers greater I could have excused it, for ill-fed, wretchedly clothed and shod as they generally were, they must have been made of steel to withstand the hardships and privations of the past few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5332"/>Even I, who was in the saddle on a march, was perfectly exhausted, and for humanity's sake would not force my poor horse to more than a trot, except necessity compelled it. Yet such was the pride of these poor weary fellows, that to my cheerful remarks they would always answer: <quote>We didn't fall out of ranks scared of the <name>Yanks</name>, lieutenant, but our feet are all in blisters and cut with hard marching-we'll soon catch up with the boys to-morrow!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5333"/></p> 
<p>As I progressed still farther on my journey, the large number of smouldering camp-fires dotted right and left of the main road, told me I had fallen in with whole brigades marching to the front; and the number of <quote>halts</quote> to which I was subjected by the guards, and the numerous questions put to me by half-sleepy and yawning <quote>officers of the guard,</quote> were, to <num value="1">one</num> in my position, vexatious in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5334"/>Sometimes the cracking of whips and loud oaths of teamsters told me of <pb id="p.443" n="443"/> wagon-trains fast in the ruts or mire; occasionally I passed a battery unable to move farther from the exhaustion of the animals, while artillerymen at the heads of sweating, snorting, and foaming horses, or at the wheels, greasing the axles, or pulling with ropes, evinced the anxiety which possessed all to be pushing to the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5335"/>Here and there camp utensils, blankets, and knapsacks; had been thrown upon the road side to lighten the wagons, more than <num value="1">one</num> of which vehicles was upset by the road-side, and the horses, tethered or hobbled, were enjoying themselves in the high grass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5336"/>Quartermasters, commissaries, and wagon-masters would occasionally pass at a swinging gallop, searching for stray teams or superintending occasional mishaps, fretting and swearing as those important officials are often wont to do. All the roads were well watched, however, and occasional bonfires on the hills told me that the <orgName n="Signal Corps" type="corps">signal-corps</orgName> was wide awake, for occasionally their burning brands were rapidly at work, repeating or transmitting telegrams from point to point. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5337"/>A few hours' ride brought me to my destination soon after sunrise, and having despatched my business, all I could do was to wait for further orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5338"/>My horse having been <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> cared for,_ I hung my saddle in a tree, near the door of a smalls cottage to which I had been directed, threw myself full length upon a bench, and was soon fast asleep. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5339"/>I know not how long I had slept, but was awakened by voices at the door: <quote>Lord a mercy, what a noise them cannons do make to be sure-they're fightin&lsquo; agin at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, <hi rend="italics">I</hi> know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5341"/>said an old housewife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5342"/>I started up and stepped to the door; the loud and regular discharge of ordnance fully told me that some part of our lines was being furiously attacked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5343"/>The heavy <quote>thuds</quote> which occasionally caught the ear were undoubtedly from howitzers, while the sharp, ringing sounds which could be occasionally heard, indicated rifled ordnance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5344"/>An action of some sort was certainly going on, and I felt uneasy at my own inactivity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5355"/>and as, the <rs>Major</rs>'s nose became redder at every additional glass, he took an extra bumper to raise steam, threw his heels upon the writing-table, and launched forth into a very long-winded story of his personal prowess, until I began mentally to inquire <quote>where he generally buried his dead.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5356"/></p> 
<p>Although in appearance very friendly to the <rs>Major</rs>, I could not but loathe him in my very heart, for he was <num value="1">one</num> of a class of brigade and divisional quartermasters who were the greatest hypocrites and rogues left unhung.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5357"/>He seemed to be totally absorbed in self; his personal baggage was large and miscellaneous; beds, bedsteads, chairs, tables, a full and large equipment of mess furniture, washing apparatus, and I know not what besides; the traps of his clerks and assistants demanded far more transportation than was allowed even to <num value="2">two</num> full companies of foot; upon a march it is pretty certain the poor privates could not find room for the stowage of a <rs n="coffee pot" type="product">coffee-pot</rs> or frying-pan, while his own wagons had the finest horses, and were always in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5358"/>If any of the wagons required an additional horse or <num value="2">two</num> to pull up a hill, he would always order them to be <quote>lightened,</quote> so that many a poor lad's extra <pb id="p.445" n="445"/> <rs n="wearing apparel" type="product">wearing apparel</rs> was thrown upon the roadside, together with pots and pans without number, and to all remonstrances he would gruffly answer,, <quote>Wagon-master, push ahead,</quote> not caring a jot if the whole regiment or brigade had not a single pot in which to cook their rations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5359"/>Like others of his stamp, the <rs>Major</rs> found time to speculate in horses or mules, and as such things could not be done without <quote>go-betweens,</quote> there were understrappers in his department, who realized hundreds of dollars per month through such purchases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5405"/>All this I observed on the extreme wing of our army; but when I proceeded farther, I saw long lines of wounded being conveyed away, and afterwards counted hundreds of dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5406"/>There had been a desperate fight, I was told, principally in <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n0004.0042.00447.02712" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s wing, and rumor said he had been obliged to give ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5408"/>The fighting was represented to me as having been awful: the enemy had been reenforced by nearly all of <placeName reg="McClellan's Peninsula">McClellan's Peninsula</placeName> force, and suddenly hurled against our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5409"/>No loss, in cannon or general officers, was reported; but it was said that, acting strictly on the defensive, we had inflicted terrible punishment upon them with our artillery as they advanced in masses against us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5410"/>Very little notice seems to have been taken of this engagement in official circles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5411"/>I learned, however, that the true object of the <rs>Federal</rs> attack was to extricate their left somewhat, and to push their right into <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, so as to keep open communication with <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> for the receipt of reenforcements and supplies; of which they stood greatly in need, since <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s visit to the <rs type="place">Junction</rs> on the <dateStruct value="--27"><day reg="2">twenty-seventh</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5413"/>Be that as it may, preparations were busily going on among us to open the battle on the morrow; and the determination of all seemed to be to push <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n0004.0042.00448.02714" reg="nearbymention:Pope,John,,,"><surname>Pope</surname></persName> harder on this occasion than ever before, and to give him a clear, unclouded view of men whose faces he pretended never to have seen. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5416"/>As this movement was continued, sharp skirmishing occurred in his immediate front, and soon after, extended rapidly along the whole line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5417"/>Nothing of moment occurred, however, between the <num value="2">two</num> armies for many hours in the morning; indeed, it was past noon when the action really commenced. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5418"/>The advance of our right seemed greatly to annoy the enemy's left, which it evidently outflanked, and they determined <pb id="p.449" n="449"/> to open upon us suddenly, and with great fury, hoping to annihilate it before the arrival of reenforcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5419"/>Contrary to custom, therefore, the enemy did not cover their advance with skirmishers, but came forward in regular battle line, and would have taken our sharpshooters by surprise; but the latter had been in service too long to be imposed upon by any such <name>Yankee</name> notion, and, instantly retreating, gave the alarm that the enemy were approaching in serried lines, <num value="1">one</num> being within easy supporting distance behind the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5425"/>A volley was fired and returned; then our men moved forward again, and continued this mode of proceeding throughout the engagement: but every time the enemy gave ground, our active batteries would gallop to the front and give them such a vigorous shelling, as completely broke the order of their retrograde movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5426"/>From such information as I could glean, while passing from point to point, it appeared that our advance was almost in the form of <num value="2">two</num> sides of a square, the enemy's left being the particular object of our main attack. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5427"/>The general advance was a beautiful sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5428"/>As far as the eye could range, <num value="2">two</num> parallel lines of glittering bayonets were flashing in the sun; now the <rs>Federal</rs> lines halted suddenly, a gleam of sunlight told that their rifles had been brought to the <quote>ready,</quote> and a moment had not elapsed ere a long flash was seen, light curls of smoke arose, and the rattling echo of their volleys was carried on the wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5429"/>A yell arose, and was borne from wing to wing with the quickness of light, when quickly a rapid irregular fire was returned, and the clatter continued as fast as our men could load.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5430"/>Onward they went-now the long line could be observed passing through open fields, skirmishers in front popping away at the retiring foe. The line again would disappear in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5431"/>A brief pause would ensue, followed by the clatter of our artillery riding to the front, and <pb id="p.450" n="450"/> the awful roar of the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5432"/>Then, again, a shout, telling that our men had resumed the advance. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5435"/>The assault was neither long nor doubtful, for the enemy retired at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volley, and such was their evident confusion, that it at <num value="1">one</num> time seemed as if their whole army was giving way to panic; yet, through the exertions of <persName n="Sigel,,,,," id="n0004.0042.00450.02719" reg="mostcommon:Sigel,Franz,,,:1"><surname>Sigel</surname></persName>, the gap in their centre was quickly filled up, and the fight maintained there with obstinacy and generalship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5436"/>An attempt made to turn our left signally failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5437"/>The flanking force was soon discovered approaching, and allowed to come within a reasonable distance, when a powerful artillery force opened at the head of the column, and literally smashed it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5438"/>Along the whole line, clouds of dust and smoke, the booming of artillery and rattle of small arms, told of the unflinching courage and pertinacity of our men; while long lines of ambulances and stretchers, proceeding to the rear, fully proved that although victory was evidently ours, we had dearly paid for it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5774"/>Meanwhile the long line of dust rising over the landscape in various directions, and the appearance of white canvas-covered wagons slowly moving over the light green fields, or disappearing in, and emerging from, the woods, gave every evidence that an immense force was cautiously approaching to the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5775"/>Our main army was in perplexed thought regarding <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s movements, and felt extremely anxious for his speedy junction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5776"/>Strong <orgName n="Picket Guards" type="guards">picket-guards</orgName> were thrown out; <orgName n="Light Artillery" type="artillery">light artillery</orgName>, with heavy infantry supports, were within short distance of the bridges; and active squads of cavalry were continually moving from point to point along our whole front. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5777"/>On the <dateStruct value="--16"><day reg="2">sixteenth</day></dateStruct>, when the mists of morning had risen from the landscape, the smoke of camp-fires extending east of the river told us that the enemy had placed their troops in position parallel to ours; but, from the quantity of smoke ascending, we judged that their centre and right centre were much more heavily guarded than any other portion of their lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5778"/>Severe skirmishing took place with bodies of troops along both banks of the river, and, as would appear, with some effect on our side, for the enemy seemed to desist, and never endeavored <pb id="p.481" n="481"/> to make any decided advance in their centre or left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5779"/>It would appear that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0004.0044.00481.02928" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,B.,,:1"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> was as totally unaware of our position as of our strength, for he instantly opened a furious cannonade along our whole front, and on his left (commanded by <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n0004.0044.00481.02929" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>) the storm of shot and shell was so fierce and incessant that numerous missiles passed harmlessly over our heads, and fell within the village or town of <placeName reg="Sharpsburg, Morgan, Ohio" key="tgn,2081856">Sharpsburgh</placeName>, causing much destruction of property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5780"/>Perhaps it was the desire of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0004.0044.00481.02930" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,B.,,:1"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> to ascertain our force and true position, but in this he was grievously deceived, for, except a few field-batteries which here and there replied to his vindictive cannonade, no display of force was made on our side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5781"/>We bided our time patiently, feeling assured that <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0004.0044.00481.02931" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz-Hugh,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> had successfully deceived them as to our position and force, and that their main attack would be delayed until the arrival of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0004.0044.00481.02932" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:4"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> and others should reenforce and equalize the strength of our lines. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5782"/>Soon after <time value="12pm">noon</time>, while the rival batteries were contending at the centre and lower bridges, and other parts of the line, the appearance of heavy forces approaching to and threatening our left, gave positive assurance that the enemy were about to commence operations by out-flanking and attacking us in the weakest part of our position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5784"/>The enemy, in strong force, had appeared at the upper bridge and fords above about <time value="3pm">three o'clock P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5785"/>As their advance for the most part was through open fields, and over very gently-rising grounds, the sweep of our artillery, and accurate aim of the best sharpshooters in the world, (Texans,) told with disastrous effect upon their heavy columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5786"/>Confusion was frequent among their ranks, and it required the utmost efforts of the officers, aided by their personal example, to induce the troops to keep ranks and advance upon us. Field-officers rode to the front with a great show of gallantry; but it was not until fully satisfied of our weakness that they moved forward with any spirit of determination.. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5787"/>To us it was matter of surprise that the few troops protecting our left should have made such a determined resistance, <pb id="p.482" n="482"/> and have held so long the large forces of the enemy in check.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5788"/>Nor did the news of their withdrawal from the disputed position cause any annoyance, for we were well aware that the gently-rising ground extending to the dense woods beyond was still held by them, and that it commanded all approach in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5789"/>The enemy, indeed, seemed well contented to remain in the captured belt of timber, and did not dare to occupy the open grounds and fields of still standing corn which intervened between their own position and ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5790"/>Yet, from the multitude of fresh troops pouring upon the scene, and taking up positions to our front and left, it was immediately perceived that their real object was to turn it, and threaten our retreat to the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5791"/>Their numbers were so great that many of us felt uneasy for the morrow, and their pickets in many places were uncomfortably near to ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5792"/>How long <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0004.0044.00482.02934" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:4"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> would be absent none could conjecture, and great uneasiness was manifested by many high in command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5793"/>It is possible, however, that the enemy's early discovery of our weakness on the left saved us from disaster, for they instantly began to mass most of their troops in that direction, thus forewarning <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0004.0044.00482.02935" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz-Hugh,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> where to send all available reenforcements that might arrive during the night or on the morrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5794"/>No demonstration of a serious character had been made on our centre or right during the day, and it was reasonable to suppose that the heavy concentration of troops against our left was more than a feint; for, should the impending action be severely pressed on the next day, the distance was too great for these masses to be countermarched against any other parts of our line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5795"/>Our outposts were unusually vigilant and active during night, and kept Headquarters fully informed of all that transpired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5796"/>The enemy had gained ground in no direction save the left, and our new position there was considered preferable to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, from which we had been driven during the afternoon, for the corn-fields were excellent shelter, the fences good concealment and protection against infantry, while to the rear of these the ground gradually rose to thick woods, in which were planted several excellent batteries. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5797"/>While seated round camp-fires, and chatting during the silence of night, faint sounds of cheering in our rear, the gradually increasing noise caused by the arrival of mounted men, <pb id="p.483" n="483"/> the sounds of artillery bugles, and the perceptible tramp of heavy columns, gave pleasing indications of the approach of reenforcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5798"/>The arrival of couriers and the jingle of artillery soon dispelled any doubt that existed about the character of the new arrivals; it was the victorious <rs>Jackson</rs> advancing from <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, and his columns came in with such order, and made such a rustle among the deep deposit of leaves, that it seemed to doubly magnify their numbers and strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5799"/>They swiftly passed through the woods and took position on the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5800"/>which movement occasioned many changes, so that regiments and batteries were continually passing to and fro. Faint cheering was occasionally heard within the enemy's lines during the night, and the shouts of the drivers proved that their artillery was in motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5801"/>On our right and centre, all was remarkably quiet; but on our left frequent picket-firing aroused the advanced posts, for the sentinels of both armies were extremely close, and ours, concealed in fields of standing corn, occupied all our front down to the fence, where a small space of open fields intervened between our position and that of the <rs>Federal</rs> army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5802"/>As morning approached, many of our men sallied forth beyond the standing corn, to despoil the <rs>Federal</rs> dead; and this being perceived, brought out the enemy's pickets, who opened a brisk and lively fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5803"/>It must be confessed the audacity of our men in this proceeding was beyond all precedent; for, in the woods immediately beyond, the enemy were in imposing force, and certainly flushed with their success of the previous evening. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5804"/>A constant picket-firing on our left gave warning that the action would soon open, our troops rose long before day, and the most provident cooked themselves breakfast, and, smoking their pipes, sat in groups, chatting sociably, not knowing at what moment all would be summoned to <quote>fall in.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5805"/>Soon simple picket-firing was succeeded by the roar of musketry; whole volleys occasionally broke upon the ear at different points of the line, which, together with the occasional roar of howitzers and rifled pieces, was more than enough to rouse the entire army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5806"/>Commanders were busily engaged, and rode from place to place, with a business-like air; no hurry or confusion was <pb id="p.484" n="484"/> visible; all seemed to look upon the matter with indifference and cheerfulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5807"/>Most of our troops had smelt powder long before, and they simply said, <quote>Another day's work is before us,</quote> and tightly buckled their straps and belts, as if bound for a march, or a long fatiguing drill. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5808"/>Fighting on our left now commenced in earnest; troops which had been prowling about fields fronting the standing corn were seen to hasten their movements, and on came the <rs>Yankee</rs> line of battle in good order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5809"/>Observing our clouds of skirmishers rapidly withdrawing from their front, and disappearing in the corn-fields, they gave loud cheers, and thought that little resistance would be offered until they had arrived at the top of the hill, or had found shelter in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5810"/>Their mistake was a grievous <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5811"/>As the <rs>Federal</rs> line of battle reached the fence, up rose our men from their concealment among the corn, and delivered successive volleys right in the faces of their foes, who, surprised and staggering with loss, retreated back over the open ground, and were cut up fearfully by our batteries, which now opened with rapidity from our rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5812"/>So accurate was the fire that whole files of Federal soldiers lay dead, parallel with the fence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5813"/>Hundreds of shell from the enemy now dropped in all directions, making our position in the standing corn very unpleasant; and although we disputed their advance stubbornly, they gradually forced us back, until they penetrated into the corn-fields, which their heavy line of battle bent and broke, as they came sweeping onward with loud cheers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5814"/>Supposing us to be beaten at this point, their commander lost no time, but seemed determined to push forward rapidly and smash our <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5815"/>As brigade after brigade rushed gallantly forward, they were subjected to a continuous and galling fire; but no token was given of our strength in the dense timber, to which our men now fell rapidly back, in skirmishing order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5816"/>When the enemy had traversed the corn-fields, and reached the summit of the <quote>rise,</quote> the ground slightly <quote>dipped</quote> towards the fence and road, so that our commanders in the woods had full view of the <rs>Federal</rs> force as it advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5817"/>Every fence and every tree was made available by our sharpshooters, who constantly poured into their heavy masses a galling fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5818"/>Still onwards <pb id="p.485" n="485"/> they came impetuously, and, from their hurried movements, were apparently breathless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5819"/>Down went every fence in their path, as they rapidly crossed the road towards the woods, and lustily they cheered, as the last of our skirmishers disappeared from their front, and were lost in the dark, thick timber. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5820"/>All was silence within our lines; regiments were lying flat on their faces with rifles cocked, and cautiously peered at the enemy as they came rushing into the woods in great masses, and with much noise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5821"/>Suddenly, up rose <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s line of battle, the enemy halted, a moment of awful silence ensued, no man stirred, and then deafening, quick, accurate, and numerous volleys broke from our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5822"/>The enemy were too thick to be missed; and, amid frightful loss and confusion, they broke and rushed forth from the woods, trembling like beings who had seen some dreadful apparition.. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5823"/>Soon as these fugitive masses had gained open ground, our batteries in rapid succession broke loose, belching forth grape and canister in such profusion that the infernal storm could be heard raining upon them with a hissing noise, and it literally ploughed furrows in the dark, confused masses, so that daylight could be seen through them at every discharge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5824"/>Round shot bounded and bounced, and shells, after whizzing over head dropped with loud explosions in the dark groups rushing through the corn-fields and dotting the landscape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5825"/>The carnage was frightful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5826"/>Through these fields the enemy (exulting in their success of the previous day) had come cheering in dense lines but a few moments before; they had swept from their front every man opposed to them, and had entered the woods with deafening shouts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5827"/>They had not been lost to view many minutes ere they rushed back in confused, bleeding, staggering masses of human beings, without order, without officers, pursued by our lines of battle; rapidly our brave fellows pushed over the well-fought fields, and, amid showers of shell, kept close to the fleeing foe, and incessantly poured into their shattered ranks murderous volleys, which whistled through the corn, and peopled every acre with scores of dead. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5828"/>Field officers of the enemy gallantly rode to the front, and endeavored to rally their brigades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5829"/>Reenforcements were seen approaching to their relief through open fields beyond; but <pb id="p.486" n="486"/> onward pressed our victorious men, and did not halt until the foe was safely screened in their original position of the morning.<note anchored="yes" id="n.486.1">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5832"/>In truth, it would not have been wise to do so; for our present position for defence was preferable ground to any we could win.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5836"/>The new line of the enemy seemed to be of immense strength; but as they came fully into view our artillery opened upon them with such rapidity and accuracy that great confusion and disorder began to reign ere they came sufficiently close to exchange shots with our infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5837"/>Long and constant volleys resounded along our whole wing; both combatants were stationary; sometimes we slightly gave ground, and again recovered it, until at last our fire began to tell among the enemy; and it seemed that little was now required to drive them completely from the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5838"/>While indecision seemed to reign among Federal commanders, ours were unanimous for an advance; and, when the order was received, loud cheers and yells burst forth from all our troops, and the cannonade re-opened with redoubled fury.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6153"/>Cold and bitter as was that bleak <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> night-cheerless and sad to <num value="1000">thousands</num> in the valley, whose oozing wounds were frosted and frozen &mdash; few went forth to assist them, save from our own lines; and there those frightful masses lay huddled together, the dying with the dead; some jerking in the last throes of death, others gasping for water, writhing with agony, laughing deliriously, cursing demonically in all the tongues of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6154"/>Save for the quick, sharp challenge of vigilant pickets posted in the valley, the lightsome footfalls of relief guards, gliding like shadows through the mists in their journeys to the front, the moans ascending on every hand, and the click of spades in the hands of those strengthening breastworks, all had subsided into a death-like calm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6155"/>None unaccustomed to war would imagine that so many <num value="1000">thousands</num> of men were grouped closely together in the valley or on the hills ready to renew the awful scenes just enacted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6156"/>Exhausted and unstrung, our men were fast asleep, and many of them far to the front among the dead and dying; yet let me not deny that, wearied though we were, the distant moan or faltering supplication often caused us to rise and give relief to some expiring enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6157"/>Most of our own men had been cared for, and taken to the rear, but heaps upon heaps of the foe were scattered in every direction, and <num value="1">one</num> could not move a dozen yards without stumbling against some voiceless, inanimate carcase, or slipping in pools of blood or scattered entrails. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6158"/>Such is war-<quote>glorious</quote> war-glorious indeed when troops had fought as ours had done for liberty and birthright, but in every other sense the most horrible and lamentable curse that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> could permit his people to inflict on each other! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6159"/>Morning dawned, the mists arose, and still the enemy were there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6160"/>No token gave indications of a further advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6161"/>The whole day passed without a movement of any kind, and no disposition seemed to be made for the care of the enemy's dead or <pb id="p.515" n="515"/> wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6162"/>In pure compassion for the heart-rending spectacle before us, many of the sufferers were collected and attended to by our surgeons, but as none knew at what moment hostilities might again re-commence, we could not enter heartily into the work of charity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6163"/>Many of our men were never allowed to be exposed in front, and the few on duty there were for the most part employed in repairing old or building new breastworks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6164"/>Next day passed as the former <num value="1">one</num>, and still no signs of the enemy's coming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6165"/>Their lines were apparently in excellent order, and the <rs type="place">Stafford Heights</rs> frowned ominously with additional batteries; so that had we advanced into the valley, a fearful cannonade would have assailed us. In the evening, we all imagined that the morning would surely usher in a decisive engagement, whether offensive or defensive on our part; but during night a fearful storm arose, so that we could neither hear nor see our own patrols, and as morning advanced, and the valley cleared, we discovered that the whole Federal army had escaped under cover of night, and were safely on the north bank again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6166"/>When the enemy's retreat became known to our army, loud yells rent the sky, and must have been plainly audible to <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n0004.0045.00515.03113" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s forces across the river; but whether these were indicative of rage or pleasure at the retreat I cannot imagine, but fancy they arose from a commixture of both those feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6167"/>It soon became known that a convention had been entered into for the burial of dead, and the valley swarmed with our troops, who were speedily engaged in the work of interment; but when I visited the town, and beheld the sad havoc done them by the <name>Vandals</name>, I almost felt sorry to think I had ever given a cup of water to their wounded and dying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6168"/>Every house was gutted and robbed; furniture, bedding, and household goods of every kind were maliciously broken and scattered through the streets; doors, windows, banks, churches, school-houses, all were destroyed or despoiled, while in every dwelling, amid pools of blood, were laid their dead and dying, whose pallid faces, staring eyes, gaping wounds, and frigid limbs, twisted into frightful distortions, met the <rs>Southern</rs> soldier at every turn in this once pleasant and hospitable town, so wilfully destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6169"/>The bombardment had done great mischief; houses were tottering to their foundations, and everywhere gave proof of the passage <pb id="p.516" n="516"/> of shell and bullet among smouldering ruins; but it remained for these valiant invaders to give a finishing touch to their barbarism by despoiling and desecrating churches, accumulating filth in the holiest of places, wantonly destroying all that came to hand, and then leaving their dead and wounded to the care of those whose residence or property it had once been. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6170"/>I have read of Goths and Vandals, of Huns and Danes, but never could I have conceived of a boastful enemy, laying claims to the highest civilization, capable of exhibiting such low caste on the battle-field, or so much petty malice among an unoffending people, as these same hordes of hypocritical <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>, whom it has been my fortune to meet in a short but exciting military career from <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> to <placeName reg="West Patterson, Putnam, New York" key="tgn,2761581">Fredericksburgh</placeName>.<note anchored="yes" id="n.516.1">
