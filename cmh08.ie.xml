<milestone unit="sentence" n="2799"/>To <num value="1">one</num> who had an active part in the great struggle of the war between the <name>States</name>, the religious element must ever be an important factor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2800"/>Indeed, to the thoughtful general reader and to the historian it must have great significance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2801"/>The reason is simple and ample.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2802"/>It may be unhesitatingly said that no people ever entered into a mighty conflict of arms with a clearer apprehension and deeper appreciation of their constitutional, natural and religious rights and obligations than did the citizens of those States which withdrew from the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName> and formed the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2803"/>They inherited from their forefathers those great qualities and views of life which combine to constitute the finest character of an intelligent, courageous, patriotic and <name n="God" type="God">God</name>-fearing people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2804"/>They drank the essence of freedom and faith from their mothers' breasts, and their noble aspirations and invincible honor were kindled from the teachings and examples of their fathers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2805"/>It is not too much to say here, that doubtless no part of the world was ever more thoroughly permeated by the spirit and power of the doctrines of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> than that part of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> which has been long distinctly and historically designated as <q direct="unspecified">the <rs>South</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2806"/>The brave people of this broad region believed in <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and in His written word, and the foundations of their commonwealths were laid in faith in the <name>Author</name> of their lives and liberties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2807"/>The <name>Christian</name> religion was as substantially a reality to them as the delights and comforts of home, and the blessings of free government under wise laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2808"/>The <rs type="place">Church</rs> in its various branches had its organizations and <pb id="p.270" n="270"/> services in every portion of the territory, and the homogeneity of population, by reason of but small influx of foreign irreligious elements, assured the transmission of the dear old beliefs from sire to son without serious admixture of diluting skepticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2809"/>The power of religion among the <rs>Southern</rs> people was never greater than at the very period when came the awful crisis of internecine war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2810"/>Keeping these leading facts in mind, it is scarcely to be wondered at that, when the actual call to arms was made, the universal sentiment of the <rs>South</rs> was a solemn appeal to heaven for the rectitude of its purposes and devout prayer to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for His abiding presence and blessings in the mighty struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2811"/>The very initiation of preparations, enlistments of men, organizations of companies and regiments, contributions of clothing, supplies of food, and every step taken for war, witnessed religious services in churches all over the land, besides innumerable smaller gatherings for prayer, with special reference to the departure of the beloved husbands, fathers, sons, brothers, friends and neighbors to join the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2812"/>A profound sense of dependence on the <name n="God" type="God">divine providence</name> was a common feeling throughout the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2813"/>It is to be admitted that while this is true, it is also true that a large number of the young men of the <rs>South</rs> were at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> almost swept off their feet by the intense excitement created by open hostilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2814"/>Many went wild with the sentiment of resistance to the combined attempts of the <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2815"/>It did not require a long time to bring very general seriousness of mind when burdens began to be laid upon <pb id="p.271" n="271"/> the young shoulders and when much sickness prostrated large numbers, and many deaths occurred before a blow had been struck for the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2816"/>The older heads and the preponderating <name>Christian</name> sentiment felt the responsibility of the hour from the beginning, and in this record we shall see that the very leaders of the great movement were men who had found <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and sought His favor both privately and publicly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2817"/>A very grave mistake was made by great numbers of people in supposing, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that the war would be ended in a short time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2818"/>This mistake added to the excitement in youthful minds so that they were in a hurry to enlist and do some fighting, for fear that the contest would be but <q direct="unspecified">a breakfast spell</q> and they get no part in it. A gradual real and powerful change came by reaction, and volunteers became experienced veterans enlisted for the war; laying everything upon the altar of country and facing the stern future without fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2819"/>A conviction forced itself into the common consciousness that a long, desperate and bitter struggle was before the people of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2820"/>The wise, the rich, the rulers and the people, the small and the great, became deeply engaged in solving the problem of national life, and of the rights and freedom of States and men.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2821"/>The national recognition of the superintending providence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> was made so early in the strife that <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0265.0015.00271.04753" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> issued a call for a day of fasting and prayer, to be observed on <dateStruct><month>June</month></dateStruct> <num value="13186">13,186</num>, only a few weeks after the opening of hostilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3624"/>His grandfather was a captain in the war of American independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3625"/>His early education was limited, being only such as could be obtained in the common schools of that day, and with but little preparation for the battle of life he was thrown upon his own resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3626"/>While yet a boy he was employed in a printing-office, and soon became very proficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3627"/>In <dateStruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></dateStruct> he became editor of the <rs>Columbia Observer</rs>.

He was so skillful in his wielding of figures and statistics that he frequently vanquished more eloquent men by the strong array of facts which he presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3632"/>In this way he was regarded as a formidable opponent in debate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3633"/>To be a Whig at that day was to be for the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3634"/>This sentiment <persName n="Zollicoffer,,,,," id="n0265.0016.00347.05640" reg="nearbymention:Zollicoffer,Felix,K.,,"><surname>Zollicoffer</surname></persName> held in common with his party; but the continual agitation of the slavery question finally drove him, as it did many other devoted <persName n="Unionists,,,,," id="n0265.0016.00347.05641" reg="mostcommon:Unionists,nomatch:0"><surname>Unionists</surname></persName> of the <rs>South</rs>, into the ranks of the <rs>State</rs> rights men.
