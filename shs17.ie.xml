<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/><hi rend="italics"><rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs> and Fellows of the <rs>Southern Surgical</rs> and Gynoecological Association, Ladies and Gentlemen</hi>:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>It is with unassumed diffidence that I appear before you to-night as the presiding officer of this body, and I approach with great hesitation the task of delivering the annual address, in compliance with the established usage of all assemblies of this kind in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>I feel confident that there are many present who would fill the office with more ability, and that it would have been better for our Society if another had been chosen in my stead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>I desire, in the commencement of my remarks, to return my thanks to my fellow members for the honor they have conferred upon me by calling me to preside over the deliberations of this, our <orgName n="Southern Association" type="association">Southern Association</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>It has been suggested that there was no need for the existence of this Society; that the <rs>State</rs>, national and international medical associations were sufficient for all that was required for the progress and development of medical science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>This was a mistake, as I hope I may be able to show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>There is need, throughout the whole <rs>South</rs>, for county and State associations, and a special need for the existence and perpetuation of this organization.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It goes without saying that union and co-operation have become as indispensable to scientific bodies as in the material walks of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>In all human enterprises, every advance accomplished is by coopera-tive work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>In this way laws are perfected; agriculture improved; philosophical investigations consummated; political and philanthropic reforms attained; by it railroads and canals are built; just and equitable laws enacted; civilization extended; tyranny and oppression overthrown; the gospel preached, and civil and religious <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> liberty secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>By union and co-operation alone can the science of medicine be advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Isolated, individual men who, in the pride of self-reliance and self-sufficiency, reject the aid and sympathy of their contemporaries, are failures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>They may have great ability, they may be faithful and enthusiastic workers in the departments to which they have devoted themselves, but in the end they are disappointed, because they have over-estimated their individual strength, and have not sought the companionship and concurrence of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>No class of men appreciate the value of co-operation more than the medical men throughout the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/><placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, <placeName reg="Austria" key="tgn,1000062">Austria</placeName>, <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> have for years shown how co-operation can bring about medical progress, through the deliberations of the respective assemblies that are annually held in these countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The people of this country, also, in their State and general societies, have added much to the development of medical learning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>So highly is co-operative work appreciated by the medical world, that the necessity for an <orgName n="International Congress" type="congress">international congress</orgName> a few years since became imperative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>I need not tell this audience what it has already accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>At its last meeting, held in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, the nature and extent of its labors can only be understood by the examination of the <num value="5">five</num> volumes that contain the contributions of its members; the work is a medical library in itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/><placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, ever alert, energetic and industrious, always anxious to obtain and practically apply that which is best, has been no laggard in her endeavors to promote the advancement of medical science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Through the <orgName n="American Medical Association" type="association">American Medical Association</orgName> how much has been accomplished?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>In its grand meetings are brought together some of the ablest men of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Historic figures many of them have become, and the fruit of their labors will hand them down through ages as among the foremost of their day and generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Her sister society, the <rs>American Surgical Association</rs>, although younger, has just cause to be proud of her work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Her field is necessarily restricted to <num value="1">one</num> of the great divisions of medicine&mdash;a division of the highest importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>That the field has been well worked, that the harvest has been rich and abundant, and that it has been gathered into our store-houses, I take it for granted none will deny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>So I might refer to other associations, and to the congress of these associations, did time permit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It may be said with truth that, until of late, the <rs>South</rs> has not kept pace with the <rs>North</rs> in medical progress and development.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>This has arisen from a variety of causes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Prior to the late war slavery was antagonistic to the development of dense populations; fertile <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> areas were monopolized by the large planter, and he generally occupied more space than his agricultural needs required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>He believed in what he called <q direct="unspecified">plenty of elbow room.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He was opposed to outside intruders, and desired neither the development of towns nor the growth of cities in his vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Criticise this policy as you may, condemn it if you will, I am not engaged in defending it, but am merely stating patent facts, in order to account for the manner in which it retarded the development of medicine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>While this was true, yet this state of society produced splendid men and women, probably the grandest on this continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Culture, grace, elegance, self-reliance, were its legitimate offshoots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Orators, poets, statesmen, soldiers, scientists, lawyers, ministers and physicians, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and greatest in the whole land, came out of it. What orator have we like <persName><foreName>Henry</foreName></persName> or <persName n="Yancey,,,,," id="n0274.0002.00005.00004" reg="mostcommon:Yancey,John,P.,,:1"><surname>Yancey</surname></persName>, what poet like <persName n="Poe,,,,," id="n0274.0002.00005.00005" reg="mostcommon:Poe,John,,,:2"><surname>Poe</surname></persName>, what scientist like <persName n="Maury,,Matthew,F.,," id="n0274.0002.00005.00006" reg="default:Maury,Matthew,F.,,"><foreName>Matthew</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Maury</surname></persName>, what statesman like <persName><foreName>Jefferson</foreName></persName>, what jurist like <persName n="Benjamin,,,,," id="n0274.0002.00005.00007" reg="mostcommon:Benjamin,nomatch:0"><surname>Benjamin</surname></persName>, what divine like <persName n="Hoge,,,,," id="n0274.0002.00005.00008" reg="mostcommon:Hoge,Moses,D.,,:4"><surname>Hoge</surname></persName>, what soldier like <persName n="Jackson,,Stonewall,,," id="n0274.0002.00005.00009" reg="default:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><foreName>Stonewall</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, what surgeon like <persName n="Sims,,,,," id="n0274.0002.00005.00010" reg="mostcommon:Sims,William,J.,,:1"><surname>Sims</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>And the women&mdash;how can I describe them!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>They were as cultured as they were refined; they were as beautiful as they were queenly, the loveliest of sweethearts, the noblest of matrons.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Let us look for a moment and see from whence these people of the <rs>South</rs> came, and what they have done.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The colonial settlers of the southern portion of <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName> were kindred by ties of blood, by association, and by the laws of common inheritance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>They came to this country deeply imbued with the idea of civil liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>In many instances they were descended from a superior element of the <rs>English</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The blood of the cavalier coursed through their veins; they were prepared to organize a government, to undertake the herculean task of creating a country out of chaos.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>And they accomplished it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>To these settlers were soon afterwards added another stream of emigrants, who came into the <rs>South</rs> through <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and through the seaports of the <name>Carolinas</name> and <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>These were the <name n="God" type="God">God</name>-loving, tyranny-hating Scotch-<persName n="Irish,,,,," id="n0274.0002.00005.00011" reg="mostcommon:Irish,nomatch:0"><surname>Irish</surname></persName>, who have left their distinguishing characteristics, to this day, upon the people of every State in the <rs>South</rs>, from <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> to the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>When the struggle came for the defense of their rights against the mother-country, how quickly her sons took up arms in defense of the common cause, and how nobly they performed their part it is useless to say, for is not the history of the time filled with accounts of their patriotism and achievements?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>At the council board, on the <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> platform, and in the field, they stood pre-eminent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The enunciation of principle, the declaration of rights, sprung from the fertile brain of a Southerner, and to-day the readers of American history recognize in <persName><foreName>Jefferson</foreName></persName> the foremost thinker of his age. Well has a <orgName n="New Englander" type="newspaper">New Englander</orgName>, in speaking of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0274.0002.00006.00012" reg="nearbymention:Washington,George,,,"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> and the <rs>Southern</rs> soldiers of <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct>, recently said: <q direct="unspecified">We must go back to <placeName reg="Athens, McMinn, Tennessee" key="tgn,2097784">Athens</placeName> to find another instance of a society, so small in numbers, and yet capable of such an outburst of ability and force.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Without the men of the <rs>South</rs>, the <name>Revolution</name> of <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct> would have gone down into history as the rebellion of that period.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>How wonderful it is, that in the comparative seclusion and solitude of an agricultural country, the men should have been reared whose writings on Constitutional government embodied the wisdom and the experience of the patriots of all ages, and whose State papers actually formed the mould in which the constitution of the <name>United Colonies</name> was shaped; and that then, after Southern statemen had formed the most perfect government the world ever saw, that Southern soldiers should have made it <hi rend="italics">an accomplished fact</hi> by their skill, valor and endurance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/><persName n="Burke,,Edmund,,," id="n0274.0002.00006.00013" reg="default:Burke,Edmund,,,"><foreName>Edmund</foreName> <surname>Burke</surname></persName>, in his speech before the <orgName n="British Parliament" type="parliament">British Parliament</orgName> <dateStruct value="1775-03-22"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="22">22</day>, <year reg="1775">1775</year></dateStruct>, on the conciliation of the <rs>American Colonies</rs>, spoke thus of our people:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/><q direct="unspecified">There is, however, a circumstance attending these Southern Colonies which, in my opinion, * * * * makes the spirit of liberty still more high and haughty than in those of the northward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>It is that in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 25" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and the <name>Carolinas</name> they have a vast multitude of slaves. * * * * And these people of the <rs>South</rs> are much more strongly and with a higher and more stubborn spirit attached to liberty than those in the northward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Such were all the ancient Commonwealths; such were our Gothic ancestors; and such, in our day, the <name>Poles</name>; and such will be all <hi rend="italics">masters</hi> who are not slaves themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>In such a people the haughtiness of domination combines with the spirit of freedom, fortifies it and renders it invincible.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/></p> 
<p>Men of Southern birth and Southern rearing were the successful generals in the war of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, and the central figures in <dateStruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The acquisition of territory was made during the administration of Southern men. <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, and <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> were acquired during their terms of office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Upon the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> bench of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> they are to be conspicuously found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The Chief Justiceship was held continuously for <measure n="63years" type="date">sixty-three years</measure> by Southern men. I need not speak of the orators and statesmen produced in every State in the <rs>South</rs>&mdash;they are household names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/><pb id="p.7" n="7"/></p> 
<p>History but repeats itself&mdash;like occasions produce like results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The patriot of to-day is but the reflex of the patriot of the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>In our late civil contest&mdash;if it be proper to call it so&mdash;for was it not rather <num value="2">two</num> sovereignties waging war, the <num value="1">one</num> against the other?&mdash; the men of the <rs>South</rs> once more displayed the same great qualities that had characterized their ancestors in the <rs>American Revolution</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Modern <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> stood aghast at the daring of a people they had been taught to regard as effeminate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>They had expected that an ephemeral struggle would be made near akin to those which had frequently taken place among the mixed Spanish population to the south of us. Climate, temperature, the pernicious effects of slavery, were all believed to have had their influence, and to have produced a weak and vacillating people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Had luxury enervated them, had they become effeminate, had the increase of wealth and the impress of slavery rendered them physically and intellectually inferior to the men of the <rs>North</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>If any so believe, let the deeds of arms that have passed into history speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Examine the details of the well-contested battlefields and see if such a declaration is true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>What tender thoughts, what hallowed associations gather around the names of these bright stars in the <rs>Southern</rs> constellation!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Does all history, does even the field of romance furnish heroes superior or patriots more noble?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>They were the leaders of an equally brave and noble people, who, when all save honor was lost, submitted to the inevitable with a dignity born only of true greatness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>And now of the <rs>Confederate</rs> surgeon let me say a word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>How can I express, in adequate terms, my admiration for him!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>He possessed virtues peculiarly his own. Coming from civil life, it was wonderful to see how rapidly he adapted himself to the discipline of the army and conformed to the requirements of military life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The hardships he endured and the privations to which he was subjected soon transformed him from a novice to a veteran, and I can say, with truth, that before the war ended some of the best military surgeons in the world could be found in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>His scanty supply of medicines and hospital stores made him fertile in expedients of every kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>I have seen him search field and forest for plants and flowers, whose medicinal virtues he understood and could use. The pliant bark of a tree made for him a good tourniquet; the juice of the green persimmon, a styptic; a knitting-needle, with its point sharply bent, a tenaculum, and a pen-knife in his hand, a scalpel and bistoury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>I have seen him break off <num value="1">one</num> prong of a common <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> table-fork, bend the point of the other prong, and with it elevate the bone in depressed fracture of the skull and save life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Long before he knew the use of the porcelain-tipped probe for finding bullets, I have seen him use a piece of soft pine wood and bring it out of the wound marked by the leaden ball.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Years before we were formally told of Nelaton's method of inverting the body in chloroform narcosis, I have seen it practiced by the <rs>Confederate Surgeon</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Many a time I have seen the foot of the operating-table raised to let the blood go, by gravitation, to the patient's head, when death from chloroform was imminent, and I will add that, in the corps to which I was attached, chloroform was given over <num value="28000">28,000</num> times, and no death was ever ascribed to its use. Many of the <rs type="role" reg="medical-Officer">medical officers</rs> of this corps were wounded or killed on the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/><num value="1">One</num>, I saw fall at <placeName reg="Strasburg, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,7014550">Strasburg</placeName>, amid the cheers of soldiers at the evidence he gave of devotion to duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Another, at <placeName reg="Sharpsburg, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7014501">Sharpsburg</placeName>, facing an assault before which even veterans quailed and fled, and <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> I found upon the bloody field of <placeName reg="Cold Harbor">Cold Harbor</placeName> dying with a shell-wound through his side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>As I knelt down beside him and told him his wound was mortal, he answered, <q direct="unspecified">I am no more afraid to die than I was afraid to do my duty.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>They were splendid specimens of a noble race-a race whose achievements astonished the world and wrung from the foe himself a full measure of praise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>During the terrible <measure n="6days" type="date">six days</measure> which followed the retreat of our army from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, the medical men, by their unswerving devotion to duty and cheerful support, contributed no little to inspire the heroism which turned our defeat into honor, and made <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName> <num value="1">one</num> of the proudest memories of the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>The social condition of the <rs>South</rs>, while it offered unusual and rare advantages to her sons generally, denied to the medical men, save in exceptional instances, the opportunities which were conducive to the progress and development of medicine.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>To prove the devotion and the heroism of the surgeon and his youthful assistants, we would briefly recall some scenes which occurred at <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg, Va.</placeName>, near the close of that period when the beleaguered town was being shut in by a cordon of earthworks, crowned with batteries belching forth their bolted thunders,&mdash;the lines of the enemy were being pressed in closer and closer, the fire of every species of armament was converging upon that devoted centre, and the roar of cannon and the detonation of small arms <q direct="unspecified">would deafen you to hear.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>So incessant was the cannonading from some quarter of the heavens, and so great the roar of artillery, that it seemed to the doomed city that a battle was almost constantly in progress.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>The surgeons and assistant surgeons, the generals and the officers lived with their men in the open fields, in trenches swept by the fire of the enemy, literally in ditches and holes burrowed in the earth, half filled with water&mdash;from which they were sometimes in the rainy season driven out like rats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>Half starved, upon the coarsest food, in cold and storm and rain, exposed to every hazard&mdash;these, our brethren of the <orgName n="Medical Department" type="department">medical department</orgName>, quailed not; they patiently submitted to every hardship, often with systems shattered by privation and ill-health, whilst they performed services which required skill, care and serene courage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>No extended reference can be made here to privations endured in <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> prisons; and more than <num value="1">one</num> example exists of voluntary surrender by surgeons in order that they might not be separated from their sick and wounded.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>Even those in the comparative shelter of hospitals&mdash;especially those placed near to the immediate theatre of the war, had by no means light duties to perform, nor were unexposed to the dangers of the battlefield whilst in attendance upon the sick and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>We have ourselves experienced some of his stern rulings, which were afterwards fully compensated for.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>But where, or under what government so complicated and extensive as this, was there ever a department of the public service characterized by such order and precision?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Every paper emanating from that office was a model of despatch and neatness; and the chief introduced various measures for the relief of the <orgName n="Medical Department" type="department">medical department</orgName> when the country was suffering privations, and in want of the ordinary necessaries of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>It will be remembered, also, that included in the sphere of his duties was the providing the medical supplies needed for the entire army&mdash;which had to be imported in great measure; and the hospitals and other branches of the service were fairly supplied with quinia, morphia, iron, chloroform and <rs n="surgical appliances" type="product">surgical appliances</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>If the writer is permitted to say it here, the hospitals at <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 7" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Petersburg</placeName> under his care were never allowed to be without these essential articles&mdash;which were purchased when needed by private contributions from friends in <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>But that we may avoid the imputation of being indiscriminately a <foreign lang="la">laudator temporis acti,</foreign> we think there were some grave mistakes committed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most serious was the failure to send surgeons of known skill and experience into positions where they might do most good&mdash;into the field or into large hospitals&mdash;in place of permitting them to remain in high cathedral places as medical examiners, medical directors, in charge of stations for purveying and distributing medical supplies, etc. <rs type="role" reg="Surgeon">Surgeons</rs> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ability were appointed to these offices&mdash;doubtless of importance&mdash;but which could have been filled by others fully competent who had not devoted their lives to surgery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>It seems strange that men, just at the period when their special capacities could be applied to the greatest advantage, were indeed absolutely demanded by the exigency, were diverted from the branch in which they were particularly proficient to such peaceful pursuits, whilst the <rs type="role" reg="assistant-Surgeon">assistant surgeon</rs>, sometimes the full <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> surgeon, was sent to the front and had the most responsible work in any army to perform; the care of the desperately wounded and the sick of every description, who required immediate attention, were often thrust upon them when they may have had little or no opportunities for acquiring practical skill.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>The surgeon-general issued some valuable and useful publications, but we had no <q direct="unspecified">Medical and Surgical History of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName></q>; we had scarcely a journal; we had no <orgName n="Army Medical Museum" type="museum">Army Medical Museum</orgName>; we had no men of science with leisure to produce original work, or to record, classify and arrange the rich and abundant material gathered in the departments of either medicine or surgery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>We did what we could; but we were working on a semi-starvation basis, pressed down with the cares of the war and of the family; and whilst we admire the genius and enterprise of our then enemy in their admirable illustrations of the records of the war, we could not expect to compete with the highly-organized and lavishly-supplied medical and surgical departments of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> of the <rs>North</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Your speaker would be very remiss if on an occasion like this, and whilst commenting favorably on our own department, he should forget the tribute we owe the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/><hi rend="italics">Exhaustion</hi> was the great characteristic, as well as the essential element to be considered and combatted; and the natural corollary was that he was to be nourished and stimulated as far as the resources of the service permitted; <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> and the treatment was of course to be modified in view of the prevalent condition just stated, with the studious avoidance of all pertubative, depressing measures, drastics, ptyalism, etc.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>What was applicable to well-nourished civilians would not apply to the soldier with his gastric irritability, his colliquative disease, his gastralgia, and more especially his nostalgia.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>The fact being determined it was acted upon practically; the promise of a furlough was found to be superior to the whole pharmacopoea, and would literally rescue a sick or wounded soldier from the jaws of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>We have seen them turn to the wall to die, and yet leave for their homes a few days after under the revivifying influence of hope and a return to their families and all which it implied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>When it was averred that <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> died on the road, the question was asked, But how many were saved?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>From this brief and imperfect description of the depressing effects produced by the circumstances which surrounded the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldier, the modification in his management became of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> importance.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>For, superadded to the prostration and general asthenic state which we have asserted to be the dominant feature of our sick soldiers; there was, also, very generally extreme apathy as to results, however sombre might be their complexion, or even fatal to their hopes, wishes or lives.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>The Confederate soldier resigned himself to his fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>Once that it was decided that a return home was impossible for him and he must remain in hospital, the physiognomy of his condition was admirably expressed by the phrase <hi rend="italics">poco curante</hi>, which he carried in every feature of his face, in his gait and in his bearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>When he entered the service, whether from compulsion or, as in nearly every instance, urged by a noble patriotism, his mind was prepared for any fate; and he went forth, having adopted the desperate maxim of <persName n="Mezentius,,,,," id="n0274.0003.00018.00083" reg="mostcommon:Mezentius,nomatch:0"><surname>Mezentius</surname></persName>&mdash; <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">Jam venio moriturus</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>The scenes of danger, also, through which he had passed had strung his nerves to so high a pitch of tension&mdash;so much higher than mere illness, which is far below the battlefield in the stirring intensity or the elevation of the emotion it excites&mdash;that he was not impressed by his present peril, however imminent might be the fate which it threatened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>He was therefore languid, <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> careless and indifferent, and his mind needed to be aroused and stimulated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>As a striking proof of the apathy of the soldier when he takes asylum in hospital, it may be stated that on the occasion of a visit by <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0274.0003.00019.00084" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,Edward,,:80"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> to the farm, near <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 7" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Petersburg</placeName>, to which the sick and wounded had been removed, he visited many of the tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>There was not the slightest excitement or enthusiasm manifested&mdash;no exclamation or apparent recognition of their beloved leader by a single individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>Politeness compelled us to occupy a singular role, and in every instance to announce the presence of their commanderin-chief and to introduce him to his soldiers.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>There was no <num value="1">one</num> so uncomplaining as the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>When the soldier, leaving friends, kindred and home, delivers up <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> his life for his country, he has paid the dearest tribute which men can offer, and there is a moral sublimity in the act which ennobles the very poorest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>It was a great error to confound the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldier, as some of our surgeons did, with those of a standing army, or with mercenary troops, and treat them with harshness or disdain.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1183"/>From his earliest childhood he scorned, not only direct lying, but all prevarication and suppression of the truth; refusing to associate with a schoolmate who got out of a difficulty by telling the teacher a falsehood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2570"/>This I stigmatized as false in the speech which I made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2571"/>But the fear, while it makes some neutral, makes others false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2572"/>By some means heretofore, every transaction in the camp has been communicated to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2614"/>The next morning I heard that the fight was about to commence, but I very sensibly determined not to go.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2620"/>I rode on rapidly, the cavalry coming closer and closer, cheering, firing pistols, etc., etc. When right upon them (within <num value="30">thirty</num> steps) I discovered that they were the enemy's cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2622"/>But they knew by my gray coat that I was a <q direct="unspecified">Rebel,</q> and I was soon surrounded by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2623"/>A Yankee with a sabre above my head ordered me to surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2625"/>I had my hand on my pistol and my spurs to my horse, and I knew that he dared not cut, for I could have shot him easily and would have done so. He therefore allowed his sabre to fall harmless by his side.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2634"/>Just then our cavalry (Rebel) pressed down on the town; a regiment of our infantry opened a galling fire, and a stampede among my captors took place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2636"/>But it was too late, <hi rend="italics">I had given my word</hi>, so, with a firm spirit but a sorrowing heart, I dashed into the river with the <rs>Yankee</rs> cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2648"/>From that moment I began to try to make my escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2651"/>I knew I was in a secession house from the following incident: I was walking up and down the room with my hand to my head telling my guard how inhuman it was for them to keep me up when I was so sick, when I heard a sweet voice say: <q direct="unspecified">Never mind, you will all pay for it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2667"/>Thus my escape rested on <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s success, and his distance of pursuit depended on <hi rend="italics">himself and his men</hi>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2668"/>I was accordingly much worse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2669"/>Oh! I got <hi rend="italics">very much worse</hi>! I sent for a Yankee surgeon, had a lotion prepared, and the old lady put a horseradish poultice on my throat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2670"/>All this time the artillery <pb id="p.176" n="176"/> was heard in the distance; the young lady bringing me news from time to time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2671"/>Finally she came up and told me (in fact I heard them) that the <rs>Yankee</rs> wagons were coming back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2672"/>She said (and I thought, too,) that the <rs>Yankees</rs> were beaten.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2673"/>I listened, and it seemed that the artillery then were getting further off. My spirits fell, but it was momentary only, for the wind varied around again, and I saw that they were nearer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2674"/>Then confusion began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2675"/>Wounded <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName> were being brought in. Ambulances were rolling to and fro and I could see from the expression of the faces of the attendant guard that something was wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2676"/>They would, too, occasionally say, <q direct="unspecified">They are too strong for us,</q> etc., etc.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2677"/>Just about this time a Yankee surgeon came in and examined me&mdash;groaning terribly&mdash;and he pronounced me unfit to be moved.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2679"/>This I refused <hi rend="italics">very feebly</hi> to do. My refusal exasperated them, and they said that I should go if it killed me. But they were warned by the artillery, which was thundering <q direct="unspecified">nearer, clearer, deadlier than before.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2680"/>A dismounted dragoon rushed in and announced their troops beaten and the <rs>Rebels</rs> in hot pursuit.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2709"/>I left the encampment of the <orgName type="regiment" key="12GARegiment">Twelfth Georgia regiment</orgName> near the <rs type="place">Dickerson House</rs> about <time value="8am">8 o'clock A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2710"/><pb id="p.178" n="178"/> A slight protection was hastily constructed, and we remained there during that day and night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2711"/>About <time value="3:30">3 1/2 o'clock</time> on the morning of the <dateStruct value="-05-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> we were set in motion upon the road leading westerly towards <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2712"/>About <time value="2pm">2 o'clock P. M.</time> we formed a line of battle and advanced through the woods, our skirmishers coming upon those of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2713"/>After an irregular and wearisome march of about an hour we returned to the road, having <measure n="4" type="captured">captured four</measure> prisoners, a few shelter tents, knapsacks, oilcloths, haversacks, &amp;c., and the enemy's skirmishers having disappeared.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2714"/>About sunset we again moved, and bivouacked on the left hand side of the plank road, about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> from the scene of the day's skirmish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2715"/>About <time value="7am">7 o'clock A. M.</time> on the morning of the <dateStruct value="-05-2"><day reg="2">2d</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> we were again set in motion, my regiment leading the brigade, and after about <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile'</measure>s advance, left the plank road, and following the head of the column, made a detour to the left; and about <time value="1pm">1 o'clock P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2716"/>About <time value="5pm">5 o'clock P. M.</time>, <dateStruct value="1863-05-02"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="2">2d</day>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, the line being formed, it was advanced for the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2717"/>So rapid and irregular was the march, and such the topography of the ground, that it was almost impossible to preserve the continuity of the line, and my left became temporarily detached from <persName n="Mercer,Colonel,,,," id="n0274.0012.00178.01898" reg="mostcommon:Mercer,George,W.,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Mercer</surname></persName>'s right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2718"/>I made a very rapid and oblique march towards the left to fill up the interval, which was not done until the charge through the thicket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2719"/>As we emerged from the woods into the open field, we were greeted with heavy discharges of grape, but the gallant regiment advanced unfalteringly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2720"/>I now discovered for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time that <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Colquitt,General,,,," id="n0274.0012.00178.01899" reg="mostcommon:Colquitt,A.,H.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Colquitt</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> was not on my right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2721"/>I received instructions from <persName n="Doles,General,,,," id="n0274.0012.00178.01900" reg="mostcommon:Doles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Doles</surname></persName>, under these circumstances, to guard carefully my right flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2722"/>I continued to advance rapidly, and threw my left forward, in order to protect my right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2723"/>Not seeing any enemy, and deeming the right secure&mdash;at least for a time&mdash;I determined to advance and fall in upon the flank of the battery which was still firing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2724"/>To do this I advanced my right, retired the left, formed an oblique line of battle, and ordered a charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2725"/>Most gallantly did the regiment move forward, and as I reached the summit of the hill the enemy had abandoned his guns and position, and <persName n="Doles,General,,,," id="n0274.0012.00178.01901" reg="mostcommon:Doles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Doles</surname></persName> ordered me through the thicket to push the now flying enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2726"/>I moved forward through the dense undergrowth about half a mile, <pb id="p.179" n="179"/> not hearing the command <q direct="unspecified">halt,</q> which had previously been given, and finding I had advanced ahead of the line, and my right and left were unsupported, and night coming on, I determined to withdraw; the enemy, not knowing how small was my force, did not advance his infantry, but we were subjected to a most terrific shelling, when we were almost under the guns of the battery, and I selected a comparatively good position, and as we were over-shot, only a few men were injured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2727"/>I will here state that I was almost under the guns of a Federal battery, and had a regiment (of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Trimble,General,,,," id="n0274.0012.00179.01902" reg="mostcommon:Trimble,I.,R.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Trimble</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>, I think,) gone with me, as I exhorted them to do, we could have captured another battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2728"/>I protected my men until the cessation of the shelling, which was truly terrific.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2729"/>About dark I quietly moved out by the left flank, and in about an hour had reported to <persName n="Doles,General,,,," id="n0274.0012.00179.01903" reg="mostcommon:Doles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Doles</surname></persName>, and resumed my position on the right of the brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2730"/>About <time value="6am">6 o'clock A. M.</time> on the morning of the <dateStruct value="-05-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> line of battle was again formed, and an advance ordered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2731"/>In marching through the thick wood and over the uneven ground, <persName n="Glover,Major,,,," id="n0274.0012.00179.01904" reg="mostcommon:Glover,W.,C.,,:1"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Glover</surname></persName> reported to me that he was cut off with <num value="4">four</num> companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2732"/>I assumed command of the whole, and instructed <persName n="Hardeman,Major,,,," id="n0274.0012.00179.01905" reg="nearbymention:Hardeman,Isaac,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Hardeman</surname></persName> to take command of the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2733"/>I then halted, reformed the line, and went forward to find <persName n="Doles,General,,,," id="n0274.0012.00179.01906" reg="mostcommon:Doles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Doles</surname></persName>, which I soon did. He returned, took command, and I returned to my regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2734"/>We continued to advance under a heavy musketry fire until we arrived at the breastworks, behind which <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="McGowan,,,,," id="n0274.0012.00179.01907" reg="mostcommon:McGowan,John,,,:1"><surname>McGowan</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> was fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2735"/>Here we remained until the command <q direct="unspecified">charge,</q> when we pushed forward, and passed the troops behind the works, and marching through the woods and up the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2736"/>As we debouched I again found my right unprotected, but I had flanked the enemy and poured in a cross-fire, which he did not even return, but ran away in utter confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2737"/>Had a brigade moved forward I could have marched by the right flank and cut off large numbers of prisoners in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2738"/>They held up their guns and hands to surrender, but there was actually nobody to take them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2739"/>Having reached the crest of the hill and finding the enemy utterly routed, I commenced to close in to the left and reform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2740"/>I was then ordered to retire, which was done, and ammunition replenished, and the troops rested the remainder of the afternoon, except a part of the time when acting as <orgName n="Provost Guard" type="guard">provost guard</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2741"/>About sunset we were again set in motion down the plank road towards <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>, marched about <measure n="1.5miles" type="distance">1 1/2 miles</measure> when we were halted and a line of battle formed upon the right hand side of the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2742"/>That night and the morning of the <dateStruct value="1863-05-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> <month reg="05">May</month>, <year>1863</year>,</dateStruct> was spent <pb id="p.180" n="180"/> in constructing a slight field work to protect the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2743"/>We remained in this position until about <time value="3pm">3 o'clock P. M.</time>, when I left the regiment, being detailed for a special purpose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2745"/>I returned about <time value="3pm">3 o'clock P.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2746"/>We remained here until about <time value="3pm">3 o'clock P.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2747"/>I deem it proper to state that great disadvantages were labored under in these battles, as I carried my men into action inverted and faced by the rear rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2748"/>A manoeuvre, I believe, almost unprecedented.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2749"/>The night march back to camp on the <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num> was calculated, in my opinion, to subvert discipline and utterly demoralize troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2750"/>Not <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of the men could keep up, and complete disorganization, disregard for authority, and perfect exhaustion were the inevitable results.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3130"/>Nobly did he perform the command laid upon him, and his stately poem with its sonorous eloquence and lofty epic inspiration still stirs the pulse's play and has become a classic to every Virginian not dead to the heroic past of his mother State.</p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3132"/>Again he wrought in noblest mood and as only the true poet can, but, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3133"/>scarce had he finished his task when death struck the votic pencil from the busy fingers and hushed that deep, rich voice, whose manly cadences had made doubly musical for us this day the rythmic sweep of his stirring numbers.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3152"/>The exciting events of the great contest in which a peaceful people <pb id="p.217" n="217"/> became suddenly involved, succeeded each other so rapidly and were so absorbing that it was difficult even for the actors in them to avoid confounding the causes of the war with some of its incidental consequences&mdash;consequences that had their origin in the exigencies of the struggle itself, <num value="1">one</num> of which was so momentous that it has come to be regarded as the actual cause of the war and the object for which it was waged.</p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3206"/>As most of the old officials were continued in office, some of them, the customs officers for instance, by express statute, it required very careful attention to discover in what respect secession had substantially changed the actual legal and political condition of the citizens of the <name>States</name> composing the <rs>Montgomery Confederacy</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3262"/>Slave labor was more profitable and slave property most valuable on the cotton, rice, and sugar plantations of the extreme <rs>South</rs>, and the emigration of slaves from those States to the remaining territories of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was insignificant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3263"/>On the other hand, many slave-holders in the border slave States who were unwilling to encounter the warmer and more enervating climate of the extreme <rs>South</rs> might find it to their interest to remove with their slaves to the rich, new Territories of the <rs>West</rs>, where the climate and productions resemble those to which they were accustomed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3264"/>It was by this class of emigrants that <placeName key="tgn,7007255" n="1.000 21" reg="kentucky">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7007825" n="1.000 14" reg="tennessee">Tennessee</placeName>, and afterwards a great part of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, had been mainly settled, and many of the same class would doubtless have removed further West with the advance of population in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3265"/>To these people the exclusion of slavery from the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> was a real grievance, while it would probably have benefitted the people of the cotton States by increasing the emigration of slaves to those States and reducing the cost of that kind of labor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3266"/>As to interference with slavery in the <name>States</name> and inciting them to insurrection, the border slave States served as a protection to their Southern neighbors and were much more exposed to this appalling peril than they.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4343"/>But strong and natural as is the inclination of those given up to the intellectual life thus to exalt the triumphs of the imagination and the reason, such is not the impulse of the great heart of the multitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4346"/>Thus, in every land, the most conspicuous monuments commemorate the great actors, not the great thinkers of the world's history; and among these men of action the great soldier has always secured the first place in the affections of his countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4352"/>Or if, turning from a career so crowned with final triumph, we recall how, for lack of a like commander, <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> in our own day has been trampled under foot, we may conceive the devotion with which Frenchmen still crowd about the tomb of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0274.0017.00314.04241" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>&mdash;a name that, in spite of all its lurid associations, in spite of all the humiliations of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num> Empire, has still had power to lift the <rs>French</rs> nation, during these latter years, from abasement and despair.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4358"/>I ventured to say that, if we take account of human nature in all its complexity, the character of the ideal commander is the grandest manifestation in which man can show himself to man.

To this add a complete acquaintance with all parts of army work and organization&mdash;a very genius for detail, an artillerist's eye for distance, and an engineer's judgment and inventiveness, with a wide and critical comprehension of all the great campaigns of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4365"/>But he must possess a still higher knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4371"/>And now come into play the qualities of heart and soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4372"/>Consecrated to his high office, a general ought to be morally the best, the most just, the most generous, the most patriotic man among his countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4373"/>He must not only be their greatest leader&mdash;he must know how to make every man in his army believe him to be their greatest leader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4374"/>And mere belief is not enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4375"/>There must be in him a power to call forth an enthusiastic and passionate devotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4381"/>Politicians have had these gifts, soldiers even have had these gifts, and utterly failed in the command of armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4382"/>To all these rich endowments there must be added an imperturbable moral courage equal to any burden or buffet of fortune, and physical intrepidity in its highest and grandest forms&mdash;not only the valor which carries a division commander under orders with overmastering rush to some desperate assault, like <persName n="Cleburne,,,,," id="n0274.0017.00316.04244" reg="mostcommon:Cleburne,Pat,,,:1"><surname>Cleburne</surname></persName>'s at <placeName reg="Franklin, Williamson, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017751">Franklin</placeName>, or makes him stand immovable as a stone wall, as <persName n="Bee,,,,," id="n0274.0017.00316.04245" reg="mostcommon:Bee,Hamilton,P.,,:1"><surname>Bee</surname></persName> saw <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0274.0017.00316.04246" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, but an aggressive and unresting ardor to fall on the enemy, like that which burned in <persName n="Nelson,,,,," id="n0274.0017.00316.04247" reg="mostcommon:Nelson,James,,,:1"><surname>Nelson</surname></persName>, when he wrote: <q direct="unspecified">I will fight them the moment I can reach their fleet, be they at anchor or under sail&mdash; I will not lose <num value="1">one</num> moment in fighting the <rs>French</rs> fleet&mdash;I mean to follow them if they go to the <placeName reg="Black Sea" key="tgn,7016619">Black Sea</placeName>&mdash;not a moment shall be lost in pursuing the enemy. * * * I will not lose a moment in bringing them to action.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4383"/></p> 
<p>With this fierce passion for fight, the general must unite the self-control, which will refuse battle or calmly await attack, and, not least, the fortitude which can endure defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4384"/>For weeks and months he must be ready at any moment of the day or night to draw on these vast resources without ever showing weakness under the protracted strain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4385"/>And over and above all there must preside some <name n="God" type="God">God</name>-like power, which, in the crisis of strategy or the storm of battle, not only preserves to the commander all these high faculties, but actually intensifies and expands them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4761"/>Men in public station are apt to be sensitive to whatever concerns their standing before the world, and so, while taking to themselves the credit of success, they are strongly tempted to throw upon others the blame of failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4762"/>Soldiers especially are jealous of their reputation, and if a commander loses a battle his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impulse is to cast the odium of defeat upon some unfortunate officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4763"/>Somebody blundered&mdash;this or that subordinate did not do his duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4764"/>Military annals are filled with these recriminations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4766"/>At <placeName reg="Waterloo, Lauderdale, Alabama" key="tgn,2005702">Waterloo</placeName> it was not <hi rend="italics">he</hi> that failed in his strategy, but <persName n="Ney,Marshal,,,," id="n0274.0019.00343.04460" reg="mostcommon:Ney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Marshal">Marshal</roleName> <surname>Ney</surname></persName> that failed in the execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4768"/>If he suffered a disaster he never sought to evade responsibility by placing it upon others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4770"/>Perhaps no incident of his life showed more the nobility of his nature.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4771"/>When the war was over <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0274.0019.00343.04463" reg="nearbymention:Lee,William,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> had left to him at <placeName reg="Lexington, Lexington, Virginia" key="tgn,7013889">Lexington</placeName> about the same number of years that <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0274.0019.00343.04464" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> had at St. Helena, and if he had had the same desire to pose for posterity in the part of the illustrious exile his mountain home would have furnished as picturesque a background as the rocky island in the south <rs>Alantic</rs>, from which he could have dictated <q direct="unspecified">Conversations</q> that should furnish the materials of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4772"/>He need not have written or published a single line if he had only been willing to let others do it for him. By their pens he had opportunity to tell of the great part he had <pb id="p.344" n="344"/> acted in the war in a way to make the whole chain of events contribute to his fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4773"/>But he seemed to care little for fame, and indeed was unmoved when others claimed the credit of his victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4774"/>If it be, as <persName><foreName>Pascal</foreName></persName> says, <q direct="unspecified">the truest mark of a great mind is to be born without envy,</q> few men in history have shown more of this greatness than he. And when, as was sometimes the case old companions-in-arms reflected upon him to excuse their own mistakes, he had only to lift the veil from the secrets of history to confound them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4775"/>But under all such temptations he was dumb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4776"/>Nothing that he <hi rend="italics">did</hi> or <hi rend="italics">said</hi> was more truly grand than the <hi rend="italics">silence</hi> with which he bore the misrepresentations of friend or foe. This required a self-command such as <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> had not to exercise at the end of his military career; for he retired from the scene crowned with victory, with a whole nation at his feet ready to do him honor; while <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0274.0019.00344.04465" reg="nearbymention:Lee,William,H.,F.,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> had to bear the reproach of the final disaster&mdash;a reproach in which friends sometimes joined with foes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4777"/>Yet to both he answered only with the same majestic calm&mdash;the outward sign of his magnificent self-control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4778"/>Such magnanimity belongs to the very higest order of moral qualities, and shows a character rare in any country or in any age.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4779"/>This impression of the man does not grow less with closer observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4780"/>With the larger number of <q direct="unspecified">great men</q> the greatness is magnified by distance and separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4781"/>As we come nearer they dwindle in stature till, when we are in their very presence and look them squarely in the face, they are found to be but men like ourselves, and sometimes very ordinary men&mdash;with some special ability perhaps, which gives them success in the world, but who for all that are full of the selfishness which is the very essence of meanness, and puffed up with a paltry conceit and vanity that stamps them as little rather than great.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4782"/>Far different was the impression made by <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0274.0019.00344.04466" reg="nearbymention:Lee,William,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> upon those who saw him in the freedom of private intercourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4783"/>It might be expected that the soldiers who fought under him should speak with admiration and pride of their old commander; but how did he appear to his neighbors?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4784"/>Here in <placeName reg="Lexington, Lexington, Virginia" key="tgn,7013889">Lexington</placeName> everybody knew him, at least by sight; they saw his manner of life from day to day in his going out and his coming in, and on all the impression was the same; the nearer he came to them the greater he seemed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4785"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> has some anecdote to tell of him, and it is always of something that was noble and lovable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4786"/>Those who knew him best loved him most, and revered him most.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4787"/>This was not a greatness that was assumed, that was put on like a military cloak; it was in the man, and could not <pb id="p.345" n="345"/> be put on or put off; it was the greatness which comes from the very absence of pretension.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4788"/>And those who came the closest to him give us a still further insight into his nature, by telling us that what struck them most was the extent of his sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4789"/>Soldiers are commonly supposed to be cold and hard&mdash;a temper of mind to which they are inured by their very profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4790"/>Those whose business is the shedding of blood are thought to delight in human suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4791"/>It is hard to believe that a soldier can have a very tender heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4792"/>Yet few men were more sensitive to others pain than <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0274.0019.00345.04467" reg="nearbymention:Lee,William,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4793"/>All who came near him perceived that with his manly strength there was united an almost womanly sweetness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4794"/>It was this gentleness which made him great, and which has enshrined him forever in the hearts of his people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4795"/>This sympathy for the suffering showed itself, not in any public act so much as a most private and delicate office which imposed upon him a very heavy burden, <num value="1">one</num> that he might have declined, but the taking of which showed the man. He had an unlimited correspondence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4796"/>Letters poured in upon him by the <num value="100">hundred</num> and the <num value="1000">thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4797"/>They came from all parts of the <rs>South</rs>, not only from his old companions in arms, but from those he had never seen or heard of. Every mother that had lost a son in the war felt that she had the right to pour her sorrow into the ear of <num value="1">one</num> who was not insensible to her grief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4798"/>Families left in utter poverty appealed to him for aid. Most men would have shrunk from a labor so great as that of answering these letters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4799"/>Not so <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0274.0019.00345.04468" reg="nearbymention:Lee,William,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4800"/>He read them, not only patiently, as a man performs a disagreeable duty, but with a tender interest, and so far as possible returned the kindest of answers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4801"/>If he had little money to give he could at least give sympathy, and to his old soldiers and their wives and children it was more than money to know that they had a place in that great heart.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4802"/>While thus ministering to his stricken people there is <num value="1">one</num> public benefit which he rendered that ought never to be forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4803"/>Though the war was over he still stood in public relations in which he could render an immeasurable service to the whole country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4804"/>There are no crises in a nation's life more perilous than those following civil war. The peace that comes after it is peace only in name if the passions of the war still live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4805"/>After our great struggle the <rs>South</rs> was full of inflammable materials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4806"/>The fires were but smouldering in ashes, and might break out at any moment and rage with destructive fury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4807"/>If <pb id="p.346" n="346"/> the spirit of some had had full swing the passions of the civil war would have been not only perpetuated but increased, and have gone down as an inheritance of bitterness from generation to generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4808"/>This stormy sea of passion but <num value="1">one</num> man could control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4809"/>He had no official position, civil or military.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4810"/>But he was the representative of the <rs>Lost Cause</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4811"/>He had led the <rs>Southern</rs> armies to battle, and he still had the unbounded confidence of <num value="1000000">millions</num>, and it was his attitude and his words of conciliation that did more than anything else to still the angry tempest that the war had left behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4812"/>It was the sight of their great chieftain&mdash;so calm in defeat, so ready to bear the burden of his people&mdash;that soothed their anger and their pride, and made the old soldiers of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> feel that they could accept what had been accepted by their leader, and that as he had set the example it was no unworthy sacrifice for them to become loyal supporters of the restored <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4813"/>It is therefore not too much to say that it is owing in great measure to <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0274.0019.00346.04469" reg="nearbymention:Lee,William,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> that the civil war has not left a lasting division between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> and that they form to day <num value="1">one</num> united country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4814"/>These are grateful memories to be recalled now that he who was so mighty in war and so gentle in peace has passed beyond the reach of praise or blame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4815"/>Do you tell me he was <q direct="unspecified">an enemy,</q> and that by as much as we love our country we ought to hate its <q direct="unspecified">enemies?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4816"/>But there are no enemies among the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4817"/>When the grave closes over those with whom we have been at strife we can drop our hatreds and judge of them without passion, and even kindly, as we wish those who come after us to judge of us.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5322"/><hi rend="italics">Question</hi>. It has been said that we refused to exchange prisoners because we found ours starved, diseased, unserviceable when we received them, and did not like to exchange sound men for such men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5323"/><hi rend="italics">Answer</hi>. There never has been any such reason as that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5324"/>That has been a reason for making exchanges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5325"/>I will confess that if our men who are prisoners in the <rs>South</rs> were really well taken care of, suffering nothing except a little privation of liberty, then, in a military point of view, it would not be good policy for us to exchange, because every man they get back is forced right into the army at once, while that is not the case with our prisoners when we receive them.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5327"/><hi rend="italics">Question</hi>. And never has been a reason for not making the exchange?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5328"/><hi rend="italics">Answer</hi>. It never has. Exchanges having been suspended by reason of disagreements on the part of agents of exchange on both sides before I came in command of the armies of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and it being near the opening of the spring campaign I did not deem it advisable or just to the men who had to fight our battles to <pb id="p.387" n="387"/> reinforce the enemy with <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> disciplined troops at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5665"/>From this encounter, which lasted less than half an hour, though in that time some <num value="500">five hundred</num> men fell, the impression may have originated that <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> was a drawn battle; but it was upon our right that the main and real action was <pb id="p.412" n="412"/> fought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5669"/>The battle opened, to me at least, most unexpectedly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5670"/>I had slipped out of camp and was breakfasting with a young lady, when suddenly the ring of a field-piece clanged close by upon the air. Seizing musket and equipments I bolted out of doors <hi rend="italics">sans ceremonie</hi> and made for the main street, visions of a court-martial floating before me. The sidewalks were full of infantry at double-quick, and artillery, staff officers, and couriers were coming down the roadway at a gallop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5671"/>Some <num value="1">one</num> told me <persName n="Hill,,,,," id="n0274.0031.00412.05069" reg="nearbymention:Hill,Ambrose,P.,,"><surname>Hill</surname></persName> was on ahead, and, throwing away my blanket, I ran to the head of the column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5672"/>The <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> could not tell me where my brigade was, and I kept on till I cleared the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5673"/>Here a group of staff officers were directing the troops, and in response to my query <num value="1">one</num> of them pointed out a regiment just disappearing behind some pines on the further side of the main road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5674"/>This road the <rs>Federals</rs> were shelling, and I began to realize that my little escapade had gotten me into a pretty serious predicament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5675"/>If I crossed the road I ran the risk of being hit, and if I went back into town so as to work my way around, it was not likely I would find the regiment again, and it would be hard work to satisfactorily explain my absence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5676"/>A little observation, however, showed that the enemy were firing slowly and would not move more than <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> guns in position, and I determined to try the short cut. Throwing off haversack and jacket, I slipped down the bank into the road and waited for the next discharge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5677"/>As soon as the shell screamed by I started.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5678"/>There was a shout or cry of warning behind me, but I flew across like a deer, dashed full tilt against the opposite bank, climbed up and soon rejoined the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5679"/>The men gave me a cheer as I came up, and I felt as fine as a fiddle.

<head>The opening of the fight.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5681"/>The brigade was soon formed in column of regiments, the <num value="7" type="ordinal">Seventh</num>, my own, in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5682"/>Behind were the ambulance, litter-carriers, and surgeons&mdash;a grisly crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5683"/>In front the skirmishers were working their way towards a dense woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5684"/>In this they disappeared, and for awhile all was silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5685"/>Then a shot rang out, then another, then a sharp rattle, and we were ordered forward by the flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5686"/>On reaching the woods we were again put in line of battle and ordered in. Scarcely had we entered before some of our troops came running out. It was a new regiment, which being suddenly fired on had given way. They soon rallied, came up behind us, moved off to the right, and, as I heard, did well the rest of the day. As soon as the fugitives had passed we opened fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5687"/>I saw nothing, but banged away, might and main, in the direction in which the balls seemed to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5688"/>After about half an hour of pretty sharp firing we were ordered to advance, and plunged into a dense tangle of brush, undergrowth, vines, etc. As we tore through this the enemy seemed to get our range and poured in a heavy fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5689"/>The thud!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5690"/>thud! with which the balls bored their way into the trees was venomous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5691"/>As soon as we reached better ground, we advanced firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5692"/>This was most exciting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5693"/>Everybody was yelling, firing, and advancing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5694"/>In this advance, I don't know that I did the enemy any harm, but, then, on the other hand, I nearly deprived the <rs>Confederacy</rs> of a soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5695"/>While in the very act of firing, a big fellow, running up rapidly from behind, got almost in front of the muzzle of my musket, which went off within a few inches of his ear. He bent a most reproachful look upon me, but it was no time for explanation, and on he went and I after him, biting another cartridge and ramming it as I went along.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5696"/>The enemy must have made off before we got within sight of them, for the firing ceased and we were halted along a fence.</p></div1> 
<div1 id="c.1.30.423" type="section" n="c.1.30.423"> 
<head>At it in dead earnest.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5697"/>By this time we were all pretty well warmed up and ready for business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5698"/>In coming through the brush I had received a very severe gash from a jagged limb, not to speak of being knocked down and trod on, and was by no means in an angelic humor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5699"/>I looked around, with all my eyes, for something to shoot at, but to the right and in front beheld nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5700"/>To the left oblique I thought I saw men moving about among the trees, and on closer inspection could discern <pb id="p.414" n="414"/> some dark blue uniforms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5701"/>Presently the presence of the enemy became unmistakable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5702"/>I could distinctly see company after company march briskly down a sort of woods road, halt, and face towards us. Half a dozen fellows by me saw the same and raised their guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5703"/>I took a rest on a tree, and a long aim, and we fired together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5704"/>Without stopping to reload I peered forward through the smoke to discern the effect of the shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5705"/>There seemed some slight commotion, but it may only have Leen the officers moving about, as in a moment, as if at the word of command, the whole line brought up their muskets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5706"/>The long stretch of glittering steel, with a head bent down at the end of each gun-barrel, was a thrilling sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5707"/>A huge cloud of smoke hid them from our view, and a tremendous report rang through the forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5708"/>Our whole line instantly replied, and the ball opened in dead earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5709"/>As I half-faced to the left to reload I saw our junior second-lieutenant flat upon his back, his jaw convulsively working in the agonies of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5710"/>He had never been with us in action before, and his presentiment was realized that he would fall in his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5711"/>I had known him before we joined the army, and the sight of his death filled me with rage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5712"/>Half mad with pain and anger I rammed the loads home with all my strength, but aimed carefully each time on the range of my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5713"/>Other troops were apparently brought up, right and left, on both sides, for the uproar swelled until it became deafening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5714"/>The ground being impracticable for either cavalry or artillery, it was a fair and square stand &mdash; up infantry fight at close range, and most stubbornly contested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5715"/>The enemy hung staunchly to their work, and our own men fought like demons.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5716"/>For fully an hour the din kept up without cessation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5717"/>Then the enemy's fire slackened, and we held up a little in turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5718"/>Then they reopened with fresh fury, and at it again we went, hammer and tongs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5719"/>Those were the days, it will be remembered, of muzzleloaders and the old-fashioned ball cartridge, the end of which you were obliged to tear off with your teeth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5720"/>After heavy firing the guns would clog, and presently every piece began to foul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5721"/>I had to stop, tear up my handkerchief and wipe her out. After awhile it clogged again, and finally the ramrod stuck fast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5722"/>It would neither come up nor go down, and, in despair, I jammed it, full force, into a tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5723"/>That drove that charge home, but, on coming to reload, the rammer was so bent as to be almost useless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5724"/>A few more loads were worried down, and then the gun became wholly unmangeable, and I threw it down and looked around for another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5725"/>Behind me was <num value="1">one</num> with a prostrate soldier by it. As I stooped to pick it up, the supposed <pb id="p.415" n="415"/> dead man came to life, stretched out his hand, and shook his head as if to say, don't take it. I gestured back it was no use to him, but he still demurred, and to cut short the pantomine, I snatched the gun away and set her to talking.</p></div1>

<head>A typical battle scene.</head>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5726"/>For a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time the fire slackened and then reopened fiercely, and <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> prolonged and stubborn combat ensued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5727"/>It was evident they were putting in fresh men; our ammunition was running low, and <persName n="Hill,General,,,," id="n0274.0031.00415.05070" reg="nearbymention:Hill,Ambrose,P.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName> ordered a charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5728"/>We started with a yell and the firing ceased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5729"/>It did not take us long to reach the enemy's position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5730"/>The line of their formation did not need the double row of knapsacks neatly piled behind it to mark where it had been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5731"/>It was bloodily signified by prostrate forms, many dead, others gasping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5732"/>They lay in every direction, like a rail fence thrown down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5733"/>In several instances body lay upon body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5734"/>It was a wretched sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5735"/>We tried to give the wounded some water, the only aid in our power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5736"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> man I bent over was past all human help; the next was unable to swallow, and as I sought to raise him the bones of his head cracked in the palm of my hand.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5737"/>During our brief rest at this spot the men busied themselves in various ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5738"/>Most of them replenished their cartridge-boxes from those who had fallen; others tore open the knapsacks and kicked the contents about the ground; others explored the haversacks plentifully strewn around.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5739"/>I refilled my box, wiped out my gun, threw away my old canteen and got me a new <num value="1">one</num>, and then fell &mdash; to on some biscuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5740"/>While there engaged we were ordered forward, and, dropping everything, reformed and went on. After marching a while the woods grew clearer, and presently we emerged at the end.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5741"/>To use the favorite <hi rend="italics">simile</hi> of Sancho Panza, all that had gone before was but tarts and cheese-cakes to what now ensued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5742"/>At the edge of the woods was a belt of felled timber, beyond that a clearing, and woods beyond that again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5743"/>At the far side of the timber a bran-new regiment of <orgName n="Federal Infantry" type="infantry">Federal infantry</orgName>, the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num>, as I make it, we had encountered that day, was drawn up to bar the way. Later in the day we learned it was the <orgName type="regiment" key="NY70">Seventieth New York</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5744"/>And I desire here to do justice to the soldierly steadiness of this command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5745"/>For <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> or more it held us at bay, at <num value="1">one</num> time forcing us back a short distance by the sheer weight of its fire, and never gave way till <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of its officers and nearly <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of its men had been shot down; till its brave and skilful colonel had been twice wounded <pb id="p.416" n="416"/> and knocked senseless, and clambering over the timber we had got fairly in among them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5746"/>But, not to anticipate; on emerging from the woods the scene was <num value="1">one</num> of stern and imposing grandeur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5747"/>The smoke of the previous combats was slowly drifting out of the forest and rising like a thin veil between us and the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5748"/>Through the haze could be seen the long line of infantry, splendidly equipped and motionless as so many statues, the sombre blue of their uniforms relieved by a shining crest of steel, the gold blazonry of the regimental colors, and the gay hues of the national flag.</p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5749"/>No time, however, was lost in admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5750"/>Our men at once settled down behind the logs, rested their muskets on the tree-trunks, and fired.
