<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The clan has never afforded a better illustration of that motto than the distinguished subject of this sketch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>They <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> settled in <placeName reg="Connecticut" key="tgn,7007159">Connecticut</placeName>, from which state <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0063.0001.00001.00010" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s grandfather, who was a soldier through the whole war of the revolution, removed to <placeName reg="Westmoreland, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,1003017">Westmoreland County, in Pennsylvania</placeName>, and was a thrifty farmer there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>About <pb id="p.2" n="2"/>the year <dateStruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></dateStruct>, however, he emigrated with his family to what was then the North-western Territory, and became <num value="1">one</num> of the pioneer settlers of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, to the rich but wild lands of which the tide of emigration from the older states was then beginning to set. At the time of this removal <persName n="Grant,,Jesse,R.,," id="n0063.0001.00002.00011" reg="default:Grant,Jesse,R.,,"><foreName>Jesse</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, the general's father, was a boy, who grew to manhood under the genial influences of that magnificent country, and the inuring difficulties of pioneer life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>He added to the occupation of a farmer that of a tanner, and settling at <placeName reg="Point Pleasant, Mason, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119619">Point Pleasant</placeName>, in the <rs type="place"><placeName reg="Clermont, Ohio, United States" key="tgn,1002279">County of Clermont</placeName></rs>, married <persName n="Simpson,,Hannah,,," id="n0063.0001.00002.00012" reg="default:Simpson,Hannah,,,"><foreName>Hannah</foreName> <surname>Simpson</surname></persName>, the daughter of another pioneer settler, also from <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>He had learned his trade of tanner in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, but his aversion to slavery led him to settle in <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>His parents were quiet and unpretending, but persevering and thrifty, possessed of good sense, and governed by good principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0001.00002.00015" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> felt their influence for good through all his early life; and his successful career is due, in no small degree, not only to his inherited temperament, but to his early training, and the influences of his home in the formation of his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>It was a humble home in which labor was necessary, but in which, also, the dignity of labor was justly appreciated and adorned with many virtues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>In it <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0001.00002.00016" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> acquired habits of industry and fidelity to all his duties, of self-reliance, perseverance, and straightforward honesty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The influence of his mother, who was a woman of genuine strength of character, was very great, and was <pb id="p.3" n="3"/>always well directed in moulding the elements of his character for future usefulness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The early settlers of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, especially those from <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> and New York, carried with them a just appreciation of the advantages of education, and made provision for common schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>At <num value="1">one</num> of these young <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0001.00003.00017" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> received such education as was then afforded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>He was not a brilliant scholar, but he was faithful and persevering, and by dint of application and encouragement at home he mastered all the lessons required of him more successfully, and to better purpose, than boys of quicker and more showy abilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>He exhibited at school, and in all his youthful life, those qualities of faithfulness, patience, and perseverance, and a persistency in doing what was to be done, which have characterized him in after life, and have given him that success which has made him famous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>In lessons he accomplished with credit all that was required of him, especially in mathematics, and at least acquired so much as enabled him, when appointed a cadet at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, to pass an examination as successfully as many who had enjoyed superior advantages, or were endowed with more brilliant mental qualities.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Nor was he idle at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Like most boys in a similar condition of life, he had many duties to perform about his father's house and tannery; and to these duties, even if they were not always agreeable, he was always faithful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He was not afraid to work, or to lend a helping hand when anything was necessary to be done, and was especially apt at driving team or taking charge of horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>His work done, he applied himself to his lessons, receiving generous encouragement from <pb id="p.4" n="4"/>his parents, and such assistance as they could render.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>He learned much by experience and observation, and acquired the habit of making practical application of what he learned by study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Thus his education at school and at home laid the foundation for the accomplishment of great deeds in his manhood, when his country imposed upon him the necessity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>When men have become famous, it is quite usual to find recorded numerous anecdotes of their sayings and doings in boyhood, which are characteristic of the qualities they exhibited in maturer years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>If these are not readily found in family traditions or neighborly gossip, they are sometimes invented, or enlarged from some trivial occurrence which the subsequent fame of the subject alone would cause to be remembered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It is not proposed to repeat or to create any such myths concerning the boyhood of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0001.00004.00018" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Doubtless many things occurred to him, and he did many things, which might, if duly recorded, add interest to his biography.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>But such things occur to all boys, and most of them do something characteristic, only there are but few whose after career renders it worth while to remember or enlarge upon such things to point a moral or adorn a biography.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>But <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0001.00004.00019" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s boyhood was not very remakable, and gave no special promise of future greatness, though a phrenologist once said <hi rend="italics">he would be <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></hi>. He was a downright, earnest, honest boy, quiet and unassuming, with indications of reserved power to meet emergencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>He was no boaster, but he exhibited self-reliance, persistency, and courage which could not but win the respect of his associates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/><pb id="p.5" n="5"/>He was generous and good-natured, but his firmness did not allow him to be imposed upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>He was not disposed to quarrel or &mdash; to fight on his own account, but it is related of him that he once fought and punished a Canadian boy who insulted the memory of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0063.0001.00005.00020" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>He was not without ambition, but it was by no means the only motive of his actions, or led him to do more than faithfully and persistently attend to the duty in hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>He was patriotic, and had a laudable desire to serve his country as a soldier rather than as a politician.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Though exhibiting no special aptitude for military life, except firmness and fidelity to duty, his modesty and reticence saw no attractions in the political field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/><num value="1">One</num> of the traits of his character earliest to be developed was his love for horses, and his faculty of managing them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>From his infancy he loved a horse, and learned to ride <num value="1">one</num> long before he learned to read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>When only <measure n="7.5years" type="date">seven and a half years</measure> old, during his father's absence, he harnessed to a sled a <num value="3">three</num>-year-old colt, which had never been broken except to the saddle, and drove the animal all day, carrying loads of brushwood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>He was afraid of no horse, and not only became an expert driver, but an excellent tamer and trainer of horses even before he was <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> old. He taught them to pace with remarkable facility, and his neighbors, near and far, were very desirous of having his service in this line, though he was not inclined to become a mere horse-trainer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>He rode with more than the skill of a circus-rider, for his rides were in the rough and open fields without the advantages of the <quote>ring;</quote> but his feats were for his own amusement and his own satisfaction, and not for the eye of any <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.6" n="6"/>else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>He once or twice balked a tricky showman by safely riding a mischievous pony which was trained to throw all venturesome boys who mounted it, but was completely mastered by young <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0001.00006.00021" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>He not only loved a horse and knew how to tame, ride, and train him, but he early learned to know the points of a good horse, so that he could, even at <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> old, judge of the quality and value of <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>This love for and power over a horse, manifested, as in young <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0001.00006.00022" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s case, in useful and practical ways, show both a genial side to his nature and a power to dare and to command.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>His love of a good horse now is well known, and it is <num value="1">one</num> of the homebred affections of his boyhood, which, with homebred habits and virtues, have adhered to him through all his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>He can <quote>talk horse</quote> with any-body, and has often evaded the questions of too inquisitive visitors, or concealed his plans and purposes, by a ready resort to that fruitful topic of conversation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Another of his traits, which was early developed, was his perseverance, which was shown not only in his mastery of horses while yet a mere child, but was abundantly illustrated by labors which would have discouraged almost any boy of his age. When but <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> old, and small for his age, he gave a remarkable example of practical application of his observation and of patient and persistent labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>He had gone to the woods expecting to find the men cutting timber and ready to load; but they were not there, and the young teamster had no idea of returning with an empty wagon if he could help it, though it required several men to lift the huge logs he was to carry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>He looked around, <pb id="p.7" n="7"/>and seeing a felled tree which lay with the trunk elevated at <num value="1">one</num> end at a moderate angle with the ground, he at once thought of an expedient, and with self-reliance and perseverance set himself to work to put it in practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>With <num value="1">one</num> of his horses he drew up the slope of the felled tree <num value="1">one</num> end of a log he proposed to carry, and that being properly placed high enough for him to back the wagon under it, he in the same way drew, <num value="1">one</num> at a time, <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> others, which made a load.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>That done, and the wagon being placed under the elevated ends, with his horse and chains he drew each log into it, and, securing his load, went quietly home, doubtless well pleased with his work, though making not the slightest boast.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>His father could hardly believe the boy's assertion, that he and the horse loaded the wagon; but he knew that <persName><foreName>Ulysses</foreName></persName> was never guilty of falsehood, and he soon had the work explained so that he was satisfied of its truth, though he still could not but wonder at his son's achievement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Such practical knowledge and persistent labor he exhibited all through his boyhood, and they furnish the key to some of the great successes of his after career.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>That <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0001.00007.00023" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was a boy of capacity and character, is proved by the fact that, without any special political or family influence, he received the appointment of cadet in the <rs>National</rs> <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName> at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>He preferred being a soldier to being a tanner, and the country now knows that he chose wisely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>He was nominated for admission to the <name>Academy</name> in <dateStruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></dateStruct>, by <persName n="Hamer,the Honorable,T.,L.,," id="n0063.0001.00007.00024" reg="default:Hamer,T.,L.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Hamer</surname></persName>, member of Congress from the district in which he resided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>By some mistake Mr. <pb id="p.8" n="8"/><persName n="Hamer,,,,," id="n0063.0001.00008.00025" reg="nearbymention:Hamer,T.,L.,,"><surname>Hamer</surname></persName> gave his name as <persName n="Grant,,Ulysses,S.,," id="n0063.0001.00008.00026" reg="default:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><foreName>Ulysses</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, probably confounding his name with that of a brother who bore the name of <persName n="Simpson,,,,," id="n0063.0001.00008.00027" reg="nearbymention:Simpson,Hannah,,,"><surname>Simpson</surname></persName>, his mother's maiden name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0001.00008.00028" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> applied to the authorities at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, and subsequently to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">secretary of war</rs>, to have the error corrected, but those parties apparently did not think the matter of sufficient importance to demand their attention; or possibly they thought that the initials U. S. were very appropriate for a cadet educated at the expense of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and destined to be an officer in the <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">army of the United States</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>At any rate, the request was not complied with, and it was fated that <persName n="Grant,,Hiram,Ulysses,," id="n0063.0001.00008.00029" reg="default:Grant,Hiram,Ulysses,,"><foreName>Hiram</foreName> <foreName>Ulysses</foreName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> was henceforth to be known as <persName n="Grant,,Ulysses,S.,," id="n0063.0001.00008.00030" reg="default:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><foreName>Ulysses</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>The movement against <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> was <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>Its object was to open the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, in order not only to secure that majestic line of communication with the sea, and with the <rs>Union</rs> forces at its mouth, but to divide the rebel confederacy in twain, and to cut off the rebel armies in the east from <num value="1">one</num> of their chief sources of supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>It was a movement <pb id="p.59" n="59"/>full of difficulties, for it was a position of great natural strength, affording no vantage-ground for an attack, and it had been industriously fortified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>The rebels knew its importance to them, and they spared no pains to make it secure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>At the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> indications of a movement against it, they extended and strengthened its defences, and concentrated their forces so as to be able to present, at any point of attack, numbers at least equal to the assailants.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>Such had been his plans before the expedition down the river had been determined upon; and when his communications were cut, had he known what he then learned by experience, and what was then <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> tried by any considerable force,--that he could subsist an army on the enemy's country,--he would have moved promptly on <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>But the river expedition was now the favorite <num value="1">one</num> with the government, and at this time, perhaps, the most advantageous <num value="1">one</num>, and he bent all his energies to secure its success, aiming still to get to the rear of the rebel position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>It was impossible to carry the enemy's works in front, or on their flank, an attack at the only practicable point, on the <rs>Yazoo</rs>, having already failed; and it was equally impossible to pass the rebel batteries on the river with a sufficient number of transports and gunboats in order to flank them on the south.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>The problem was, therefore, somewhat difficult in theory as well as in practice.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>Without being too confident of success, <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0005.00060.00404" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> ordered this work to be completed on a larger scale and in a more effective manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>He always felt that it was essential to keep his men actively employed; and even if this canal did not enable the fleet to pass down below <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, it occupied the attention and encouraged the hopes of the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>The work was pushed forward with vigor; but it took months to bring it near completion, and then a rapid rise in the river broke through the embankment of the canal and overflowed the country, and the work did not answer its purpose.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>He was busy in seeking other practicable routes by which he could reach the position he desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>As soon as he took command, he gave orders for cutting a way from the <rs>Mississippi</rs> to <placeName reg="Lake Providence, East Carroll, Louisiana" key="tgn,2599878">Lake Providence</placeName> on the west, from which it was hoped steamers might pass into the <rs>Tensas</rs>, and thence into the <placeName reg="Natchitoches, Natchitoches, Louisiana" key="tgn,7014191">Red River</placeName>, and a passage thus be opened for communication with <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n0063.0005.00060.00406" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName>, who was to cooperate from New Orleans in the opening of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>At <num value="1">one</num> time the latter route promised to be practicable, and to enable <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0005.00060.00407" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> to flank the rebel works on the <pb id="p.61" n="61"/><placeName reg="Yazoo City, Yazoo, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057820">Yazoo</placeName>, and reach the high land in the rear of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>But unexpected obstacles, natural and artificial, were encountered; and though the novel and remark-serious loss and alarm to the rebels, it was found at last to be unavailing.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>There was a clamor for his removal, prompted in part by jealousy, and in part by ignorance and impatience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>This feeling at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 4" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, and at the <rs>North</rs>, suggested all sorts of rumors and misrepresentations about <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0005.00061.00409" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, the condition of his troops, and everything which could affect his character as a general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>So through his whole career, while there was an enemy of his country in his front, he did not turn back to fight his personal enemies in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>And never did he undertake to defend himself against the misrepresentations and plots of unscrupulous men, until in himself the safety and welfare of the country were assailed, and the fruits of all his victories were endangered.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>He had yet another plan, to which, from the beginning, he had anticipated he might resort when the waters had sufficiently subsided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>This was to move his army, which was now large and well organized, partly by water through the bayous on the west side of the river, and partly by a wagon road to New Carthage, and thence across the <rs>Mississippi</rs> below <placeName reg="Warrenton, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057734">Warrenton</placeName>, or to a point still farther down the river, and thence across to <placeName reg="Grand Gulf, Claiborne, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056516">Grand Gulf</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>These gunboats and transports, with such small steamers as could pass through the bayous, were to transport the troops across the river, and a movement was then to be made to the rear of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>The movement was successfully made, and attended with the most brilliant results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>The rebel soldiers stared at him curiously, as if they wondered how so unpretending a man could be a great general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>His greatest anxiety &mdash; which, even then, did not amount to a doubt &mdash; was when he was contending against unnumbered difficulties and obstacles in his efforts to reach the enemy, and the country was becoming impatient at the tedious delays.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>But when he found that his long-contemplated movement could be made, he was no longer anxious, except to get his troops forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>He never doubted the result; he was confident of victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>His confidence then, as in all his campaigns, amounted almost to fatalism; but it was a confidence born not of blind egotism, or a superstitious belief in inevitable destiny, but of indefatigable effort and unyielding tenacity of purpose.

Cautious, vigilant, active, his orders to his subordinates were promptly and explicitly given; and when fairly in the field, every considerable movement contributed to secure the object in view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>The experience of the campaign developed his military genius, and proved him a great general in his ability to move and feed troops, as well as in the grand tactics of the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>His army was prompt and rapid in its movements, and always well supplied; and he attended so closely to the details of these matters, that, without the slightest effort or desire to make himself popular, he secured the attachment of his men. But he did not content himself with simply seeing that they were furnished with supplies; he looked well after the wounded and sick, and protected all against the extortions <pb id="p.71" n="71"/>of sutlers and steamboat captains, and other classes of vampyres that followed the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>Plain, quiet, and unassuming, but self-reliant, brave, and cool in the midst of danger, he was just the man to inspire the confidence, if not the enthusiasm, of the army under his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>He had thus, at the close of this brilliant campaign, established with the government, in the army, and before the world, a reputation as a general more solid than that of any other officer in the country. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>He desired that his success should be promptly followed up by vigorous movements which should weaken and dispirit the rebels, and he considered <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> as the next most important point of attack in the south-west, and at that time not very difficult to capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>His suggestions were no longer treated with contempt or indifference by <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n0063.0006.00075.00498" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><surname>Halleck</surname></persName>, who joined him in wishing he had a sufficient force at his disposal to accomplish the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>It was therefore deemed of much political importance <pb id="p.76" n="76"/>that a strong <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> force should occupy the line of the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>, to check any hostile movement which <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, under false pretences, might make into <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>This required the forces which would have been used against <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, and for these reasons <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0006.00076.00499" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was obliged to abandon a movement which he believed desirable, and which under his direction would probably have met with early success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>The secretary also bore other orders, which gave the general full power over all the troops in his department, with authority to conduct the campaign according to his own plans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>The government and the people had long felt that in order to secure unity of purpose in the conduct of the campaigns, <name>east</name> and <name>west</name>, and an efficient cooperation between the several Union armies, it was important to have all the forces under the command of <num value="1">one</num> active and able general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>The <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName> had been, through nearly all its existence, so near to the national capital, and <pb id="p.98" n="98"/>within such easy communication with the great cities and the manufacturing States of the <rs type="place">Atlantic coast</rs>, that it was supplied with some comforts and luxuries which were not enjoyed by the western armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>The nature of its campaigns, too, and frequent communication with <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 4" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, had gradually introduced customs which were unknown in western campaigns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>The amount of officers' baggage, especially during the months of comparative inactivity, had materially increased, and was much larger than that carried in the campaigns at the west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>Another custom had grown up at the east for officers to use ambulances, and even more luxurious carriages, for transportation from <num value="1">one</num> point to another, and many horses and vehicles were thus used without any legitimate authority, sometimes much to the dissatisfaction of the soldiers, who were precluded from such privileges, and not much to the advantage of the officers.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>He had no taste for show, and gave no time to it. He did not believe in delay, and would not tolerate it. Ready to work himself, and capable of accomplishing a great deal of labor, he set a good example, and required it <pb id="p.103" n="103"/>to be followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>His headquarters were always distinguished by the quiet, business-like industry of his staff and clerks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>And in the selection of his staff, he chose only men of capacity for their several duties, never simply for their good looks or social position, as some officers did, not for mere friendship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>No intimation of his plans ever leaked out from his headquarters to reach alike the loyal press and the rebel commanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant General</rs> kept his own counsel, except so far as it was necessary to intrust a knowledge of his purposes to his subordinates; and his staff learned reticence from his example, if not from his injunctions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>The government heartily supported the man to whom it had intrusted the whole military power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>Supplies and munitions were furnished without stint, and all that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0008.00103.00675" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> deemed necessary at any point was furnished as promptly as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>The country, too, sent forward troops with unfailing zeal, and the armies were filled up to a strength they had never before reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/><measure n="2years" type="date">Two years</measure> before, after great preparation and long delay, after many grand reviews and much unpractical discipline, a commander, of whom the country unwisely expected as much as they did now of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0008.00103.00676" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, had begun the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> campaign against <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>From the outset, he had asked for reenforcements, and the burden of all his despatches was <quote>more troops,</quote> <quote>more troops,</quote> or something more and different from what the government had provided or proposed, not because he had <hi rend="italics">proved</hi> the strength of the enemy, but because he <hi rend="italics">feared</hi> it, and was ready to magnify it. And so the very delays resulting from his dissatisfaction with what he had, and his distrust of his troops, if not of his own <pb id="p.104" n="104"/>capacity, served to make the enemy as formidable as he had feared.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>It is true that there had now been a great improvement in military affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>The army was better organized, better equipped, and better officered, and experience had made both men and officers more efficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>Never in all his campaigns had he clamored for reenforcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>He had always taken what the government could send, and made the best possible use of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>So, as the commander of all the armies, he evinced the same spirit, trusting to the patriotism of the government and the people to furnish all that they could to accomplish the work of crushing the rebellion, and resolved to do his part by a faithful and persistent use of the means thus placed in his hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>His letter to <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0063.0008.00104.00678" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, quoted in the preceding chapter, shows how he acknowledged the efforts of the government, and with what a generous spirit he recognized his own responsibility.</p>

The rebel army in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> was the objective of the eastern campaign, and the rebel army between <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> and <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> was the objective of the western campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>These <num value="2">two</num> armies comprised the mass of the rebel forces, and covered the vital points of the rebel Confederacy, and they were to be the objects towards which the <num value="2">two</num> <orgName n="Great Union" type="union">great Union</orgName> armies were to move; all other operations being in aid of these, to create diversions, or to hold <pb id="p.105" n="105"/>detached rebel forces from joining the main rebel armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1160"/>As a soldier, he abstained from a frequent expression of his political opinions, and his constitutional <pb id="p.140" n="140"/>reticence made him appear still more cautious in that respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1179"/>It is but a short time since the <orgName n="U. S. Senate" type="org">United States Senate</orgName> was in session, and why not then have asked for his removal if it was desired?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1180"/>It certainly was the intention of the legislative branch of government to place cabinet ministers beyond the power of executive removal, and it is pretty well understood that, so far as cabinet ministers are affected by the <quote>tenure of office bill,</quote> it was intended specially to protect the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, whom the country felt great confidence in. The meaning of the law may be explained away by an astute lawyer, but common sense, and the views of the loyal people, will give to it the effect intended by its framers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1181"/>On the subject of the removal of the very able commander of the <orgName type="district" n="district 5">fifth military district</orgName>, let me ask you to consider the effect it would have upon the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1184"/>He has had difficulties to contend with which no other district commander has encountered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1185"/>Almost if not quite from the day he was appointed district commander to the present time, the press has given out that he was to be removed; that the administration was dissatisfied with him, &amp;c.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1186"/>In conclusion, allow me to say, as a friend desiring peace and quiet, the welfare of the whole country <name>north</name> and <name>south</name>, that it is in my opinion more than the loyal people of this country (I mean those who supported the government during the great rebellion) will quietly submit to, to see the very men of all others whom they have expressed confidence in removed.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1261"/>I in nowise admitted the correctness of the <rs>President</rs>'s statement of our conversations, though, to soften the evident contradiction my statement gave, I said (alluding to our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> conversation on the subject) the <rs>President</rs> might have understood me the way he said, namely, that I had promised to resign if I did not resist the reinstatement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1262"/>I made no such promise.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1268"/>Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the <dateStruct value="--31"><day reg="31">31st ultimo</day></dateStruct>, in answer to mine of the <dateStruct value="--28"><day reg="28">28th ultimo</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1269"/>After a careful reading and comparison of it with the article in the <orgName n="National Intelligencer" type="newspaper">National Intelligencer</orgName> of the <dateStruct value="--15"><day reg="15">15th ultimo</day></dateStruct>, and the article over the initials J.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1270"/>I confess my surprise that the cabinet officers referred to should so greatly misapprehend the facts in the matter of admissions alleged to have been made by me at the cabinet meeting of the <dateStruct value="--14"><day reg="14">14th ultimo</day></dateStruct> as to suffer their names to be made the basis of the charges in the newspaper article referred to, or agree in the accuracy, as you affirm they do, of your account of what occurred at that meeting.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1271"/>You know that we parted on <date>Saturday</date>, the <dateStruct value="--11"><day reg="11">11th ultimo</day></dateStruct>, without any promise on my part, either express or implied, to the effect that I would hold on to the office of <hi rend="italics"><rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> ad interim</hi> against the action of the <name>Senate</name>, or, declining to do so myself, would surrender it to you before such action was had, or that I would see you again at any fixed time on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1272"/><pb id="p.154" n="154"/></p> 
<p>The performance of the promises alleged by you to have been made by me would have involved a resistance to law, and an inconsistency with the whole history of my connection with the suspension of <persName n="Stanton,Mister,,,," id="n0063.0010.00154.00993" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,E.,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1273"/>From our conversations, and my written protest of <dateStruct value="1867-08-01"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg="1">1</day>, <year reg="1867">1867</year></dateStruct>, against the removal of <persName n="Stanton,Mister,,,," id="n0063.0010.00154.00994" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,E.,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName>, you must have known that my greatest objection to his removal or suspension was the fear that some <num value="1">one</num> would be appointed in his stead who would, by opposition to the laws relating to the restoration of the <rs>Southern States</rs> to their proper relations to the government, embarrass the army in the performance of duties especially imposed upon it by these laws; and it was to prevent such an appointment that I accepted the office of <hi rend="italics"><rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> ad interim</hi>, and not for the purpose of enabling you to get rid of <persName n="Stanton,Mister,,,," id="n0063.0010.00154.00995" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,E.,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName> by my withholding it from him in opposition to law, or not doing so myself, surrendering it to <num value="1">one</num> who would, as the statement and assumptions in your communication plainly indicate was sought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1274"/>And it was to avoid this same danger, as well as to relieve you from the personal embarrassment in which <persName n="Stanton,Mister,,,," id="n0063.0010.00154.00996" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,E.,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName>'s reinstatement would place you, that I urged the appointment of <persName n="Cox,Governor,,,," id="n0063.0010.00154.00997" reg="mostcommon:Cox,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Cox</surname></persName>, believing that it would be agreeable to you and also to <persName n="Stanton,Mister,,,," id="n0063.0010.00154.00998" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,E.,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName>--satisfied, as I was, that it was the good of the country, and not the office, the latter desired.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1275"/>On the <dateStruct value="--15"><day reg="15">15th ultimo</day></dateStruct>, in presence of <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0063.0010.00154.00999" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, I stated to you that I thought <persName n="Stanton,Mister,,,," id="n0063.0010.00154.01000" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,E.,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName> would resign, but did not say that I would advise him to do so. On the <dateStruct value="--18"><day reg="2">18th</day></dateStruct> I did agree with <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0063.0010.00154.01001" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> to go and advise him to that course, and on the <num value="19" type="ordinal">19th</num> I had an interview alone with <persName n="Stanton,Mister,,,," id="n0063.0010.00154.01002" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,E.,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName>, which led me to the conclusion that any advice to him of the kind would be useless, and I so informed <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0063.0010.00154.01003" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1276"/>Before I consented to advise <persName n="Stanton,Mister,,,," id="n0063.0010.00154.01004" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,E.,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName> to resign, I understood from him, in a conversation on the subject <pb id="p.155" n="155"/>immediately after his reinstatement, that it was his opinion that the act of Congress, entitled <quote>An act temporarily to supply vacancies in the executive departments in certain cases,</quote> approved <dateStruct value="1863-02-20"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg="20">20</day>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, was repealed by subsequent legislation, which materially influenced my action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1277"/>Previous to this time I had had no doubt that the law of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct> was still in force, and notwithstanding my action, a fuller examination of the law leaves a question in my mind whether it is or is not repealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1278"/>This being the case, I could not now advise his resignation, lest the same danger I apprehended on his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> removal might follow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1279"/>The course you would have it understood I agreed to pursue was in violation of law, and without orders from you; while the course I did pursue, and which I never doubted you fully understood, was in accordance with law, and not in disobedience of any orders of my superior.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1280"/>And now, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, when my honor as a soldier and integrity as a man have been so violently assailed, pardon me for saying that I can but regard this whole matter, from the beginning to the end, as an attempt to involve me in the resistance of law, for which you hesitated to assume the responsibility in orders, and thus to destroy my character before the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1281"/>I am in a measure confirmed in this conclusion by your recent orders directing me to disobey orders from the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>,--my superior and your subordinate,--without having countermanded his authority to issue the orders I am to disobey.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1282"/>With the assurance, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, that nothing less than a vindication of my personal honor and character could have induced this correspondence on my part,</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1286"/>But it is significant, that of these indorsers of presidential veracity, those who are of the least political consequence, and the most obsequious followers of <persName n="Johnson,Mister,,,," id="n0063.0010.00156.01008" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,A.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, give the briefest and most emphatic certificates of his correctness; while those who chose to exercise their own memory, though they do not contradict the <rs>President</rs>, whom they felt compelled to sustain, really show that <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0063.0010.00156.01009" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s statement was the true <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1287"/>Certainly every unprejudiced reader could not but believe the plain, straightforward, soldierly declarations of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0063.0010.00156.01010" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, which accord with his well-known character and acts, rather than the disingenuous statements of <persName n="Johnson,,Andrew,,," id="n0063.0010.00156.01011" reg="default:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><foreName>Andrew</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, who was bent upon disobeying law, and defying Congress, and was trying to force a loyal officer to share his guilt.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1288"/>When the correspondence was placed before the people, they speedily rendered a verdict in favor of the tried and honest soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1289"/>They saw that his fidelity to the country in time of peace, against the wily schemes of an unscrupulous executive, was as firm and true as it had been in war when contending against the armed forces of the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1290"/>And <persName n="Johnson,Mister,,,," id="n0063.0010.00156.01012" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> had the satisfaction of seeing his little game of damaging <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0010.00156.01013" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s reputation no more successful than his malignant and unlawful attempt to get rid of <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0063.0010.00156.01014" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,E.,M.,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName>; for the general was only the more firmly fixed in the regards of the people, and all the more trusted by Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1291"/>On the other hand, the unexpected result of <persName n="Johnson,Mister,,,," id="n0063.0010.00156.01015" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s <pb id="p.157" n="157"/>schemes soon followed this correspondence; for, continuing in his folly and madness, he boldly defied the law, and was impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1296"/>His intellectual ability, which early in the war was not appreciated nor even admitted among those who measured such ability by scholarship or brilliant success in some civil pursuit, has been fully proved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1297"/>It only required the opportunities of war to develop itself, so that it should tower above his modesty, his undemonstrative manner, and retiring habits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1298"/>After his successful campaigns, planned and executed with so much of skill and persistency; after <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, and <pb id="p.159" n="159"/><placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>; after the skilful direction of movements on the most extended field of war which ever came under the supervision of <num value="1">one</num> man, his intellectual ability cannot be questioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1299"/>Though not of a type to be called into exercise under ordinary circumstances, or rather being accompanied by traits of character which prevented its being called into exercise except under extraordinary pressure, it has proved itself in the most difficult field, and on the most important of occasions; and it has proved itself to be of that quality and character that it can be safely trusted to conduct prudently and successfully the affairs of a great country in time of peace as well as in time of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1300"/>His remarkable insight into the character and capacity of others has been illustrated by his wise choice of subordinates to carry out his plans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1301"/>It has been said that he owed his success to his able subordinates, and this idea has been encouraged by his own modesty and generosity towards them; but, in truth, they were more indebted to him than he to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1302"/>It was his sagacity which recognized their merit, and, in more than <num value="1">one</num> instance, called them from obscurity, and gave them the opportunity of distinguishing themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1303"/>It was his discernment which selected each to take that command, and to perform those deeds, for which he was best adapted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1304"/>His most brilliant subordinates, <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00159.01022" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> and <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00159.01023" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>, were especially thus indebted to him. <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00159.01024" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> was looked upon as little better than a lunatic till <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00159.01025" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> gave direction to his abilities, and <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00159.01026" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> achieved no distinction till <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00159.01027" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, seeing his true capacity, made him his cavalry commander, and <pb id="p.160" n="160"/>sent him to the <rs>Shenandoah</rs> to defeat <persName n="Early,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00160.01028" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><surname>Early</surname></persName>, and to <placeName reg="Five Forks, Dinwiddie, Virginia" key="tgn,2111769">Five Forks</placeName> to break through <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00160.01029" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1306"/>So, also, his staff has always been composed of men admirably qualified for their respective duties, and who performed them with the same quiet energy which characterized their chief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1307"/>This power to discern the character and ability of others, and to make a wise selection of agents, is <num value="1">one</num> of the essential traits of a genius for command and for administration; and it is <num value="1">one</num> as important for complete success in civil affairs as in military.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1308"/>Should <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0063.0011.00160.01033" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> be called to the higher position to which the people wish to promote him, the country has reason to feel assured that his wise choice of counsellors and executive officers will secure the most honest, faithful, and successful administration that has been vouchsafed to the country for many years.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1309"/>His tenacity of purpose is another trait which has been illustrated through his whole career, and which is so prominent in the foregoing narrative of each of his campaigns, that it is needless to do more than allude to it here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1310"/>Happily, in <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00160.01034" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> persistency is united with patriotism, honesty of purpose, and sound judgment, which give it direction and exalt its character.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1311"/>Allied to this is his firmness, which, being entirely free from conceit, never degenerates into obstinacy, although <persName n="Grant,Mrs.,,,," id="n0063.0011.00160.01035" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> says <quote><persName n="Grant,Mister,,,," id="n0063.0011.00160.01036" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> is a very obstinate <pb id="p.161" n="161"/>man.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1312"/>His firmness is generally for a good purpose, and subordinate to reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1313"/>He does not adhere to an opinion simply because he has expressed it, but only when he is convinced it is right; and when he has adopted a course which he is satisfied is the true <num value="1">one</num>, he is not to be turned aside by opposition or flattery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1314"/>Self-reliant and independent, by nature and by long training, he is not easily moved by the various advice of various men, but he calmly listens, weighs, and acts upon his own conclusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1315"/>He can say <quote>no</quote> to unworthy office-seekers, and keep political schemers at a distance, as he did the cotton speculators, who sought to bribe him when he commanded on the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1316"/>But with all his firmness and independence, he has always manifested the strictest obedience to law, and submission to legitimate authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1317"/>This was illustrated throughout his career during the war, and it has been especially shown in his efforts to carry out the provisions of the reconstruction acts, against the adverse influence of <persName n="Johnson,,Andrew,,," id="n0063.0011.00161.01037" reg="default:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><foreName>Andrew</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, the sneers and opposition of northern Democrats, and the schemes of perverse rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1318"/>Again, in his respect for the tenure of office act, he resisted the machinations of the <rs>President</rs> and his advisers to disregard the law, and involve him in a violation of it. His obedience to law has always been based upon respect for the source of law,--the will of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1319"/>He conducted the war in accordance with the declared policy of the loyal people, and in his protest against the removal of <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00161.01038" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,E.,M.,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> and <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00161.01039" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>, he boldly told <persName n="Johnson,Mister,,,," id="n0063.0011.00161.01040" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, <quote>It is more than the loyal people of this country (I mean those who <pb id="p.162" n="162"/>supported the government during the great rebellion) will quietly submit to, to see the very men, of all others, whom they have expressed confidence in, removed;</quote> and again, he reminded him, <quote><hi rend="italics">This is a republic, where the will of the people is the law of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1320"/>I beg that their voice may be heard</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1321"/>Thus, by his acts and by his language, he has put himself upon record, and established his reputation as a true democrat, and a thorough republican, whom the people can safely trust.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1322"/>Such traits of character, possessed in a remarkable degree by <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0063.0011.00162.01041" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, admirably qualify him, not only for the high position, and the important command and trusts to which he has been called, but for the still higher functions for which the loyal people have every &mdash; where designated him. But besides these, he possesses other traits becoming that high position, if not so important to it, which commend themselves to the admiration of the people, and to their love.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1323"/>He has always manifested a noble generosity to his subordinates,--a generosity which has won their firmest friendship, and the genuine respect of his soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1324"/>No <num value="1">one</num> more heartily rejoiced in the successes of his brother officers than he; no <num value="1">one</num> more warmly commended them for their gallantry and good service; no <num value="1">one</num> more earnestly supported them in the hour of danger and trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1325"/>No petty jealousy ever disturbed his relations with any officer in the army; and if there were some whose capacity he doubted, or whose conduct he censured, it was never because of any mean prejudice, ungenerous rivalry, or ,narrow ill will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1326"/>Never acting from impulse, his judgment of others was always founded on reason, while a kindly nature has <pb id="p.163" n="163"/>made his favorable judgments all the more friendly and his unfavorable opinions less harsh.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1327"/>Much has been said about <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0063.0011.00163.01042" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s reticence, and it might be supposed from some accounts that he is mute as a statue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1328"/>But, on the contrary, though he is not loquacious or demonstrative, and never seeks opportunities to express his opinions, he is often very agreeable in conversation, and is straightforward, honest, and simple in his language as he is in all his conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1329"/>But upon all matters connected with his official action he is discreetly reticent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1330"/>During the war he never announced his plans or talked about them, except with those whom he could absolutely trust, and his staff officers, following his instruction and example, were equally silent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1331"/>When he took the field with the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>, he was frequently beset by members of Congress, correspondents of the press, and visitors favored with special passes to the front, who endeavored to elicit from him something of his views and purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1332"/>But they were always unsuccessful, and were obliged to be content with the most <rs n="General Remarks" type="misc">general remarks</rs>, from which they drew inferences to suit themselves, or were put off with quiet monosyllables, which sometimes alarmed their fears and sometimes wounded their conceit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1333"/>Impertinent querists and officious advisers often retired from his headquarters utterly baffled in their purposes, and uncertain whether to be angry or not. A characteristic anecdote of such an interview is told.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1334"/>A visitor to the army, during the brief quiet which followed the <rs n="Battle of Spottsylvania" type="battle">battle of Spottsylvania</rs>, called at the general's headquarters, and found him talking with <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.164" n="164"/>of his staff, and smoking as usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1335"/>The stranger, who had studied strategy to his own satisfaction, encouraged by the absence of all ceremony at <placeName reg="Headquarters, Cowlitz, Washington" key="tgn,2383093">Headquarters</placeName>, ventured to address the commander, and inquired,--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1336"/><quote>General, if you flank <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00164.01043" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, and get between him and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, will you not uncover <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 4" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, and leave it a prey to the enemy?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1337"/><quote>I reckon so,</quote> replied the general, indifferently, discharging a cloud of smoke, perhaps to conceal a quiet smile.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1338"/>The visitor, encouraged, again asked, <quote>Do you not think <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00164.01044" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> can detach a sufficient force from his army to reenforce <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00164.01045" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, and overwhelm <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00164.01046" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1339"/><quote>Not a doubt of it,</quote> replied <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00164.01047" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, promptly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1340"/>The stranger, finding that his views were so readily accepted by <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00164.01048" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, asked again, <quote>Is there not danger, general, that <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00164.01049" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> may come up from <placeName reg="Carolina City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2222249">Carolina</placeName> and reenforce <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00164.01050" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, so that with overwhelming numbers he can swing round and cut off your communications and seize your supplies?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1341"/><quote>Very likely,</quote> coolly replied the general, knocking the ashes from his cigar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1342"/>The stranger, alarmed at all these dangers admitted by the general, and amazed at his indifference and stolidity, hurried away to startle the timid with a vivid account of the critical position of affairs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1343"/>Such was <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00164.01051" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s reticence while conducting the war, and the country saw abundant reason for applauding it. After the war, when he established his headquarters at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 4" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, where he was continually surrounded by impertinent inquirers and political <pb id="p.165" n="165"/>schemers, that reticence was none the less needed, and was as discreetly practised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1344"/>If they endeavored to entrap him, they were completely foiled by quiet monosyllables or a blunt change of the topic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1345"/>If schemers talked politics to elicit his views, he could <quote>talk horse,</quote> as a subject with which he declared himself more familiar; and it is related that when <persName n="Johnson,President,,,," id="n0063.0011.00165.01052" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> undertook to find out what he thought of the rumored intention of the <name>Democrats</name> to nominate him for the presidency in order to flank the <name>Republicans</name>, he replied, <quote>I think &mdash; this is the poorest cigar I ever smoked.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1346"/>As for making speeches, he is utterly averse to doing so; and on many occasions when the people, aroused to enthusiasm by his presence, have called him out, he has in the briefest possible manner thanked them, and excused himself, or called upon some friend to respond for him. There is no danger of his making speeches, under any circumstances, which would compromise himself; but in view of the speech-making of Mr, <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00165.01053" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00165.01054" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s silence is a virtue more precious than gold.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1347"/>By his discreet reticence, <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0063.0011.00165.01055" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> has avoided many embarrassments which a more loquacious and demonstrative man might have experienced in the atmosphere of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 4" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>; and, in avoiding embarrassments, he has also saved the country from the excitement and alarm which the ever-changing rumors of his sayings and opinions might produce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1348"/>But if he knows when to be silent, he knows also when and where, and to whom, he can talk frankly and without reserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1349"/>And his views and opinions thus expressed harmonize fully, and always, with the conduct and acts <pb id="p.166" n="166"/>which have proved his devotion to the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1350"/>He is, in words as well as deeds, a firm, unhesitating supporter of Congress in its reconstruction policy, and a strenuous opponent of executive usurpation and disregard of law.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1351"/>Though retiring and undemonstrative in manner, he is by no means repulsive or inaccessible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1352"/>On the contrary, he is easily approached, and is courteous and pleasant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1353"/>But the citadel of his thoughts and purposes he does not yield either to the bold assaults of brazen inquisitors, or to the wary approaches of cunning diplomatists.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1354"/>Of all the distinguished officers in the army, <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00166.01056" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> has always been the most unostentatious and unpretending in appearance and manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1355"/>He is careless, but not slovenly in his dress, and is so devoid of any air of importance, that but for the <num value="4">four</num> stars upon his shoulder-straps, no <num value="1">one</num> would suppose he was more than a hard-worked quartermaster's subordinate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1356"/>In the winter of <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, shortly before his final and triumphant campaign, while in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 4" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, he visited the <rs>Capitol</rs>, and was received with becoming respect by the members of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1357"/>But so quiet and modest was his deportment, that when he retired from the <rs type="place">Senate chamber</rs>, a Democratic senator declared that <quote>a gross mistake had been made in appointing <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00166.01057" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> lieutenant general, for, in his opinion, there was not a second lieutenant of the <orgName n="Home Guard" type="militia">home guard</orgName> of his state who did not <q direct="unspecified">cut a bigger swell</q> than this man who had just left their presence!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1358"/>Such is his modesty and simplicity of demeanor on all occasions, except when at the very front he gives orders on the field of battle; and then <pb id="p.167" n="167"/>his energy and determination assert themselves above his modesty and usual quiet.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1359"/>During the war there was no parade about his headquarters, which was no more pretending in appearance or arrangement than a colonel's, while his <quote>headquarters train</quote> was often the smallest in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1360"/>In the winter of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">5</year></dateStruct> he lived in a small log-house on the banks of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James</placeName>, sleeping on a common <rs n="camp cot" type="product">camp cot</rs>, and eating with his staff at a table furnished with such simple food as <quote>roast beef, pork and beans, <q direct="unspecified">hard tack,</q> and coffee.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1361"/>No body-guard ever accompanied him simply for display, and he never made a show of good-looking, well-dressed, and formal orderlies about his headquarters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1362"/>The same simplicity he continues in his position as general of the army, at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 4" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1363"/>While not wholly negligent of the proprieties of life and of his office, he discards all useless display, and seems to deprecate all unnecessary formalities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1364"/>No punctilious etiquette is necessary in order to reach him; and no omission of customary form would call down his wrath on the head of any careless or ignorant offender, though some brigadier generals have in that way manifested their importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1365"/>In truth, his whole style and bearing afford an example of <hi rend="italics">republican simplicity</hi> remarkable in a successful military commander, but not inconsistent with true dignity, nor unbecoming in the high office he now holds, or the higher office which awaits him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1366"/>But <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0063.0011.00167.01058" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> is human.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1367"/>Though possessing a genius for command in war, and sterling qualities which fit him for high executive duties, and inspire the <pb id="p.168" n="168"/>confidence of the people, he is not an immaculate hero.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1368"/>He has <num value="2">two</num> weaknesses: he loves to smoke a good cigar, and he loves to drive good horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1369"/>There are some persons to whom even these weaknesses, in a man like <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00168.01059" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, commend themselves more than rigid virtues; and there are few who, while they appreciate his high qualities and well-balanced character, will like him any the less for such tokens of a genial humanity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1370"/>He is an inveterate smoker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1371"/>He smokes on almost all occasions when there is not an absolute impropriety in the indulgence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1372"/>And sometimes the force of habit has been so strong that it was necessary to remind him of the propriety of laying aside his cigar; as once, when he visited the <rs>Capitol</rs>, and was about to enter the <rs type="place">Senate chamber</rs> as the most distinguished guest of the <name>Senate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1373"/>So on more than <num value="1">one</num> occasion the guard over ammunition wagons has been obliged to repeat to him the orders, <quote>No smoking allowed here, sir!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1374"/>Like a gentleman and a soldier he always good-naturedly complied with such suggestions, whether there is danger of a social explosion or an explosion of gun-powder.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1375"/>Smoking, with <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00168.01060" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, acts as a sedative rather than as a stimulant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/>During the war, in the most trying times of anxiety, while awaiting the result of movements vital to success, and in the most exciting moments of battle, he smoked incessantly, and, to all out-ward appearances, as calmly as if his mind were not burdened with the heavy responsibilities and duties of his position and the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1377"/>He smoked while laying his plans and consulting his officers in his tent, and while, on the battle-field, he watched the eventful contest <pb id="p.169" n="169"/>and gave his orders for skilful manoeuvres or for the decisive charge.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1378"/>With smoking he sometimes combined the <rs>Yankee</rs> habit of <quote>whittling</quote> when deep in thought or anxiously awaiting results; and in the <rs>Wilderness</rs> is a tree which he industriously hacked with his penknife while the great battle raged, as if smoking alone were not enough to keep the outward man quiet while his mind was occupied with the great events around him, and the great purposes within.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1379"/>So, in front of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> he smoked and whittled while watching the mounting of some guns in an important position, utterly regardless of the bullets of the enemy's sharp-shooters which whistled about him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1380"/>As for his love for driving good horses, it is what might be expected of <num value="1">one</num> whose earliest trait was a love for, and command over, a horse.. That trait was developed so early in his boyhood, that it must have been born in him, and is not the result of education or association.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1381"/>He knows a good horse, and knows how to drive <num value="1">one</num>; and he has too much humanity to abuse the animal he loves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1382"/>He is said to be <num value="1">one</num> of the best riders in the army, as might be expected from his early habit of riding, though his physique does not render him the most showy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1383"/>In these times of peace, he prefers to ride in his carriage and drive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1384"/>If once or twice he has driven a little faster than the snail-pace gait which municipal laws allow, he was simply up with the times; and when some vigilant policeman, prompted by fun or malice, complained of him for violating an ordinance against fast-driving, with his usual deference for law, he modestly acknowledged his error, and promptly paid his fine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1385"/><pb id="p.170" n="170"/></p> 
<p>It has been alleged that he has a more serious weakness, which would be less pardonable in the eyes of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1386"/>At various times during the war, malignant enemies charged that he was grossly intemperate in his habits; and since he became, by his acts, identified with the party which seeks to reap the just fruits of victory over a wicked rebellion, Copperhead presses have asserted, or meanly insinuated, the same charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1387"/>No allusion would be made here to such accusations but for the gross injustice which has been done him, in thus seeking to create a prejudice against him in the minds of a large number of people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1388"/>It is sufficient to say, that those who know him best, who have been most intimately associated with him during the war and since, pronounce such charges utterly false; and that gentlemen, earnest in the cause of temperance, have satisfied themselves that there is no foundation for the assertions and insinuations derogatory to his character in this respect, but that he is a man whose temperance cannot justly be called in question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1389"/>Such charges originated in personal or political enmity, and have been encouraged and circulated through total misapprehension of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0063.0011.00170.01061" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s temperament and manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1390"/>They are the mean and malicious inventions of those who, during the war, hated him for his victories; those who have always sympathized with the rebels whom he conquered, or those who have supported the policy of the man who publicly disgraced the country when he became <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice-President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1391"/>Narrow prejudice and ignorance, which are ever ready to misapprehend, have given credit and circulation to the libel; but it is hone the less a libel, unsupported by any evidence worthy of belief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/>Quiet and retiring in his appearance, there is yet an air of reserved power in his look and manner which his career has abundantly proved that he possesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1394"/>He is of medium height, rather under than over the average standard, and has a very slight stoop of the shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1395"/>With all his retiring and modest expression, and absence of pretension of every sort, there is in his manner a quiet dignity, and a courteous but unceremonious bearing, becoming his position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1396"/>He has, too, a pleasant smile; and at times a keen glance in his gray eyes tells how closely he observes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1397"/>He can give a cordial greeting to a guest; but his very look seems to read the motives of men, and inform him when to close his heart and his thoughts against sycophants and selfish schemers.
