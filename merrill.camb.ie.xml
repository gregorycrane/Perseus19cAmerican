<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>This is not a guide book in the ordinary sense of that term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>But it does take the reader into the life of <persName n="Cambridge,,,,," id="n0224.0002.00008.00004" reg="mostcommon:Cambridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Cambridge</surname></persName> and makes known to him something of the past and the present of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Any <num value="1">one</num> should feel more at home here after reading these pages, and he can readily find where his life might be joined to the common life and be enriched by it while he imparts to it of his own force.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The extension of the town has been steady and rapid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The hamlet which held so large a place in the colonial life has constantly advanced to the city whose influence is felt through the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>To those who have watched this growth, and shared in it, it has been of great interest to mark the appearance of new institutions, of new forms of work, of new endeavors for the general advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The city must have been poorer than she knew before the <name>Library</name> and Hospital were built, and the societies formed which are now so prominent and so efficient for good.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>It is right that here a prominent place should be given to the organization under whose direction this book has been prepared, and is now given to the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The <placeName key="tgn,7013528;tgn,7013527;tgn,7011980;tgn,7010874;tgn,2120866;tgn,2078704" n="0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7013528;cambridge city, wayne, indiana,Wayne,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7013527;cambridge, middlesex, massachusetts,Middlesex,Massachusetts,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7011980;cambridgeshire,england,united kingdom,europe,England,United Kingdom,Europe;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7010874;cambridge,cambridgeshire,england,united kingdom,europe,Cambridgeshire,England,United Kingdom,Europe;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,2120866;cambridge, wisconsin,Dane,Wisconsin,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,2078704;cambridge, guernsey, ohio,Guernsey,Ohio,United States,North and Central America" reg="cambridge city, wayne, indiana,Wayne,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;cambridge, middlesex, massachusetts,Middlesex,Massachusetts,United States,North and Central America;cambridgeshire,england,united kingdom,europe,England,United Kingdom,Europe;cambridge,cambridgeshire,england,united kingdom,europe,Cambridgeshire,England,United Kingdom,Europe;cambridge, wisconsin,Dane,Wisconsin,United States,North and Central America;cambridge, guernsey, ohio,Guernsey,Ohio,United States,North and Central America">Cambridge</placeName> <orgName n="Young Women's Christian Association" type="association">Young Women's Christian Association</orgName> deserves the place which it holds in the confidence and esteem of all who know its work, which would be more widely known and admired but for the modesty of those who are doing it. The number of workers is not very large, their rooms are not conspicuous, there is no parade of methods or results, there are few appeals for money, so that the <name>Association</name> is less before the eyes and in the minds of the people than it ought to be. It has all the quietness which marks everything that is done in <placeName key="tgn,7013528;tgn,7013527;tgn,7011980;tgn,7010874;tgn,2120866;tgn,2078704" n="0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7013528;cambridge city, wayne, indiana,Wayne,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7013527;cambridge, middlesex, massachusetts,Middlesex,Massachusetts,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7011980;cambridgeshire,england,united kingdom,europe,England,United Kingdom,Europe;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7010874;cambridge,cambridgeshire,england,united kingdom,europe,Cambridgeshire,England,United Kingdom,Europe;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,2120866;cambridge, wisconsin,Dane,Wisconsin,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,2078704;cambridge, guernsey, ohio,Guernsey,Ohio,United States,North and Central America" reg="cambridge city, wayne, indiana,Wayne,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;cambridge, middlesex, massachusetts,Middlesex,Massachusetts,United States,North and Central America;cambridgeshire,england,united kingdom,europe,England,United Kingdom,Europe;cambridge,cambridgeshire,england,united kingdom,europe,Cambridgeshire,England,United Kingdom,Europe;cambridge, wisconsin,Dane,Wisconsin,United States,North and Central America;cambridge, guernsey, ohio,Guernsey,Ohio,United States,North and Central America">Cambridge</placeName>, and this is naturally enhanced by the womanly reserve which is content to abide in stillness and work without observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>This is admirable and no <num value="1">one</num> would change it. But the <name>Association</name> should be better known, which is <pb id="p.-009" n="-009"/> another way of saying it should have more honor among men, and should be enabled to enlarge and perfect its work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It would be difficult to overestimate the importance of the associations for young men. When these had proved their efficiency, it was certain that similar organizations for young women would be formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The spirit and wisdom which created the earlier form of service were sure to advance to this which was equally needed and equally promising.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The influence of the association for young women is manifold and in every way it is helpful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The young woman who comes to the city and is a stranger here, can find <num value="1">one</num> place which belongs to her. There she will meet others who can direct her to a home and assist her in beginning her new life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>She can visit the rooms which have been opened for her when she will, and find there a quiet seat, with books and papers and friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>She can learn under good teachers that which will be useful to her. She can study books if she will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>She can learn to sing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>She will be taught to cut a dress, to trim a hat, to make a loaf of bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>She can study the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> and receive wise religious counsel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>She can find amusement for a leisure hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>To the many these things are proffered &mdash; to those who have homes and to strangers within the gates.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Younger girls can learn the simple processes of domestic life for the benefit of their households, and for their furnishing as they go out into the larger world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Indeed, so far as may be, the <name>Association</name> offers a home with its security, its refinement, its friendship, its instruction, its mutual assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>With a liberal constitution, broad enough for all who call themselves Christians, the women of many churches of many names join in these labors of love and joy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>I am left free to say what I will in this introduction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>But I am glad to commend this Association to the active and generous confidence of all who have time which they can use in its work, or money which they can give for its enlargement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The Association should have a house of its own. It should be a building large enough and good enough for the admirable work which is to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It should have ample <num value="12">XII</num> <pb id="p.-010" n="-010"/> rooms and all the appliances which it can use. Happy is that person who can thus endow an institution of immediate and increasing beneficence.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>Having been requested to write a few lines for this book, I <quote>lend a hand</quote> and cheerfully jot down a few memories which may refresh those of others among my earliest friends.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>In all my childish recollections, from <dateStruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></dateStruct> on toward the forties, nothing seems to linger more persistently than the frequent journeys down <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address> to <placeName reg="Ma'am Rand's store">Ma'am Rand's store</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>This was kept by a sunny-faced, pleasant-voiced woman, who always addressed me as <quote>Dear life, dear soul,</quote> from whose hand in exchange for my copper cents, I received many a sugar heart, either <rs type="color">white</rs> or <rs type="color">red</rs> as I preferred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>There were jumping-jacks, too, of brilliant colors; open-work pewter baskets with covers, for <measure n="4d." type="currency"><num value="4">four</num>-pence</measure> ha'penny; pewter frying-pans with a green and a blue fish in each (always the <num value="2">two</num>, side by side); jews-harps of various sizes; little churns, in which I many a time made about a teaspoonful of butter for my dolls' table, and which in imagination I can still taste, it being strongly and horribly flavored with the pine churn; molasses gibralters and tiny peppermints dropped on paper; jointed dolls with smooth black painted heads, and high yellow combs, all the way from <measure n="2cents" type="currency">two cents</measure> to a ninepence in price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>The children of to-day would be puzzled to give the value in those old times of a fourpence and a ninepence, representing then <num value="6.25">six and a quarter</num> and <measure n="12.5cents" type="currency">twelve and a half cents</measure>. <pb id="p.78" n="78"/> What would they think to be told when purchasing goods that the price was <quote><num value="2">two</num> and thrippence,</quote> <quote><num value="3">three</num> and ninepence</quote> or <quote><num value="4">four</num> and sixpence</quote> ? We older children remember the prices as <num value="37.5">thirty-seven and a half</num>, <num value="62.5">sixty-two and a half</num> and <measure n="75cents" type="currency">seventy-five cents</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>I think with actual pity of the children of the present generation who have no remembrance of such a store, with a bell which jingled merrily as the door opened, to call <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="2">two</num> sisters from a back room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>It is next to being without a remembrance of a grandmother's home in the country, where the hollyhocks stood near the open windows, and the bees flew in and out, and the white floors were sanded, and the rows of shining tins full of milk looked so inviting, and the fruit cake smelt so sweet in the high cupboards, with a big wooden <quote>button,</quote> as it was called, to fasten the doors instead of a lock.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>The <num value="2">two</num> sisters who kept the store where I loved to linger, were regular attendants at the old <placeName reg="Orthodox Church">Orthodox Church</placeName> on <address><street n="Norfolk street">Norfolk street</street></address>, where <persName n="Stearns,Reverend,William,A.,," id="n0224.0009.00078.00340" reg="default:Stearns,William,A.,,"><roleName n="Reverend">Rev.</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Stearns</surname></persName> preached faithfully for many years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>My father used to assist in <quote>taking up the collection,</quote> and always said if everyone should give as generously in proportion as these women, the results would be astonishing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/><persName><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <foreName>Abigail</foreName></persName> usually wore in the house a buff muslin turban, but for church the bonnets were something to attract attention, being made of black satin lined with yellow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>Immense bows of broad gauze ribbon were placed between the crown which resembled a tin quart measure, and the front which was like a large tunnel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>These bonnets were worn long after the fashion had passed away and given place to the small <quote>cottage bonnet</quote> or other <pb id="p.79" n="79"/> forms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>What a bonanza <num value="1">one</num> of them would be now!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>Also a fourpence ha'penny or a ninepence!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>School memories crowd upon me too: <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> a private <num value="1">one</num> kept by <persName n="Pratt,Miss,Caroline,,," id="n0224.0009.00079.00341" reg="default:Pratt,Caroline,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <foreName>Caroline</foreName> <surname>Pratt</surname></persName>, then the public school, taught by <persName n="Ford,Miss,,,," id="n0224.0009.00079.00342" reg="mostcommon:Ford,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Ford</surname></persName>; and another by <persName n="Seymour,Miss,Almira,,," id="n0224.0009.00079.00343" reg="default:Seymour,Almira,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <foreName>Almira</foreName> <surname>Seymour</surname></persName>, who <dateStruct value="-05-1"><day reg="1">one</day> <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> <time>Day</time>, formed a procession of her scholars, and marched through several streets, preceding them as the <quote><rs type="role" reg="Queen">Queen</rs> of the may,</quote> with a long green barge veil hanging down at her back, and a wreath of flowers on her head.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>Perhaps that dusty march was responsible for my change of schools, as I was sent then to a private school kept by <persName n="Gibson,Miss,Nancy,,," id="n0224.0009.00079.00344" reg="default:Gibson,Nancy,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <foreName>Nancy</foreName> <surname>Gibson</surname></persName> in the rear part of a chapel on <address><street n="Austin street">Austin street</street></address>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>I loved him, even though he inflicted many an indignity upon me, by causing me to follow him while he slowly moved through the seats of the boys' side, mending their quill-pens or filling their inkstands, thereby mortifying greatly my sweet elder sister who never did anything wrong; and all &mdash; for what?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>The <orgName n="Peabody Museum" type="museum">Peabody Museum</orgName> may be called the laboratory of a new science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>There is a sense in which all our modern science is new, yet most of the sciences have been pursued with some success since the <rs>Middle Ages</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>The study of anthropology in its different branches, however, was scarcely thought of until this century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>History was a record of wars and kings and public events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>We are but just beginning to realize that there is no study so interesting as that of man, especially in his social developmentt.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>Early in this century, some interest was manifested in discoveries of prehistoric human remains in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>In our own country, stone arrow heads turned up by the farmer's plough, and the pottery and other contents of the mysterious mounds in the <rs type="place">Mississippi valleys</rs> awakened some curiosity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>Collections were made; yet there was so little <pb id="p.118" n="118"/> general and intelligent interest in these remains, that in <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct> an excellent collection of articles made by the <rs type="place">Mound</rs>-builders was suffered to pass into <name>English</name> hands.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>Then a change took place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>These relics became matter not only for curiosity-seekers, but for serious study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>People began to recognize that a forgotten past might be partly restored through these fragments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>We cannot know who were the kings of these people or what the results of their battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>We cannot know of their statesmen and political triumphs,--if so be that there were statesmen and politics among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>In short their history, in the old-fashioned sense, is sealed to us. What can we learn?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>For <num value="1">one</num> thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>we may learn something of the antiquity of man. If the geologist tells us that the gravel from which certain stone tools are dug was deposited a certain number of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of years ago, the man who made them must be of similar antiquity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>Of course the geologist may be mistaken, and so our estimates of the age of man must be open to revision.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>Again, we may find out something about the habits and skill of the people of these remote ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>We may watch the development of man from age to age, seeing hown he gradually improves in manual skill and intellectual forethought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>We may at some time be able to trace a race history through these broken relics of past ages.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>Again, we may preserve the skeletons that are exhumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>These, especially the skulls, are valuable race indices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>Perhaps we may be able to establish the continuity of some of these people with some modern races.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>Collections were begun, but collectors were feeling their way, and hardly knew how to arrange or study their material.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>Although the original building has twice been added to, great quantities of material are packed away out of sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>In the cases around the edge is a somewhat diversified exhibition &mdash; masks from New Guinea, wax models of different tribes of Indians and Esquimaux, skeletons <pb id="p.120" n="120"/> of different races, implements of war and peace, articles used in religious ceremonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>These are mostly modern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>There are photographs, too, of the places whence some of these came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>Photographs, indeed, are a feature of this Museum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>On every floor, in almost every room, are photographs of the regions represented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>In the lecture hall, also, is a model of the serpent mound of <placeName reg="Hamilton, Ohio, United States" key="tgn,1002441">Hamilton County, Ohio</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>Especial attention is given to North American tribes, although articles from Central and <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName> are welcomed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>For the study of the race history of our own continent, it is desirable, even necessary, to have articles for comparison from other parts of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>It would not be desirable here to catalogue the curious, interesting and instructive exhibitions <pb id="p.121" n="121"/> which have been so skilfully displayed in the different rooms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>Objects are placed in the cases in strict geographical order and the modern is separated from the ancient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>The labels give account of the date and circumstances of finding the different articles, and photographs of the regions to which they belong are near at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>Anyone can go and study for himself in these carefully arranged rooms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>If the articles on exhibition are not numerous enough, the reserve stores, also carefully arranged and labelled, may be examined by the student.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>The study of these relics has only begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>What we have is incompletely understood, and many gaps remain to be filled by future discoveries.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>Go from room to room and from floor to floor, and see for yourself the suggestions as to mode of living and religion given by the long buried articles now opened to the light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>Study the mound-builders and the cliff-dwellers and other early inhabitants of our land, through their handiwork now revealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>Examine their tools, their weapons, their pottery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>What points of resemblance can be discovered between modern and ancient?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>Are there any indications of continuity of race?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>Can signs be found of their connection with any other tribes in other parts of the world?</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>No department of <orgName n="Harvard University" type="university">Harvard University</orgName> is more worthy of its pride than the <rs>Astronomical Observatory</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>Founded only <measure n="55years" type="date">fifty-five years</measure> ago, it has from the beginning been <num value="1">one</num> of the foremost contributors to the marvellous growth of astronomical science during the latter half of this century.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>Its beginning was humble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>The fine old house on the corner of <address><street n="Harvard Street">Harvard</street></address> and <address><street n="Quincy Street">Quincy</street></address> streets, lately the home of <persName n="Peabody,Doctor,A.,P.,," id="n0224.0011.00133.00442" reg="default:Peabody,A.,P.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Peabody</surname></persName> and now occupied by <persName n="Palmer,Professor,,,," id="n0224.0011.00133.00443" reg="mostcommon:Palmer,Alice,Freeman,,:1"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Palmer</surname></persName>, was its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>The round cupola on top is a relic of this period, for it was built to support an astronomical dome to shelter the small telescope then used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> recorded observation was on the evening of <dateStruct value="1839-12-31"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="31">31</day>, <year reg="1839">1839</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> director, <persName n="Bond,Professor,W.,C.,," id="n0224.0011.00133.00444" reg="default:Bond,W.,C.,,"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Bond</surname></persName>, was appointed the following <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>The Observatory might have struggled long with its inferior equipment, for it had aroused no popular interest, such as is necessary in order to secure funds for any costly enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>But when the great comet of <dateStruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></dateStruct> appeared and frightened the ignorant, it proved a harbinger of good for the industrious little observatory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>Everybody's curiosity was aroused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>People regretted that at <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> there was no instrument of sufficient power to study it and other heavenly bodies to advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/><pb id="p.134" n="134"/> Accordingly a meeting of prominent men was called in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, with the result that sufficient money was raised to purchase a telescope of the largest size.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>In <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> of that very year work was begun on the foundations of the great stone pier on which such a telescope must be supported; and from that day to this, the observatory has not lacked the best of modern equipments.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>It was an exciting day when the completed telescope was mounted on <placeName reg="Observatory Hill, Marquette, Wisconsin" key="tgn,2555048">Observatory Hill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>It was the largest refracting telescope in the world save <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>That other <num value="1">one</num> was of the same aperture (<measure n="15inches" type="distance">fifteen inches</measure>) and had been ordered at the same time with ours for the observatory at Pulkowa.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>In these days telescopes of <measure n="25inches" type="distance">twenty-five inches</measure> and over are not uncommon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>Our <measure n="15inch" type="distance">fifteen inch</measure> instrument would look like a pigmy by the side of the <measure n="40inch" type="distance">forty inch</measure> <persName n="Yerkes,,,,," id="n0224.0011.00134.00446" reg="mostcommon:Yerkes,nomatch:0"><surname>Yerkes</surname></persName> telescope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>Yet even at the present day the <rs>Harvard</rs> instrument is remarkably fine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>Its clearness and defining power are unusual, and for delicate work requiring great accuracy it is unsurpassed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>Let us, in imagination, make a visit to the <name>Observatory</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>We can go past its back door on the electric cars, for this locality, once so retired, has been invaded by the trolley, and only the thick hedge of evergreen trees prevents serious embarrassment from the electric lights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>Our pleasanter way will be to leave the car at <address><street n="Garden street">Garden street</street></address> and walk up the hill under the grateful shade of magnificent old trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>We have the grounds on our left for some time before we reach the entrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>Inside, we find it like a park.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>Still walking up hill we approach the <name>Observatory</name>, in front of which is the pleasant home of <persName n="Pickering,Professor,,,," id="n0224.0011.00134.00447" reg="mostcommon:Pickering,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Pickering</surname></persName>, the director.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>Above and behind towers the great dome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>Near <pb id="p.135" n="135"/> by is a smaller dome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>Off to the right is a substantial brick building evidently belonging to the observatory; and on reaching the top of the hill we see that behind, in the back yard so to speak, is a little cluster of domes, each surmounting a tiny building of its own.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>Of course our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> desire is to see the large telescope, around whose pier the building was originally raised as a shelter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>After climbing a few stairs, we find ourselves in a large circular room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>Walls and ceiling are joined in <num value="1">one</num> great curve,--in fact, they form the dome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>This dome can be revolved on its <quote>ball-bearings,</quote> spheres of bronze which run in a circular track around the edge of the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>We do not notice this at once, however, for in front of us rises the magic instrument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>It is a ponderous mass, and we question whether so great a weight can be controlled conveniently; but we find that it moves at a touch.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>There are certain difficulties in the use of so large a telescope, even if it is thus easily handled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>In a large telescope, the apparent motion of the stars is so magnified that those at any distance from the pole seem fairly to rush across the field of view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>Add to this the fact that the field of a large telescope is very small, and <persName n="Newcomb,Professor,Simon,,," id="n0224.0011.00135.00448" reg="default:Newcomb,Simon,,,"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <foreName>Simon</foreName> <surname>Newcomb</surname></persName> may be understood when he says that with a telescope and nothing else <num value="1">one</num> might spend a whole winter evening looking for Sirius, and on finding him, lose him at once and irrevocably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>This difficulty of finding and keeping stars is obviated by the <quote>equatorial</quote> mounting, as well as by the <quote>finders,</quote> telescopes of low power and large field attached to the tube. \When a star is found, the instrument can be clamped so that it can be moved only in <num value="1">one</num> direction &mdash; that of the star's apparent <pb id="p.136" n="136"/> motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>As fast as the star leaves the field, therefore, a touch of the instrument will bring it into view again.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>Obviously, however, if the star's apparent motion were very great, it would take most of the observer's attention to keep it in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>Any refined observation would thus be rendered impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>To remedy this difficulty, clock work is attached to the instrument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>This is so arranged that the motion of the telescope is exactly equal and opposite to that of the earth in rotation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>The observer is thus enabled to study and measure at his leisure, without a thought but that instrument and star are alike stationary.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>When equipped with the best of mounting and the most perfect of clock work, with stable foundations and adequate protection from the weather, the telescope might seem complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>But it is poised <measure n="13feet" type="distance">thirteen feet</measure> above the floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>The eye piece has a sweep of <num value="90">ninety</num> degrees and is far out of reach most of the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>Without some means of getting to it, the instrument would be practically useless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>It was for <persName n="Bond,Professor,,,," id="n0224.0011.00136.00449" reg="nearbymention:Bond,W.,C.,,"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Bond</surname></persName> to meet this difficulty, and he devised the observing chair which is still in use. In appearance it is rather a formidable looking piece of machinery, but it is simple in use. By its means the observer can convey himself easily and rapidly to any desired part of the dome.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>It may be well for us to remind ourselves that an astronomer would consider it a waste of time simply to sit and look through the tube of the telescope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>Unless he wants <num value="0.5">a half</num> hour's amusement, he will attach to it <num value="1">one</num> of the little instruments which are shown us, for measuring minute distances and angles, or for measuring or analyzing light.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>The <placeName reg="Harvard Station, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2379301">Harvard</placeName> telescope is much used for measuring <pb id="p.137" n="137"/> the comparative light of stars, or other heavenly bodies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>Photometry, as it is called, is a specialty at the <rs>Harvard Observatory</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>Many photometers have been devised here, each adapted to some particular kind of work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>A large variety of these is used with the large telescope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>If none of the photometers in use seems to be exactly what is wanted for a particular piece of work, <persName n="Pickering,Professor,,,," id="n0224.0011.00137.00450" reg="mostcommon:Pickering,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Pickering</surname></persName> or <num value="1">one</num> of the staff invents a new <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num> made was called A, and for a long time each new <num value="1">one</num> received the succeeding letter, until the alphabet was exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>Now there is no special designation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>There is another instrument much used with the great telescope and that is the micrometer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>This is a device for measuring very small distances and is much used in the study of double stars.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>Before leaving the dome, we must read the list of donors printed on the walls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>We ought also to step out on the balconies from which we have a fine view of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> and surrounding towns by day, and by night an unobstructed view of the heavens.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>Down stairs is another instrument of the very greatest importance,--the meridian circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>This is a telescope of fair size, large we should say if we had not just come from the <measure n="15inch" type="distance">fifteen inch</measure> equatorial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>Its peculiarity is in the mounting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>It turns on a rod pointing <name>east</name> and <name>west</name>, the ends of which are supported on heavy stone piers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>It can therefore revolve freely in the plane of the meridian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>Any star may be observed just as it crosses the meridian, but at no other time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>Attached to the instrument is a large circle, very delicately graduated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>The exact angle at which the telescope is turned to observe any star, is shown on this circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>Thus the star's height above the horizon is obtained, and <pb id="p.138" n="138"/> from this is obtained directly the declination, or distance from the celestial equator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>The time of a star's transit is signalled, by means of an electric transmitter in the operator's hand, to a chronograph which records the beats of the astronomical clock in the basement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>This chronograph was invented by <persName n="Bond,Professor,,,," id="n0224.0011.00138.00451" reg="nearbymention:Bond,W.,C.,,"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Bond</surname></persName> and was very quickly adopted in other observatories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>The time observed gives the star's right ascension which corresponds to terrestrial longitude, as declination does to terrestrial latitude.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>The meridian circle is the most accurate means of obtaining the exact position of stars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>These positions are recorded in the star catalogue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>It is also the most accurate means of obtaining true time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>Until very recently <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> obtained its true noon from this observatory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>Now, however, the time is telegraphed daily from the observatory at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and the <rs>Harvard</rs> time service has been discontinued.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>A beautiful little brass instrument in the same room, not more than <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> high, is a transit instrument made in <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>It can be used, like the meridian circle, for obtaining the time of meridian transit of stars, but not for declinations, as there is no circle attached to it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>The astronomical clock is in the basement, and is interesting to look at with its <num value="3">three</num> dials, <num value="1">one</num> for each of the <num value="3">three</num> hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>It is regulated to sidereal time; that is, it makes its round of <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> between <num value="2">two</num> successive passages of the same star over the meridian, thus gaining about <measure n="4minutes" type="date">four minutes</measure> a day over solar time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>This clock is, perhaps, the most important instrument in the observatory, for it is essential to the proper use of <persName n="Zzz,,,,," id="n0224.0011.00138.00452" reg="mostcommon:Zzz,nomatch:0"><surname>Zzz</surname></persName> the other instruments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>A fine new clock <persName n="Zzz,,,,," id="n0224.0011.00138.00453" reg="mostcommon:Zzz,nomatch:0"><surname>Zzz</surname></persName> <pb id="p.139" n="139"/> has been presented to the <name>Observatory</name> recently which will undoubtedly make some of the work easier, possibly even more accurate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>On our way out of this building we must step into the library for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>Here are between <num value="7">seven</num> and <num value="8000">eight thousand</num> bound volumes and nearly <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> pamphlets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>A considerable proportion of these books and pamphlets contain records of observations made at different times all over the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>The Harvard Annals alone fill a long row of thick quarto volumes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>Those dry looking pages of statistics contain many interesting secrets for future discovery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>Now let us see what are the other buildings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>A good sized wooden house at a little distance, serves as a shop, and there are a number of small buildings scattered about, most of them domed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>Most of these contain photographic instruments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>Off to the right, a little way down the slope, is a brick building used for the storage and examination of photographic plates.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>Within a few years, photography of the heavens has come to have a leading place as a means of astronomical research.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>At <placeName reg="Harvard Station, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2379301">Harvard</placeName>, several telescopes are kept busy with photographic work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>The advantages of this method are obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>Unlike the human eye, so soon wearied, the photographic plate sees the more, the longer it is exposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>There is reason to believe that if a telescope could be kept pointed night and day, with perfect accuracy, upon any source of light anywhere in the universe, it would finally record it on the sensitive plate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>Nearly all kinds of astronomical work usually accomplished by visual observations can be done more or less admirably, or can be assented greatly, by the photographic telescope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>For instance, the <pb id="p.140" n="140"/> comparative light of stars can be studied from photographic plates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>The meridian photometer<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/> 
<p>Erratum.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>At the top of <ref n="page 140">page 140</ref>, omit the sentence beginning <quote>The meridian photometer.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>It is true that stellar magnitudes are conveniently and accurately derived from measurements on photographic plates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>The meridian photometer, however, is not a photographic instrument, but is used for the visual determination of stellar magnitudes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>It is an important part of the equipment of the <name>Observatory</name>.</p></note> is an ingenious device for doing this in the most convenient manner, and the results are surprisingly accurate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>Again, photography is an easy means of obtaining excellent charts of the heavens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>These photographic telescopes bring into view stars that cannot be seen by the eve, even with the most powerful telescopes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>Thus we have a record of every star in the heavens, down to the faintest of which we can be made aware.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>The positions of the stars cannot be so accurately determined by these charts as by the meridian circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>But they are accurate enough for some purposes and, what is most important, they give us a record of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of stars that never could have been observed singly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>The plates of the same region taken with the same telescope at different times may be compared and any changes noted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>The new star in Auriga, which drew so much attention <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> ago, was found to have printed itself upon <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Harvard</rs> plates weeks before its discovery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most important uses of photography is in spectrum analysis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>It is by means of the spectroscope that the most important advances in modern astronomy have been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/>The rainbow-colored band, crossed by its tale-telling black or bright lines, has let us into the physical secrets of other worlds to a marvellous extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>Here at <placeName reg="Harvard Station, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2379301">Harvard</placeName> the spectra are photographed by placing a prism in front of the object glass of a photographic telescope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1132"/>For this, as the most interesting discovery of the year, the <orgName n="Sciences French Academy" type="academy">French Academy of Sciences</orgName> awarded <persName n="Clark,Mister,,,," id="n0224.0011.00151.00493" reg="nearbymention:Clark,George,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clark</surname></persName> the <name>Lalande</name> medal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/>The telescope was finished in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, but did not go to <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> on account of the breaking out of the <rs>Civil War</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1134"/>From that time the size of the aperture of telescopes has steadily increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1135"/>The <rs>Clarks</rs> have several times been privileged to have in their workshop glasses larger than any before made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1136"/><num value="1">One</num> of the best known of these is the <measure n="26inch" type="distance">twenty-six inch</measure> glass now at the <rs>National Observatory</rs> in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1137"/>This, with its twin, made at the same time and sold into private hands, long held the place of the largest telescope in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1139"/>Again and again, however, this aperture was exceeded until the famous Lick telescope aroused the extraordinary popular interest of a few years ago. The Lick telescope is of <measure n="36inches" type="distance">thirty-six inches</measure> aperture, and promised to hold the first place for many years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1140"/>But the new <orgName n="Chicago University" type="university">Chicago University</orgName> wants to be <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in everything, and so of course wishes to own the largest telescope in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1141"/>The man has been found to make the princely gift, and now (<dateStruct value="1895--"><year reg="1895">1895</year></dateStruct>) the object glasses for the <measure n="40inch" type="distance">forty-inch</measure> <persName n="Yerkes,,,,," id="n0224.0011.00151.00494" reg="mostcommon:Yerkes,nomatch:0"><surname>Yerkes</surname></persName> telescope are lying nearly finished in <persName n="Clark,Mister,,,," id="n0224.0011.00151.00495" reg="nearbymention:Clark,George,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clark</surname></persName>'s workshop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1142"/><placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> people have come to feel that if a telescope of extraordinary proportions is to be made, of course it must have its lenses ground at <persName n="Clark,,,,," id="n0224.0011.00151.00496" reg="nearbymention:Clark,George,B.,,"><surname>Clark</surname></persName>'s.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1143"/>A visit to the modest shop where all this work has been done, is full of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1144"/>Everything is <pb id="p.152" n="152"/> for use, not for show, and there is no attempt to make any tool finer than it need be to meet its purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1145"/>But everything is exactly adapted to its purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1146"/>Almost every stage of telescope making may be seen here usually, from the rough discs to the finished instrument; though at any particular time, some stages of progress may not be exemplified, for telescopes are not turned off by <num value="1000">thousands</num>, like boots and shoes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1147"/>The discs for the lenses come from the manufacturers in flat, square plates of such thickness and diameter as may be needed for telescopes of given sizes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1148"/>The surface is not polished, save at <num value="2">two</num> places on the edges, through which <num value="1">one</num> can look into the glass and out across its greatest diameter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1149"/>So perfect is the clearness, that a thickness of several inches does not seem to obstruct the sight any more than so much air. <persName n="Clark,Mister,,,," id="n0224.0011.00152.00497" reg="nearbymention:Clark,George,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clark</surname></persName>, however, does not accept it as perfect because of this apparent clearness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1150"/>Every disc of optical glass is subjected to numerous tests before being pronounced suitable for use. Flaws that could not be discovered by the eye are searched for with ingenious instruments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1151"/>Very large discs are not sent in this rough, square form, but are rounded and polished over the whole surface.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1152"/>These come very carefully packed, as well they may, for the discs alone, before they have been touched by <persName n="Clark,Mister,,,," id="n0224.0011.00152.00498" reg="nearbymention:Clark,George,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clark</surname></persName>, are, when large, worth <num value="1000">thousands</num> of dollars.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1153"/>After testing the purity of the glass, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> process is the grinding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1154"/>This is begun with very coarse stone and sand until an approximately correct shape is reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1155"/>Then emery of finer and finer quality is used, until the shape is as perfect as it can be made by computation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1156"/>Then the polishing is quickly done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1157"/>and the lens is apparently <pb id="p.153" n="153"/> finished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1158"/>But it is only begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1159"/>The larger part of the work is yet to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1160"/>A perfect object glass cannot be made by theory; it must be tested over and over again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1161"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> tests show the principal defects, which are remedied as they are discovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1162"/>Then the process becomes increasingly delicate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1163"/>Every part of the lens is tested by ingenious devices, and minute corrections are made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1164"/>After months of this sort of work, the glass may be tried out of doors in a temporary frame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1165"/>Then more corrections follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1166"/>As long as <persName n="Clark,Mister,,,," id="n0224.0011.00153.00499" reg="nearbymention:Clark,George,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clark</surname></persName> has a telescope in the shop he feels he can do something to improve it. At this writing, the object glasses for the <name>Yerkes</name> telescope have been practically done for more than a year, yet <persName n="Clark,Mister,,,," id="n0224.0011.00153.00500" reg="nearbymention:Clark,George,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clark</surname></persName> expects to keep them for several months still, making final minute corrections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1167"/>Of course a small lens can be made in a much shorter time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1168"/>The nervous strain of making a large object glass is severe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1169"/><persName n="Clark,Mister,,,," id="n0224.0011.00153.00501" reg="nearbymention:Clark,George,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clark</surname></persName> is not sure that he would undertake to exceed the <measure n="40inch" type="distance">forty-inch</measure> glass, if he should be asked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1170"/>He certainly would refuse unless allowed a voice in the selection of the place where it should be mounted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1171"/>The finest of glasses would be of little use, unless suitably mounted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1172"/>Indeed, the larger and finer the glass, the more imperative is a good mounting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1173"/>So the manufacture of mountings is a very important part of <persName n="Clark,Mister,,,," id="n0224.0011.00153.00502" reg="nearbymention:Clark,George,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clark</surname></persName>'s business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1174"/>A large space is given up to this, and <num value="1">one</num> soon discovers that in its way the work is as delicate as the grinding of the lenses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1175"/>No ordinary machinery or labor can be employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1176"/>Microscopical accuracy must be observed in every part.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1177"/>After looking at the different processes in the manufacture of a telescope, the visitor may be fortunate enough to see a complete telescope mounted <pb id="p.154" n="154"/> before sending to the purchaser.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1178"/>Its value and beauty are likely to be appreciated as would hardly have been possible before understanding something of the long, and delicate, and complicated processes of its manufacture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1179"/>Soon it will be taken apart, packed carefully, and shipped to a place perhaps <num value="1000">thousands</num> of miles distant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1180"/>Other telescopes are in process of manufacture, and will in turn be sent to places near and remote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1181"/>So the unpretentious work-shop supplements the great Observatory, in making <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> <num value="1">one</num> of the scientific centres of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1297"/>About <measure n="17years" type="date">seventeen years</measure> ago there were vague reports abroad to the effect that <orgName n="Harvard College" type="college">Harvard College</orgName> was about to admit women to its classes with men. These reports were, of course, based upon unwarranted rumor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1298"/>For a long time there had been talk on the subject in the papers and in many private circles previous to the centennial year, but no plan had been formed, either on the part of <orgName n="Harvard College" type="college">Harvard College</orgName>, or of anybody else, by which such an end might be attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1299"/>There were <num value="2">two</num> very positive <quote>parties</quote> engaged in the talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1300"/><num value="1">One</num> wished for the admission of women at once, as a right, and the other looked with distaste or even with horror upon such a thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1301"/>It may be stated, indeed, as a fact, that it was at the time impossible for a woman to gain admission to <num value="1">one</num> of the college classes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1302"/>I was not involved in this discussion, but it became a personal matter with me on account of the interest that my wife and I took in a certain young lady at the moment attending <num value="1">one</num> of the schools for girls in <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, who seemed to have reached the limit of the advantages that it offered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1303"/>While we were considering the wants of this young woman we became more and more thoroughly convinced that it was desirable for her to get instruction from the professors of <orgName n="Harvard College" type="college">Harvard College</orgName>, and we were no <pb id="p.184" n="184"/> less thoroughly convinced that she could not get this in the classes of the college, even if it were desirable for a single girl to enter classes comprising many young men. We saw that in whatever way she were taught, she could only get the advantage she needed by some joining of forces with other young women in the same stage of educational progress.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1304"/>After considerable thought I conceived the plan of providing a course of instruction for women by the professors of <orgName n="Harvard College" type="college">Harvard College</orgName>, but outside of the college and without responsibility to it. Such a course would not lead to a degree, but it would give the women who were fitted for it all the training that the degree certified to, and of which it is the seal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1305"/>While I was sure that such a scheme was practicable, and that it might lead to great results, because I was confident that a large body of women longed for the grade of instruction that <orgName n="Harvard College" type="college">Harvard College</orgName> gives, I was not certain that a proposition to begin the work would be favorably received by the professors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1306"/>Some considerations made me feel that their favor might be obtained, but my fears, which were greater than my hopes, restrained me from making a public expression of my desires for a long time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1307"/>While I was thus delaying, I discussed the subject with my wife as we walked through the streets of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> and looked at this house and that which we thought might some day serve as the home for the institution that we had in mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1308"/>Many months passed, and I still found myself in the position of seeking the proper moment to approach some member of the faculty.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1310"/>When we reached home I concluded that the time had <pb id="p.185" n="185"/> arrived, for we heard rumors that a young lady had sought instruction from <num value="3">three</num> different professors, and that she was enjoying in some degree the privileges that we desired for others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1312"/>I therefore determined to bring the matter to the attention of the professors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1314"/>I had arranged a list of the professors who seemed to me desirable to interest, based upon the elective pamphlet of that year, and with many misgivings I pulled the door-bell at <placeName><persName n="Greenough,Professor,,,," id="n0224.0019.00185.00550" reg="mostcommon:Greenough,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Greenough</surname></persName>'s home</placeName> on Appian Way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1315"/>I confess to a sense of relief when I saw a postponement in prospect, and I merely asked <persName n="Greenough,Professor,,,," id="n0224.0019.00185.00551" reg="mostcommon:Greenough,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Greenough</surname></persName> if he would not call at my house on <address><street n="Phillips Place">Phillips Place</street></address> the following evening, with <persName n="Greenough,Mrs.,,,," id="n0224.0019.00185.00552" reg="mostcommon:Greenough,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Greenough</surname></persName>, because I had a very important subject that I wished to discuss.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1317"/>The whole evening was spent in pleasant conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1318"/>We very likely discussed our <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> neighbors, perhaps even the weather, but certainly there was not the smallest reference to the subject that had been so long agitating me.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1322"/>The beginning was favorable beyond our hopes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1323"/>The next step was to find out whether the other professors would look at the matter in the same way that <persName n="Greenough,Professor,,,," id="n0224.0019.00186.00559" reg="mostcommon:Greenough,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Greenough</surname></persName> did, and whether, if they should, the <rs type="place">University</rs> would permit them to give this systematic instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1446"/>Usually some entertainment is provided by the committee, --a concert, tableaux, or a play which occasionally may be said to be literally of the students, by the students, and for the students, for several original plays have been given by members of the club for the exclusive benefit of the students, no outsiders being admitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1454"/>All of these exist primarily for work, but a goodly social element is not lacking, and each club keeps open house at least once a year, when it has for its honored guest some man or woman well known in the world of scholars who speaks to the club on some interesting topic.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1651"/>The term <quote>charities,</quote> or philanthropies if the <name>Greek</name> form is chosen as a trifle more sonorous, has been so loosely used and so often abused by the present and passing generations-like that other noble and long-suffering word, temperance-that it needs to be strictly defined by the writer who would use it specifically without appearing offensively patronizing to certain classes of the community and effusively sentimental to others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1652"/>The derivation of the phrase <hi rend="italics">Charities of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName></hi> ought to show to every <num value="1">one</num> that by it is meant those organizations and activities in our midst whose motive power is <hi rend="italics">love</hi> rather than greed of gain; that this meaning is obscured, overlaid in fact, by a certain stigma which attaches to the technical use of the word, is not the fault of the dignified Latin trisyllable or of the idea back of it, but is caused by the difficulty of apprehending and applying its simple beauty on the part of donors and recipients alike.</p>
