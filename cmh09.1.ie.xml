<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>At the treaty at <placeName reg="Watauga, Carter, Tennessee" key="tgn,2102018">Watauga, Tenn.</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1775-03-"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1775">1775</year></dateStruct>, when the <name>Cherokees</name> sold to the <name>Henderson</name> company for <measure n="10000l." type="pounds"><num value="10000">ten thousand</num> pounds</measure> sterling the greater part of the territory embracing the present <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">State of Kentucky</placeName>, the chief, Dragging Canoe, said there was a dark cloud over that country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Another version is that he said it was <q direct="unspecified">a dark and bloody ground.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>The whites, inquiring the meaning of his reference to a cloud, and fearing it implied an imperfect title, were assured with a stately wave of the hand by the stem chieftain that their title was unquestioned, but that he feared when the purchasers went to take possession the <name>Indians</name> of the north who frequented the land as a hunting ground would shed their blood and resist their occupancy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/><measure n="3days" type="date">Three days</measure> after the conclusion of the treaty, the purchasers, preceded by <persName n="Boone,,Daniel,,," id="n0251.0001.00003.00004" reg="default:Boone,Daniel,,,"><foreName>Daniel</foreName> <surname>Boone</surname></persName> with a small party, started for their newly acquired possessions, and within <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blood was spilled in verification of the chief's ominous warning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>The <rs>Indians</rs> of the north met <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> them almost at the very threshold, thus inaugurating a bloody war which lasted for <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>, and gave to the <rs>State</rs>, which near its close had become a member of the <rs>Union</rs>, the sobriquet of <q direct="unspecified">the dark and bloody ground.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/><placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> holds this title after the lapse of more than a century of statehood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Tradition reaching back beyond <placeName reg="Watauga River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2752758">Watauga</placeName> had represented it as an untenanted expanse of forest and grassy plains in which the <name>Indians</name> of the <name>north</name> and <name>south</name> periodically hunted the buffalo, deer and other game, and across which were beaten war paths by which they were wont to make predatory excursions into the territory each of the other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The aborigines yielded before the march of civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The axe of the pioneer felled the forest, and before a century had passed since <persName n="Boone,,,,," id="n0251.0001.00004.00005" reg="nearbymention:Boone,Daniel,,,"><surname>Boone</surname></persName> blazed away for the <name>Transylvania</name> company more than a <num value="1000000">million</num> souls were dwelling in peace and happiness in the fair land whose natural beauties had been heightened by the skill of the husbandman and the embellishments of modem civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>For a long season, interrupted only by the call to arms in the national defense, the dark cloud of the <rs>Indian</rs> legend seemed dispelled and the war path between the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> obliterated forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>But the fancied security was illusory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>In the very sunshine of a peaceful day the cloud suddenly loomed up on the horizon, and spreading with a blinding gloom, enveloped every home with its pall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/><placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> again became in very deed <q direct="unspecified">the dark and bloody ground.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The war-path was reestab-lished and legions from the <rs>North</rs> and from the <rs>South</rs> threaded the ways which <persName n="Boone,,,,," id="n0251.0001.00004.00006" reg="nearbymention:Boone,Daniel,,,"><surname>Boone</surname></persName> had trod, and crimsoned her soil with their blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The tragedy was heightened by the fate which arrayed father against son, and brother against brother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>There was scacre a home across which the shadow of death did not fall.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/><num value="0.33">A <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> of a century has passed since this deluge of blood swept the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Peace has smoothed the wrinkled brow of war. The passions of strife have cooled into the <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> calm reflection of a philosophic retrospect The discussions born of war have ceased, and the wounds of strife have so far healed as to admit of dispassionate review of the stirring events of that period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>A new generation risen since the treaty of peace was written with the sword at <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName>, has nearly displaced the actors in the great tragedy of the <name n="Confederate States">Confederate</name> struggle, and they and the children of those who bared their bosoms to the storm, are eager to learn something more of the causes of this terrible war and of the heroism it evoked than they can find in the distorted publications of the press or the fireside narratives of its survivors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The history of the great struggle which for <num value="4">four</num> long years shook the continent and made the world stand aghast, has yet to be written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The personal observations of many hundreds of its participants have been printed, and many of the civil and military leaders have prepared volumes of more or less merit; and for many years yet to come these and others to follow will but form the material from the great mass of which, together with the official military records of both sides published by the government, the real history of our civil war will be written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>When the actors shall all have passed away, and when to the narratives of actual participants shall succeed the periods of romance and the drama; when all traces of the war shall have disappeared save the imperishable monuments which will attest the valor of victor and vanquished alike; and when the <num value="2">two</num> sections shall be as thoroughly welded into <num value="1">one</num> as the houses of <persName n="York,,,,," id="n0251.0001.00005.00007" reg="mostcommon:York,nomatch:0"><surname>York</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lancaster,,,,," id="n0251.0001.00005.00008" reg="mostcommon:Lancaster,nomatch:0"><surname>Lancaster</surname></persName> after years of blood or those of the <name>Stuarts</name> and <placeName reg="Hanover, York, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2089058">Hanover</placeName>&mdash;some great mind like that of <persName n="Gibbon,,,,," id="n0251.0001.00005.00009" reg="mostcommon:Gibbon,nomatch:0"><surname>Gibbon</surname></persName> or <persName n="Macaulay,,,,," id="n0251.0001.00005.00010" reg="mostcommon:Macaulay,nomatch:0"><surname>Macaulay</surname></persName> will dispassionately, with the clear perspective of time, collate all this heterogeneous mass of material and give to the world the unbiased truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The South can well await the verdict of prosperity when the evidence thus sifted of prejudice and free from distortions of error or malice shall be philosophically woven <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> into a narrative where only truth shall have a lodgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Meantime as the era of the living actors is fast coming to a close, it behooves every <num value="1">one</num> who can contribute, either from his own observation and experience or a careful study of the record, to the accumulation of such material for the use of such an historian and the instruction of the present and coming generations, to put his offering in tangible shape ere it be too late; for <q direct="unspecified">the night cometh when no man can work.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/></p> 
<p>While, therefore, it is a sacred duty both to the living and the dead for all who love truth for its own sake to aid in making up this record upon which posterity must pass, especially is it the duty of the people of the <rs>South</rs> to marshal the evidence upon which will rest their title to the future respect of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It naturally follows that the victor in a civil war has more ample material for history than the defeated side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Its record makes itself, its archives are intact, its muster rolls carefully preserved in State and Federal capitals, while pride and individual ambition secure the preservation of every incident of real or alleged valor which can be claimed as contributing to the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>On the other hand, the defeated in such a struggle, while as jealous of their good name, even in disaster, too often lack the power of preserving their records.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Official papers become part of the spoils of war. Fire and pillage, added to authorized deportation, deprive them of the most valuable material, leaving in many instances the personal testimony of actual participants as the only adjunct to the scanty record rescued from a common destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>In the present instance, the <rs>South</rs> was, after the war, paralyzed by the mal-administration imposed upon the people and, for many years, more concerned as to whether it would have a future than with the preparation of its past history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>But now, after having won additional title to the admiration of the world by her heroic struggles toward rehabilitation in peace, and having secured as the result of labor <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> and self-denial a fair measure of thrift, and a restoration to full civil equality, the work of marking the graves of her dead with fitting monuments and collecting into permanent form the record of the deeds of her sons begins to assume a practical phase.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>While the duty is enjoined upon the <name>States</name> of the <rs>South</rs> proper whose autonomy has been preserved as actual members of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, it is even more incumbent upon <persName><foreName>Kentuckians</foreName></persName> who survive to see that justice is done in history to their comrades, dead and living, who left their homes and all that makes life sweet to obey the dictates of conscience and vindicate their principles as <name n="God" type="God">God</name> gave them to see their way. They exchanged luxury for want, the certain rank which awaited most of them for private station, home for exile, peace for war, and life for death itself, rather than turn their weapons against a kindred people struggling to maintain their convictions of right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The war has settled adversely to their views many questions; but while the superficial or ignorant may talk of the enormity of the treason which their advocacy implied, the enlightened student knows that in the first place no court has ever pronounced participation in the late war treason; and in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, that if treason could be committed without an overt act, secession as a remedy for wrongs committed by the general government against the reserved rights of the <name>States</name> was, before the war, regarded by no means as such a monstrous doctrine as the resort to arms against it has made it. The very essence of the platform upon which <persName n="Jefferson,,Thomas,,," id="n0251.0001.00007.00011" reg="default:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> was elected, which he inspired, if he did not write, and which was introduced in and passed by the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">general assembly of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName></orgName> in <dateStruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></dateStruct>, had this initial resolution: <q direct="unspecified">Resolved, That the several States composing the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States of America</placeName> are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their general government, but that by compact under the style and title of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> and by <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> amendments thereto, they constituted a general government for special purposes, delegated to that government certain definite powers, reserving each State for itself the residuary mass of right to their own self-government, and that whensoever the general government assumes undelegated powers its acts are unauthoritative, void and of no force; that to this compact each State acceded as a State and is an integral party; that the government created by this compact was not made the exclusive or final judge of the power delegated to itself, since that would have made discretion and not the <rs>Constitution</rs> the measure of its powers; but that as in all cases of compact among parties having no common judge, each party has an equal right to judge for itself as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/></p> 
<p>For more than <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>, up to the brink of the war, this resolution was reaffirmed by State legislatures and party conventions as containing the true theory of our government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It had been put forth by men who had taken a leading part in the war of the <name>Revolution</name> and the formation of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, as embodying the principles upon which separation from <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> had taken place and the federative system of government had been founded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>But it had a still further significance and object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Within a decade after the formation of the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">union of the States</orgName>, dangerous heresies had gained a foothold, and a monarchical element, assuming the theory of a consolidated government, had passed acts such as the alien and sedition laws, and in many ways transcended the limits of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>By a silent, yet steady and peaceful revolution, our form of government was undergoing a radical change when <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n0251.0001.00008.00012" reg="nearbymention:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> sounded the note of alarm and, upon the platform of the resolutions of <dateStruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></dateStruct>, overthrew the <orgName n="Federal party" type="party">Federal party</orgName> in <dateStruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></dateStruct> and, in contradistinction to its contention for a strong central government with powers other than those specially delegated to it by the <name>States</name>, established <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> upon a firm basis the opposite and Democratic theory of our government which was maintained for more than half a century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>No <num value="1">one</num> dreamed that such principles were treasonable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>They are each sovereign with respect to the objects committed to the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>If it be true that the <rs>Constitution</rs> and laws of the land made in pursuance thereof are the supreme law of the land, it is equally true that laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> made not in pursuance thereof cannot be the supreme law of the land.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>As long as these principles were observed in the administration of the government there was peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It was not the <rs>South</rs> alone which maintained them as embodying the correct theory of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Other States, both before and after the compact, had contended for them as the conditions under which the <rs>Union</rs> was formed or was possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>New York, among others, in ratifying the <rs>Constitution</rs> declared that the powers delegated by her could be resumed whenever perverted to her injury or oppression, and that every power not granted remained with her. Not only was this so, but <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> was the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to assert her sovereign rights, to the very verge of active hostility to the <rs>Federal</rs> government and affiliation with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in the war of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>. <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> The Federal laws were nullified by governor and legislature and in <dateStruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></dateStruct>, at the darkest period of the war, the legislature declared that <q direct="unspecified">it was as much the duty of the <rs>State</rs> authorities to watch over the rights reserved, as of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to exercise the powers which are delegated, and that States which have no common umpire must be their own judges and execute their own decisions.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>A mere reference to the <orgName n="Hartford Convention" type="convention">Hartford Convention</orgName> is sufficient to indicate the extent to which these sentiments prevailed in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>As time progressed and the profits of the slave trade fell off, and when the <rs>Northern</rs> slave States had sold their human chattels to the <rs>Southern</rs> planters, a twofold system of oppression began, the successful execution of which required a relinquishment of such constitutional views and a revival of the <name>Federalism</name> which <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n0251.0001.00010.00016" reg="nearbymention:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> had overthrown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The protective tariff system was devised as a special process by which <num value="1">one</num> section of the country would build itself up at the expense of the other and grow wealthy under an unequal form of taxation but little short of legalized robbery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The South protested and pleaded against this discrimination, but except in <num value="1">one</num> instance, in the case of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></dateStruct>, there was never action other than in the form of legislative or party protest, and no overt act of war. The other form of hostility and unconstitutional action on the part of the <rs>Northern States</rs> against the <rs>South</rs> was in the nullification of the express provisions of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> which recognized slavery in <num value="3">three</num> articles and required slaves to be delivered up to their owners when they should escape into another State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>This assertion of the <q direct="unspecified">higher law</q> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> took the form of fanatical agitation, and was condemned by such men as <persName n="Everett,,Edward,,," id="n0251.0001.00010.00017" reg="default:Everett,Edward,,,"><foreName>Edward</foreName> <surname>Everett</surname></persName>, who, in addition to the obligation which the <rs>Constitution</rs> enjoined, held that <q direct="unspecified">the great relation of servitude in some form or other, with greater or less departure from the theoretic equality of men, is inseparable <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> from our nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Domestic slavery is not, in my judgment, to be set down as an immoral and irreligious relation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>It is a condition of life as well as any other, to be justified by morality, religion and international law.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The present generation, after having been drilled into the belief that the late war was a righteous measure to extirpate the horrid crime of slavery, will, as generations yet to come, find it difficult to understand how such a transition of public sentiment could occur in so short a time&mdash;from the embodiment of the most cultured and humane thought on the subject as cited above, to the fanaticism which in a few short years has made a saint of <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0251.0001.00011.00018" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> and declared the author of the emancipation proclamation an inspired man. The crusade once begun, grew rapidly from <num value="1">one</num> of mere fanatical zeal and the agitation by voluntary associations and religious organizations, to the deliberate action of State legislatures, <num value="15">fifteen</num> of which nullified the <name>Constitutional</name> provision and the laws passed to enforce the same, by imposing severe penalties upon those who sought to execute the fugitive slave law. In short, it grew from a small germ of sentiment without regard to law to a cruel attempt to incite servile war in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 16" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and finally to a great revolution which brushed aside law, constitutions, and American brotherhood, until a <num value="1000000">million</num> men were in arms invading the homes and shedding the blood of a people who thought, as all early publicists and the most enlightened later ones maintained, that they were protected against such infraction of right by the very terms of the compact under which they lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The action of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, looking to the protection of their constitutional rights from such a tidal wave of fanaticism by the peaceful expedient of withdrawing from the <rs>Union</rs> and resuming the sovereignty they had surrendered to the <rs>Federal</rs> government upon well-defined conditions, will not appear so illogical or revolutionary when it is reflected that the tenor of public opinion, as well as judicial <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> decision, was not adverse to belief in such a remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>They proposed no war upon the government at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, nor upon any individual States, and no <num value="1">one</num> had, until after their initial action, claimed that the right of coercion existed as a means of keeping them in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The whole trend of sentiment in the <rs>North</rs> as well as the <rs>South</rs>, while many deprecated the wisdom or necessity of the movement, was that it was a question for them to decide as an exercise of a reserved right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>We do not regard this as so important looking merely to military results, but we desire to present it to your consideration in its political aspects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>We have now in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> a civil government opposed to us; elections have recently been held in which the voice of the people was suppressed by the order of the <rs type="role" reg="military-Governor">military governor</rs> of the <rs>State</rs>; soldiers were placed around the ballot-boxes; the people were not permitted to vote without taking odious oaths prescribed by the military authorities unknown to and in derogation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>; candidates who were the favorites of the majority of the people, who would have been elected, were peremptorily ordered to at once withdraw from the canvass under penalty of being immediately sent to a military prison, and the officers of the election were directed not to place the names of candidates on the poll-books unless they were known to be loyal to the <rs>Federal</rs> government, of which loyalty there was no standard except the caprice, the passion or the interest of the officers themselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>You will at once perceive that should we get military possession of the <rs>State</rs> <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> things to be done will be to overthrow this usurpation, and to give to the people of the <rs>State</rs> an opportunity of establishing such a government as they may desire and of electing such officers to execute the powers of government as they may prefer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>It then becomes important that the citizens of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> who have the confidence of the great body of the people, and who have been intimately associated with <pb id="p.80" n="80"/> them both in private life and in the conduct of public affairs, should return to the <rs>State</rs> to aid and co-operate with the people in their efforts to overthrow the despotism that now oppresses them and re-establish constitutional free government in the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>We are fully convinced that their presence among their old friends and fellow citizens at this time would be attended with the happiest results both to the people of the <rs>State</rs> and to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; and we would therefore most respectfully suggest and recommend that as many of the officers and soldiers from <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> in the service as can be spared for the purpose with a due regard to other exigencies and interests, should be temporarily withdrawn from other duty and attached to the army entering that State.</p>
