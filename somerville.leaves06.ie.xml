<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>It was after a lapse of more than <measure n="2centuries" type="date">two centuries</measure> from the time the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> white man came hither that the name of <placeName reg="Somerville, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050602">Somerville</placeName> was given to a Massachusetts town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Originally our territory, as is well known, was a part of the then town of <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName> and, until our incorporation as a separate town, was mentioned in the town records as <q direct="unspecified">without the <name>Neck</name></q>; but not quite all of what was so-called is within our confines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The line as established when <persName n="Somerville,,,,," id="n0306.0005.00025.00388" reg="mostcommon:Somerville,nomatch:0"><surname>Somerville</surname></persName> was set off caused some friction at the time among those living near and on either side of the boundary, and the partition as made was not satisfactory to many of those residing in the vicinity and on both sides of the border; but each side was in a measure happy because the other side was unhappy; and this statement is absolutely true.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>For convenience at this time, our territory will be designated as <placeName reg="Somerville, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050602">Somerville</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>The local names within our borders in the early time were the <rs type="place">Ten Hills Farm</rs>, between what is now <placeName key="tgn,2110813" n="1.000 2" reg="broadway, rockingham, virginia">Broadway</placeName> and the <rs>Mystic</rs>, and from <placeName reg="Medford town">Medford town</placeName> line to about where <address><street n="Winthrop Avenue">Winthrop Avenue</street></address> connects with <persName n="Broadway,,,,," id="n0306.0005.00025.00389" reg="mostcommon:Broadway,nomatch:0"><surname>Broadway</surname></persName> the line extended by a creek to the river; but the larger part of the farm was outside of our limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>The <rs>Highfield</rs> and Highfield-mead included all the remaining territory between <placeName key="tgn,2110813" n="1.000 2" reg="broadway, rockingham, virginia">Broadway</placeName> and the river: but a part of the <name>Highfield</name> was on the <rs>Charlestown</rs> side of our boundary line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>The Stinted Pasture, or Cow Commons, was from <placeName key="tgn,2110813" n="1.000 2" reg="broadway, rockingham, virginia">Broadway</placeName> <pb id="p.26" n="26"/> toward <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, and north from the <q direct="unspecified">Road to <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>,</q> now <address><street n="Washington Street">Washington Street</street></address>, and comprised a large part of <placeName reg="Somerville, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050602">Somerville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Gibbons-field, the South-mead and the <rs>West End</rs> were south of the <q direct="unspecified">Road to <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>,</q> and westerly of what is now the <rs>Southern</rs> division of the <orgName n="Boston and Maine Railroad" type="railroad">Boston and Maine Railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/><placeName key="possibilities=19" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Strawberry Hill</placeName> was probably the same as our <placeName key="possibilities=81" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Prospect Hill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Lastly, there can hardly be a doubt that a part of what was called the <rs type="place">Line</rs>-field of <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName> was between the <rs>Stinted Pasture</rs> and the <name>Newtown</name>, or <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, town line; from what is now <placeName key="tgn,2215707" n="1.000 21" reg="cambridgeport, middlesex, massachusetts">Cambridgeport</placeName> to <placeName reg="Menotomy River">Menotomy River</placeName>, now <placeName reg="Alewife Brook, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2128842">Alewife Brook</placeName>; the <rs type="place">Line</rs>-field extending, also, into what is now the town of <placeName reg="Arlington, Arlington, Virginia" key="tgn,7015769">Arlington</placeName> to, <placeName reg="Mystic Pond, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2534271">Mystic Pond</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>All these local names are now obsolete except that a part of the original <placeName reg="Ten Hills, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2714579">Ten Hills</placeName> Farms within our limits is still known as such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>A century or more ago the <name>Highfield</name> became <placeName key="tgn,2162801" n="1.000 3" reg="mount benedict, suffolk, massachusetts">Ploughed Hill</placeName>, and over <measure n="2centuries" type="date">two centuries</measure> ago the Highfield-mead became Dirty-marsh; but these names are now extinct, and there seems to be no modern names except for <placeName key="possibilities=19" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Strawberry Hill</placeName> for the other localities of the olden time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>The Cow Commons, as grazing ground, and also other lands in <placeName reg="Somerville, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050602">Somerville</placeName>, were held largely by the inhabitants of the peninsula of <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The Commons were a feature of the town, almost from its commencement to <dateStruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></dateStruct>, or a little later, but in the next century were unknown.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>A record in the town book of <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName> would seem to imply some disposition of the <name>Commons</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>The language is ambiguous, to say the least, but may be read as a literary curiosity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>Besides the blackbirds, <num value="2">two</num> kinds or more, the cow buntings, also called blackbirds, though they were a smoke color, we had the yellowbirds, bluebirds, robins, orioles, golden robins, swallows, sandmartins, chickadees, wrens, chippers or chipbirds, kingbirds, bluejays, woodpeckers, crows, and others, occasionally hawks, and in the winter the plump little snowbirds, while around our clay pits and water shores came peep, snipes, and other water birds.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>The lands around <address><street n="Union Square">Union Square</street></address>, adjacent and outlying, were little mines of prosperity to their owners half a century ago, and could <num value="1">one</num> of our opulent chevaliers of finance and finesse of the present day have appeared and promoted the great sand and clay deposits of this vicinity under some such alluring and persuasive name as the <q direct="unspecified">Consolidated Aluminum and Silica Trust</q> &mdash;which certainly sounds better than <orgName n="Brick Company" type="company">Brick Company</orgName>&mdash;who knows but that <num value="1000000">millions</num> might have been wrung from tile venture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>It seems to be a curious fact that wherever clay is found here, sand is found near it; on the northerly side of <placeName reg="Millers, Massachusetts, United States" key="tgn,1127166">Miller's River</placeName> were sand hills or lands in profusion, while on the southerly side were largely fields of clay, which were early in the last century the sites of brick yards, and so continued, I think, until after the <rs>Civil War</rs>. Here, as in other parts of the town, the clay lands were burrowed with pits, having narrow dykes between them, which until excavated to required depth were kept pumped out, but then abandoned and allowed to become stagnant ponds, of varying depths, along the borders of which were luxuriant growths of cat-o-<num value="9">nine</num>-tails, and in whose waters flourished myriads of hornpout, which is the catfish or sucker of the <name>South</name> and <name>West</name>.
