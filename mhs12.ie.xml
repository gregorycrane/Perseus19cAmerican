<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>And now appears a highly respectable citizen of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, who remembers that his brother, who went to the war with the <rs>Lawrence</rs> <orgName type="mil" key="LightGuard">Light Guard</orgName>, (reenlisting after a home-coming of <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure>) and was killed in battle, was present at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> destruction of the dam, which must thus have been as early as <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>From the foregoing it is evident that the proprietor certainly thought he had some right in the premises, and with what follows it will be seen that the upper <rs>Mystic</rs> was a scene of strife for a period of <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>The mill was a small <num value="2">two</num>-story building, situated on the western bank of the river, and therefore in <placeName key="tgn,7013320" n="1.000 30" reg="arlington, middlesex county, massachusetts">West Cambridge</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>The river-bank was there quite steep, and entrance was had into the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> story from the land adjoining by a connecting bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>The building projected somewhat over the river, was supported by stones and timber, and the water-wheel was enclosed by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>It was of the undershot variety, its paddles dipping into the current, which, as the tide ebbed, ran very swiftly, and was accelerated by the fall of less than <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> caused by the dam. <num value="2">Two</num> pictures of the mill are preserved, the earlier showing the wheel in a shed-like addition, the later without the shed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>Possibly the addition may have been wrecked in the earliest attack, the later picture having been made at about <dateStruct value="1868--"><year reg="1868">1868</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>On either side the mill were willows, which leaned far out over the stream, making a picturesque setting for the old mill, <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> whose shingled walls and roof were time-worn and weatherbeaten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>The proprietor was <persName n="Wood,Mister,B.,F.,," id="n0334.0003.00015.00197" reg="default:Wood,B.,F.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Wood</surname></persName>, who lived in a large white house on the level plain near by, who did wood-turning, jig-sawing and like work, also making <rs n="baby carriages" type="product">baby carriages</rs> and curtain fixtures in his mill.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>As a matter of course, the mill was nothing without the water power, which was obtained at the ebbing of the tide that had flowed up-stream into the lower lake, and was secured by the low dam built across the river to the <rs>Medford</rs> side.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>As a natural water-way, the river at its beginning just above <placeName reg="Wear bridge">Wear bridge</placeName> did not present a favorable aspect, and in many places below was very shallow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>The <q direct="unspecified">Proprietors of <placeName reg="Middlesex Canal, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2510678">Middlesex Canal</placeName></q> very soon abandoned their original idea of utilizing the <rs>Mystic</rs>, and, authorized by additional legislation, built their artificial water-way <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> farther to the <rs>Charles</rs>, in <dateStruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>There is credible evidence that prior to the canal's discontinuance early in <dateStruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></dateStruct>, boatmen shunned the last mile up the river by lifting their boats from the river near the canal <q direct="unspecified"><rs n="Landing 4">Landing No. 4</rs></q> (which was just north of the canal aqueduct over the <rs>Mystic</rs>), placing them in the canal, then rowing or towing them up the canal and removing them into the lake, or <placeName reg="Medford pond">Medford pond</placeName>, as it was then called.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>But there were those who thought that <persName n="Wood,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0003.00015.00198" reg="nearbymention:Wood,B.,F.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wood</surname></persName> had no right to maintain his dam, and claimed that the river was navigable for its entire length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>Both sides held to their opinions, and the conflict arose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>After the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> destruction of the dam (which demolition does not appear to have been complete), it was soon repaired, and later the selectmen of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> were appealed to in the matter, though <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of the offending and obstructing dam was in the adjoining town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>No mention of it is, however, to be found upon the records of that town.
