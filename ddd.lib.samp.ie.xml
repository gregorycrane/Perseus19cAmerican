<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The important object which had brought him there to-night grew out of that accursed system of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>If it were not for that disgraceful institution, he did not believe that there would be a single countryman of his begging in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>(Hear.) He could hardly be said to be begging now for his own countrymen, because, when they reached <placeName>Canada</placeName>, he looked upon them as subjects of the <rs>British Crown</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>(Hear.) <placeName>Canada</placeName> was the brightest spot on earth to the fugitive slave, for it was to him a place of refuge from all his hardships and all his wrongs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It was the only-sport upon the <name>American</name> continent where a colored person was recognized as a man, or where he could call himself, his wife or his child his own The slaveholder claimed to be a <name n="Divine Providence" type="God">god</name> in his own country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The slave was not allowed to choose with what denomination he should worship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>He must do whatever his master told him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The negro had no appeal from his master's decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>If his master decided that he was to be burnt, he was burnt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Slavery, he emphatically declared, was an abomination of the blackest dye.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The tyrannical and brutal influences of slavery were shown in the treatment of those who had been possessed of the moral courage to tell the <rs n="American people" type="group">Americans</rs> the enormity of their crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Look at the influence of slavery even in the <orgName n="Senate" type="military">Senate</orgName>, as evidenced in that shameful outrage upon <persName n="Slavery,,Charles,Sumner,," key="n-0001.0002.00000.00044"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <foreName>Sumner</foreName> <surname>Slavery</surname></persName> denied the right of <persName n="Christ,,,,," key="n-0001.0002.00000.00045"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>'s reign, and claimed to reign for itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>He had noticed the want of an institution for their secular and religious education, by which they might be enabled to assume respectable positions in society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>He had, therefore, come to this country, with a view to complete the establishment of a church, a school, and a temporary home for colored refugees in <placeName>Hamilton</placeName>, <rs type="direction">West</rs> <placeName reg="Canada" key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>. By the erection of an institution combining these qualities, the poor fugitive who found his way to that spot need not be without food or lodging, and the means would be at hand for his education and employment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The total cost of the building would be <measure n="600l." type="pounds">&pound; <num value="600">600</num></measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>He might, however, state that, although they had commenced on a small scale, they had now greatly extended their operations, and frequently held meetings in large halls, which he was glad to say were always crowded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>(Hear.) The <rs>Anti-Slavery League</rs> was a desideratum, the want of which had long been felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>He was very glad of its formation, and should always feel happy to render it his best assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>It was a good and noble idea to educate and clothe the poor fugitives from slaveholding tyranny, and fit them for the ordinary paths of life, that they might give the lie to the unjust assertion that the black man was inferior to the white.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>That this news should find us still embarrassed, and still diddling with the negro question!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>That we should still have <num value="1">one</num> war upon our hands, while we are threatened with another!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Had we, as we should have done, disposed of this question at the beginning of the war, then would its beginning have also been its ending.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>If slavery was not, as it certainly was, the sole cause of the war, it, nevertheless, was that vulnerable spot in the foe at which we should have struck without a moment's delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Instead of repelling the negroes, bond and free, by insults and cruel treatment, we could have brought them all to our side by simply inviting them to it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>As it is, the war has grown into a very formidable <num value="1">one</num>; and the threatened <num value="1">one</num> growing out of it will be far more formidable; whereas, had we not acted insanely on the negro question, we should have dreaded neither.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>More than this, had we, as it was so easy to do, struck instant death into the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> war, we should have escaped the threat of this <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>For what is it that the <name>English</name> press threatens us with war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>It is for compelling the <name n="United Kingdom">English</name> ship to give up the <rs>Rebel Commissioners</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>So it says.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>This is the ostensible reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>But would not <placeName>England</placeName>&mdash;she who is so famous for clinging to an almost entirely unqualified and unlimited right of search&mdash;have done the same thing in like circumstances?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>If she would not, then she would not have been herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Had a part of her home counties revolted, and sent a couple of their rebels to <placeName>America</placeName> for help, would she not have caught them, if she could? and in whatever circumstances they might have been found?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>If she says she would not, there is not on all the earth <num value="1">one</num> <quote>Jew Apella</quote> so credulous as to believe her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>If she confesses she would, then is she self-convicted, not only of trampling in her boundless dishonesty on the great and never-to-be-violated principle of doing as we would be done by, but of insulting us by claiming that we ought to be tame and base enough to forbear to do that which her self-respect and high spirit would prompt her to do.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>But perhaps <placeName>England</placeName> would not have done, as we did.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Her naval captains have, however, taken <num value="1000">thousands</num> of seamen from our ships&mdash;these captains constituting themselves the sole accusers, witnesses and judges in the cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>It was chiefly for such outrages that we declared was against her in <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>. The instance, of the <placeName reg="San Jacinto">San Jacinto</placeName> and <persName n="Trent,,,,," key="n-0001.0003.00000.00066"><surname>Trent</surname></persName> is not like these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>In this instance, there was no question, because no doubt, of personal identity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>But, I repeat, perhaps <placeName>England</placeName> would not have done as we did.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>In a case so aggravated, she would, perhaps, nay, probably, have taken ship and all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>By the way, it may be that we did act illegally in not seizing the ship as well as the rebels, and subjecting her to a formal trial: but if in this we fell into a mistake, could <placeName>England</placeName> be so mean as to make war upon us for it?&mdash;for a mistake which was prompted by a kind and generous regard for the comfort and interests of <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Surely, if <placeName>England</placeName> is not noble enough to refuse to punish for <hi rend="italics">any</hi> mere mistake, she is, nevertheless, not monstrous enough to punish for the mistake, which grow solely out of the desire to serve her.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>But wherein have we harmed <placeName>England</placeName> in this matter?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>We have insulted her, is the answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>We have not, however, intended to insult her: and an unintended insult is really no insult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>If, in my eagerness to overtake the man who has deeply injured me, I run rudely through my neighbor's house, he will not only not accuse me of insulting him, but he will pardon so much to my very excusable eagerness as to leave but little ground of any kind of complaint against me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>Surely, if <placeName>England</placeName> were but to ask her own heart how she would feel toward men in her own bosom, who, without the slightest provocation, were busy in breaking up her nation, and in plundering and slaughtering her people, she would be more disposed to shed tears of pity for us than to make war upon us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>It is not possible that <placeName>England</placeName> will make war upon us for what we did to the <rs>Trent</rs>, and for doing which she has herself furnished us innumerable precedents, It is not possible that she will so ignore, nay, so deny and dishonor her own history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>I will not believe that <placeName>England</placeName>, whom I have ever loved and honored almost as if she were my own country, and who, whatever prejudiced and passionate <name>American</name> writers have written to the contrary, has hitherto, during our great and sore trial, done nothing through her government, nor through the great body of her people, to justify the attempt by a portion (happily a very small and very unworthy portion) of our press to stir up our national feeling against her&mdash;I say, I will not believe that this loved and honored <placeName>England</placeName> will make war upon us for a deed in which we intended her no wrong; in which, so far as her own example is authority, there is no wrong; and in which, in the light of reason, and, as it will prove in the judgment of mankind, there is no wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>She could not make so causeless a war upon us, without deeply and broadly blotting her own character, and the character of modern civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>But, after all, what better is our modern civilization than a mere blot and botch if the nation, which is pre&euml;minently its exponent, can be guilty, and without the least real cause of provocation, and upon pretexts as frivolous as they are false, of seeking to destroy a sister nation?&mdash;a sister nation, too, whose present embarrassments and distresses appeal so strongly to every good heart?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>Moreover, how little will it argue for the cause of human rights and popular institutions, if the nation, which claims to be the chief champion of that cause, can wage so wicked a war upon a nation claiming no humbler relation to that precious cause?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>What, then, do I hold that <placeName>England</placeName> should do in this case?.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>. Reprimand, or more severely punish, the <rs>Captain</rs> of the <rs>Trent</rs> for his very gross and very guilty violation of our rights in furnishing exceedingly important facilities to our enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>This our Government should have promptly insisted on, and not have suffered <placeName>England</placeName> to get the start of us with her absurd counter claim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>This is a case in which not we, but <placeName>England</placeName>, should have been made defendant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>It is her <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> who is the real offender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>Ours is, at the most, but a nominal <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>In the conduct of her <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> were the spirit and purpose, as well as the doing, of wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The conduct of ours, on the contrary, was prompted by the spirit and purpose of doing right; and if, in any respect, it was erroneous, it was simply in regard to the <hi rend="italics">forms</hi> of doing right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Moreover, the guilt of her <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> can be diminished by nothing that was seemingly or really guilty in ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>The criminality of taking the rebels into the <rs>Trent</rs> was none the less, because of any mistakes which attended the getting of them out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>Nevertheless, <placeName>England</placeName> takes no action against him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>Her policy is to have her guilty <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> lost sight of in her bluster about our innocent <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>To screen the thief, she cries, <quote>Stop thief!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>Her policy is to prevent us from getting the true issue before the public mind, by occupying it with her false <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>How preposterous is the claim of <placeName>England</placeName> to her right to make war, because we took our rebellious subjects from her ship!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>The taking of them into her ship is the only thing in the case which can possibly furnish cause of war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/><hi>That</hi>, of unless amply apologized for, does, in the light of international law, furnish abundant cause of war.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Was there ever a more emphatic <quote>putting the saddle on the wrong horse</quote> ? I overtake the thief who has stolen my watch, and jerk it from his pocket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>He turns to the people, not to confess his theft, but to protest against my rudeness, and to have me, instead of himself, regarded as the criminal!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>An old fable tells us that a council of animals, with the lion at their head, put an ass on trial for having <quote>broused the bigness of his tongue.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>The lion (<placeName>England</placeName>) was constrained to confess that he had himself eaten sheep, and shepherds too.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Nevertheless, it was the offence of the ass (American) that caused the council to shudder with horror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Moreover, <placeName>England</placeName>, instead of turning to her own conscience with the true case, has the brazen effrontery to appeal to our conscience with her trumped &mdash; up case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Which of the parties in this instance needs conscience-quickening, is no less certain than in the instance of the footpad and the traveller, whom he had robbed of his bags of gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>Why does she spare the <rs>Captain</rs> of the <placeName>Trent</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Is it because she has more sympathy with the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> than she had with <placeName>Mexico</placeName>?&mdash;and is, therefore, more tender toward him who serves the former, than she was toward him who served the latter?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>But it will, perhaps, be said, that we have not demanded satisfaction in this case as we did in that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/><placeName>England</placeName>, nevertheless, knows that we are entitled to it; and that she is bound to satisfy us for the wrongs she did us, before she complains of the way we took to save ourselves from the deep injury with which that great and guilty wrong threatened us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>In this connexion, I add, that if, upon her own principles and precedents, the <rs>Captain</rs> of the <rs>Trent</rs> deserves punishment for what he did, she is estopped from magnifying into a grave offence our undoing what he did.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>. The next thing which <placeName>England</placeName> should do is to give instructions, or rather to repeat those in the <rs>Queen</rs>'s Proclamation, that no more rebel <rs type="role2">Commissioners</rs> be received into her vessels.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/><num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>. And then she should inform us whether, in the case of a vessel that shall hereafter offend in this wise, she would have us take the vessel itself, or take but the <rs>Commissioners</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>It is true that, whatever her preference, we would probably insist in every case in taking the vessel:&mdash;for it is not probable that we shall again expose ourselves in such a case to the charge of taking too little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>It is, however, also true, that, should she prefer our taking the vessel, we will <hi rend="italics">certainly</hi> never take less.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>But such instructions and information, although they would provide for future cases, would leave the present case unprovided for, and <placeName>England</placeName> might still say that she could not acquiesce in our having, in this case, taken the <rs>Commissioners</rs> instead of the <term type="ship">vessel</term> <rs type="ship">What</rs> then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>She ought to be content with the expression of our regret that we did not take the mode of her choice, and the more so as that mode could not have been followed by any different result in respect to our getting possession of the <rs>Commissioners</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>But this might not satisfy her:&mdash;and what then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>She should generously wait until this unnatural and horrid war is off our hands; and if the parties could not then agree, they should submit the case to an <name>Umpire</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>If, however, she should call for an <persName n="Umpire,,,,," key="n-0001.0003.00000.00070"><surname>Umpire</surname></persName> <hi rend="italics">now</hi>, then, although the civilized world would think badly of her for it, and our own nation be very slow to forgive her for it, I would, nevertheless, in my abhorrence of all war, have our Government consent to an <persName n="Umpire,,,,," key="n-0001.0003.00000.00071"><surname>Umpire</surname></persName> <hi rend="italics">now</hi>. Nay, in the spirit of this abhorrence, and for the sake of peace, I would go much farther.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>If no other concession we could make would satisfy <placeName>England</placeName>, I would have our Government propose to surrender the rebels, <persName n="Mason,,,,," key="n-0001.0003.00000.00072"><surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,,,,," key="n-0001.0003.00000.00073"><surname>Slidell</surname></persName>, in case the <rs>English Government</rs> would say, distinctly and solemnly, that it would not itself disturb neutral vessels having on board rebels who had gone out from <placeName>England</placeName> in quest of foreign aid to overturn the <rs>English Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>An ineffably base Government would it prove itself to be should it refuse to say this, and yet declare war on the ground of our capture of rebels who were on their way for foreign help to overturn our government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>I spoke of my abhorrence of all war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Our life-long opponents of war find themselves unexpectedly in sympathy with mighty armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>They have to confess that they never anticipated a rebellion so vast; still less did they ever anticipate that <placeName>England</placeName> would be guilty of coming to the help of such a satanic rebellion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>I have said that <placeName>England</placeName> will not go to war with us in the case of the <rs>Trent</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Nevertheless, I am not without fear that her Government will be driven to declare war against us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>The <rs>Government</rs> of no other nation (and this is honorable to <placeName>England</placeName>) is more influenced by the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>By such an affair as the capture of <persName n="Mason,,,,," key="n-0001.0003.00000.00074"><surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,,,,," key="n-0001.0003.00000.00075"><surname>Slidell</surname></persName>, the patriotism of the least-informed and superficial and excitable part of her people is easily and extensively wrought upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>With this part of her people the inviolability of the <name>British</name> flag is more than all earth besides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>But it is not by that capture, nor by those classes to whom it appeals with such peculiar power, that the <rs>Government</rs> will be moved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>If an irresistible pressure comes upon the <rs>Government</rs>, it will come from those people who long for the cotton and the free trade of the <rs>South</rs>, and who have allowed themselves to get angry with the <rs>North</rs> by foolishly misconstruing our high tariff (which is simply a necessary war measure) into a <hi rend="italics">hostile commercial measure</hi>. The capture of <persName n="Mason,,,,," key="n-0001.0003.00000.00076"><surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,,,,," key="n-0001.0003.00000.00077"><surname>Slidell</surname></persName> will be only the pretext, not the provocation; only the occasion, not the cause of the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>If <placeName>England</placeName> wishes to go to war with us for any wrongs we have done her, she shall not have the chance&mdash;for we will promptly repair the wrongs, at whatever sacrifice of property or pride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>But if, as I still honor and love her too much to believe, she wishes to go to war with us at any rate, and chooses this our time of trouble as her time to make us an easy prey, then will she be gratified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>It will be but fair, however, to advertise her that she must not take our fighting in the war with the rebels as a sample of what will be our fighting in the war with herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>The former is fooling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>The latter will be fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>On all subjects connected with slavery, and therefore in a war about slavery, we <rs n="American people" type="group">Americans</rs> are fools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>We cannot help it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>We have worshipped the idol so long and so devoutly; that when in its all-influential presence, we cannot be men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>The powers of our moral nature are, however, not destroyed; they are but perverted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>And such an outrage as the <name>English</name> press threatens us with will restore their legitimate use.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Our manhood is not dead; it but sleeps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>And as it was when the <rs>Philistines</rs> fell upon the bound <rs>Samson</rs>, that the <rs>Spirit</rs> of the <rs>Lord</rs> came to his help, so, when the <rs>English</rs> shall fall upon the worse-bound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/><rs n="American people" type="group">Americans</rs>, this sleeping manhood will awake. And it will awake to assort itself, not merely against the <rs>English</rs>, but against the rebels also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>And it will do this mightily, because it will, at the same time, be asserting itself against its own life-long degradations, and the hateful cause of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Let us but know that <placeName>England</placeName>, to whom we have done no wrong, has resolved to come to the help of the <rs>Pro-Slavery Rebellion</rs>, and our deep indignation against her, combining with our deeper indignation against ourselves, will arm us with the spirit and the power to snap the <quote>cords,</quote> and <quote>green withs,</quote> and <quote>new ropes,</quote> with which slavery has bound us, and to dash to the dust the foul idol whose worship has so demented and debased us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>Yes, let us hear this month that <placeName>England</placeName> has declared war against us, and this month will witness our Proclamation of <persName><foreName>Liberty</foreName></persName> to every slave in the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>No thanks will be due her for the happy effect upon us of her Declaration of War. No thanks will be due her that the <rs>Declaration</rs> will have the effect to save us&mdash;to save us by making us antislavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>No more half-way measures, and no more nonsense on the subject of slavery, shall we then propose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>There will be no more talk then of freeing <num value="1">one</num> sort of slaves, and continuing the other in slavery; but we shall then invite every negro in the land, bond and free, to identity himself, <quote>arm and soul,</quote> with our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>And then there will be no more talk of <hi rend="italics">swapping off</hi> taxes for negroes, and no more talk of colonizing and apprenticing them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>Then we shall be eager to lift up the negroes into the enjoyment of all the rights of manhood, that so we may have in them <hi rend="italics">men</hi> to stand by our side, and help us make short work with the present war, and with that with which we are threatened.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>Owing to the bewitching and debauching influence of slavery upon our whole nation, there are, even in the Free States, divisions among us in regard to the present war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>But, should <placeName>England</placeName> so causelessly, cruelly and meanly force a war, upon us, there will be no divisions among us in regard to that war&mdash;nor, indeed, will there then be in regard to the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>And so deep and abiding will be our sense of her boundless injustice, that there will never be any among us to welcome propositions of peace with <placeName>England</placeName>, until her war with us shall, have reached the result of our subjugation, or of her expulsion from every part of the <rs>Continent</rs> of <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName>.
