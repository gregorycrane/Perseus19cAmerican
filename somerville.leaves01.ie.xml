<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The gulf stream of his life had not as yet flowed into the <rs>Arctic</rs> winter of age. His powers were unabated, his literary designs many, and his genial enthusiasms and high ambitions as warm as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>So it is natural for the literary world, and for the <num value="1000">thousands</num> who had learned to await the appearance of his successive books, to feel sorrow at his death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>But sorrow for the author by the world at large cannot approach the grief of his friends, who knew the man himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>But we who knew him by intimate contact seldom thought of him as an author at all. He had none of the affectations of authorship; he was utterly without lettered pride; he never <q direct="unspecified">talked like a book,</q> and he never posed like a celebrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Success that makes small men vain never contracted the largeness of his heart or soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>His heart was like a wayside inn, where every traveler could rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>This popular conception of him is based on good reasons, but we should not be misled by it. His books are certainly books very popular with the young, but no man or woman is too old to find them readable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>He was wise enough to know that a healthy boy is a man in his hopes, and a good man is a boy in his memories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>When he wrote a book the boy in his heart dictated to the man in his brain, and so the book was a book that either a man or boy would read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>He knew, what some writers of juveniles never learn, that a boy becomes wise very young.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>So he knew better than to write patronizingly to his youthful readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>He never stood on a high pedestal and shouted moral platitudes down to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>He never told them to be good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>He made them good, in the only way that a man or a boy can be made good, by making them think, good thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>His fiction, in the highest sense of the word, is true; but his history is never fiction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>He took unusual pains to verify all historical statements and allusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>The good roads movement has acquired too much momentum in these <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> days of the <num value="20" type="ordinal">twentieth</num> century, is too well appreciated by all sorts and conditions of travelers, for us, here and now, to criticise either the cost of construction or the great and lasting benefits accruing from the gradual introduction of these scientifically constructed,&mdash;the so-called sand-papered roads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>Between <dateStruct value="1636--"><year reg="1636">1636</year></dateStruct>, when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> apportionment was made among the people of the town, and <dateStruct value="1681--"><year reg="1681">1681</year></dateStruct>, there were numerous transfers of titles to rights in the common, from <num value="1">one</num> owner to another, but in none of these transfers, nor in the records of <dateStruct value="1638--"><year reg="1638">1638</year></dateStruct>, and later years, or in the confirmation of titles in <dateStruct value="1657--"><year reg="1657">1657</year></dateStruct>, is there any description of lots by bounds, or any reference to rangeways or streets, or any plan mentioned covering the territory laid out and allotted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>It is probable that some survey and plan of this section was made, as the people of that day were methodical in their public matters, and would hardly have attempted the granting of innumerable titles in a tract of several <measure n="100acres" type="area">hundred acres</measure> of land, without some plat or plan to guide them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/><pb id="p.3.9" n="9"/></p> 
<p>Why it was deemed necessary in <dateStruct value="1681--"><year reg="1681">1681</year></dateStruct> to again revive the question of titles in the <rs>Stinted Pasture</rs> I do not know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>The question may have arisen before, and evidently did then, whether or not these titles were permanent; there seems to have been nothing in the record of the division of <dateStruct value="1636--"><year reg="1636">1636</year></dateStruct>, or in any other record previous to <dateStruct value="1681--"><year reg="1681">1681</year></dateStruct>, to show whether their tenure was forever or temporary, but I think the persons receiving the grants believed that they were for all time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>In every sale previous to <dateStruct value="1681--"><year reg="1681">1681</year></dateStruct>, the deed simply gives the number of cow commons, but does not locate them, yet, in most of the transfers between owners, these commons are deeded to the grantees and their heirs forever, and I think all were supposed to be thus conveyed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>The idea of dividing or stinting common lands and pastures was not new; the custom dates back in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, <placeName reg="Sverige" key="tgn,1000097">Sweden</placeName>, and probably other countries, to the earliest times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>Among the early bequests mentioned in the reports of the <rs>Charities Commissioners</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> is <num value="1">one</num> to the poor of the town of <placeName reg="Marston, Cheshire, England" key="tgn,1029992">Marston</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7008168" n="1.000 2" reg="oxfordshire,england,united kingdom,europe">Oxfordshire</placeName>, where it has been the custom from time immemorial to grant to a certain number of the poor of this town a cow common, or right of pasturage for <num value="1">one</num> cow each, on waste land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> this right of cow commons arose, and became a law of the land probably in feudal times, when the lords of the manor granted lands to tenants or retainers for services performed or expected; and as these tenants could not plough or improve their lands without cattle, it became a necessity, and later a law, that the tenant should have cow commons or rights of pasturage for his cattle in the waste lands of the manor; other rights were granted tenants, such as the right to fish, to cut peat, etc., but these rights of commonage evidently did not carry with them any fee in the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>A knowledge of the fact that in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> this tenure was limited may have caused a doubt in the minds of the <name>Charlestownians</name> as to whether their fee in these cow commons was absolute or limited, or whether, indeed, they had any fee at all, or only rights of pasturage, under the previous divisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/><pb id="p.3.10" n="10"/> This, together with the repeated attempts of the <rs type="place">Royal</rs> government to revoke their charter, the fact that, when so revoked, all common lands would revert to the crown, the vagueness of former allotments, and disputes concerning land claims may each or all have been the cause which led to a reapportionment in <dateStruct value="1681--"><year reg="1681">1681</year></dateStruct>, the records of which begin as follows, viz.:&mdash;</p>
