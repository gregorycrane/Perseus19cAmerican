<head>Preface.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>The author of this book has but few words to write in presenting it to the public.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/><measure n="12years" type="date">Twelve years</measure> have passed away since the close of our civil war. The passions of men have had time to cool, and their prejudices time to abate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>We may, therefore, view the contest as we could not when we stood nearer to it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Reared under almost directly opposite interpretations of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, the people of the <rs>North</rs> and of the <rs>South</rs> fought with equal earnestness for principles regarded by each as essential to the well-being of the <rs>American</rs> people and to the perpetuity of a republican form of government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>What is to be the ultimate results of the contest cannot yet he clearly determined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>But may we not hope that a country which endured <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of civil war unequalled in the history of the world, and has since endured <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> of sectional strife, and still lives in freshness and vigor, is destined by a favoring <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> to bear the blessings of <name>Christian</name> civilization onward to the remotest ages, and to stand as a beacon to other peoples as they pass through those stormy periods which are bound up in the bundle of every nation's life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>If such shall be the lessons of our civil war, it will not be without its value to the world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Essentially a religious people, it was to be expected that the faith in which they had been trained should assert itself even amid the strife of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>And it was so. To what extent the religious element prevailed among the soldiers of the <rs>North</rs>, they can best tell us who labored among them in word and doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>To what <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> extent it prevailed among the soldiers of the <rs>South</rs>, the following pages tell in part, for so abundant are the records of the revival, that our book might have been twofold larger had all the material been used.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Of <num value="1">one</num> thing the reader may be certain &mdash; this work is authentic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The facts of the army revival are stated by those who witnessed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>As <rs type="role" reg="Superintendent">Superintendent</rs> of <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Tract Associations</rs> during several years of the war, and near its close as an army chaplain, the author, by correspondence and by personal labors and observation, has had ample opportunity to collect materials for his work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Besides, he has been favored with private letters from many of the most faithful and laborious chaplains and army missionaries, and from officers and private soldiers, giving their recollections of the revival in every part of the wide field of strife.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>There has been no attempt to write a book on the war, but still, in following the armies and tracing the revival, the successive campaigns have been outlined so that the reader might see the conditions under which the work of grace progressed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>To <num value="1000">thousands</num> in the <rs>South</rs> this book will recall scenes dark and sad in many features, but over them is shed the light of hope, and from them the prayers and songs of war days and nights come floating down to mingle with the joys of the present; and if not to mingle with present joys, to give assurance that He who spread a shield over their heads in the day of battle, is still nigh at hand to guide, to cheer, and to deliver all who put their trust in Him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>To <num value="1000">thousands</num> in the <rs>North</rs> this book will be an enigma.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>That <name n="God" type="God">God</name> should appear in the midst of men, to bless and save them, who, as they believe, rushed to arms without just cause, may be almost beyond belief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>To all such persons we can only say, read the narrative, weigh the facts, and then make up your verdict.</p>

<head>Chapter <num type="roman" value="1" n="I"><num value="1">1</num></num>: religion among soldiers.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The late American war has no parallel in history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>When we consider the area of the contest, its gigantic proportions, the number of men under arms, the magazines of warlike stores, the sieges, the marches, the battles, the enthusiasm of the people, the discipline and valor of the soldiers, the wretchedness and desolation which followed the contending hosts,--we may in vain search the annals of the world for the record of a struggle approaching it in all the dreadful elements of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The American may now add to his boasts, that his country claims pre-eminence in the greatest of all national calamities &mdash; a civil war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>We have read, but now we know by experience, that war, more than all things else, reveals the angel and the demon in man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Our composite race evinced on both sides in the struggle the special traits of its near and remote ancestors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The good and bad were strangely mingled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>So it has ever been in wars, especially in wars between people of the same race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Ours gave a powerful emphasis to this sad truth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Sincere piety, brazen wickedness; pure public virtue, sordid baseness; lofty patriotism, despicable time-serving; consecration to a sacred cause and shameless abandonment of principle, appeared in every section of the country <pb id="p.8" n="8"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>To the people of the Old World the war must have been a subject of interest and wonder.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The rapid transformation of peaceful citizens into excellent soldiers must have created among them surprise, if not alarm; the ingenuity and skill displayed in the preparation of war material revealed a progress in this direction which they hardly dreamed that we had made; the steady valor of many battlefields assured them that the <rs>American</rs> veteran of <measure n="20months" type="date">twenty months</measure> was not inferior to the <rs>European</rs> veteran of <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The atrocities of the war must have shaken their faith in the sincerity of a people who subscribed the code of nations, and professed to regard the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> as a revelation from Heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>On the other hand, the patient endurance of hardships, toil, and all manner of privation by a people whom they had been educated to look upon as voluptuous, tyrannical, and effeminate, by reason of their peculiar institutions, must have filled them with astonishment, if not with admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The leading public journal of the world thus described the impression made on the <rs>European</rs> mind by the attitude of the <rs>Southern</rs> people: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/></p> 
<p>The people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> have made themselves famous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>If the renown of brilliant courage, stern devotion to a cause, and military achievements almost without a parallel, can compensate men for the toil and privations of the hour, then the countrymen of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0166.0002.00008.00001" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,Edward,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> and <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0166.0002.00008.00002" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> may be consoled amid their sufferings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>From all parts of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, from their enemies as well as from their friends, from those who condemn their acts as well as those who sympathize with them, comes the tribute of admiration.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>When the history of this war is written the admiration will doubtless become deeper and stronger, for the veil which has covered the <rs>South</rs> will be drawn away, and disclose a picture of patriotism, of unanimous self-sacrifice, of wise and firm administration, which we can now only see indistinctly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/><pb id="p.9" n="9"/></p> 
<p>The details of that extraordinary national effort, which has led to the repulsion and almost to the destruction of an invading force of more than half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men will then become known to the world; and whatever may be the fate of the new nationality, or its subsequent claims to the respect of mankind, it will assuredly begin its career with a reputation for genius and valor which the most famous nations might envy.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Such were the compliments which the <rs>South</rs> wrung from reluctant and opposing nationalities by the genius and ability she displayed in her struggle for independence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>But there is <num value="1">one</num> aspect of the war, on the <rs>Southern</rs> side, which has been almost wholly overlooked by statesmen and politicians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>We mean its religious aspect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Whatever may be the judgment of the world as to the principles on which the <rs>Southern</rs> people entered into the strife, it must be admitted that they brought with them into it, and carried with them through it, a deep and strong religious element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Their convictions of right in what they did were <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> only to their convictions of the truth of the <rs>Christian</rs> religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Nor has the stern logic of events eradicated this conviction from the <rs>Southern</rs> mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The cause is lost, but its principles still live, and must continue to live so long as there remains in human nature any perception and appreciation of justice, truth, and virtue.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The great moral phenomenon of the war was the influence and power of religion among the <rs>Southern</rs> soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>War is a dreadful trade, and the camp has always been regarded as the best appointed school of vice; the more wonderful then is it to see the richest fruits of grace growing and flourishing in such a soil.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Christianity visits and reforms every grade of human society; and some of its greatest miracles of grace are wrought upon the most wicked subjects, and in the worst localities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/><quote>The Gospel is the power of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> unto salvation <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> to every <num value="1">one</num> that believeth;</quote> and this blessed truth has been as fully tested amid the horrors of war as in the sweet days of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>We do not usually consider how important a part military characters have borne in the history of our religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>True, it is not to be propagated by means of the sword; and yet many who have borne the sword have been its bright ornaments, and sometimes its most successful preachers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The soldiers mentioned in the New Testament have great interest connected with their brief history, and some of them are models of faith and piety.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Among the anxious multitudes that flocked to the preaching of <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> the <rs>Baptist</rs>, there were soldiers who put in their question as well as others, <quote>saying, and what shall we do?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>To whom the <rs>Baptist</rs> replied, <quote>Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Thus from the beginning did the <quote>men of war</quote> receive the truth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Was it not a Centurion, a Roman captain of a <num value="100">hundred</num> men, that gave that simple and beautiful illustration of his faith as he kneeled before the <name>Saviour</name> praying for his servant?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>How pure must have been his life, and how clear and strong his faith, to bring from our <rs type="role2">Lord</rs> that high commendation, <quote>Verily, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in <placeName key="tgn,1000119" n="1.000 3" reg="yisra'el">Israel</placeName>.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>We cannot forget that amidst the darkness and horror of the crucifixion conviction seized the heart of another <name>Roman</name> soldier, and while the <name>Jews</name> derided the suffering <rs>Christ</rs>, he exclaimed, <quote>Truly, this man was the son of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>It was in the house of <persName n="Cornelius,,,,," id="n0166.0002.00010.00003" reg="mostcommon:Cornelius,nomatch:0"><surname>Cornelius</surname></persName> of the <rs>Italian</rs> band, <quote>a devout man, that feared <name n="God" type="God">God</name> with all his house, who gave much alms to the people, and prayed to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> always,</quote> that the gospel message was opened to the heathen world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>To this godly soldier an angel was sent to assure him that his <quote>prayers and his alms had come up for a memorial before <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>On him, his family, and <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> his <quote>devout soldiers,</quote> the <rs>Holy Ghost</rs> fell while <persName><foreName>Peter</foreName></persName> preached, and like as it was on the day of <persName n="Pentecost,,,,," id="n0166.0002.00011.00004" reg="mostcommon:Pentecost,nomatch:0"><surname>Pentecost</surname></persName>, they <quote>spake with tongues and magnified <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Thus, at the headquarters of the <quote><persName n="Italian,,,,," id="n0166.0002.00011.00005" reg="mostcommon:Italian,nomatch:0"><surname>Italian</surname></persName> band</quote> at Caesarea was the first <placeName reg="Church of Gentile">Church of Gentile</placeName> converts established.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>It was doubtless under a deep sense of this man's kindness that <placeName key="tgn,7013947" n="1.000 10" reg="saint paul, ramsey, minnesota">St. Paul</placeName> prayed for his sick father, <quote>and laid his hands on him and healed him.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>In every age of the <rs type="place">Church</rs> since, soldiers have been found among the most zealous and devoted followers of the <name>Redeemer</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>When Christianity was made popular by the example and patronage of Roman Emperors, of course <num value="1000">thousands</num> of all classes flocked to her standard; but history also shows that every rise of the pure faith in ages of superstition and ignorance, every genuine revival, has been sustained and helped forward by military men. Among the <name>Reformers</name> in <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, and in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, there were <quote>devout soldiers,</quote> who wielded the sword of the <name>Spirit</name> as valiantly against the enemies of the <rs>Lord</rs> as they did the sword of war against the enemies of their country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Whatever some may think of <persName n="Cromwell,,Oliver,,," id="n0166.0002.00011.00010" reg="default:Cromwell,Oliver,,,"><foreName>Oliver</foreName> <surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>, there is no doubt that he was a devout and earnest <persName n="Christian,,,,," id="n0166.0002.00011.00011" reg="mostcommon:Christian,nomatch:0"><surname>Christian</surname></persName>, and that there was much sound religion among his invincible <quote>Ironsides.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>He talks of experimental religion as no man could who had not felt its inward and renewing power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>After a number of fruitless efforts against <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> the <name>Royalists</name>, he determined to rally <quote>men of religion</quote> to his cause, convinced that <quote>with a set of poor tapsters and town apprentice people</quote> he could never overcome the forces of the <rs>King</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>With these <quote>men of religion</quote> he always conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>They marched into battle singing psalms and shouting such watchwords as, <quote>The <name n="God" type="God"><rs type="role" reg="Lord">Lord</rs> of Hosts</name>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>How far their invincibility was grounded in their religion, <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0166.0002.00012.00012" reg="nearbymention:Cromwell,Oliver,,,"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName> shall judge for us: <quote>Truly I think he that prays and preaches best will fight best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>When victory crowned his arms, he would exclaim, <quote>This is nothing but the hand of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>He taught his soldiers to regard themselves as the <quote>instruments of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> glory and their country's good.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>His full influence for good only the final day will reveal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>By the highborn, and the lowly, his religious power was felt and confessed.

<p>If the private soldier be a true man, there is something of moral sublimity in his conduct that attracts our highest admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>And yet how apt some people are to forget him. There is no star on his collar, no glittering ornament on his arm; but his plain gray jacket may enclose as noble a heart as ever throbbed in a human breast, or thrilled with patriotic devotion on the day of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>In sleepless vigilance he paces his sentinel watch during the long hours and gloom of night, while the quiet stars shed their soft light on his musket, or the storm and rain beat pitilessly down on his shivering body and weary head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Look at him in battle at his gun, begrimed with powder, weary, hungry, almost exhausted, yet the fire gleams in his fearless eye as he rams home the charge, or sights his piece at the foe. <quote> Forward</quote> is the command along the line, and you can see him as he brings his musket to a charge and dashes on to the very muzzles of the death-dealing guns to win the day or die in the attempt.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>There is something as inspiriting in his cheerfulness in the camp as there is grand in his heroism on the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Now he is a house carpenter building him a shanty, then a dirt-dauber constructing a mud chimney.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Now he is a cook frying <quote>middling</quote> on the coals and baking bread on a piece of bark set up before the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Now he is washer-man, and has stripped off his only shirt to have it done up, that he may enjoy a clean garment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>In a word, he is a wonderful creature, that private soldier --he is cook, <hi rend="italics">washer-woman</hi>, (?) carpenter, tent-maker, wagoner, pedestrian, clerk, butcher, baker, market huckster, groom, stable-boy, blacksmith, scout, anything and everything a man can or must be in camp, and then he wins a battle and gives the glory to his officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>We like him. His rich, ringing shout, and his merry, loud laugh, make music of a manly, stirring sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>His wit is as original as it is amusing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>It is amusing to hear him, as his regiment passes through a town where hundreds of well-grown exempts stand on the side-walk, <quote>Fall in, boys!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>now is your time-ain't going to fight soon?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Or to hear the mock sympathy with which he exclaims, <quote> Boys, ain't you almost big enough yet?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>Yes, the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldier is a patriot; it is for this he wields the sword and shoulders the musket; it is for this he surrenders home, bids adieu to all its hallowed associations, and undergoes the hardships of the camp, the fatigues of the march, the privations of the soldier, and the perils of battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/> He is brave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>He marches without fear to the brink of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>The booming of cannon, the shrill sound of rifle and musketry, the clash of arms, the smoke of battle, the groans of the wounded, and the fallen corpses of the dead, inspire him with no terror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>Brave, but not reckless, he would stand, if need be, in the very front of the battle, facing danger and braving death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Such is true courage, and it is possessed in all its plenitude by the model soldier.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/> He is obedient to his superiors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/></p> 
<p>The history of the world confirms the testimony of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> as to the moral dangers of accumulated treasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>Wealth is favorable to every species of wickedness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>Luxury, licentiousness of manners, selfishness, indifference to the distresses of others, presumptuous confidence <pb id="p.44" n="44"/> in our own resources-these are the accompaniments of affluence, whenever the safeguards of the <name>Divine</name> word, both as to the mode of increase and proper use, are disregarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>As to the higher forms of character and civilization, unless regulated and sanctified by Scripture truth and principle, <hi rend="italics">opulence</hi> has always been <num value="1">one</num> of the most active causes of individual degeneracy and of national corruption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>Under the influence of its subtle poison, moral principle decays; Patriotism puts off its nobility and works for hire; Bribery corrupts the judgment-seat, and Justice is blinded by gifts; Benevolence suppresses its generous impulses, and counts its contributions by fractions; Religion, forgetting the example of its Author and the charity of its mission, pleads penury, and chafes at every opportunity for work or distribution; Covetousness devours widows' houses and grows sleek on the bread of orphans; Usury speculates on <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> and claims its premium, alike from suffering poverty and selfish extravagance; Extortion riots upon the surplus of the rich and the scrapings of the poor, enlarges its demand as necessity increases, and, amid impoverishment, want, and public distress, whets its appetite for keener rapine, and, with unsated desire, laps the last drop from its victim and remorselessly sighs for more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>The world counts gain as godliness, prosperity as virtue, fraud as talent; and <hi rend="italics">money</hi>, money, money, is the <name n="God" type="God">god</name> of the land, with every house for a temple, every field for an altar, and every man for a worshipper.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>Whenever the conservative laws of accumulation and distribution, as prescribed in the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, are ignored, then not only does the love of money stimulate our native <pb id="p.45" n="45"/> depravity, but the hoarded gain furnishes facilities for uncommon wickedness.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/></p> 
<p> My views are summed up in few words.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>Each branch of the <orgName n="Christian Church" type="church">Christian Church</orgName> should send into the army some of its most prominent ministers who are distinguished for their piety, talents, and zeal, and such ministers should labor to produce concert of action among chaplains and Christians in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>These ministers should give special attention to preaching to regiments which are without chaplains, and induce them <pb id="p.52" n="52"/> to take steps to get chaplains, to let the regiments name the denominations from which they desire chaplains selected, and then to see that suitable chaplains are secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>A bad selection of a chaplain may prove a curse instead of a blessing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>If the few prominent ministers thus connected with each army would cordially cooperate, I believe that glorious fruits would be the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>Denominational distinctions should be kept out of view, and not touched, upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>And, as a general rule, I do not think that a chaplain who would preach denominational sermons should be in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>His congregation is his regiment, and it is composed of various denominations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>I would like to see no question asked in the army what denomination a chaplain belongs to, but let the question be, Does he preach the gospel?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>The neglect of the spiritual interests of the army may be seen from the fact that not <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of my regiments have chaplains.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/><gap/> </p> 
<p>Among the wants of the <rs type="place">Church</rs> in the army are some ministers of such acknowledged superiority and zeal as, under <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, to be the means of giving concert of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>Our chaplains, at least in the same military organization encamped in the same neighborhood, should have their meetings, and through <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> blessing devise successful plans for spiritual conquests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>All the other departments of the army have system, and such system exists in any other department of the service that no <num value="1">one</num> of its officers can neglect his duty without diminishing the efficiency of his branch of the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>And it appears to me that when men see what attention is bestowed secularly in comparison with what is religiously, they naturally under-estimate the importance of religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>From what I have said, you may think I am despondent; but thanks to an ever kind <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, such is not the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>I do not know when so many men, brought together without any religious test, exhibit so much religious feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/><pb id="p.53" n="53"/></p> 
<p>The striking feature is that so much that is hopeful should exist, when so little human instrumentality has been employed for its accomplishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>In civil life, ministers have regular meetings to devise means for cooperation in advancing the interests of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>This can be done in the army, and I am persuaded it should be. <gap/> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>The chaplain writes to every minister or church, with which the member may have been connected, or the young convert desires to be united, and, giving the name of the person, solicits the prayers of the said church, both for the individual and the whole camp church, and by correspondence keeps them apprised of the walk and history of the party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>And with clothing they sent every article that could contribute to the comfort of the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>Their beds were stripped of blankets and quilts, their pianos of india-rubber covers, their floors of carpets, to shelter their brave defenders from the rigors of winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>Often the costliest jewelry and plate were sold to buy supplies for the army,--and <pb id="p.56" n="56"/> nothing was deemed too valuable to be devoted to the cause which was freighted with all their hopes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>A more than Spartan, a Christian heroism glowed in their hearts and brightened all their deeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>Without repining, even with cheerfulness, they bore all the hardships of the war, and amid want and woe, doubt and disaster, cheered on their husbands, sons and fathers in the path of duty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>When in the progress of the war those places of rest and refreshment for the weary and hungry soldier sprang up, the wayside hospitals, the wives and daughters of the <rs>South</rs> were their presiding geniuses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>The white, smooth pillow, the clean bed, the well-swept floor, the tempting food to suit the sick soldier's appetite, were all their handy-work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>They met him at the door, and often with their own hands relieved him of the heavy knapsack and the soiled white cotton haversack in which he carried his cold corn dodger and uncooked pork, and sent him to some quiet bed where he lay down thanking <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for the angels that had met him in his journey.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>These welcome resting-places, and the scenes that daily occurred in them, are thus described by a lady, <num value="1">one</num> of the most gifted women of the <rs>South</rs>, who soothed the sorrows of many a sick and wounded soldier: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/></p> 
<p>These wayside hospitals are located, generally, at the depot of some railroad, where the sick and wounded soldier immediately as he leaves the cars, exhausted, weary and faint, finds a grateful shelter, where surgical aid, refreshments and attention, are immediately tendered him. These institutions are generally supported entirely by voluntary contributions, and refreshing and delightful is it to see the unstinted supplies coming daily in and always equalling the demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>Much faith and prayer have been put in exercise for these tarrying-places for the war-worn soldier, so that their <quote>bread and water</quote> has never yet failed; nor do we believe they ever <pb id="p.57" n="57"/> shall, while the people of a covenant-keeping <name n="God" type="God">God</name> claim his exceeding great and precious promises.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>After I had ministered to several of the wounded, I drew near the couch of <num value="1">one</num> whose case was considered <num value="1">one</num> of the worst there, but who appeared, since his wounds had been dressed and refreshments administered to him, much relieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>After conversing some time with him, he asked my name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>I told him, and that I was the wife of the gentleman who had just been giving him his breakfast-(for he had to be fed as an infant). I told him, moreover, that the gentleman was a preacher &mdash; a Methodist preacher.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>After the prayer was ended, the subject of religion continued to be our theme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>He said he was quite resigned to <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> will concerning him, and that he was not afraid to die; and while dwelling on the goodness of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, his countenance assumed that serene and beautiful expression, indicative of peace within and joy in the <rs>Holy Ghost</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>Well was it for him that he had strength from on high, and that the everlasting arms of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> love were his support, for in a few hours from the time we conversed together it was found amputation of his arm would be necessary, from which he suffered excruciatingly until death came to his relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>But all the time of his mortal agony his faith remained firm and unshaken, and he pillowed his sinking head on the bosom of <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>, and <quote>breathed his life out sweetly there,</quote> while to all around, witnessing a good confession of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0166.0005.00057.00076" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>'s power to save, to the uttermost, all those that put their trust in him.</p></quote> <pb id="p.58" n="58"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2671"/>Here, in prayer, he hastily committed his soul and body to his faithful Keeper, then rose calm and serene, with an assurance that no weapon of the enemy would harm him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2672"/>When the battle was over and victory perched upon our banner, <persName><foreName>Albert</foreName></persName> found himself surrounded with the dead and dying, among whom were some of his particular friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2673"/>He was strongly and strangely exercised with a mingled feeling of joy and grief, a sort of hysteric paroxysm of laughing and crying, weeping for the slain, and rejoicing that he had escaped unharmed, with a deep consciousness that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> had been his shield and hiding-place in the hour of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2674"/><persName><foreName>Albert</foreName></persName> endured all the sufferings of fatigue, cold, and hunger, incident to a winter campaign; none murmured less, none were more faithful in the discharge of duty, than he. The demoralizing effects of the camp, with almost the entire absence of religious privileges, produced a coldness i his state; and although he did not compromise his moral character by profanity, gambling, and drunkenness, as many others did, yet he failed to enjoy the close communion and clear sense of the <name>Divine</name> presence which he had done in former days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2675"/>In this state of mind, he entered upon the <measure n="7days" type="date">seven days</measure> battles before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2676"/>The solemnities of the occasion aroused him to a sense of his danger, causing him to cleave more closely to his Bible and its precious promises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2677"/>With his hand on this blessed book pressed to his heart, he called on <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to be his shield and support in the hour of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2679"/>A degree of joy and gratitude swelled his heart as he surveyed the field of death, in view of his own wonderful escape, but not so deep and warm as on a former occasion, when his faith and piety were more earnest and simple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2680"/><persName><foreName>Albert</foreName></persName> continued at times to read his Bible; but it was evidently more as a task than a pleasant duty; his keen relish for Divine things had abated very much; the excuses of camp-life, long marches, and the general indifference of officers and men upon the subject of religion, offered his conscience the consolation of a temporary opiate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2681"/>Sometimes, however, on the reception of letters from home, and sometimes when alone on his midnight round of picket duty, he would shed a penitential tear, and resolve to double his diligence and regain his lost ground as a Christian; but a plant so tender and unprotected by the pale of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>, unwatered by the dews of the sanctuary, persecuted and scathed by the lightnings of contempt, nipped and browsed upon by every wild beast of the forest, necessarily became greatly dwarfed in life and growth; a feeling of self-security, a trust in fate or chance, impressed him more than a simple faith in the ever-present <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2682"/>In this spiritually demoralized condition he entered the <rs>Sharpsburg</rs> fight, without even asking <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to protect and save him from danger and death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2683"/>Soon after the battle opened he was struck by a ball and carried back to the rear a wounded man; from profuse hemorrhage, a sick, dreamy sensation stole over him; the light faded from his eyes, while a <num value="1000">thousand</num> mingled sounds filled his ears, and a faint vision of home, friends, green turf, battle-fields, and grave-yards, flitted by like phantoms of the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2684"/>With returning consciousness, there came a sense of shame and sorrow for having declined in his religious state, and a conviction <pb id="p.219" n="219"/> that his wound was the chastening of the <rs>Lord</rs> to rebuke his wanderings and check his self-reliance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2685"/>As soon as he was sufficiently restored, he drew from his pocket his neglected Bible, kissing it many times over, and bathing it in tears as truly penitential as <persName><foreName>Peter</foreName></persName> when he wept at the feet of <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2686"/>His bloody fingers searched out the old-cherished promises of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, leaving many a gory stain on the blessed pages of inspiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2687"/>The law of the <rs>Lord</rs> again became his meat and drink, on which he feasted by day and by night; a new life was infused into his soul, which enabled him to bear his sufferings with true <name>Christian</name> heroism.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2688"/>In this condition I found him in the old <placeName reg="Academy Hospital">Academy Hospital</placeName> in <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, lying on the dirty floor, with a blanket for his bed and a wisp of straw to pillow up his wounded limb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2689"/>While sitting by his side, trying to minister to his soul and body, I received from him this narrative substantially as I have given it to you.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2691"/>Near him sat the matron of the hospital, rendering every possible comfort that the sympathy of a woman could suggest, intensely sharpened by the recent loss of a promising son, who fell in a late battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2692"/>Reduced by a secondary hemorrhage and amputation, <persName><foreName>Albert</foreName></persName>, with a calm, steady faith, came down to the cold waters of <persName n="Jordan,,,,," id="n0166.0014.00219.00409" reg="mostcommon:Jordan,nomatch:0"><surname>Jordan</surname></persName>, where he lingered for a short time and dictated a letter to his mother, which I wrote for him, in which he gave an appropriate word to each <num value="1">one</num> of the family, not even forgetting Maum <persName n="Patty,,,,," id="n0166.0014.00219.00410" reg="mostcommon:Patty,nomatch:0"><surname>Patty</surname></persName>, his old nurse, and reserving a postscript, the last and <pb id="p.220" n="220"/> best, for <persName><foreName>Jennie</foreName></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2694"/>After pausing a few moments at the close of the letter, he seemed self-absorbed, and soliloquized thus: <quote>I die for my country and the cause of humanity, and, with many others, have thrown my bleeding body into the horrid chasm of revolution to bridge the way for the triumphal car of Liberty which will roll over me, bearing in its long train the happy <num value="1000000">millions</num> of future generations, rejoicing in all the grandeur of peace and prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2699"/>Checking himself, he said: <quote>These are earthly desires, which I feel gradually giving way to a purer, heavenly sympathy.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2700"/>Then, in a low, sweet voice, he repeated-<quote rend="blockquote"><lg type="couplet"><l>Give joy or grief, give ease or pain,</l> <l>Take life or friends away,</l> <l>I come to find them all again</l> <l>In that eternal day.</l></lg></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2701"/>He repeated the last line with an emphasis that threw a beauty and force into it which I never saw or felt before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2702"/>Seeing that he was communing with his own soul, and that spiritual things in the opening light of eternity were rising in bold relief before his vision of faith, I withdrew a short space from him, feeling it <pb id="p.221" n="221"/> was holy ground, <quote>where the good man meets his fate, quite on the verge of heaven.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2703"/>He then gently laid his hand on his Bible and the daguerreotype that lay near his side, and amid this profound stillness, surrounded by a halo of more than earthly glory, gently as the evening shadows the curtain dropped, leaving nothing visible to us but the cold and lifeless clay, on which a sweet smile rested, as though it had seen the happy soul enter the pearly gates of the New Jerusalem.
