<p>It may be inquired of me why I seek to agitate the subject of Slavery in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, where we all acknowledge it to be an evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Because such an acknowledgment is not enough on our part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>It is doing no more than the slave-master and the slave-trader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/><q direct="unspecified">We have found,</q> says <persName n="Monroe,,James,,," id="n0318.0002.00001.00001" reg="default:Monroe,James,,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <surname>Monroe</surname></persName>, in his speech on the subject before the <orgName n="Virginia Convention" type="convention">Virginia Convention</orgName>, <q direct="unspecified">that this evil has preyed upon the very vitals of the <rs>Union</rs>; and has been prejudicial to all the states in which it has existed.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>All the states in their several Constitutions and declarations of rights have made a similar statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>And what has been the consequence <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> of this general belief in the evil of human servitude?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Has it sapped the foundations of the infamous system?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>No. Has it decreased the number of its victims?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Quite the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Unaccompanied by philanthropic action, it has been in a moral point of view worthless, a thing without vitality, sightless, soulless, dead.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>But it may be said that the miserable victims of the system have our sympathies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Sympathy! the sympathy of the <name>Priest</name> and the <name>Levite</name>, looking on, and acknowledging, but holding itself aloof from mortal suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Can such hollow sympathy reach the broken of heart, and does the blessing of those who are ready to perish answer it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Does it hold back the lash from the slave, or sweeten his bitter bread?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/><num value="1">One</num>'s heart and soul are becoming weary of this sympathy, this heartless mockery of feeling; sick of the common cant of hypocrisy, wreathing the artificial flowers of sentiment over unutterable pollution and unimaginable wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It is white-washing the sepulchre to make us forget its horrible deposit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It is scattering flowers around the charnel-house and over the yet festering grave to turn away our thoughts <q direct="unspecified">from the dead men's bones and all uncleanness,</q> the pollution and loathsomeness below.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>No let the truth on this subject, undisguised, naked, terrible as it is, stand out before us. Let us no longer seek to cover it; let us no longer strive to forget it; let us no more dare to palliate it. It is better to meet it here with repentance than at the bar of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The cry of the oppressed, of the <num value="1000000">millions</num> who have perished among us as the brute <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> perisheth, shut out from the glad tidings of salvation, has gone there before us, to Him who as a father pitieth all His children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Their blood is upon us as a nation; woe unto us, if we repent not, as a nation, in dust and ashes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Woe unto us if we say in our hearts, <q direct="unspecified">The <rs>Lord</rs> shall not see, neither shall the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of <persName><foreName>Jacob</foreName></persName> regard it. He that planted the ear, shall He not hear?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>In his speech during the last session, upon the bill of the <orgName n="Ways and Means Committee" type="committee">Committee of Ways and Means</orgName>, after discussing the constitutional protection of slavery, he says: <q direct="unspecified">But that same interest is further protected by the <name>Laws</name> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>This was intended as a preliminary to complete emancipation at some remote period, but it is impossible to perceive either its justice or expediency.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/><num value="2">2</num>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/><num value="3">3</num>. Abstinence on the part of the people of the free states from the use of the known products of slave labor, in order to render that labor profitless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>Let us look at this subject from another point of view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>The large sum of money necessary for stocking a plantation with slaves has an inevitable tendency to place the agriculture of a slave-holding community exclusively in the hands of the wealthy, a tendency at war with practical republicanism and conflicting with the best maxims of political economy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/><num value="200">Two hundred</num> slaves at <measure n="200dollars" type="currency">$200</measure> per head would cost in the outset <measure n="40000dollars" type="currency">$40,000</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>Free labor is perfectly in accordance with the spirit of our institutions; slave labor is a relic of a barbarous, despotic age. The <num value="1">one</num>, like the firmament of heaven, is the equal diffusion of similar lights, manifest, harmonious, regular; the other is the fiery predominance of some disastrous star, hiding all lesser luminaries around it in <num value="1">one</num> consuming glare.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>Emancipation would reform this evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>The planter would no longer be under the necessity of a heavy expenditure for slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>He would only pay a very moderate price for his labor; a price, indeed, far less than the cost of the maintenance of a promiscuous gang of slaves, which the present system requires.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>In an old plantation of <num value="300">three hundred</num> slaves, not more than <num value="100">one hundred</num> effective laborers will be found.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>Well, admitting that <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> may be able and willing at some remote period to rid herself of the evil by commuting the punishment of her unoffending colored people from slavery to exile, will her fearful remedy apply to some of the other slaveholding states</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>It is a fact, strongly insisted upon by our Southern brethren as a reason for the perpetuation of slavery, that their climate and peculiar agriculture will not admit of hard labor on the part of the whites; that amidst the fatal malaria of the rice plantations the white man is almost annually visited by the country fever; that few of the white overseers of these plantations reach the middle period of ordinary life; that the owners are compelled to fly from their estates as the hot season approaches, without being able to return until the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> frosts have fallen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>But we are told that the slaves remain there, at their work, mid-leg in putrid water, breathing the noisome atmosphere, loaded with contagion, and underneath the scorching fervor of a terrible sun; that they indeed suffer; but that their habits, constitutions, and their long practice enable them to labor, surrounded <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> by such destructive influences, with comparative safety.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>The conclusive answer, therefore, to those who in reality cherish the visionary hope of colonizing all the colored people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> or elsewhere, is this single, all-important fact: The labor of the blacks will not and cannot be dispensed with by the planter of the <rs>South</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>To what remedy, then, can the friends of humanity betake themselves but to that of emancipation</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>And nothing but a strong, unequivocal expression of public sentiment is needed to carry into effect this remedy, so far as the general government is concerned.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>And when the voice of all the non-slave-holding states shall be heard on this question, a voice of expostulation, rebuke, entreaty&mdash;when the full light of truth shall break through the night of prejudice, and reveal all the foul abominations of slavery, will <placeName reg="Delaware" key="tgn,7007239">Delaware</placeName> still cling to the curse which is wasting her moral strength, and still rivet the fetters upon her <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4000">four thousand</num> slaves</p> 
<p>

<text><body> 
<p>A friend has handed me a late number of your paper, containing a brief notice of a pamphlet, which I have recently published on the subject of slavery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>From an occasional perusal of your paper, I have formed a favorable opinion of your talent and independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>Compelled to dissent from some of your political sentiments, I still give you full credit for the lofty tone of sincerity and manliness with which these sentiments are avowed and defended.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>I perceive that since the adjustment of the tariff question a new subject of discontent and agitation seems to engross your attention.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>The <q direct="unspecified">accursed tariff</q> has no sooner ceased to be the stone of stumbling and the rock of offence, than the <q direct="unspecified">abolition doctrines of the <rs>Northern</rs> enthusiasts,</q> as you are pleased to term the doctrines of your own <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0318.0002.00058.00071" reg="nearbymention:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, furnish, in your opinion, a sufficient reason for poising the <q direct="unspecified">Ancient Dominion</q> on its sovereignty, and rousing every slave-owner to military preparations, until the entire <rs>South</rs>, from the <rs>Potomac</rs> to the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs>, shall bristle <pb id="p.59" n="59"/> with bayonets, <q direct="unspecified">like quills upon the fretful porcupine.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/></p> 
<p>In proof of a conspiracy against your <q direct="unspecified">vested rights,</q> you have commenced publishing copious extracts from the pamphlets and periodicals of the abolitionists of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> and New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>An extract from my own pamphlet you have headed <q direct="unspecified">The Fanatics,</q> and in introducing it to your readers you inform them that <q direct="unspecified">it exhibits, in strong colors, the morbid spirit of that false and fanatical philanthropy, which is at work in the <rs>Northern</rs> states, and, to some extent, in the <rs>South</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/></p> 
<p>Gentlemen, so far as I am personally concerned in the matter, I feel no disposition to take exceptions to any epithets which you may see fit to apply to me or my writings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>A humble son of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>&mdash;a tiller of her rugged soil, and a companion of her unostentatious yeomanry&mdash;--it matters little, in any personal consideration of the subject, whether the voice of praise or opprobrium reaches me from beyond the narrow limits of my immediate neighborhood.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>But when I find my opinions quoted as the sentiment of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, and then denounced as dangerous, <q direct="unspecified">false and fanatical;</q> and especially when I see them made the occasion of earnest appeals to the prejudices and sectional jealousies of the <rs>South</rs>, it becomes me to endeavor to establish their truths, and defend them from illegitimate influences and unjust suspicions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>In the first place, then, let me say, that if it be criminal to publicly express a belief that it is in the power of the slave states to emancipate their <pb id="p.60" n="60"/> slaves, with profit and safety to themselves, and that such is their immediate duty, a majority of the people of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> are wholly guiltless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>Of course, all are nominally opposed to slavery; but upon the little band of abolitionists should the anathemas of the slave-holder be directed, for they are the agitators of whom you complain, men who are acting under a solemn conviction of duty, and who are bending every energy of their minds to the accomplishment of their object.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>And that object is the overthrow of slavery in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, by such means only as are sanctioned by law, humanity, and religion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>I shall endeavor, gentlemen, as briefly as may be, to give you some of our reasons for opposing slavery and seeking its abolition; and, secondly, to explain our mode of operation; to disclose our plan of emancipation, fully and entirely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>We wish to do nothing darkly; frank republicans, we acknowledge no double-dealing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>At this busy season of the year, I cannot but regret that I have not leisure for such a deliberate examination of the subject as even my poor ability might warrant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>My remarks, penned in the intervals of labor, must necessarily be brief, and wanting in coherence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>The causes of this disproportionate increase, so inimical to the true interests of the country, are very manifest.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>The forced, unnatural system of slavery in some of the states renders the demand for free laborers less urgent; they are not so readily and abundantly supplied with the means of subsistence as those of their own class in the free states, and as the necessaries of life diminish population also diminishes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>There is yet another cause for the decline of the white population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>In the free states labor is reputable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>The statesman, whose eloquence has electrified a nation, does not disdain in the intervals of the public service to handle the axe and the hoe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>Compelled to perform the despised offices of the slave, they can hardly rise above his level.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>They become the pariahs of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>No wonder, then, that the tide of emigration flows from the slave-cursed shores of the <rs>Atlantic</rs> to the free valleys of the <rs>West</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>In the early and better days of the <rs>Roman Republic</rs>, the ancient warriors and statesmen cultivated their fields with their own hands; but so soon as their agriculture was left to the slaves, it visibly declined, the once fertile fields became pastures, and the inhabitants of that garden of the world were dependent upon foreign nations for the necessaries of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>The beautiful villages, once peopled by free contented laborers, became tenantless, and, over the waste of solitude, we see, here and there, at weary distances, the palaces of the master, contrasting painfully with the wretched cottages and subterranean cells of the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>In all the slave states the increase of the slaves is vastly more rapid than that of the whites or free blacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>When we recollect that they are under no natural or moral restraint, careless of providing food or clothing for themselves or their children; when, too, we consider that they are raised as an article of profitable traffic, like the cattle of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> and the hogs of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>; that it is a matter of interest, of dollars and cents, to the master that they should multiply as fast as possible, there is surely nothing at all surprising in the increase of their numbers.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>We therefore hold it to be the duty of the people of the slave-holding states to begin the work of emancipation now; that any delay must be dangerous to themselves in time and eternity, and full of injustice to their slaves and to their brethren of the free states.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>Because the slave has never forfeited his right to freedom, and the continuance of his servitude is a continuance of robbery; and because, in the event of a servile war, the people of the free states would be called upon to take a part in its unutterable horrors.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/><placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> would obey that call, for she will abide unto death by the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the land.

<p>

Notwithstanding the great importance of the subjects which they discuss, the intense interest which they are calculated to awaken throughout this commonwealth and the whole country, and the exalted reputation of their author as a profound statesman and powerful writer, they are as yet hardly known beyond the limits of the constituency to whom they are particularly addressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>The reason of this is sufficiently obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/><persName n="Adams,,John,Quincy,," id="n0318.0002.00093.00113" reg="default:Adams,John,Quincy,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>Quincy</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> belongs to neither of the prominent political parties, fights no partisan battles, and cannot be prevailed upon to sacrifice truth and principle upon the altar of party expediency and interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>Hence neither party is interested in defending his course, or in giving him an opportunity to defend himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>But however systematic may be the efforts of mere partisan presses to suppress and hold back from the public eye the powerful and triumphant vindication of the <name>Right</name> of Petition, the graphic delineation of the slavery spirit in Congress, and the humbling disclosure of Northern cowardice and <pb id="p.94" n="94"/> treachery, contained in these letters, they are destined to exert a powerful influence upon the public mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>They will constitute <num value="1">one</num> of the most striking pages in the history of our times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>They will be read with avidity in the <rs>North</rs> and in the <rs>South</rs>, and throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>Apart from the interest excited by the subjects under discussion, and viewed only as literary productions, they may be ranked among the highest intellectual efforts of their author.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>Their sarcasm is Junius-like,&mdash;--cold, keen, unsparing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>In boldness, directness, and eloquent appeal, they will bear comparison with <persName n="O'Connell,,,,," id="n0318.0002.00094.00114" reg="mostcommon:O'Connell,Daniel,,,:2"><surname>O'Connell</surname></persName>'s celebrated <hi rend="italics">Letters to the <name>Reformers</name> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName></hi>. They are the offspring of an intellect unshorn of its primal strength, and combining the ardor of youth with the experience of age.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>The disclosure made in these letters of the slavery influence exerted in Congress over the representatives of the free states, of the manner in which the rights of freemen have been bartered for Southern votes, or basely yielded to the threats of men educated in despotism, and stamped by the free indulgence of unrestrained tyranny with the <q direct="unspecified">odious peculiarities</q> of slavery, is painful and humiliating in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>It will be seen that, in the great struggle for and against the <name>Right</name> of Petition, an account of which is given in the following pages, their author stood, in a great measure, alone and unsupported by his Northern colleagues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>On his <q direct="unspecified">gray, discrowned head</q> the entire fury of slave-holding arrogance and wrath was expended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>He stood alone, beating back, with his aged and single arm, the tide which would have borne down <pb id="p.95" n="95"/> and overwhelmed a less sturdy and determined spirit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>We need not solicit for these letters, and the speech which accompanies them, a thorough perusal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>They deserve, and we trust will receive, a circulation throughout the entire country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>They will meet a cordial welcome from every lover of human liberty, from every friend of justice and the rights of man, irrespective of color or condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>The principles which they defend, the sentiments which they express, are those of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, as recently asserted, almost unanimously, by her legislature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>In both branches of that body, during the discussion of the subject of slavery and the right of petition, the course of the <rs type="role" reg="ex-President">ex-President</rs> was warmly and eloquently commended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>He thinks the command to give to servants that which is just and equal means simply that the masters should treat their slaves with equity, and that while the servant is to be profitable to the master, the latter is bound in <q direct="unspecified">a fair and equitable manner to provide for the slave's subsistence and happiness.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>Although he professes to believe that a faithful adherence to Scriptural injunctions on this point would eventually terminate in the emancipation of the slaves, he thinks it not necessary to inquire whether the New Testament does or does not <q direct="unspecified">tolerate slavery as a permanent institution</q>!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>From the foregoing synopsis it will be seen at once that whatever may have been the motives of the writer, the effect of his publication, so far as it is at all felt, will be to strengthen the oppressor in his guilt, and hold him back from the performance <pb id="p.97" n="97"/> of his immediate duty in respect to his slaves, and to shield his conscience from the reproofs of that class who, according to <q direct="unspecified">Evangelicus,</q> have <q direct="unspecified">no personal acquaintance with the actual domestic state or the social and political connections of their Southern fellow-citizens.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>With all due deference to the author, we tell him, and we tell the church, <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, that this question must be met.

In him the awful distinction between a person and a thing is annihilated: he is thrust down from the place which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and Nature assigned him, from the equal companionship of rational intelligences,&mdash;--a man herded with beasts, an immortal nature classed with the wares of the merchant!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>The relations of parent and child, master and apprentice, government and subject, are based upon the principle of benevolence, reciprocal benefits, and the wants of human society; relations which sacredly respect the rights and legacies which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has given to all His rational creatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>But slavery exists only by annihilating or monopolizing these rights and legacies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>In every other modification of society, man's personal ownership remains secure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>He may be oppressed, deprived of privileges, loaded with burdens, hemmed about with legal disabilities, his liberties restrained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>But, through all, the right to his own body and soul remains inviolate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>He retains his inherent, original possession of himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>Even crime cannot forfeit <pb id="p.104" n="104"/> it, for that law which destroys his personality makes void its own claims upon him as a moral agent; and the power to punish ceases with the accountability of the criminal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>He may suffer and die under the penalties of the law, but he suffers as a man, he perishes as a man, and not as a thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>To the last moments of his existence the rights of a moral agent are his; they go with him to the grave; they constitute the ground of his accountability at the bar of infinite justice,&mdash;--rights fixed, eternal, inseparable; attributes of all rational intelligence in time and eternity; the same in essence, and differing in degree only, with those of the highest moral being, of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> himself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>Slavery alone lays its grasp upon the right of personal ownership, that foundation right, the removal of which uncreates the man; a right which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> himself could not take away without absolving the being thus deprived of all moral accountability; and so far as that being is concerned, making sin and holiness, crime and virtue, words without significance, and the promises and sanctions of revelation, dreams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>Hence, the crowning horror of slavery, that which lifts it above all other iniquities, is not that it usurps the prerogatives of Deity, but that it attempts that which even He who has said, <q direct="unspecified">All souls are mine,</q> cannot do, without breaking up the foundations of His moral government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>Slavery is, in fact, a struggle with the <name>Almighty</name> for dominion over His rational creatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>It is leagued with the powers of darkness, in wresting man from his Maker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>It is blasphemy lifting brazen brow and violent hand to heaven, attempting <pb id="p.105" n="105"/> a reversal of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>Man claiming the right to uncreate his brother; to undo that last and most glorious work, which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> himself pronounced good, amidst the rejoicing hosts of heaven!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>Man arrogating to himself the right to change, for his own selfish purposes, the beautiful order of created existences; to pluck the crown of an immortal nature, scarce lower than that of angels, from the brow of his brother; to erase the <name n="God" type="God">God</name>-like image and superscription stamped upon him by the hand of his Creator, and to write on the despoiled and desecrated tablet, <q direct="unspecified">A chattel personal!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>Nature, with her <num value="1000">thousand</num> voices, cries out against it. Against it, divine revelation launches its thunders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>The woes and wrongs unutterable which attend this dreadful violation of natural justice, the stripes, the tortures, the sunderings of kindred, the desolation of human affections, the unchastity and lust, the toil uncompensated, the abrogated marriage, the legalized heathenism, the burial of the mind, are but the mere incidentals of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> grand outrage, that seizure of the entire man, nerve, sinew, and spirit, which robs him of his body, and <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of his soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>With a zeal which never abated, with a warmth which the frost of years could not chill, he urged the great truths, that each man should be the guardian of his own weal; that <num value="1">one</num> man should never have absolute control over another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>He maintained the entire equality of the race, the inherent right of self-ownership, the equal claim of all to a fair participation in the enactment of the laws by which they are governed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>He saw clearly that slavery, as it existed in the <rs>South</rs> and on his own plantation, was inconsistent with this doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>His early efforts for emancipation in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> failed of success; but he next turned his attention to the vast northwestern territory, and laid the foundation of that ordinance of <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>, which, like the flaming sword of the angel at the gates of Paradise, has effectually guarded that territory against the entrance of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>Nor did he stop here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>He was the friend and admirer of the ultra-abolitionists of revolutionary <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>; he warmly urged his <name>British</name> friend, <persName n="Price,Doctor,,,," id="n0318.0003.00108.00126" reg="mostcommon:Price,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Price</surname></persName>, to send his anti-slavery pamphlets into <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>; he omitted no opportunity to protest against slavery as anti-democratic, unjust, and dangerous to the <pb id="p.109" n="109"/> common welfare; and in his letter to the territorial governor of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, written in old age, he bequeathed, in earnest and affecting language, the cause of negro emancipation to the rising generation.

<p>Such was <persName n="Jefferson,,Thomas,,," id="n0318.0003.00109.00127" reg="default:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, the great founder of American Democracy, the advocate of the equality of human rights, irrespective of any conditions of birth, or climate, or color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>His political doctrines, it is strange to say, found their earliest recipients and most zealous admirers in the slave states of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>The privileged class of slaveholders, whose rank and station <q direct="unspecified">supersede the necessity of an order of nobility,</q> became earnest advocates of equality among themselves&mdash;the democracy of aristocracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>With the misery and degradation of servitude always before them, in the condition of their own slaves, an intense love of personal independence, and a haughty impatience of any control over their actions, prepared them to adopt the democratic idea, so far as it might be applied to their own order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>Of that enlarged and generous democracy, the love, not of individual freedom alone, but of the rights and liberties of all men, the unselfish desire to give to others the privileges which all men value for themselves, we are constrained to believe the great body of <persName n="Jefferson,,Thomas,,," id="n0318.0003.00109.00128" reg="default:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>'s slave-holding admirers had no adequate conception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>They were just such democrats as the patricians of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> and the aristocracy <pb id="p.110" n="110"/> of <placeName key="tgn,7018159" n="1.000 1" reg="venezia,venezia,veneto,italia,europe">Venice</placeName>; lords over their own plantations, a sort of <q direct="unspecified">holy alliance</q> of planters, admitting and defending each other's divine right of mastership.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>In the debate on the memorials presented to the <orgName n="United STATES Congress 1" type="congress">first Congress of the United States</orgName>, praying for the abolition of slavery, the voice of the <rs>Virginia</rs> delegation in that body was unanimous in deprecation of slavery as an evil, social, moral, and political.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>In the debate on the same subject in the legislature in <dateStruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></dateStruct>, universal and impartial democracy found utterance from eloquent lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>We might say as much of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, the child of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>But it remains true that these were exceptions to the general rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>With the language of universal liberty on their lips, and moved by the most zealous spirit of democratic propagandism, the greater number of the slave-holders of the <rs>Union</rs> seem never to have understood the true meaning, or to have measured the length and breadth of that doctrine which they were the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to adopt, and of which they have claimed all along to be the peculiar and chosen advocates.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>The Northern States were slow to adopt the <pb id="p.111" n="111"/> Democratic creed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>The oligarchy of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, and the rich proprietors and landholders of the <rs>Middle States</rs>, turned with alarm and horror from the levelling doctrines urged upon them by the <q direct="unspecified">liberty and equality</q> propagandists of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>The doctrines of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> were quite as unpalatable to <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> at the beginning of the present century as those of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> now are to the Old Dominion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>Democracy interfered with old usages and time-honored institutions, and threatened to plough up the very foundations of the social fabric.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>It was zealously opposed by the representatives of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> in Congress and in the home legislatures; and in many pulpits hands were lifted to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in humble entreaty that the curse and bane of democracy, an offshoot of the rabid Jacobinism of revolutionary <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, might not be permitted to take root and overshadow the goodly heritage of <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>It was in vain that federalism denounced with indignation the impertinent inconsistency of slave-holding interference in behalf of liberty in the free states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>Come the doctrine from whom it might, the people felt it to be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>State after state revolted from the ranks of federalism, and enrolled itself on the side of democracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>The old order of things was broken up; equality before the law was established, religious tests and restrictions of the right of suffrage were abrogated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>There the resistance to democratic principles was the most strenuous and longest continued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>Yet, at this time, there is no state in the <rs>Union</rs> more thorough in its practical adoption of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>No property qualifications or religious tests prevail; all distinctions of sect, birth, or color, are repudiated, and suffrage is universal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>The democracy, which in the <rs>South</rs> has only been held in a state of gaseous abstraction, hardened into concrete reality in the cold air of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>The ideal became practical, for it had found lodgment among men who were accustomed to act out their convictions and test all their theories by actual experience.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>While thus making a practical application of the new doctrine, the people of the free states could not but perceive the incongruity of democracy and slavery.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1275"/>The flames of our merchant vessels, seized by pirates, lighted every sea; we heard of officers of the rebel army and navy stealing into our cities, firing hotels filled with sleeping occupants, and laying obstructions on the track of rail cars, for the purpose of killing and mangling their passengers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1276"/>Yet in spite of these revelations of the utterly barbarous character of slavery and its direful effect upon all connected with it, we were on the <pb id="p.150" n="150"/> very point of trusting to its most criminal defenders the task of reestablishing the state governments of the <rs>South</rs>, leaving the real Union men, white as well as black, at the mercy of those who have made hatred a religion and murder a sacrament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1280"/>In the public utterances I hear much of punishing and hanging leading traitors, fierce demands for vengeance, and threats of the summary chastisement of domestic sympathizers with treason, but comparatively little is said of the accursed cause, the prolific mother of abominations, slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1281"/>The government is exhorted to remember that it does not bear the sword in vain, the Old Testament is ransacked for texts of <placeName reg="Oriental, Juniata, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2091582">Oriental</placeName> hatred and examples of the revenges of a semi-barbarous nation; but, as respects the <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of unmistakably loyal people of the <rs>South</rs>, the patient, the long-suffering, kind-hearted victims of oppressions, only here and there a voice pleads for their endowment with the same rights of citizenship which are to be accorded to the rank and file of disbanded rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1282"/>The golden rule of the <name>Sermon</name> on the <name>Mount</name> is not applied to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1283"/>Much is said of executing justice upon rebels; little of justice to loyal black men. Hanging a few ringleaders of treason, it seems to be <pb id="p.151" n="151"/> supposed, is all that is needed to restore and reestablish the revolted states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1284"/>The negro is to be left powerless in the hands of the <q direct="unspecified">white trash,</q> who hate him with a bitter hatred, exceeding that of the large slave-holders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1285"/>In short, <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of terrible chastisement, of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> unmistakable judgments, have not taught us, as a people, their lesson, which could scarcely be plainer if it had been written in letters of fire on the sky.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1292"/>In wreaking revenge upon these miserable men, we must see to it that we do not degrade ourselves and do dishonor to the sacred memory of the dead.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1295"/>In dealing with the guilty leaders and instigators of the rebellion we should beware how we take counsel of passion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1296"/>Hatred has no place beside the calm and awful dignity of justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1297"/>Human life is still a very sacred thing; <name>Christian</name> forbearance and patience are still virtues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1298"/>For my own part, I should be satisfied to see the chiefs of the great treason go out from among us homeless, exiled, with the mark of <persName n="Cain,,,,," id="n0318.0004.00152.00215" reg="mostcommon:Cain,nomatch:0"><surname>Cain</surname></persName> on their foreheads, carrying with them, wherever they go, the avenging <rs>Nemesis</rs> of conscience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1299"/>We cannot take lessons, at this late day, in their school of barbarism; we cannot starve and torture them as they have starved and tortured our soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1300"/>Let them live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1301"/>Perhaps that is, after all, the most terrible penalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1302"/>For wherever they hide themselves the story of their acts will pursue them; they can have no rest nor peace save in that deep repentance which, through the mercy of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, is possible for all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1303"/>I have no disposition to stand between these men and justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1304"/>If arrested, they can have no claim to exemption from the liabilities of criminals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1305"/>But it is not simply a question of deserts that is to <pb id="p.153" n="153"/> be considered; we are to take into account our own reputation as a Christian people, the wishes of our best friends abroad, and the humane instincts of the age, which forbid all unnecessary severity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1306"/>Happily we are not called upon to take counsel of our fears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1307"/>Rabbinical writers tell us that evil spirits who are once baffled in a contest with human beings lose from thenceforth all power of further mischief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1310"/>As respects the misguided masses of the <rs>South</rs>, the shattered and crippled remnants of the armies of treason, the desolate wives, mothers, and children mourning for dear ones who have fallen in a vain and hopeless struggle, it seems to me our duty is very plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1311"/>We must forgive their past treason, and welcome and encourage their returning loyalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1312"/>None but cowards will insult and taunt the defeated and defenceless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1314"/>Our sole enemy was slavery, and slavery is dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1315"/>We have now no quarrel with the people of the <rs>South</rs>, who have really more reason than we have to rejoice over the downfall of a system which impeded their material progress, perverted their religion, shut them out from the sympathies of the world, and ridged their land with the graves of its victims.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1369"/>I thank you for the very kind expression of your confidence and your generous reference to my endeavors to serve the cause of freedom; but I must own that I would fain have been spared the necessity of adding to the already too long list of political epistles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1370"/>I have felt it my duty in times past to take an active part&mdash;often very distasteful to me&mdash;in political matters, having for my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> object the deliverance of my country from the crime and curse of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1371"/>That great question being now settled forever, I have been more than willing to leave to younger and stronger hands the toils <pb id="p.162" n="162"/> and the honors of partisan service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1372"/>Pained and saddened by the bitter and unchristian personalities of the canvass now in progress, I have hitherto held myself aloof from it as far as possible, unwilling to sanction in the slightest degree the criminations and recriminations of personal friends whom I have every reason to love and respect, and in whose integrity I have unshaken confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1373"/>In the present condition of affairs I have not been able to see that any special action as an abolitionist was required at my hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1374"/>Both of the great parties, heretofore widely separated, have put themselves on substantially the same platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1375"/>The <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, originally pledged only to the non-extension of slavery, and whose most illustrious representative, <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0318.0004.00162.00238" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, avowed his willingness to save the <rs>Union</rs> without abolishing slavery, has been, under <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, mainly instrumental in the total overthrow of the detestable system; while the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>, composed largely of slave-holders, and, even at the <rs>North</rs>, scarcely willing to save the <rs>Union</rs> at the expense of the slave interest upon which its success depended, shattered and crippled by the civil war and its results, has at last yielded to the inexorable logic of events, abandoned a position no longer tenable, and taken its <q direct="unspecified">new departure</q> with an abolitionist as its candidate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/>As a friend of the long-oppressed colored man, and for the sake of the peace and prosperity of the country, I rejoice at this action of the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1377"/>The underlying motives of this radical change are doubtless somewhat mixed and contradictory, honest conviction <pb id="p.163" n="163"/> on the part of some, and party expediency and desire of office on the part of others; but the change itself is real and irrevocable; the penalty of receding would be swift and irretrievable ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1378"/>In any point of view the new order of things is desirable; and nothing more fully illustrates <q direct="unspecified">the ways that are dark and the tricks that are vain</q> of party politics than the attempt of professed friends of the <rs>Union</rs> and equal rights for all to counteract it by giving aid and comfort to a revival of the worst characteristics of the old party in the shape of a straight-out <orgName n="Democratic Convention" type="convention">Democratic convention</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1379"/>As respects the candidates now before us, I can see no good reason why colored voters as such should oppose <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0318.0004.00163.00239" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, who, though not an abolitionist and not even a member of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> previous to his nomination, has faithfully carried out the laws of Congress in their behalf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1380"/>Nor, on the other hand, can I see any just grounds for distrust of such a man as <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0318.0004.00163.00240" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>, who has so nobly distinguished himself as the advocate of human rights irrespective of race or color, and who by the instrumentality of his press has been for <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> the educator of the people in the principles of justice, temperance, and freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1381"/>Both of these men have, in different ways, deserved too well of the country to be unnecessarily subjected to the brutalities of a presidential canvass; and, so far as they are personally concerned, it would doubtless have been better if the <num value="1">one</num> had declined a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> term of uncongenial duties, and the other continued to indite words of wisdom in the shades of <placeName key="tgn,2068445" n="1.000 1" reg="chappaqua, westchester, new york">Chappaqua</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1382"/>But they <pb id="p.164" n="164"/> have chosen otherwise; and I am willing, for <num value="1">one</num>, to leave my colored fellow-citizens to the unbiased exercise of their own judgment and instincts in deciding between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1383"/>The <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> labors under the disadvantage of antecedents not calculated to promote a rapid growth of confidence; and it is no matter of surprise that the vote of the emancipated class is likely to be largely against it. But if, as will doubtless be the case, that vote shall be to some extent divided between the <num value="2">two</num> candidates, it will have the effect of inducing politicians of the rival parties to treat with respect and consideration this new element of political power, from self-interest if from no higher motive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1384"/>The fact that at this time both parties are welcoming colored orators to their platforms, and that, in the <rs>South</rs>, old slave-masters and their former slaves fraternize at caucus and barbecue, and vote for each other at the polls, is full of significance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1385"/>If, in New England, the very men who thrust <persName n="Douglass,,Frederick,,," id="n0318.0004.00164.00241" reg="default:Douglass,Frederick,,,"><foreName>Frederick</foreName> <surname>Douglass</surname></persName> from car and stage-coach, and mobbed and hunted him like a wild beast, now crowd to shake his hand and cheer him, let us not despair of seeing even the <name>Ku</name>-Klux tamed into decency, and sitting <q direct="unspecified">clothed in their right minds</q> as listeners to their former victims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1386"/>The colored man is to-day the master of his own destiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1387"/>No power on earth can deprive him of his rights as an <orgName n="American Citizen" type="newspaper">American citizen</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1388"/>And it is in the light of American citizenship that I choose to regard my colored friends, as men having a common stake in the welfare of the country; mingled with, and not separate from, their white fellow-citizens; not herded <pb id="p.165" n="165"/> together as a distinct class to be wielded by others, without self-dependence and incapable of selfde-termination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1389"/>Thanks to such men as <persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n0318.0004.00165.00242" reg="nearbymention:Sumner,Charles,,,"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName> and <persName n="Wilson,,,,," id="n0318.0004.00165.00243" reg="mostcommon:Wilson,nomatch:0"><surname>Wilson</surname></persName> and their compeers, nearly all that legislation can do for them has already been done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1390"/>We can now only help them to help themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1391"/>Industry, economy, temperance, self-culture, education for their children,&mdash;these things, indispensable to their elevation and progress, are in a great measure in their own hands.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1392"/>You will, therefore, my friends and fellowciti-zens, pardon me if I decline to undertake to decide for you the question of your political duty as respects the candidates for the presidency,&mdash;a question which you have probably already settled in your own minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/>If it had been apparent to me that your rights and liberties were really in danger from the success of either candidate, your letter would not have been needed to call forth my opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1394"/>In the long struggle of well-nigh <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure>, I can honestly say that no consideration of private interest, nor my natural love of peace and retirement and the good &mdash; will of others, have kept me silent when a word could be fitly spoken for human rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1395"/>I have not so long acted with the class to which you belong without acquiring respect for your intelligence and capacity for judging wisely for yourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1396"/>I shall abide your decision with confidence, and cheerfully acquiesce in it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1397"/>If, on the whole, you prefer to vote for the reelection of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0318.0004.00165.00244" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, let me hope you will do so without joining with <num value="11" type="ordinal">eleventh</num>-hour friends in denouncing and reviling such an old and tried friend <pb id="p.166" n="166"/> as <persName n="Sumner,,Charles,,," id="n0318.0004.00166.00245" reg="default:Sumner,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName>, who has done and suffered so much in your behalf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1407"/>A single glance at the names of the petitioners is a sufficient answer to the insinuation that they are unmindful of that self-sacrifice and devotion, the marble and granite memorials of which, dotting the state from the <rs>Merrimac</rs> to the <rs>Connecticut</rs>, testify the gratitude of the loyal heart of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1579"/>My acquaintance with him commenced in boyhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1580"/>My father was a subscriber to his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> paper, the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Free Press" type="newspaper">Free Press</orgName></hi>, and the humanitarian tone of his editorials awakened a deep interest in our little household, which was increased by a visit which he made us. When he afterwards edited the <hi rend="italics">Journal of the <rs>Times</rs></hi>, at <placeName reg="Bennington, Bennington, Vermont" key="tgn,7013382">Bennington, Vt.</placeName>, I ventured to write him a letter of encouragement and sympathy, urging him to continue his labors against slavery, and assuring him that he could <q direct="unspecified">do great things,</q> an unconscious prophecy which has been fulfilled beyond the dream of my boyish enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1581"/>The friendship thus commenced has <pb id="p.190" n="190"/> remained unbroken through half a century, con, firming my early confidence in his zeal and devotion, and in the great intellectual and moral strength which he brought to the cause with which his name is identified.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1582"/>During the long and hard struggle in which the abolitionists were engaged, and amidst the new and difficult questions and side-issues which presented themselves, it could scarcely be otherwise than that differences of opinion and action should arise among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1583"/>The leader and his disciples could not always see alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1584"/>My friend, the author of this book, I think, generally found himself in full accord with him, while I often decidedly dissented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1585"/>I felt it my duty to use my right of citizenship at the ballot-box in the cause of liberty, while <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0318.0004.00190.00328" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, with equal sincerity, judged and counselled otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1586"/>Each acted under a sense of individual duty and responsibility, and our personal relations were undisturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1587"/>If, at times, the great anti-slavery leader failed to do justice to the motives of those who, while in hearty sympathy with his hatred of slavery, did not agree with some of his opinions and methods, it was but the pardonable and not unnatural result of his intensity of purpose, and his self-identification with the cause he advocated; and, while compelled to dissent, in some particulars, from his judgment of men and measures, the great mass of the antislavery people recognized his moral leadership.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1588"/>The controversies of old and new organization, non resistance and political action, may now be looked upon by the parties to them, who still survive, with <pb id="p.191" n="191"/> the philosophic calmness which follows the subsidence of prejudice and passion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1589"/>We were but fallible men, and doubtless often erred in feeling, speech, and action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1590"/>Ours was but the common experience of reformers in all ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1594"/>I love to think of him as he seemed to me, when in the fresh dawn of manhood he sat with me in the old <placeName reg="Haverhill farm">Haverhill farm</placeName>-house, revolving even then schemes of benevolence; or, with cheery smile, welcoming me to his frugal meal of bread and milk in the dingy <rs>Boston</rs> printing-room; or, as I found him in the gray <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> morning in the small attic of a colored man, in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, finishing his night-long task of drafting his immortal <hi rend="italics">Declaration of Sentiments</hi> of the <orgName n="American Anti Slavery Society" type="society">American Anti-Slavery Society</orgName>; or, as I saw him in the jail of <address><street n="Leverett Street">Leverett Street</street></address>, after his almost miraculous escape from the mob, playfully inviting me to share the safe lodgings which the state had provided for him; and in all the varied scenes and situations where we acted together our parts in the great endeavor and success of Freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1601"/>I need not say how gladly I would be with you at the semi-centennial of the <rs>American</rs> AntiSla-very Society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1602"/>I am, I regret to say, quite unable to gratify this wish, and can only represent myself by a letter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1603"/>Looking back over the long years of half a century, I can scarcely realize the conditions under which the convention of <dateStruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></dateStruct> assembled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1604"/>Slavery was predominant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1605"/>Like Apollyon in <hi rend="italics">Pilgrim's Progress</hi>, it <q direct="unspecified">straddled over the whole breadth of the way.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1606"/>Church and state, press and pulpit, business interests, literature, and fashion were prostrate at its feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1607"/>Our convention, with few exceptions, was composed of men without influence or position, poor and little known, strong only in their convictions and faith in the justice of their cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1608"/>To onlookers our endeavor to undo the evil work of <measure n="2centuries" type="date">two centuries</measure> and convert a nation to the <q direct="unspecified">great renunciation</q> involved in emancipation must have seemed absurd in the last degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1609"/>Our voices in such an atmosphere found no echo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1610"/>We could look for no response but laughs of derision or the missiles of a mob. <pb id="p.194" n="194"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1611"/>But we felt that we had the strength of truth on our side; we were right, and all the world about us was wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1612"/>We had faith, hope, and enthusiasm, and did our work, nothing doubting, amidst a generation who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> despised and then feared and hated us. For myself I have never ceased to be grateful to the <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name> for the privilege of taking a part in that work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1613"/>And now for more than <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> we have had a free country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1614"/>No slave treads its soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1615"/>The anticipated dangerous consequences of complete emancipation have not been felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1616"/>The emancipated class, as a whole, have done wisely and well under circumstances of peculiar difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1617"/>The masters have learned that cotton can be raised better by free than by slave labor, and nobody now wishes a return to slave-holding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1618"/>Sectional prejudices are subsiding, the bitterness of the civil war is slowly passing away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1619"/>We are beginning to feel that we are <num value="1">one</num> people, with no really clashing interests, and none more truly rejoice in the growing prosperity of the <rs>South</rs> than the old abolitionists, who hated slavery as a curse to the master as well as to the slave.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1620"/>In view of this commemorative semi-centennial occasion, many thoughts crowd upon me; memory recalls vanished faces and voices long hushed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1621"/>Of those who acted with me in the convention <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> ago nearly all have passed into another state of being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1622"/>We who remain must soon follow; we have seen the fulfilment of our desire; we have outlived scorn and persecution; the lengthening shadows invite us to rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1623"/>If, in looking back, we <pb id="p.195" n="195"/> feel that we sometimes erred through impatient zeal in our contest with a great wrong, we have the satisfaction of knowing that we were influenced by no merely selfish considerations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1624"/>The low light of our setting sun shines over a free, united people, and our last prayer shall be for their peace, prosperity, and happiness.</p></body></text> </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1747"/>The gentleman who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> called attention to him, <pb id="p.214" n="214"/> in a recent note to <persName n="Howe,Doctor,,,," id="n0318.0004.00214.00365" reg="nearbymention:Howe,Samuel,G.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Howe</surname></persName>, published in the report, thus speaks of his present condition: <q direct="unspecified">When I remember his former wild and almost frantic demeanor when approached by any <num value="1">one</num>, and the apparent impossibility of communicating with him, and now see him standing in his class, playing with his fellows, and willingly and familiarly approaching me, examining what I gave him,&mdash;and when I see him already selecting articles named by his teacher, and even correctly pronouncing words printed on cards,&mdash;improvement does not convey the idea presented to my mind; it is creation; it is making him anew.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1748"/></p> 
<p>All the pupils have more or less advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1749"/>Their health and habits have improved; and there is no reason to doubt that the experiment, at the close of its <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, will be found to have been quite as successful as its most sanguine projectors could have anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1750"/><persName n="Howe,Doctor,,,," id="n0318.0004.00214.00366" reg="nearbymention:Howe,Samuel,G.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Howe</surname></persName> has been ably seconded by an accomplished teacher, <persName n="Richards,,James,B.,," id="n0318.0004.00214.00367" reg="default:Richards,James,B.,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Richards</surname></persName>, who has devoted his whole time to the pupils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/>Of the nature and magnitude of their task, an idea may be formed only by considering the utter listlessness of idiocy, the incapability of the poor pupil to fix his attention upon anything, and his general want of susceptibility to impressions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1752"/>All his senses are dulled and perverted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1753"/>Touch, hearing, sight, smell, are all more or less defective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1754"/>His gluttony is unaccompanied with the gratification of taste,&mdash;the most savory viands and the offal which he shares with the pigs equally satisfy him. His mental state is still worse than his physical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1755"/>Thought is painful and irksome to him. <pb id="p.215" n="215"/> His teacher can only engage his attention by strenuous efforts, loud, earnest tones, gesticulations and signs, and a constant presentation of some visible object of bright color and striking form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1756"/>The eye wanders, and the spark of consciousness and intelligence which has been fanned into momentary brightness darkens at the slightest relaxation of the teacher's exertions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1757"/>The names of objects presented to him must sometimes be repeated hundreds of times before he can learn them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/>Yet the patience and enthusiasm of the teacher are rewarded by a progress, slow and unequal, but still marked and manifest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>Step by step, often compelled to turn back and go over the inch of ground he had gained, the idiot is still creeping forward; and by almost imperceptible degrees his sick, cramped, and prisoned spirit casts off the burden of its body of death, breath as from the <name>Almighty</name> is breathed into him, and he becomes a living soul.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>After the senses of the idiot are trained to take note of their appropriate objects, the various perceptive faculties are next to be exercised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>The greatest possible number of facts are to be gathered up through the medium of these faculties into the storehouse of memory, from whence eventually the higher faculties of mind may draw the material of general ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/>It has been found difficult, if not impossible, to teach the idiot to read by the letters <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, as in the ordinary method; but while the varied powers of the <num value="3">three</num> letters, <hi rend="italics">h, a, t</hi>, could not be understood by him, he could be made to comprehend the complex sign of the word <hi rend="italics">hat</hi>, made by uniting the <num value="3">three</num>. <pb id="p.216" n="216"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/>The moral nature of the idiot needs training and development as well as his physical and mental.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>All that can be said of him is, that he has the latent capacity for moral development and culture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1765"/>Uninstructed and left to himself, he has no ideas of regulated appetites and propensities, of decency and delicacy of affection and social relations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>The germs of these ideas, which constitute the glory and beauty of humanity, undoubtedly exist in him; but there can be no growth without patient and persevering culture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1767"/>Where this is afforded, to use the language of the report, <q direct="unspecified">the idiot may learn what love is, though he may not know the word which expresses it; he may feel kindly affections while unable to understand the simplest virtuous principle; and he may begin to live acceptably to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> before he has learned the name by which men call him.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1768"/></p> 
<p>In the facts and statistics presented in the report, light is shed upon some of the dark pages of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> providence, and it is seen that the suffering and shame of idiocy are the result of sin, of a violation of the merciful laws of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and of the harmonies of His benign order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1769"/>The penalties which are ordained for the violators of natural laws are inexorable and certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1770"/>For the transgressor of the laws of life there is, as in the case of <persName><foreName>Esau</foreName></persName>, <q direct="unspecified">no place for repentance, though he seek it earnestly and with tears.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1771"/>The curse cleaves to him and his children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1772"/>In this view, how important becomes the subject of the hereditary transmission of moral and physical disease and debility!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1773"/>and how necessary it is that there should be a clearer understanding <pb id="p.217" n="217"/> of, and a willing obedience, at any cost, to the eternal law which makes the parent the blessing or the curse of the child, giving strength and beauty, and the capacity to know and do the will of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, or bequeathing loathsomeness, deformity, and animal appetite, incapable of the restraints of the moral faculties!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1774"/>Even if the labors of <persName n="Howe,Doctor,,,," id="n0318.0004.00217.00368" reg="nearbymention:Howe,Samuel,G.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Howe</surname></persName> and his benevolent associates do not materially lessen the amount of present actual evil and suffering in this respect, they will not be put forth in vain if they have the effect of calling public attention to the great laws of our being, the violation of which has made this goodly earth a vast lazarhouse of pain and sorrow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1775"/>The late annual message of the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> invites our attention to a kindred institution of charity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1776"/>The chief magistrate congratulates the legislature, in language creditable to his mind and heart, on the opening of the <rs type="place">Reform School</rs> for Juvenile Criminals, established by an act of a previous legislature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1777"/>The act provides that, when any boy under <measure n="16years" type="date">sixteen years</measure> of age shall be convicted of crime punishable by imprisonment other than such an offence as is punished by imprisonment for life, he may be, at the discretion of the court or justice, sent to the <rs type="place">State Reform School</rs>, or sentenced to such imprisonment as the law now provides for his offence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1778"/>The school is placed under the care of trustees, who may either refuse to receive a boy thus sent there, or, after he has been received, for reasons set forth in the act, may order him to be committed to prison under the previous penal law of the <pb id="p.218" n="218"/> state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1779"/>They are also authorized to apprentice the boys, at their discretion, to inhabitants of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1780"/>And whenever any boy shall be discharged, either as reformed or as having reached the age of <measure n="21years" type="date">twenty-one years</measure>, his discharge is a full release from his sentence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1781"/>It is made the duty of the trustees to cause the boys to be instructed in piety and morality, and in branches of useful knowledge, in some regular course of labor, mechanical, agricultural, or horticultural, and such other trades and arts as may be best adapted to secure the amendment, reformation, and future benefit of the boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1782"/>The class of offenders for whom this act provides are generally the offspring of parents depraved by crime or suffering from poverty and want,&mdash;the victims often of circumstances of evil which almost constitute a necessity,&mdash;issuing from homes polluted and miserable, from the sight and hearing of loathsome impurities and hideous discords, to avenge upon society the ignorance, and destitution, and neglect with which it is too often justly chargeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1783"/>In <dateStruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></dateStruct> <num value="300">three hundred</num> of these youthful violators of law were sentenced to jails and other places of punishment in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, where they incurred the fearful liability of being still more thoroughly corrupted by contact with older criminals, familiar with atrocity, and rolling their loathsome vices <q direct="unspecified">as a sweet morsel under the tongue.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1784"/>In view of this state of things the <rs type="place">Reform School</rs> has been established, <measure n="22000dollars" type="currency">twenty-two thousand dollars</measure> having been contributed to the state for that purpose by an unknown benefactor of his race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1785"/>The school is <pb id="p.219" n="219"/> located in Westboroa, on a fine farm of <measure n="200acres" type="area">two hundred acres</measure>. The buildings are in the form of a square, with a court in the centre, <num value="3">three</num> stories in front, with wings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1786"/>They are constructed with a good degree of architectural taste, and their site is happily chosen,&mdash;a gentle eminence, overlooking <num value="1">one</num> of the loveliest of the small lakes which form a pleasing feature in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> scenery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1787"/>From this place the atmosphere and associations of the prison are excluded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1788"/>The discipline is strict, as a matter of course; but it is that of a well-regulated home or school-room,&mdash;order, neatness, and harmony within doors; and without, the beautiful sights and sounds and healthful influences of Nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1789"/><num value="1">One</num> would almost suppose that the poetical dream of <persName n="Coleridge,,,,," id="n0318.0004.00219.00369" reg="mostcommon:Coleridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Coleridge</surname></persName>, in his tragedy of <hi rend="italics">Remorse</hi>, had found its realization in the <rs type="place">Westboroa School</rs>, and that, weary of the hopelessness and cruelty of the old penal system, our legislators had embodied in their statutes the idea of the poet:&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1790"/></p><l>With other ministrations thou, O Nature,</l> <l>Healest thy wandering and distempered child:</l> <l>Thou pourest on him thy soft influences,</l> <l>Thy sunny hues, fair forms, and breathing sweets,</l> <l>Thy melodies of woods, and winds, and waters,</l> <l>Till he relent, and can no more endure</l> <l>To be a jarring and a dissonant thing</l> <l>Amidst this general dance and minstrelsy.</l></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1791"/>Thus it is that the <rs>Christian</rs> idea of reformation, rather than revenge, is slowly but surely incorporating itself in our statute books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1792"/>We have only to look back but a single century to be able to appreciate the immense gain for humanity in the treatment of criminals which has been secured in <pb id="p.220" n="220"/> that space of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1793"/>Then the use of torture was common throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1794"/>Inability to comprehend and believe certain religious dogmas was a crime to be expiated by death, or confiscation of estate, or lingering imprisonment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1795"/>Petty offences against property furnished subjects for the hangman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1796"/>The stocks and the whipping-post stood by the side of the meeting-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1797"/>Tongues were bored with redhot irons and ears shorn off. The jails were loathsome dungeons, swarming with vermin, unventilated, unwarmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/>A century and <num value="0.5">a half</num> ago the populace of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> were convulsed with grim merriment at the writhings of a miserable woman scourged at the cart-tail or strangling in the ducking-stool; crowds hastened to enjoy the spectacle of an old man enduring the unutterable torment of the <hi rend="italics">peine forte et dure</hi>,&mdash; pressed slowly to death under planks,&mdash;for refusing to plead to all indictment for witchcraft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1799"/>What a change from all this to the opening of the <rs type="place">State Reform School</rs>, to the humane regulations of prisons and penitentiaries, to keen-eyed benevolence watching over the administration of justice, which, in securing society from lawless aggression, is not suffered to overlook the true interest and reformation of the criminal, nor to forget that the magistrate, in the words of the <name>Apostle</name>, is to be indeed <q direct="unspecified">the minister of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to man for good</q> </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1800"/><q direct="unspecified">they that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick,</q> was the significant answer of our <rs type="role2">Lord</rs> to the self-righteous Pharisees who took offence at his companions,&mdash;the poor, the degraded, the weak, and the sinful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1801"/><q direct="unspecified">Go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice; for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1802"/></p> 
<p>The great lesson of duty inculcated by this answer of the <rs>Divine Teacher</rs> has been too long overlooked by individuals and communities professedly governed by His maxims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1803"/>The phylacteries of our modern Pharisees are as broad as those of the old <persName n="Jewish,,,,," id="n0318.0004.00221.00370" reg="mostcommon:Jewish,nomatch:0"><surname>Jewish</surname></persName> saints.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1804"/>The respectable <rs>Christian</rs> detests his vicious and ill-conditioned neighbors as heartily as the <name>Israelite</name> did the publicans and sinners of his day. He folds his robe of self-righteousness closely about him, and denounces as little better than sinful weakness all commiseration for the guilty; and all attempts to restore and reclaim the erring violators of human law otherwise than by pains and penalties as wicked collusion with crime, dangerous to the stability and safety of society, and offensive in the sight of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1805"/>And yet nothing is more certain than that, just in proportion as the example of our <rs type="role2">Lord</rs> has been followed in respect to the outcast and criminal, the effect has been to <pb id="p.222" n="222"/> reform and elevate,&mdash;to snatch as brands from the burning souls not yet wholly given over to the service of evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/>The wonderful influence for good exerted over the most degraded and reckless criminals of <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> by the excellent and self-denying <persName n="Fry,,Elizabeth,,," id="n0318.0004.00222.00371" reg="default:Fry,Elizabeth,,,"><foreName>Elizabeth</foreName> <surname>Fry</surname></persName>, the happy results of the establishment of houses of refuge, and reformation, and <persName><foreName>Magdalen</foreName></persName> asylums, all illustrate the wisdom of Him who went about doing good, in pointing out the morally diseased as the appropriate subjects of the benevolent labors of His disciples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1807"/>No <num value="1">one</num> is to be despaired of. We have no warrant to pass by any of our fellow-creatures as beyond the reach of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> grace and mercy; for, beneath the most repulsive and hateful outward manifestation, there is always a consciousness of the beauty of goodness and purity, and of the loathsomeness of sin,&mdash; <num value="1">one</num> chamber of the heart as yet not wholly profaned, whence at times arises the prayer of a burdened and miserable spirit for deliverance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1808"/>Deep down under the squalid exterior, unparticipative in the hideous merriment and recklessness of the criminal, there is another self,&mdash;a chained and suffering inner man,&mdash;crying out, in the intervals of intoxication and brutal excesses, like <persName><foreName>Jonah</foreName></persName> from the bosom of hell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1809"/>To this lingering consciousness the sympathy and kindness of benevolent and humane spirits seldom appeal in vain; for, whatever may be outward appearances, it remains true that the way of the transgressor is hard, and that sin and suffering are inseparable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1810"/>Crime is seldom loved or persevered in for its own sake; but, when once the evil path is entered upon, a return is <pb id="p.223" n="223"/> in reality extremely difficult to the unhappy wanderer, and often seems wellnigh impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1811"/>The laws of social life rise up like insurmountable barriers between him and escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>As he turns towards the society whose rights he has outraged, its frown settles upon him; the penalties of the laws he has violated await him; and he falls back despairing, and suffers the fetters of the evil habit to whose power he has yielded himself to be fastened closer and heavier upon him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1813"/>We have been led into these remarks by an account, given in the <hi rend="italics">London Weekly Chronicle</hi>, of a most remarkable interview between the professional thieves of <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> and <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Ashley</foreName></persName>,&mdash;a gentleman whose best patent of nobility is to be found in his generous and untiring devotion to the interests of his fellow-men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1819"/>Here, to his surprise, he met a number of thieves and outlaws, who declared themselves extremely anxious to know whether any hope could be held out to them of obtaining an honest living, however humble, in the colonies, as their only reason for continuing in their criminal course was the impossibility of extricating themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>He gave them such advice and encouragement as he was able, and invited them to assemble again, with such of their companions as they could persuade to do so, at the room of the <name>Irish</name> <orgName n="Free School" type="school">Free School</orgName>, for the purpose of meeting <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Ashley</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2305"/>The world about us moves with accelerated impulse, and we move with it: the rest we have enjoyed, whether true or false, is broken; the title-deeds of our opinions, the reason of our practices, are demanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2306"/>Our very right to exist as a distinct society is questioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2307"/>Our old literature&mdash;the precious journals and <pb id="p.306" n="306"/> biographies of early and later Friends&mdash;is comparatively neglected for sensational and dogmatic publications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2308"/>We bear complaints of a want of educated ministers; the utility of silent meetings is denied, and praying and preaching regarded as matters of will and option.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2314"/>My life has been nearly spent in laboring with those of other sects in behalf of the suffering and enslaved; and I have never felt like quarrelling with Orthodox or Unitarians, who were willing to pull with me, side by side, at the rope of Reform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2315"/>A very large proportion of my dearest personal friends are outside of our communion; and I have learned with <persName n="Woolman,,John,,," id="n0318.0004.00306.00500" reg="default:Woolman,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Woolman</surname></persName> to find <q direct="unspecified">no narrowness respecting sects and opinions.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2316"/>But after a kindly and candid survey of them all, I turn to my own Society, thankful to the <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name> which placed me where I am; and with an unshaken faith in the <num value="1">one</num> distinctive doctrine of Quakerism &mdash;the <name>Light</name> within&mdash;the immanence of the <rs>Divine Spirit</rs> in Christianity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2317"/>I cheerfully recognize and bear testimony to the good works and lives of <pb id="p.307" n="307"/> those who widely differ in faith and practice; but I have seen no truer types of Christianity, no better men and women, than I have known and still know among those who not blindly, but intelligently, hold the doctrines and maintain the testimonies of our early Friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2318"/>I am not blind to the shortcomings of Friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2319"/>I know how much we have lost by narrowness and coldness and inactivity, the overestimate of external observances, the neglect of our own proper work while acting as conscience-keepers for others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2320"/>We have not, as a society, been active enough in those simple duties which we owe to our suffering fellow-creatures, in that abundant labor of love and self-denial which is never out of place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2321"/>Perhaps our divisions and dissensions might have been spared us if we had been less <q direct="unspecified">at ease in <placeName key="possibilities=24" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Zion</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2322"/>It is in the decline of practical righteousness that men are most likely to contend with each other for dogma and ritual, for shadow and letter, instead of substance and spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2323"/>Hence I rejoice in every sign of increased activity in doing good among us, in the precious opportunities afforded of working with the <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name> for the <name>Freedmen</name> and <name>Indians</name>; since the more we do, in the true spirit of the gospel, for others, the more we shall really do for ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2324"/>There is no danger of lack of work for those who, with an eye single to the guidance of Truth, look for a place in <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> vineyard; the great work which the founders of our Society began is not yet done; the mission of Friends is not accomplished, and will not be until this world of ours, now full of sin and suffering, shall take <pb id="p.308" n="308"/> up, in jubilant thanksgiving, the song of the <name>Advent</name>: <q direct="unspecified">Glory to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in the highest!

<p>It is charged that our Society lacks freedom and adaptation to the age in which we live, that there is a repression of individuality and manliness among us. I am not prepared to deny it in certain respects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2327"/>But, if we look at the matter closely, we shall see that the cause is not in the central truth of Quakerism, but in a failure to rightly comprehend it; in an attempt to fetter with forms and hedge about with dogmas that great law of <name>Christian</name> liberty, which I believe affords ample scope for the highest spiritual aspirations and the broadest philanthropy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2328"/>If we did but realize it, we are <q direct="unspecified">set in a large place.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2333"/>We shall gain nothing by aping the customs and trying to adjust ourselves to the creeds of other sects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2334"/>By so doing we make at the best a very awkward combination, and just as far <pb id="p.309" n="309"/> as it is successful, it is at the expense of much that is vital in our old faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2337"/>I am not insensible of the need of spiritual renovation in our Society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2338"/>I feel and confess my own deficiencies as an individual member.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2339"/>And I bear a willing testimony to the zeal and devotion of some dear friends, who, lamenting the low condition and worldliness too apparent among us, seek to awaken a stronger religious life by the partial adoption of the practices, forms, and creeds of more demonstrative sects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2340"/>The great apparent activity of these sects seems to them to contrast very strongly with our quietness and reticence; and they do not always pause to inquire whether the result of this activity is a truer type of practical Christianity than is found in our select gatherings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2341"/>I think I understand these brethren; to some extent I have sympathized with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2342"/>But it seems clear to me, that a remedy for the alleged evil lies not in going back to the <q direct="unspecified">beggarly elements</q> from which our worthy ancestors called the people of their generation; <pb id="p.310" n="310"/> not in will-worship; not in setting the letter above the spirit; not in substituting type and symbol, and oriental figure and hyperbole for the simple truths they were intended to represent; not in schools of theology; not in much speaking and noise and vehemence, nor in vain attempts to make the <q direct="unspecified">plain language</q> of Quakerism utter the <name>Shibboleth</name> of man-made creeds: but in heeding more closely the <rs>Inward Guide</rs> and Teacher; in faith in <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0318.0004.00310.00505" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> not merely in His historical manifestation of the <rs>Divine Love</rs> to humanity, but in His living presence in the hearts open to receive Him; in love for Him manifested in denial of self, in charity and love to our neighbor; and in a deeper realization of the truth of the apostle's declaration: <q direct="unspecified">Pure religion and undefiled before <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the <rs>Father</rs> is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2343"/></p> 
<p>In conclusion, let me say that I have given this expression of my opinions with some degree of hesitation, being very sensible that I have neither the right nor the qualification to speak for a society whose doctrines and testimonies commend themselves to my heart and head, whose history is rich with the precious legacy of holy lives, and of whose usefulness as a moral and spiritual Force in the world I am fully assured.</p></body></text> </p></div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2823"/>Looking at the matter from the point of theory only, we should say that a physician could not be otherwise than melancholy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2824"/>A merry doctor!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2825"/>Why, <num value="1">one</num> might as well talk of a laughing death's head,&mdash;the cachinnation of a monk's <hi rend="italics">memento mori</hi>. This life of ours is sorrowful enough at its best estate; the brightest phase of it is <q direct="unspecified">sicklied o'er with the pale cast</q> of the future or the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2826"/>But it is the special vocation of the doctor to look only upon the shadow; to turn away from the house of feasting and go down to that of mourning; to breathe day after day the atmosphere of wretchedness; to grow familiar with suffering; to look upon humanity disrobed of its pride and glory, robbed of all its fictitious ornaments,&mdash;weak, helpless, naked,&mdash;and undergoing the last fearful metempsychosis <pb id="p.375" n="375"/> from its erect and godlike image, the living temple of an enshrined divinity, to the loathsome clod and the inanimate dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2827"/>Of what ghastly secrets of moral and physical disease is he the depositary!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2828"/>There is woe before him and behind him; he is hand and glove with misery by prescription,&mdash;the <hi rend="italics">ex oficio</hi> gauger of the ills that flesh is heir to. He has no home, unless it be at the bedside of the querulous, the splenetic, the sick, and the dying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2829"/>He sits down to carve his turkey, and is summoned off to a <hi rend="italics">post-mortem</hi> examination of another sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2830"/>All the diseases which <placeName reg="Milton, Caswell, North Carolina" key="tgn,2075706">Milton</placeName>'s imagination embodied in the lazarhouse dog his footsteps and pluck at his doorbell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2831"/>Hurrying from <num value="1">one</num> place to another at their beck, he knows nothing of the quiet comfort of the <q direct="unspecified">sleek-headed men who sleep oa nights.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2832"/>His wife, if he has <num value="1">one</num>, has an undoubted right to advertise him as a deserter of <q direct="unspecified">bed and board.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2833"/>His ideas of beauty, the imaginations of his brain, and the affections of his heart are regulated and modified by the irrepressible associations of his luckless profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2834"/>Woman as well as man is to him of the earth, earthy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2835"/>He sees incipient disease where the uninitiated see only delicacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2836"/>A smile reminds him of his dental operations; a blushing cheek of his hectic patients; pensive melancholy is dyspepsia; sentimentalism, nervousness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2837"/>Tell him of lovelorn hearts, of the <q direct="unspecified">worm ia the bud,</q> of the mental impalement upon <persName n="Cupid,,,,," id="n0318.0005.00375.00652" reg="mostcommon:Cupid,nomatch:0"><surname>Cupid</surname></persName>'s arrow, like that of a giaour upon the spear of a janizary, and he can only think of lack of exercise, of tightlacing, and slippers in winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2840"/>Then her skin,&mdash;smooth and white as a gallipot; her mouth as round and not larger than that of a penny vial; and her teeth,&mdash;none of your sturdy fixtures,&mdash;ache as they would, it was only a small pull, and out they came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2841"/>I believe I have drawn half a score of her dear pearls. [ <hi rend="italics">Weeps</hi>.] But what avails her beauty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2842"/>She has gone, and left no little babe to hang like a label on papa's neck!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2843"/></p> 
<p>So much for speculation and theory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2844"/>In practice it is not so bad after all. The grave-digger in <hi rend="italics">Hamlet</hi> has his jokes and grim jests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2845"/>We have known many a jovial sexton; and we have heard clergymen laugh heartily at small provocation close on the heel of a cool calculation that the great majority of their fellow-creatures were certain of going straight to perdition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2846"/>Why, then, should not even the doctor have his fun?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2847"/>Nay, is it not his duty to be merry, by main force if necessary <persName><foreName>Solomon</foreName></persName>, who, from his great knowledge of herbs, must have been no mean practitioner for his day, tells us that <q direct="unspecified">a merry heart doeth good like a medicine;</q>and universal experience has confirmed the truth of his maxim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2848"/>Hence it is, doubtless, that we have so many anecdotes of facetious doctors, distributing their pills and jokes together, shaking at the same time the contents of their vials and the sides of their patients.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2849"/>It is merely <pb id="p.377" n="377"/> professional, a trick of the practice, unquestionably, in most cases; but sometimes it is a <q direct="unspecified">natural gift,</q> like that of the <q direct="unspecified">bonesetters,</q> and <q direct="unspecified">scrofula strokers,</q> and <q direct="unspecified">cancer curers,</q> who carry on a sort of guerilla war with human maladies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2850"/>Such we know to be the case with <persName n="Holmes,Doctor,,,," id="n0318.0005.00377.00655" reg="nearbymention:Holmes,Oliver,Wendell,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Holmes</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2851"/>He was born for the <q direct="unspecified">laughter cure,</q> as certainly as Priessnitz was for the <q direct="unspecified">water cure,</q> and has been quite as successful in his way, while his prescriptions are infinitely more agreeable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2852"/>The volume now before us gives, in addition to the poems and lyrics contained in the <num value="2">two</num> previous editions, some <num value="100">hundred</num> or more pages of the later productions of the author, in the sprightly vein, and marked by the brilliant fancy and felicitous diction for which the former were noteworthy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2853"/>His longest and most elaborate poem, <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Urania,,,,," id="n0318.0005.00377.00656" reg="mostcommon:Urania,nomatch:0"><surname>Urania</surname></persName>, is</hi> perhaps the best specimen of his powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2854"/>Its general tone is playful and humorous; but there are passages of great tenderness and pathos.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2855"/>Witness the following, from a description of the city churchgoers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2996"/>Its heroes were beastly revellers or cruel and ferocious plunderers; its heroines unsexed hoidens, playing the ugliest tricks with their lovers, and repaying slights with bloody revenge, &mdash;very dangerous and unsatisfactory companions for any other than the fire-eating Vikings and red-handed, unwashed Berserkers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2997"/>Significant of a religion which reverenced the strong rather than the good, and which regarded as meritorious the unrestrained indulgence of the passions, it delighted to sing the praises of some coarse debauch or pitiless slaughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3001"/>And is it not <num value="1">one</num> of the strongest proofs of the divine life and power of that Gospel, that, under its influence, the hard and cruel Norse heart has been so softened and humanized that at this moment <num value="1">one</num> of the best illustrations of the peaceful and gentle virtues which it inculcates is afforded by the descendants of the sea-kings and robbers of the middle centuries?
