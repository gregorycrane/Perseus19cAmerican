<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/><persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0037.0001.00001.00001" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> was born in <dateStruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>He died in <dateStruct value="1889--"><year reg="1889">1889</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>During the intervening period of over fourscore years, by his stainless personal character; by his unflagging and unselfish devotion to the interests of the <rs>South</rs>; by his unsurpassed ability as an exponent and champion of her rights and principles, as well as by his distinguished public services in peace and war, and his high official station, he was universally regarded, both at home and abroad, as pre-eminently the representative of a great era, a great cause, and a great people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>The era is closed, the cause sleeps, but the people survive, and revere the memory, and mourn him dead, whom, living, they delighted to honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>It is for them that I write this memoir and vindication of his political action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>In vindicating him I also vindicate them; for he spent <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> his long life in their service, and was rewarded with their love and confidence from his cradle to his grave. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>In the fulfilment of this sacred task I shall endeavor to be guided by the spirit that inspired him during his whole life &mdash; a spirit of unswerving devotion to truth and duty, of unyielding antagonism against all assailants of justice, without regard to their prejudices or their numbers, but mindful of the fact that every opponent, even to the death, is not necessarily an enemy, and that sincerity of belief is entitled to respectful consideration even when found arrayed against us. I shall endeavor to do exact and equal justice to the antagonists of the <rs>South</rs>, as well as to her leaders; <quote>naught to extenuate, nor set down aught in malice.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>If I fail, it will be because my love for the <rs>Southern</rs> people, and their lost cause and leader, may unconsciously influence my judgment of the men and beliefs that were arrayed in deadly conflict during the war between the <name>States</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>As to the plan of the work, I shall endeavor, as far as possible, to make the book an autobiography &mdash; to tell the story of my husband's life in his own words; to complete the task he left unfinished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>For, during the last year of his life, after having spent the summer in preparing <quote><hi rend="italics">A</hi> Short History of the <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>,</quote> he yielded to the repeated requests, both of his personal friends and publishers, to write an autobiography. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Shortly before his last journey to <placeName reg="Briarfield, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2193949">Briarfield</placeName> he dictated to a friend, as an introductory chapter, this account of his ancestry and early boyhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>He was too weak to sit up long at a time, and lay in bed while his friend and I sat by and listened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>No verbal or other change has been made in the dictation, which <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0037.0001.00003.00002" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> did not read over: </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> At the close of the war he returned to his home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>In the meantime his mother had died, and the movable property had been scattered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The place was a wreck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It was a home no more; so he settled near <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>His early education had qualified him for the position of county clerk, and the people, who had known him from boyhood, gave him that office. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>During his service in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> he had met my mother, and after the war they were married.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>She was of Scotch-<name>Irish</name> descent, and was noted for her beauty and sprightliness of mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>She had a graceful poetic mind, which, with much of her personal beauty, she retained to extreme old age. My father, also, was unusually handsome, and the accomplished horseman his early life among the <q direct="unspecified"> mounted men</q> of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> naturally made him.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>At this point of the narrative my husband was interrupted by a question, which he answered <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> by relating this anecdote about his father: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The last time I saw my father he was <measure n="64years" type="date">sixty-four years</measure> of age. He was about to mount a tall and restless horse, so that it was difficult for him to put his foot in the stirrup.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Suddenly he vaulted from the ground into the saddle without any assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>He was usually of a grave and stoical character, and of such sound judgment that his opinions were a law to his children, and quoted by them long after he had gone to his final rest, and when they were growing old.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> During my infancy my father removed to <placeName reg="Lower Atchafalaya River, Louisiana, United States" key="tgn,2473217">Bayou Teche, in Louisiana</placeName>; but, as his children suffered from acclimatization, he sought a higher and healthier district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>He found a place that suited him about a mile east of <placeName reg="Woodville, Wilkinson, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057811">Woodville, in Wilkinson County</placeName>, Miss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>For this purpose a county court, consisting of a justice and quorum, ordered a draft for a certain number of men to stay at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The land near the river, although very hilly, was quite rich.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>After we had become somewhat calmer, I inquired for my father, and was told he was out in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/> A task had been assigned me in excess of my power to memorize.

<p>The next day, furnished with a bag, I went into the fields and worked all day and the day after.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>The heat of the sun and the physical labor, in conjunction with the implied equality with the other cotton-pickers, <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> convinced me that school was the lesser evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>This change of opinion I stated to my father when coming from the field, after my day's cotton had been weighed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>He received the confidence with perfect seriousness, mentioned the disadvantages under which a man, gently bred, suffers when choosing a laborer's vocation, and advised me, if I was of the same opinion the next day, to return to school; which I did, and quietly took my accustomed place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>He had probably arranged with the teacher to receive me without noticing my revolt. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/> The dominies of that period were not usually university men.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>The method of instruction in these old log <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> school-houses was very simple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>It consisted solely of a long copy-book &mdash; the qualifications required of the teacher being that he should be able to write at the head of each page the pot-hooks, letters, and sentences which were to be copied by the pupil on each line of the paper. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/> As the pupil advanced, he was required to have a book for his sums.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>He worked out the examples in the arithmetic, and, after a sufficient amount of attention, he was required to copy this into a book, which, when it was completed, was the evidence that he understood arithmetic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>After some time a bright boy could repeat all the rules; but if you asked him to explain why, when he added up a column of figures, he set down the right and carried the left-hand figure, he could give the rule, but no reason for it. And I am not sure that, as a general thing, the teacher could have explained it to him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>The log-cabin schools were not public schools in the sense in which that term is used to-day &mdash; for the teacher was supported by the fees charged every pupil. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> The path along which I travelled to the school-house passed by the residence of an old dominie who had a great contempt for Latin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>He explained to them that with him it was a profession; that he agreed to preach for a stipulated salary; but, unless he thought he was doing good, which the absence of the people showed to be doubtful, he was neither willing to preach nor to receive the salary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>He continued solely under the pay received as principal of the <name>Academy</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/> He was a quiet, just man, and I am sure he taught me more in the time I was with him than I ever learned from any <num value="1">one</num> else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>Of course I disliked to go down from the head class of <num value="1">one</num> institution to the lowest in another; but I yielded and went to <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, to find that I was too late; that all the candidates had been admitted in <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> or the <dateStruct value="-09-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>; that the classes were engaged in their studies; and that the rule was absolute as to the time of admission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>This chance caused me also to be examined, and to be admitted out of rule. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/> As soon as permission was given to appear <pb id="p.35" n="35"/> before the staff, <persName n="Hitchcock,Captain,,,," id="n0037.0004.00035.00099" reg="mostcommon:Hitchcock,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Hitchcock</surname></persName> came and told me that I would be examined, particularly in arithmetic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>He asked, <q direct="unspecified"> I suppose you have learned arithmetic?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>To which I had to answer in the negative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>But I added that I had learned some algebra and some geometry, and also some application of algebra.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>He was quite alarmed, and went off and got me an arithmetic, telling me to study as much as I could of fractions and proportion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>I had hardly commenced when an order came to bring me before the staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>The professor of mathematics asked me <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> questions in regard to vulgar fractions and the difference between vulgar and decimal fractions, which I knew enough algebra to answer, and then asked how, the <num value="3">three</num> terms of a direct proportion being given, I would put the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>I answered that the proportion was that the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> should bear to the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> the relation that the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> did to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>. <q direct="unspecified">Certainly, certainly,</q> he said, probably thinking that I knew a great deal more than I did.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>To his gratification he learned that I read <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName>, and launched into a discussion of some <pb id="p.36" n="36"/> questions as to the construction of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName>, with which he was so delighted that he kept on till the superintendent stopped him, and that broke up my examination. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>In appearance and manner he seemed to belong to the pulpit, and he had a peculiar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>From its highest tones it would sink to a whisper, and yet be audible throughout the whole chapel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>His sermons, according to the usage of his Church &mdash; the <name>Episcopalian</name> &mdash; were written beforehand; but, occasionally, he would burst forth in a grand tide of oratory, clearly unpremeditated, and more irresistible than it probably would have been had it been carefully written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>For example: He was once preaching, and, just behind him, was visible the mountain pass through which the <pb id="p.38" n="38"/> <persName n="Hudson,,,,," id="n0037.0004.00038.00108" reg="mostcommon:Hudson,nomatch:0"><surname>Hudson</surname></persName> flows, when a gathering storm was seen approaching <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>That coming storm he wove into his sermon, so that the crash of <num value="1">one</num> fitted into a great outburst of the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>They seemed to belong to <num value="1">one</num> another &mdash; the sermon and the storm. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/> Among the cadets then and subsequently distinguished was <persName n="Bache,,Alexander,D.,," id="n0037.0004.00038.00109" reg="default:Bache,Alexander,D.,,"><foreName>Alexander</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Bache</surname></persName>, the head of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> or graduating class, when I entered the <name>Academy</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>He was a grandson of <persName n="Franklin,,Benjamin,,," id="n0037.0004.00038.00110" reg="default:Franklin,Benjamin,,,"><foreName>Benjamin</foreName> <surname>Franklin</surname></persName>, and, to the extraordinary genius of his grandfather, was added an elementary education in physical science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>He had a power of demonstration beyond that of any man I ever heard; so much so that, by way of illustration, I have often stated that I believe he could explain the highest astronomical problems to any <num value="1">one</num> of good understanding, if he would acknowledge at the beginning his entire ignorance and admit when he did not understand any point in the progress of the demonstration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>He graduated at the head of his class in <dateStruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>He resigned after a few years' service in the <orgName type="mil" key="EngCorps">Engineer Corps</orgName> of the army, became <rs type="role2">President</rs> of <orgName n="Girard College" type="college">Girard College</orgName>, and went abroad to study the <rs>European</rs> system of instruction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>After his return from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> we met, and he told me that the thing which surprised him most was the system of the <rs type="place">West Point</rs> <pb id="p.39" n="39"/> Academy, where any boy, regardless of his endowments or previous preparation, was required to learn the same things in the allotted time; and implied that, what astonished him most was that he should have gone through the <name>Academy</name> without even realizing that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>In defence of the institution I reminded him that it was not intended for popular education, but to prepare as many as were required from year to year for appointments in the army; that, therefore, it might well be that <num value="1">one</num> might have a genius for something not specially required of a soldier, and be unable to learn a thing that was needful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>The consequence would be that he would have to carry his talents into some calling for which he was especially endowed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/> To take this extraordinary genius for illustration, though he readily mastered every branch of the curriculum of the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName>, and would doubtless have been useful as an engineer in the army, his career as a civilian proved that another field was more peculiarly his, and that he could there render greater service to his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>In the succeeding class, the cadet who held the first place was <persName n="Bartlett,,William,H.,C.," id="n0037.0004.00040.00117" reg="default:Bartlett,William,H.,C.,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Bartlett</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>He is a man of such solid merit and exemption from pretensions that I am sure he will pardon me for stating in regard to him what may be a useful incentive to others under like embarrassments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>The C in his name stands for <persName n="Chambers,,,,," id="n0037.0004.00040.00118" reg="mostcommon:Chambers,nomatch:0"><surname>Chambers</surname></persName>, the <rs>Colonel</rs> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">First Infantry</orgName>, who was interested in the boy and secured for him an appointment as cadet, when <persName n="Chambers,,,,," id="n0037.0004.00040.00119" reg="mostcommon:Chambers,nomatch:0"><surname>Chambers</surname></persName> was gratefully added to his <name>Christian</name> name as a token of his obligation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>His own preparation had been so small that, in addition to learning his lessons at night, he told me that he had to use a dictionary to find out the meaning of the words in the text, and an English grammar to teach him how to construct his sentences in demonstrations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>Yet, despite these drawbacks, he led his class from <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/><pb id="p.41" n="41"/> </p> 
<p>After graduation he was assigned to the <rs>Corps</rs> of Engineers, and afterward was employed as <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Professor">Assistant Professor</rs> of Engineering in the <name>Academy</name>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>In his conduct there was a total want of self-assertion, and a modesty which rendered him prone to believe that others possessed the same capacity as himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>For example, he offered me the last book he wrote on natural philosophy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>With thanks I told him <quote>it had more mathematics, no doubt, than I could master.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1524"/>He pondered and dictated it to me, and the delivery was to consume half an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1525"/>The <quote>inland seas</quote> were gracefully left to take care of their own shores, and the speech, as written, had an amount of pretty imagery and lofty rhetoric in it, that, to my girlish taste, was as wonderful as it was charming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1526"/>It had the usual stanzas of poetry, and the ship of state tossing, as it does for all young orators, on a stormy sea, while the statesman addressed took its bearings and brought it <quote>safe into port!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1528"/>It was my <pb id="p.209" n="209"/> glorious privilege to be permitted to perpetuate such eloquence!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/>We then prepared our house for a long absence, and commenced our journey to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, taking with us our niece, <persName n="Bradford,Miss,Mary,,," id="n0037.0020.00209.00793" reg="default:Bradford,Mary,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <foreName>Mary</foreName> <surname>Bradford</surname></persName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1532"/>The boat was delayed and the guest of the evening did not arrive until the large assemblage were tired out. Then, after rustlings, cranings of necks, and whispered remonstrances at the delay, the door opened, and the committee, escorting <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0037.0020.00209.00796" reg="nearbymention:Calhoun,John,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>, entered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1533"/>My Whig proclivities had inclined me to be coolly civil to the stern zealot with whom I could feel no sympathy; but when <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0037.0020.00209.00797" reg="nearbymention:Calhoun,John,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>, with head erect, cast his eagle eyes over the crowd, I felt like rising up to do homage to a king among men. His head was long rather than broad, the ears were placed low upon it, the depth from front to back was very great; his forehead was low, steep, and beetled squarely over the most glorious pair of yellow brown shining eyes, that seemed to have a <pb id="p.210" n="210"/> light inherent in themselves; they looked steadily out from under bushy eyebrows that made the deep sockets look still more sunken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/>When excited, the pupils filled the iris and made his eyes seem black.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/>He lowered them less than any <num value="1">one</num> I have ever seen; they were steadily bent on the object with which he was engaged; indeed on some people they had an almost mesmeric power. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/>He wore his thick hair all the same length, and rather long, combed straight back from his forehead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/>This, with his brilliant eyes and unflinching gaze, gave his head the expression of an eagle's. His mouth was wide and straight; he rarely smiled, and the firm, square chin and grave manner made a personality striking in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>He was tall and slenderly built, quick and alert in both speech and movement, but mind and body were so equally and rarely adjusted to each other that no dignity could be more supreme that <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0037.0020.00210.00798" reg="nearbymention:Calhoun,John,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>'s. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>His voice was not musical; it was the voice of a professor of mathematics, and suited his didactic discourse admirably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>He made few gestures, but those nervous, gentlemanly hands seemed to point the way to empire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1541"/>He always appeared to me rather as a moral and mental abstraction than a politician, and it was impossible, knowing him well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1542"/>to <pb id="p.211" n="211"/> associate him with mere personal ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/>His theories and his sense of duty alone dominated him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1544"/>Now the forthcoming speech of welcome was to be delivered, and I was for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time to hear my husband address an assembly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1545"/>Dread was the prevailing feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1546"/>The world had not then given its <foreign lang="la">imprimatur</foreign> to him, and I felt like a mute inglorious <placeName reg="Columbus, Lowndes, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056204">Columbus</placeName> who had discovered a new continent, and that my El-Dorado was to enrich the <num value="1000000">millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1547"/>He had asked me not to look at him while speaking, so I heard only his beautiful voice, expressive of respectful regard in every tone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1548"/>He greeted the great statesman with a few words of personal and general welcome, and then began, in rather a slow manner, evidently trying to remember the aforesaid speech ; but as he progressed his voice grew round and clearer until it filled the large hall to the echo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1549"/>Without pausing for a word, he passed in rapid review the tariff, the currency, the probable addition of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> to the Union-which was then an exciting theme &mdash; as there were many opponents of the measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1550"/>He did not even look askance at nullification, or internal improvements by the <rs>General Government</rs>, but made a strong appeal for strict construction of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and an eloquent statement of the power, the glory, and the <pb id="p.212" n="212"/> danger of our country; a short review of <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0037.0020.00212.00799" reg="nearbymention:Calhoun,John,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>'s career as <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, <rs type="role2">Senator</rs>, and <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice-President</rs>; and then came to the home-stretch with State rights sails all set and <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0037.0020.00212.00800" reg="nearbymention:Calhoun,John,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> at the helm. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1551"/>Round after round of applause greeted the orator, and then <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0037.0020.00212.00801" reg="nearbymention:Calhoun,John,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> deliberately arose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1552"/>After the enthusiastic greeting had subsided, amid profound silence, I heard him for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1553"/>His language was plain to poverty; he never used a trope or simile; and seemed to argue as though alone with <num value="1">one</num> man, and he a devoted patriot, who only aimed to know the right to do it with all his might. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1555"/>The duty of a citizen to the <rs>State</rs> was his theme; the reward he offered was the consciousness of having performed it faithfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1556"/>He spoke so fast, in words so concise, that the loss of <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> rendered it hard to follow him. He borrowed nothing from the style or thoughts of authors of the past or present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1557"/>It was the chart of his faith which he turned toward us and explained its bearings, taking it for granted we were to sail with him; and I do not think any <num value="1">one</num> present would have hesitated then to do so. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1558"/>When the applause which followed subsided a little, he passed from <num value="1">one</num> lady to another, <pb id="p.213" n="213"/> saying to each a few words without a trace of gallantry; yet, though he was gray and much emaciated, the fire within made him seem hardly to have reached middle age. He devoted a little more time than to others to the wife of the orator of the evening, and his manner was so paternal and full of indulgent sympathy that I found myself telling him what a grief it was to contemplate my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> separation from my mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1559"/>He spoke of a daughter named <persName n="Cornelia,,,,," id="n0037.0020.00213.00803" reg="mostcommon:Cornelia,nomatch:0"><surname>Cornelia</surname></persName>, near my age, who loved him better than any <num value="1">one</num> else, and told some little anecdotes of her, and of his brilliant <persName n="Anna,,,,," id="n0037.0020.00213.00804" reg="mostcommon:Anna,Santa,,,:13"><surname>Anna</surname></persName>, who married <persName n="Clemsen,Mister,,,," id="n0037.0020.00213.00805" reg="mostcommon:Clemsen,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clemsen</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1560"/>Thus began a friendship which lasted through his life, and was attested by long letters on governmental subjects, written as though to an intellectual equal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1561"/>It was <num value="1">one</num> of the sources of his power over the youth of the country that he assumed nothing except a universal, honest, co-intelligence between him and the world, and his conversation with a girl was on the same subjects as with a statesman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1562"/>His perceptions were so quick, however, that after a few words in response to him he would interject, <quote>Yes, Yes, I know what you mean,</quote> and proceed to answer at once to the unexpressed opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1563"/>His letters were all lost during the war; but it was I and not posterity that sustained the misfortune, <pb id="p.214" n="214"/> for his handwriting, though it looked neat, was almost undecipherable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1564"/>I once sent him back his letter to read for me, and he responded, <quote>I know what I think on this subject, but cannot decipher what I wrote.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1565"/></p> 
<p>These <num value="2">two</num> speeches, the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> I had ever heard &mdash; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was <num value="1">one</num> by Sargent Prentiss-excited me greatly; but when a lull came, a certain pity for the loss to the world of the written speech over which we had toiled so industriously came upon me. Not <num value="1">one</num> word had been repeated of all the very fine things I had indited in a fair hand-and all for nothing!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1566"/>However, the amateur reporters had entirely forgotten their object, and neglected to give the speech as it was delivered; we had no time to rewrite it, so the other was printed instead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1567"/>If still in existence, it will be a thing of joy to the young people, but very unlike the address, or any other <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0037.0020.00214.00806" reg="nearbymention:Davis,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> ever made afterward. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1568"/>From that day forth no speech was ever written for delivery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1569"/>Dates and names were jotted down on <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3inches" type="distance">three inches</measure> of paper, and these sufficed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1570"/><persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0037.0020.00214.00807" reg="nearbymention:Davis,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>'s speeches never read as they were delivered; he spoke fast, and thoughts crowded each other closely; a certain magnetism of manner and the exceeding beauty and charm of his voice moved the multitude, and there were apparently <pb id="p.215" n="215"/> no inattentive or indifferent listeners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1571"/>He had <num value="1">one</num> power that I have never seen excelled; while speaking, he took in the individuality of the crowd, and seeing doubt or a lack of coincidence with him in their faces, he answered the mental dissonance with arguments addressed to the case in their minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1572"/>He was never tiresome, because, as he said, he <quote>gave close attention to the necessity of stopping when he was done.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1573"/></p> 
<p>Only so much of his eloquence has survived as was indifferently reported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1574"/>The spirit of the graceful periods was lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1575"/>He was a parenthetical speaker, which was a defect in a written oration, but it did not, when uttered, impair the quality of his speeches, but rather added a charm when accentuated by his voice and commended by his gracious manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1576"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> his style was ornate, and poetry and fiction were pressed from his crowded memory into service; but it soon changed into a plain and stronger cast of what he considered to be, and doubtless was, the higher kind of oratory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1577"/>His extempore addresses are models of grace and ready command of language. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1578"/>The next day we took a boat for <placeName key="tgn,7014620" n="1.000 73" reg="wheeling, ohio, west virginia">Wheeling</placeName>, which was the route usually pursued by persons going <name>North</name> at that season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1580"/>This was called the <quote>Southern route,</quote> and consumed <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure> and nights of hard travel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1581"/>There were no sleeping cars, and the only way to get rest, if greatly fatigued, was to stop overnight at some miserable little inn and lose a day, or go on and trust to a good constitution to bear <num value="1">one</num> through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1582"/>This latter mode we preferred. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1583"/>The river soon began to be full of floating ice, which crunched alarmingly against the sides of the boat, and, after making very little headway, we ascended the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio River</placeName> to what the captain called the <quote>Norrows.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1584"/>The ice closed around us, and we remained on board nearly a week, hoping for a thaw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1585"/>Here we had an amusing experience of the frankness of the uneducated classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1592"/>She puffed and steamed all night, and in the morning had only reached the south bank, in sight of the boat we had left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1593"/>Then her wheels ceased to revolve and we had to debark and continue our journey, at the imminent risk of our lives, on a rough wood-sled with oaken runners, sitting on our trunks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2292"/>This was, however, a mere skirmish, with which the main body of neither had anything to do, and was soon stopped by darkness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2293"/>About sunrise in the morning, however, the armies engaged and fought until <time value="3pm">three o'clock P.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2307"/>In compliance with your note of yesterday I have the honor to present the following report of the service of the <orgName type="mil" key="MSRifles">Mississippi Rifles</orgName> on the <dateStruct value="--2"><day reg="2">2d ultimo</day></dateStruct>: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2308"/> Early in the morning of that day the regiment was drawn out from the <name>Headquarters</name> encampment, which stood in advance of, and overlooked, the town of <placeName reg="Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico" key="tgn,7007120">Saltillo</placeName>. <pb id="p.319" n="319"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2309"/> Conformably to instruction <num value="2">two</num> companies were detached for the protection of that encampment, and to defend the adjacent entrance of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2310"/>The remaining <num value="8">eight</num> companies were put in march to return to the position of the preceding day, now known as the battle-field of <placeName reg="Buena Vista, Baja Caifornia Norte, Mexico" key="tgn,1017085">Buena Vista</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2311"/>We had approached to within about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> of that position, when the report of artillery firing, which reached us, gave assurance that a battle had been commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2312"/>Excited by the sounds the regiment pushed rapidly forward, manifesting upon this, as upon other occasions, their more than willingness to meet the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2313"/> At the first convenient place the column was halted for the purpose of filling the canteens with water, and the march being resumed, was directed toward the position which had been indicated to me on the previous evening as the post of our regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2314"/>As we approached the scene of action, horsemen, recognized as of our troops, were seen running dispersed and confusedly from the field; and our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> view of the line of battle presented the mortifying spectacle of a regiment of infantry flying disorganized from before the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2315"/>These sights, so well calculated to destroy confidence and disspirit troops just coming into action, it is my pride and pleasure <pb id="p.320" n="320"/> to believe only nerved the resolution of the regiment I have the honor to command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2316"/> Our order of march was in column of companies advancing by their centres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2317"/>The point which had just been abandoned by the regiment alluded to was now taken as our direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2318"/>I rode forward to examine the ground upon which we were going to operate, and, in passing through the fugitives appealed to them to return with us and renew the fight, pointing to our regiment as a mass of men behind which they might securely form. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2319"/> With a few honorable exceptions the appeal was as unheeded as the offers which, I am informed, were made by our men to give their canteens of water to those who complained of thirst, on condition that they would go back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2320"/><persName n="Wool,General,,,," id="n0037.0026.00320.01307" reg="mostcommon:Wool,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Wool</surname></persName> was upon the ground, making great efforts to rally the men who had given way. I approached him and asked if he would send another regiment to sustain me in the attack upon the enemy before us. He was alone, and after promises of support went in person to send it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2321"/> Upon further examination I found that the slope we were ascending was intersected by a deep ravine, which uniting obliquely with a still larger <num value="1">one</num> upon our right, formed, between them, a point of land difficult of access by us, but which, spreading into a plain <pb id="p.321" n="321"/> toward the base of the mountain, had easy communication with the main body of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2322"/>This position, important from its natural strength, derived a far greater value from the relation it bore to our order of battle and line of communication with the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2323"/>The enemy, in number many times greater than ourselves, supported by strong reserves, flanked by cavalry, and elated by recent success, was advancing upon it. The moment seemed to me critical, and the occasion to require whatever sacrifice it might cost to check the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2324"/> My regiment having continued to advance was near at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2325"/>I met and formed it rapidly into order of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2326"/>The line then advanced in double-quick time, until within the estimated range of our rifles, when it was halted and ordered to <quote>fire advancing.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2327"/></p> 
<p> The progress of the enemy was checked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2328"/>We crossed the difficult chasm before us under a galling fire, and in good order renewed the attack upon the other side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2329"/>The contest was severe &mdash; the destruction great upon both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2330"/>We steadily advanced, and as the distance was diminished the ratio of loss increased rapidly against the enemy; he yielded and was driven back on his reserves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2331"/>A plain now lay behind us &mdash; the enemy's cavalry had passed around our right flank, which <pb id="p.322" n="322"/> rested on the main ravine, and gone to our rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2332"/>The support I had expected to join us was nowhere to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2333"/>I therefore ordered the regiment to retire, and went in person to find the cavalry, which, after passing round our right, had been concealed by the inequality of the ground, I found them, at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> point where the bank was practicable for horsemen, in the act of descending into the ravine &mdash; no doubt for the purpose of charging upon our rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2334"/>The nearest of our men ran quickly to my call, attacked this body and dispersed it with some loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2335"/>I think their commander was among the killed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2336"/> The regiment was formed again into line of battle behind the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ravine we had crossed; soon after which we were joined upon our left by <persName n="Kilbourn,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0037.0026.00322.01308" reg="mostcommon:Kilbourn,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Kilbourn</surname></persName>, with a piece of <orgName n="Light Artillery" type="artillery">light artillery</orgName>, and <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 3"><persName n="Lane,Colonel,,,," id="n0037.0026.00322.01309" reg="mostcommon:Lane,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Lane</surname></persName>'s Third Regiment</orgName> of <orgName type="mil" key="INVolunteer">Indiana Volunteers</orgName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2338"/>The enemy immediately receded; we advanced, and he retired to the mountain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2339"/> No <rs type="role" reg="senior-Officer">senior officer</rs> of <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Kilbourn,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0037.0026.00322.01311" reg="mostcommon:Kilbourn,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Kilbourn</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> being present upon this occasion, it gives me pleasure to bear testimony of the valuable services he rendered, and to express my admiration of the professional skill and soldierly qualities he manifested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2340"/><pb id="p.323" n="323"/> </p> 
<p> We occupied the ground where the <rs>Mississippi</rs> regiment <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> met the enemy, when a heavy fire was opened upon us by a battery which the enemy had established near the centre of his line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2341"/>The <placeName key="tgn,7007252" n="1.000 7" reg="indiana">Indiana</placeName> regiment was most exposed, and passed from the left into the ravine upon our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2342"/>The artillery retired to the battery from which it had been drawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2343"/>I had sent out some parties to examine the ground on which we had fought in the morning, for the purpose of bringing in the wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2344"/>When these parties had returned our regiment retired by its left flank, and marched along the bank of the ravine heretofore noticed as being on our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2345"/>The <placeName key="tgn,7007252" n="1.000 7" reg="indiana">Indiana</placeName> regiment, in moving down the hollow, was concealed from the view of the enemy, who was probably thereby encouraged to make an attack. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2346"/>We had proceeded but a short distance when I saw a large body of cavalry debouch from his cover on the left of the position from which we had retired, and advance rapidly upon us. <placeName reg="The Mississippi">The Mississippi</placeName> regiment was filed to the right, and fronted in line across the plain; the <rs>Indiana</rs> regiment was formed on the bank of the ravine, in advance of our right flank, by which a <hi rend="italics">re-entering angle</hi> was presented to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2347"/>While this preparation was being made, <rs type="role" reg="Sergeant-Major">Sergeant-Major</rs> <pb id="p.324" n="324"/> Miller of our regiment was sent to <persName n="Sherman,Captain,,,," id="n0037.0026.00324.01312" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,John,,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> for <num value="1">one</num> or more pieces of artillery from his battery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2348"/>The enemy, who was now seen to be a body of richly caparisoned lancers, came forward rapidly, and in beautiful order &mdash; the files and ranks so closed as to look like a mass of men and horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2349"/>Perfect silence and the greatest steadiness prevailed in both lines of our troops, as they stood at shouldered arms awaiting an attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2350"/>Confident of success and anxious to obtain the full advantage of a cross-fire at a short distance, I repeatedly called to the men not to shoot. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2351"/> As the enemy approached his speed regularly diminished, until, when within <num value="80">eighty</num> or <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure>, he had drawn up to a walk, and seemed about to halt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2352"/>A few files fired without orders, and both lines then instantly poured in a volley so destructive that the mass yielded to the blow, and the survivors fled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2353"/><persName n="Sherman,Captain,,,," id="n0037.0026.00324.01313" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,John,,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> having come up with a field-piece from his battery, followed their retreat with a very effective fire until they fled beyond the range of his gun. Soon after this event a detachment of our artillery and cavalry rode up, and I was directed to co-operate with it in an attack upon the enemy at the base of the mountain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2354"/>We advanced parallel to this detachment until it <pb id="p.325" n="325"/> halted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2355"/>I then placed my men under such protection as the ground afforded from the constant fire of the enemy's artillery, to which we were exposed, to wait the further movement of the force with which we were to act. At this time the enemy made his last attack upon the right, and I received the <rs n="General Order" type="misc">General's order</rs> to march to that portion of the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2356"/>The broken character of the intervening ground concealed the scene of action from our view; but the heavy firing of musketry formed a sufficient guide for our course. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2357"/> After marching <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure> we saw the enemy's infantry advancing in <num value="3">three</num> lines upon <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Bragg,Captain,,,," id="n0037.0026.00325.01314" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s battery</orgName>, which, though entirely unsupported, resolutely held its position, and met the attack with a fire worthy of the former achievement of the battery, and of the reputation of its meritorious commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2358"/>We pressed on, climbed the rocky slope of the plain on which this combat occurred, reached its brow so as to take the enemy in flank and reverse when he was about <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure> from the battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2359"/>Our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fire, raking each of his lines, and opening close upon his flank, was eminently destructive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2360"/>His right gave way and he fled in confusion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2361"/> In this last contest of the day my regiment equalled &mdash; it was impossible to exceed &mdash; my <pb id="p.326" n="326"/> expectations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2362"/>Though worn down by many hours of fatigue and thirst, the ranks thinned by our heavy loss in the morning, they yet advanced upon the enemy with the alacrity and eagerness of men fresh to the combat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2363"/>In every approbatory sense of these remarks I wish to be included a party of <orgName n="IN regiment"><persName n="Bowles,Colonel,,,," id="n0037.0026.00326.01315" reg="mostcommon:Bowles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Bowles</surname></persName>'s Indiana regiment</orgName>, which served with us during the greatest part of the day, under immediate command of an officer from that regiment whose gallantry attracted my particular attention, but whose name is, I regret, unknown to me. When hostile demonstrations had ceased I retired to a tent upon the field for surgical aid, having been wounded by a musket-ball when we <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> went into action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2364"/>Our regiment remained inactive until evening, and was then ordered to the encampment of the previous night, under the command of <persName n="Bradford,Major,,,," id="n0037.0026.00326.01316" reg="mostcommon:Bradford,Mary,,,:2"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Bradford</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2365"/>We had seen the enemy retire; but his numerical superiority over us would scarcely admit the supposition that he had finally retreated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2366"/>After my arrival at our encampment, which was some time after dark, I directed <persName n="Rogers,Captain,,,," id="n0037.0026.00326.01317" reg="mostcommon:Rogers,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Rogers</surname></persName>, with his company, K, and <persName n="Russell,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0037.0026.00326.01318" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName>, commanding <orgName type="company" n="Company D">Company D</orgName>, to proceed with their commands to the field of battle, and to report to the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding General</rs> for orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2367"/>These were the <num value="2">two</num> <pb id="p.327" n="327"/> companies which had been left as a guard at Headquarters encampment, as stated in the beginning of this report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2368"/>They had been threatened during the day by a strong detachment of the enemy's cavalry; but performed all the duties which belonged to their position, as will be seen by the accompanying statement of <persName n="Rogers,Captain,,,," id="n0037.0026.00327.01319" reg="mostcommon:Rogers,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Rogers</surname></persName>, in a manner creditable to themselves and their regiment; but they were disappointed because they had not been with us in the battle of the day, and were gratified at the order to march upon night-service, and probably to a dangerous post. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2369"/> Every part of the battle having been fought under the eye of the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding General</rs>, the importance and manner of any service it was our fortune to render will be best estimated by him. But in view of my own responsibility, it may be permitted me to say, in relation to our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attack upon the enemy, that I considered the necessity absolute and immediate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2370"/>No <num value="1">one</num> would have failed to perceive the hazard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2510"/>The gaily caparizoned lancers were approaching <pb id="p.346" n="346"/> rapidly, each with a lance the blade of which shone brightly, while the tri-colored streamer on each lance gave the proud horsemen a magnificent appearance, <quote> almost too pretty to shoot at,</quote> was the remark of <num value="1">one</num> of our boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2511"/>They came in fours, and when near enough we observed that they were led by a very large and stout officer (colonel we supposed), who had his sword raised, and while very brave, manifested a very poor judgment on this occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2512"/>By the bye, he must have been <num value="1">one</num> of our countrymen some time or other, on land or sea, for we afterward found, on close inspection, that his wrists were tattooed with the star spangled banner and several of our national mottoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2513"/>If he had at any time been an Americano, he received on this occasion, from his former fellow-citizens, as a present, at least a dozen rifle-balls more than he could pack away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2514"/>But to resume the story: The officer alluded to bravely led the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2515"/>To his right and a little behind him was a boy-bugler, who we afterward had opportunity to closely inspect, and found that he and his bugle, even, had shared his colonel's fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2516"/>The ground over which they had to make their approach was apparently unbroken, but they encountered several ravines too wide for a horseman, and their long columns were what <num value="1">one</num> would imagine a huge serpent moving <pb id="p.347" n="347"/> over the ground in a tortuous course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2517"/>They evidently did not understand the manoeuvre of our little force; it was something new in military strategy, and they no doubt expected to encounter an old-fashioned infantry hollow square.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2518"/>But when they got near and discovered their mistake they seemed determined to make the most of it; and with their superior force (more than <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="1">one</num>) overwhelm and massacre us. They were making for the line of our regiment, which threw their lines parallel to the lines of our allies formed on the bank of the ravine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2519"/>They were now in short range, and with levelled guns we awaited patiently the order to fire; but it never came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2520"/>The head of their column had passed the point of the extreme right of the <rs>Indiana</rs> detachment, which brought them inconveniently near the line; the little bugler had raised his bugle to give the signal to <quote>deploy and charge,</quote> and had given <num value="1">one</num> distinct blast, when the report of a solitary gun broke the stillness and was followed by a prolonged volley all along our line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2521"/>I think I am safe in saying not a loaded gun was left in the whole command; but that <num value="1">one</num> round did fearful execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2525"/>They were not slow to belch forth showers of grape and canister, and every effort of the <rs>Mexican</rs> officers to rally their men and renew the charge was fruitless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2526"/>The carnage was so terrible that many of them dismounted, took the nearest route to get out of range of the artillery, and then, in a roundabout way, came and surrendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2808"/>The clause in the <rs>Constitution</rs> relative to the regulation of commerce was a constitutional admission that the slave is property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2856"/>As equals the <name>States</name> came into the <rs>Union</rs>, and by the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation equal rights, privileges, and immunities were secured to the citizens of each; yet, for asserting that, in this case, the <rs>Federal Government</rs> shall not authorize the destruction of such equality, we have been accused of wishing to claim for the citizens of the <rs>Southern States</rs> unusual rights under the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2857"/>This accusation comes badly from those who insist on provisions for exclusion; and cannot find its application to a demand that nothing shall be done to affect the constitutional rights of property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2862"/>Sir, slavery is sustained, but was not created by the local law of the <name>States</name> in which it exists; nor did those States ask of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> to secure or maintain it within their borders; beyond their own jurisdiction, and there only, is the protection of Federal laws required.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3123"/> Sir, it is a melancholy fact that, morning after morning, when we come here to enter into the business of the <name>Senate</name>, our feelings <pb id="p.433" n="433"/> are harrowed up by the introduction of this exciting and profitless subject, and we are compelled to listen to insults heaped upon our institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3124"/>Sir, there is no man who comes here to represent his constituency for high and useful purposes, and who feels upon himself the obligation of his oath to maintain the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, who would thus act, from day to day, for the purpose of disturbing the useful legislation of the country, for no other purpose than to insert another brand into the flame which every reflecting, sober man now sees threatens to consume the fabric of our government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3125"/> We, of the <rs>South</rs>, stand now, as we have always stood, upon the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3126"/>We raised not the question; but, when raised, it is our duty to defend ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3127"/>For <num value="1">one</num>, sir, my purposes are to keep down this species of excitement both here and at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3128"/>I know the temper of those whom I represent, and they require no promptings to resist aggression or insult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3129"/>I know their determination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3130"/>It is well and deeply taken, and will be shown when the crisis comes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3139"/>I still trusted, however, in the intelligence and patriotism of the masses, for I have long since said that I could put no faith in politicians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3140"/>I feel that they have raised a storm which they cannot control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3142"/>And yet, I believe that the descendants of the <name>Franklins</name>, the <name>Hancocks</name>, and the <name>Adamses</name>, if they saw our institutions about to be destroyed by a mean <pb id="p.435" n="435"/> and captious exercise of the power of demagogues to press to a fatal extremity aggressions upon our rights by the <rs>North</rs>, would rise up in their strength and would enforce the justice and obligations of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3143"/>This is no indication of any confidence which I put in their representatives; with them I am ready to meet this issue face to face; and if the representatives of that people see proper to sow the seeds of dissension and to influence the passions and prejudices of <num value="1">one</num> section, while they drive the other by every possible provocation to the point of civil war, then all I have to say is that the representatives of the <rs>South</rs>, true to their constituency, are prepared to meet the issue here and now.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3175"/>I rise merely to make a few remarks on the right of petition . . . It is offensive to recommend legislation for the dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>; offensive to the <name>Senate</name> and to the whole country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3178"/>Congress has no power to legislate upon that which will be the destruction of the whole foundations upon which their authority rests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3179"/>I recollect, a good many years ago, that the <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> who addressed the <name>Senate</name> this morning (<persName n="Davis,,John,,," id="n0037.0031.00440.01662" reg="default:Davis,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>), very pointedly described the right of petition as a very humble right &mdash; as the mere right to beg. This is my own view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3180"/>The right peacefully to assemble, I hold, as the right which it was intended to grant to the people; that was the only right which had ever been denied in our colonial condition; the right of petition had never been denied by Parliament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3181"/>It was intended only to secure to the people, I say, the right peacefully to assemble whenever they chose to do so, with intent to petition for a redress of grievances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3182"/><pb id="p.441" n="441"/> </p> 
<p> But, sir, the right of petition, though but a poor right, the mere right to beg, may yet be carried to such an extent that we are bound to abate it as a nuisance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3183"/>If the avenues to the <rs>Capitol</rs> were obstructed so that members would find themselves unable to reach the halls of legislation because hordes of beggars presented themselves in the way, calling for relief, it would be a nuisance that would require to be abated, and Congress in self-defence would be compelled to remove them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3184"/> But such a collection of beggars would not be half so great an evil as the petitions presented here on the subject of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3185"/>They disturb the peace of the country; they impede and pervert legislation by the excitement they create; do more to prevent rational investigation and proper action in this body than any, if not all, other causes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3187"/>Why, then, should we be bound to receive such petitions to the detriment of the public business; or, rather, why are they presented?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3188"/>I am not of those who believe we should be turned from the path of duty by out-of-door clamor, or that the evil can be removed by partial concession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3197"/>In the <name>Senate</name>, the bills reported by the <rs>Committee</rs> on Territories were referred to a select committee of which <persName n="Clay,Mister,,,," id="n0037.0031.00443.01664" reg="mostcommon:Clay,Henry,,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName> was chairman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3198"/>From this counsellor emanated the bills which, taken together, are known as the <q direct="unspecified">Compromise Measures of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3199"/></p> 
<p> With some others, I advocated the division of the newly acquired territory by the extension to the <placeName reg="Pacific Ocean" key="tgn,7014652">Pacific Ocean</placeName> of the <placeName reg="Missouri Compromise">Missouri Compromise</placeName> line of <num value="30">30</num>&deg; <num value="30">30</num>.&lsquo; This was not because of any inherent merit or fitness in that line, but because it had been accepted by the country as a settlement of the sectional question which, <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> before, had threatened a rupture of the <rs>Union</rs>, and it had acquired in the public mind a prescriptive respect which it seemed unwise to disregard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3200"/>A majority, however, decided otherwise, <pb id="p.444" n="444"/> and the line of political conciliation was then obliterated as far as it lay in the power of Congress to do. This result was effected almost exclusively by the representatives of the <rs>North</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3201"/> However objectionable it may have been, in <dateStruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></dateStruct>, to adopt that political line as expressing a geographical definition of different sectional interests, and, however it may be condemned as the assumption by Congress of a function not delegated to it, it is to be remembered that the act had received such recognition and quasi-ratification by the people of the <name>States</name> as to give it a value which it did not rightfully possess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3202"/>Pacification had been the fruit borne by the tree, and it should not have been recklessly hewn down and cast into the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3203"/>The frequent assertion then made was that all discrimination was unjust, and that the popular will should be left untrammelled in the formation of new States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3204"/>This theory was good enough in itself, and, as an abstract proposition, could not be gainsaid; but its practical application has but poorly sustained the expectations of its advocates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3205"/>Retrospectively reviewed, under the mellowing light of time, and with the calm consideration we can usually give to the irremediable past, the <rs>Compromise Legislation</rs> of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> bears the impress of that sectional spirit so widely at <pb id="p.445" n="445"/> variance with the general purposes of the <rs>Union</rs>, and so destructive of the harmony and mutual benefit which the <rs>Constitution</rs> was intended to secure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3206"/>The refusal to divide the territory acquired from <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> by an extension of the line of the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs> to the <rs>Pacific</rs>, was a consequence of the purpose to admit <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> as a State of the <rs>Union</rs> before it had acquired the requisite population, and while it was under the control of the military organization sent from New York during the war with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, and disbanded in <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> upon the restoration of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3207"/>The inconsistency of the argument against the extension of the line was exhibited in the division of the <placeName key="possibilities=24" n="1.000 10" reg=",">territory of Texas</placeName>, by that parallel, and payment to the <rs>State</rs> of money to secure her consent to the partition of her domain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3208"/>In the case of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, the <rs>North</rs> had everything to gain and nothing to lose by the application of the practice of geographical compromise on an arbitrary line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3209"/>In the case of <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>, the conditions were reversed; the <rs>South</rs> might have been the gainer and the <rs>North</rs> the loser, by a recognition of the same rule. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3210"/>The compensation which, it has been alleged, the <rs>South</rs> received, was a more effective law for the rendition of fugitives from <pb id="p.446" n="446"/> service or labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3211"/>But it is to be remarked that the law provided for the execution by the <rs>General Government</rs> of obligations which had been imposed by the <rs>Federal</rs> compact upon the several States of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3212"/>The benefit to be derived from a fulfilment of that law, would be small in comparison with the evil to result from the plausible pretext that the <name>States</name> had been relieved from a duty which they had assumed in the adoption of the compact of Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3213"/>Whatever tended to lead the people of any of the <name>States</name> to feel that they could be relieved of their constitutional obligations by transferring them to the <rs>General Government</rs>, or that they might thus or otherwise evade or resist them, could not fail to be like the tares which the enemy sowed amid the wheat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3214"/>It was reasonably argued that, as the <name>Legislatures</name> of <num value="14">fourteen</num> of the <name>States</name> had enacted what was termed <quote>personal liberty bills,</quote> which forbade the co-operation of State officials in the rendition of fugitives from service or labor, it became necessary that the <rs>General Government</rs> should provide the requisite machinery for the execution of the law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3446"/><pb id="p.485" n="485"/> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3544"/>In forwarding the reports of the exploring expeditions the <rs>Secretary</rs> thus tersely stated the need of a transcontinental railroad for the defence of the <rs type="place">Pacific coast</rs> in case of war with a maritime power: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3545"/> The facts developed by these surveys, added to other information which we possess, suggest some considerations of great interest with regard to our territory on the <rs>Pacific</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3546"/>They exhibit it as a narrow strip of an average width of <measure n="150miles" type="distance">one hundred and fifty miles</measure> of cultivated land, skirting the ocean for a distance of <measure n="1000miles" type="distance">one thousand miles</measure>; rich in those mineral productions which are tempting even beyond their value, and which would be most readily turned to the use of an invader; drained by <num value="2">two</num> rivers of widespread branches, and with seaports lying so directly upon the ocean that a hostile fleet could commence an attack upon any <num value="1">one</num> of them within a few hours of being descried from land; or, if fortified against attack, so few in number that comparatively few ships would suffice to blockade them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3547"/>This territory is not more remote from the principal <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> states than from those parts of our country whence it would derive its military supplies, and some of those states <pb id="p.507" n="507"/> have colonies on the <rs type="place">Pacific coast</rs>, which would greatly facilitate their operations against it. With these advantages, and with those which the attacking force always has of choice of place and time, an enemy possessing a considerable military marine could, with comparatively little cost to himself, subject us to enormous expense in giving to our Pacific frontier the protection which it is the duty of the <rs>General Government</rs> to afford. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3548"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year of a war with any great maritime power, the communication by sea could not be relied upon for the transportation of supplies from the <rs>Atlantic</rs> to the <rs>Pacific States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3549"/>Our naval peace establishment would not furnish adequate convoys for the number of store-ships which it would be necessary to employ, and steamships alone, laden with supplies, could not undertake a voyage of <measure n="20000miles" type="distance">twenty thousand miles</measure>, passing numerous neutral ports where an enemy's armed vessels, even of the smallest size, might lie in wait to intercept them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3550"/>The only line of communication, then, would be overland; and by this it would be impracticable, with any means heretofore used, to furnish the amount of supplies required for the defence of the <rs>Pacific</rs> frontier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3551"/>At the present prices, over the best part of this <pb id="p.508" n="508"/> route the expense of land transportation alone for the annual supplies of provisions, clothing, camp equipage, and ammunition for such an army as it would be necessary to maintain there would exceed <measure n="20000000dollars" type="currency">$20,000,000</measure>, and to sustain troops and carry on offensive operations under those circumstances, the expense per man would be <num value="6">six</num> times greater than it is now; the land transportation for each field <num value="12">twelve</num>-pounder, with a due supply of ammunition for <num value="1">one</num> year, would cost <measure n="2500dollars" type="currency">$2,500</measure>; of each <num value="24">twenty-four</num> pounder and ammunition, <measure n="9dollars" type="currency">$9</measure>, <num value="00000">00000</num>; and of a sea-coast gun and ammunition, <measure n="12000dollars" type="currency">$12,000</measure>. The transportation of ammunition for a year for <num value="1000">one thousand</num> sea-coast guns would cost <measure n="10000000dollars" type="currency">$10,000,000</measure>. But the expense of transportation would be vastly increased by a war; and at the rates that were paid on the <rs>Northern</rs> frontier during the last war with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, the above estimates would be trebled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3552"/>The time required for the overland journey would be from <num value="4">four</num> to <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>. In point of fact, however, supplies for such an army could not be transported across the continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3553"/>On the arid and barren belts to be crossed, the limited quantities of water and grass would soon be exhausted by the numerous draught animals required by heavy trains; and for such distance forage could not be carried for their sustenance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3554"/><pb id="p.509" n="509"/> </p> 
<p>On the other hand, the enemy would send out his supplies at from <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num> to <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="20" type="ordinal">twentieth</num> the above rates, and in less time --perhaps in <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> the time &mdash; if he could get command of the <name>Isthmus</name> routes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3555"/> Any reliance, therefore, upon furnishing that part of our frontier with means of defence from the <rs>Atlantic</rs> and interior States, after the commencement of hostilities, would be in vain, and the next resource would be to accumulate there such amount of supplies and stores as would suffice during the continuance of the contest, or until we could obtain command of the sea. Assigning but a moderate limit to this period the expense would yet be enormous, the fortifications, depots, and storehouses would necessarily be on the largest scale, and the cost of placing supplies there for <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> would amount to nearly <num value="100000000">one hundred millions</num> of dollars. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3556"/> In many respects the cost during peace would be equivalent to that during the war. The perishable character of many articles would render it impossible to put provisions in depot for such a length of time; or in any case there would be deterioration amounting to some <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars per year. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3557"/>These considerations, and others of a strictly military character, cause the <name>Department</name> to examine with interest all projects <pb id="p.510" n="510"/> promising the accomplishment of railroad communication between the navigable waters of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> and those of the <placeName reg="Pacific Ocean" key="tgn,7014652">Pacific Ocean</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3558"/>As military operations depend in a greater degree upon the rapidity and certainty of movement than upon any other circumstance, the introduction of railway transportation has greatly improved the means of defending our <placeName key="tgn,7014206" n="1.000 31" reg="atlantic ocean">Atlantic</placeName> and inland frontiers; and to give us a sense of security from attack upon the most exposed portion of our territory, it is requisite that the facility of railroad transportation should be extended to the <rs type="place">Pacific coast</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3559"/>Were such a road completed our <placeName reg="Pacific Coast, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7014680">Pacific coast</placeName>, instead of being farther removed in time, and less accessible to us than to an enemy, would be brought within a few days of easy communication, and the cost of supplying an army there, instead of being many times greater to us than to him, would be about equal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3560"/>We would be released from the necessity of accumulating large supplies on that coast, to waste, perhaps, through long years of peace; and we could feel entire confidence that,--let war come, when and with whom it may, before a hostile expedition could reach that exposed frontier an ample force could be placed there to repel any attempt at foreign invasion.</p></quote> </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3565"/>The <rs>Secretary</rs> recommended a revision of the policy of locating small military posts in advance of settlement, now that civilization had passed the line of general fertility. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3566"/><quote>Assuming,</quote> he wrote) <quote>that the limits of the fertile regions have been sufficiently well ascertained, and that future operations should be made to conform to the character of the country, the true interests of the public service would seem to suggest that instead of dispersing <pb id="p.512" n="512"/> the troops, to form small garrisons at numerous posts where they exhibit weakness to a savage foe. Within the fertile regions a few points accessible by steam-boats or by railways should be maintained, from which strong detachments should annually be sent out into the <rs>Indian</rs> country during the season when the grass will suffice for the support of the cavalry horses and beasts of draught and burden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3567"/>These detachments would be available both to hunt and chastise those tribes who had committed depredations, or by passing along the main routes to <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Oregon" key="tgn,7007708">Oregon</placeName> and <persName n="Territories,,Washington,,," id="n0037.0037.00512.01803" reg="default:Territories,Washington,,,"><foreName>Washington</foreName> <surname>Territories</surname></persName>, give the needful protection to emigrants during the season of their transit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3568"/>Experience has shown that small posts are nearly powerless beyond their own limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3569"/>Some of the most flagrant depredations on parties in the vicinity of such military posts, and their inability to pursue and punish the offenders, has tended to bring into disrepute the power and energy of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, whose citizens were the victims of predatory attacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3570"/>Indeed it is quite supposable that these posts, being fixed points in the routes of the emigrants, afford the <name>Indians</name> the opportunity of observing each train which passes, and thus enable them to determine upon future operations.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3571"/>Again, with increased and impressive emphasis, the <pb id="p.513" n="513"/> <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs> renewed his plea for increased pay of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3572"/><quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>More than the usual number of resignations within the past year give evidence of a defective organization, of a policy injurious to professional pride, and of the necessity of increased compensation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3573"/>While the hard service and frontier stations of the officers of the army require of them sacrifices which no other officers of the <rs>Government</rs> are called upon to make, the expense of living has been greatly augmented, and their pay is nearly the same as that which was fixed more than <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> ago. There is surely no economy in a practice which must in the end drive the more active and intellectual from a service which they adorn and in which their country specially requires them, to seek a competent support in some other pursuits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3574"/>As little does it accord with the spirit of generosity or justice to ask at their hands the sacrifice which so many of them make to professional pride and habitual love for their country's service and their country's flag. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3575"/>Though special acts have, from time to time, made provisions for the widows and orphans of officers and soldiers of the army who have lost their lives in the discharge of their duty, no such general provisions have been made for the army as those which subsist <pb id="p.514" n="514"/> in relation to the widows of officers and seamen in the navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3576"/>If there was ever a just ground for this discrimination it is believed that it no longer exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3577"/>While the army has no claim to be paid by its Government for the capture of the public property of an enemy, large sums have from time to time inured to the <rs>Government</rs> from that source, and the policy which encourages to deeds of daring in naval warfare, by the assurance that the brave sailor who falls in maintaining the honor of his country's flag, leaves in his Government a protector and guardian to the family deprived of his support, is, certainly, in principle and degree, applicable to the soldier who perils his life in the same cause, and, without chance of being enriched by pillage, incurs the hazard of leaving his wife and children to want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3578"/>I would, therefore, again recommend that such legislation be asked as will place the widows and orphans of officers and soldiers of the army on the same footing, with respect to pensions, as those of the officers and seamen of the navy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4208"/>I am welcomed to this hall, so venerable for all the associations of our early history; to this hall of which you are so justly proud, and the memories of which are part of the inheritance of every <orgName n="American Citizen" type="newspaper">American citizen</orgName>; and I felt, as I looked upon it, and remembered how many voices <pb id="p.611" n="611"/> of patriotic fervor have filled it; how here the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> movement originated from which the <name>Revolution</name> sprang; how here began the system of town meetings, and free discussion --that, though my theme was more humble than theirs, as befitted my humbler powers, I had enough to warn me that I was assuming much to speak in this sacred chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4209"/>But, when I heard your distinguished orator say that words uttered here could never die, that they lived and became a part of the circumambient air, I felt a hesitation which increases upon me with the remembrance of his expressions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4210"/>But, if those voices which breathed the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impulse into colonies-now the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>--to proclaim independence, and to unite for resistance against the power of the mother-country; if those voices live here still, how must they fare who come here to preach treason to the <rs>Constitution</rs> and to assail the union of these States?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4211"/>It would seem that their criminal hearts would fear that those voices, so long slumbering, would break silence, that those forms which hang upon these walls behind me might come forth, and that the sabres so long sheathed would leap from their scabbards to drive from this sacred temple those who desecrate it as did the money-changers who sold doves in the temple of the living <name n="God" type="God">God</name>. <pb id="p.612" n="612"/> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4215"/>This is <num value="1">one</num> of the instances in which we find tradition so much more reliable than history; for tradition has borne the name of <persName n="Adams,,Samuel,,," id="n0037.0042.00612.02193" reg="default:Adams,Samuel,,,"><foreName>Samuel</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> to the remotest of the colonies, and the new States formed out of what was territory of the old colonies; and there it is a name as sacred among us as it is among you. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4227"/>The steady courage and cautious wisdom of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> availed to drive the <rs>British</rs> troops out from the city which they had so confidently held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4228"/>Here, too, you find where once the old <rs>Liberty Tree</rs>, connected with so many of your memories, grew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4229"/>You ask your legend, and learn that it was cut down for firewood by <name>British</name> soldiers, as some of your meeting-houses <pb id="p.615" n="615"/> were destroyed; they burned the old tree, and it warmed the soldiers long enough to leave town, and, had they burned it a little longer, its light would have shown <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and his followers where their enemies were. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4235"/>If I were selecting a place where the advocate of strict construction, the extreme expounder of democratic State-rights doctrine should go for his texts, I would send him into the collections of your historical associations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4236"/>Instead of going to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> as a place where only consolidation would be found, he would find written, in letters of living <pb id="p.616" n="616"/> light, that sacred creed of State-rights which has been miscalled the ultra opinions of the <rs>South</rs>; he could find among your early records that this <placeName reg="Faneuil Hall">Faneuil Hall</placeName>, the property of the town at the time when <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> was under a colonial government, administered by a man appointed by the <rs>British</rs> crown, guarded by <name>British</name> soldiers, was refused to a British Governor in which to hold a British festival, because he was going to bring with him the agents for collecting, and the naval officers sent here to enforce, an oppressive tax upon your commonwealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4237"/>Such was the proud spirit of independence manifested even in your colonial history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4238"/>Such is the great foundation-stone on which may be erected an eternal monument of State-rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4239"/>And so, in an early period of our country, you find <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> leading the movements, prominent of all the <name>States</name>, in the assertion of that doctrine which has been recently so much belied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4240"/>Having achieved your independence, having passed through the <name>Confederation</name>, you assented to the formation of our present <orgName n="Constitutional Union" type="union">constitutional Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4241"/>You did not surrender your sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4242"/>Your fathers had sacrificed too much to claim, as a reward of their toil, merely that they should have a change of masters; and a change of masters it would have been had <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> <pb id="p.617" n="617"/> surrendered her State sovereignty to the <rs>Central Government</rs>, and consented that that Central Government should have the power to coerce a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4243"/>But, if this power does not exist, if this sovereignty has not been surrendered, then, who can deny the words of soberness and truth spoken by your candidate this evening, when he has pleaded to you the cause of State independence, and the right of every community to be judge of its own domestic affairs?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4244"/>This is all we have ever asked-we of the <rs>South</rs>, I mean &mdash; for I stand before you as <num value="1">one</num> of those who have always been called the ultra men of the <rs>South</rs>, and I speak, therefore, for that class; and I tell you that your candidate for Governor has uttered to-night everything which we have claimed as a principle for our protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4245"/>And I have found the same condition of things in the neighboring <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">State of Maine</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4246"/>I have found that the <name>Democrats</name> there asserted the same broad constitutional principle for which we have been contending, by which we are willing to live, for which we are willing to die. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4247"/> In this state of the case, my friends, why is the country agitated?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4248"/>The old controversies have passed away, or they have subsided, and have been covered up by <num value="1">one</num> dark pall of sombre hue, which increases <pb id="p.618" n="618"/> with every passing year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4249"/>Why is it, then, I say, that you are thus agitated in relation to the domestic affairs of other communities?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4250"/>Why is it that the peace of the country is disturbed in order that <num value="1">one</num> people may judge of what another people may do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4251"/>Is there any political power to authorize such interference?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4252"/>If so, where is it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4253"/>You did not surrender your sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4254"/>You gave to the <rs>Federal Government</rs> certain functions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4255"/>It was your agent, created for specified purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4256"/>It can do nothing save that which you have given it power to perform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4257"/>Where is the grant?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4258"/>Has it a right to determine what shall be property?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4259"/>Surely not; that belongs to every community to decide for itself; you judge in your case-every other State must judge in its case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4260"/>The Federal Government has no power to destroy property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4261"/>Do you pay taxes, then, to an agent, that he may destroy your property?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4262"/>Do you support him for that purpose?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4263"/>It is an absurdity on the face of it. To ask the question is to answer it. The Government is instituted to protect, not to destroy, property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4264"/>And, in the abundance of caution, your fathers provided that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> should not take private property for its own use unless by making due compensation therefor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4265"/>It is prohibited from attempting to destroy property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4266"/><pb id="p.619" n="619"/> <num value="1">One</num> of its great purposes was protection to the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4267"/>Whenever that power is made a source of danger, we destroy the purpose for which the <rs>Government</rs> was formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4268"/>Why, then, have you agitators?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4269"/>With pharisaical pretension it is sometimes said it is a moral obligation to agitate, and I suppose they are going through a sort of vicarious repentance for other men's sins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4270"/>With all due allowance for their zeal, we ask, how do they decide that it is a sin?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4271"/>By what standard do they measure it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4272"/>Not the <rs>Constitution</rs>: the <rs>Constitution</rs> recognizes the property in slaves in many forms, and imposes obligations in connection with that recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4273"/>Not the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>; that justifies it. Not the good of society; for, if they go where it exists, they find that society recognizes it as good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4274"/>What, then, is their standard?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4275"/>The good of mankind?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4276"/>Is that seen in the diminished resources of the country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4277"/>Is that seen in the diminished comfort of the world?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4278"/>Or is not the reverse exhibited?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4279"/>Is there, in the cause of Christianity, a motive for the prohibition of the system which is the only agency through which Christianity has reached that inferior race, the only means by which they have been civilized and elevated?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4280"/>Or is their piety manifested in denunciation of their brethren, who are deterred from <pb id="p.620" n="620"/> answering their denunciation only by the contempt which they feel for a mere brawler, who intends to end his brawling only in empty words? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4281"/>What, my friends, must be the consequences?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4282"/>Good, or evil?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4283"/>They have been evil, and evil they must be only to the end. Not <num value="1">one</num> particle of good has been done to any man, of any color, by this agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4284"/>It has been insidiously working the purpose of sedition, for the destruction of the <rs>Union</rs> on which our hopes of future greatness depend. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4285"/> On the <num value="1">one</num> side, then, you see agitation tending slowly and steadily to that separation of States, which, if you have any hope connected with the liberty of mankind; if you have any national pride connected with making your country the greatest upon the face of the earth; if you have any sacred regard for the obligations which the deeds and the blood of your fathers entailed upon you, that hope should prompt you to reject anything that would tend to destroy the result of that experiment which they left it to you to conclude and perpetuate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4286"/>On the other hand, if each community, in accordance with the principles of our Government, should regard its domestic interests as a part of the common whole, and struggle for the benefit of all, this would steadily lead us to fraternity, to <pb id="p.621" n="621"/> unity, to co-operation, to the increase of our happiness and the extension of the benefits of our useful example over mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4287"/>The flag of the <rs>Union</rs>, whose stars have already more than doubled their original number, with its ample folds may wave, the recognized flag of every State, or the recognized protector of every State upon the <name>Continent</name> of <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4288"/> In connection with the view which I have presented of the early idea of community independence, I will add the very striking fact that <num value="1">one</num> of the colonies, about the time that they had resolved to unite for the purpose of achieving their independence, addressed the <orgName n="Colonial Congress" type="congress">Colonial Congress</orgName> to know in what condition it would be in the interval between the separation from the <rs>Government</rs> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and the establishment of a government on this continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4289"/>The answer of the <orgName n="Colonial Congress" type="congress">Colonial Congress</orgName> was exactly what might have been expected; exactly what State-rights Democracy would answer to-day to such an inquiry, that they <q direct="unspecified">had nothing to do with it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4290"/>If such sentiment had continued, if it had governed in every State, if representatives had been chosen upon it, then your halls of Federal legislation would not have been disturbed about the question of the domestic institutions of the different States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4291"/>The peace of the country would not have been hazarded by the <pb id="p.622" n="622"/> arraignment of the family relations of people over whom the <rs>Government</rs> has no control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4292"/>If in harmony working together, with co-intelligence for the conservation of the interests of the country; if protection to the <name>States</name> and the other great ends for which the <rs>Government</rs> was established, had been the aim and united effort of all-what effects would not have been produced?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4293"/>As our Government increases in expansion it would increase in its beneficent effect upon the people; we should, as we grow in power and prosperity, also grow in fraternity, and it would be no longer a wonder to see a man coming from a Southern State to address a Democratic audience in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4294"/> But I have referred to the fact that <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> stood pre-eminently forward among those who asserted community independence; and this reminds me of another incident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4295"/><persName n="Washington,President,,,," id="n0037.0042.00622.02196" reg="nearbymention:Washington,George,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName> visited <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> when <placeName reg="John Hancock">John Hancock</placeName> was Governor, and <persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n0037.0042.00622.02197" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,nomatch:0"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName> refused to call upon the <rs>President</rs>, because he contended that any man who came within the limits of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> must yield rank and precedence to the <rs>Governor</rs> of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4296"/>He eventually only surrendered the point on account of his personal regard and respect for the character of <persName n="Washington,,George,,," id="n0037.0042.00622.02198" reg="default:Washington,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4297"/>I honor him for this, and value it as <num value="1">one</num> of the early <pb id="p.623" n="623"/> testimonies in favor of State-rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4298"/>I wish all our Governors had the same regard for the, dignity of the <rs>State</rs> as had the great and glorious <placeName reg="John Hancock">John Hancock</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4299"/>In the beginning the founders of this Government were true democratic State-rights men. Democracy was State-rights, and State-rights was democracy, and it is so to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4300"/>Your resolutions breathe it. The <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> embodied the sentiments which had lived in the hearts of the country for many years before its formal assertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4301"/>Our fathers asserted the great principle-the right of the people to choose their own government-and that government rested upon the consent of the governed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4302"/>In every form of expression it uttered the same idea, community independence and the dependence of the <rs>Union</rs> upon the communities of which it consisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4303"/>It was an American declaration of the unalienable rights of man; it was a general truth, and I wish it were accepted by all men. But I have said that this State sovereignty --this community independence &mdash; has never been surrendered, and that there is no power in the <rs>Federal Government</rs> to coerce a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4304"/>Will anyone ask me, then, how a State is to be held to the fulfilment of its obligations?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4305"/>My answer is, by its honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4306"/>The obligation is the more sacred to observe every feature <pb id="p.624" n="624"/> of the compact, because there is no power to enforce it. The great error of the <name>Confederation</name> was, that it attempted to act upon.the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4307"/>It was found impracticable, and our present form of government was adopted, which acts upon individuals, and is not designed to act upon States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4308"/>The question of State coercion was raised in the <rs>Convention</rs> which framed the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and, after discussion, the proposition to give power to the <rs>General Government</rs> to enforce against any State obedience to the laws was rejected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4309"/>It is upon the ground that a State cannot be coerced that observance of the compact is a sacred obligation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4310"/>It was upon this principle that our fathers depended for the perpetuity of a fraternal Union, and for the security of the rights that the <rs>Constitution</rs> was designed to preserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4311"/>The fugitive slave compact in the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> implied that the <name>States</name> should fulfil it voluntarily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4312"/>They expected the <name>States</name> to legislate so as to secure the rendition of fugitives; and in <dateStruct value="1778--"><year reg="1778">1778</year></dateStruct> it was a matter of complaint that the <rs>Spanish</rs> colony of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> did not restore fugitive negroes from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> who escaped into that colony, and a committee, composed of <persName n="Hamilton,,,,," id="n0037.0042.00624.02199" reg="mostcommon:Hamilton,nomatch:0"><surname>Hamilton</surname></persName>, of New York, <persName n="Sedgwick,,,,," id="n0037.0042.00624.02200" reg="mostcommon:Sedgwick,nomatch:0"><surname>Sedgwick</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, and <persName n="Mason,,,,," id="n0037.0042.00624.02201" reg="mostcommon:Mason,James,M.,,:2"><surname>Mason</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, reported resolutions in the <rs>Congress</rs>, instructing <pb id="p.625" n="625"/> the <rs>Secretary</rs> of Foreign Affairs to address the <foreign lang="fr">charge d'affaires</foreign> at <placeName key="tgn,7010413" n="1.000 2" reg="madrid,madrid,madrid,espana,europe">Madrid</placeName> to apply to <name n="his Majesty" type="role">his Majesty</name> of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> to issue orders to his governors to compel them to secure the rendition of fugitive negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4313"/>This was the sentiment of the committee, and they added, also, that the <name>States</name> would return any slaves from <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> who might escape into their limits. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4314"/>When the constitutional obligation was imposed, who could have doubted that every State, faithful to its obligations, would comply with the requirements of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and waive all questions as to whether the institution should or should not exist in another community over which they had no control?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4315"/>Congress was at last forced to legislate on the subject, and they have continued up to a recent period to legislate, and this has been <num value="1">one</num> of the causes by which you have been disturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4316"/>You have been called upon to make war against a law which need never to have been enacted, if each State had done the duty which she was called upon by the <rs>Constitution</rs> to perform. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4317"/>Gentlemen, this presents <num value="1">one</num> phase of agitation-negro agitation; there is another and graver question, it is in relation to prohibition by Congress of the introduction of slave property into the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4318"/>What power does Congress possess in this connection?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4319"/><pb id="p.626" n="626"/> Has it the right to say what shall be property anywhere?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4320"/>If it has, from what clause of the <rs>Constitution</rs> does it derive that power?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4321"/>Have other States the power to prescribe the condition upon which a citizen of another State shall enter upon and enjoy territory-common property of all?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4322"/>Clearly not. Shall the inhabitants who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> go into territory deprive any citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> of those rights which belong to him as an equal owner of the soil?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4323"/>Certainly not. Sovereign jurisdiction can only pass to those inhabitants when the <name>States</name>, the owners of the territory, shall recognize their right to become an equal member of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4324"/>Until then, the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the laws of the <rs>Union</rs> must be the rule governing within the limits of a Territory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4325"/> The Constitution recognizes all property, and gives equal privileges to every citizen of the <name>States</name>; and it would be a violation of its fundamental principles to attempt any discrimination. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4326"/>There is nothing of truth or justice with which to sustain this agitation, or ground for it, unless that it be it is a very good bridge over which to pass into office; a little stock of trade in politics built up to aid men who are missionaries staying at home; reformers of things which they do not go to learn; preachers without a congregation; <pb id="p.627" n="627"/> overseers without laborers and without wages; war-horses who snuff the battle afar off and cry: <q direct="unspecified">Aha, aha!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4327"/>I am afar off!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4328"/></q> </p> 
<p> Thus it is that the peace of the <rs>Union</rs> is disturbed; thus it is that brother is arrayed against brother; thus it is that the people come to consider, not how they can promote each other's interests, but how they may successfully war upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4329"/>And among the things most odious to my mind is to find a man who enters upon a public office under the sanction of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and taking an oath to support the <rs>Constitution</rs> &mdash; the compact between the <name>States</name> binding each for the common defence and general welfare of the other-and retaining to himself a mental reservation that he will war upon the institutions and the property of any of the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4330"/>It is a crime too low to characterize as it deserves before this assembly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4331"/>It is <num value="1">one</num> which would disgrace a gentleman-<num value="1">one</num> which a man with self-respect would never commit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4332"/>To swear that he will support the <rs>Constitution</rs>, to take an office which belongs in many of its relations to all the <name>States</name>, and to use it as a means of injuring a portion of the <name>States</name> of whom he is thus an agent, is treason to everything that is honorable in man. It is the base and cowardly attack of him who gains the confidence of another in order that <pb id="p.628" n="628"/> he may wound him. But I have often heard it argued, and I have seen it published; I have seen a petition that was circulated for signers, announcing that there was an incompatibility between the different sections of the <rs>Union</rs>; that it had been tried long enough, and that they must get rid of those sections in which the curse of slavery existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4333"/>Ah, those sages, so much wiser than our fathers, have found out that there is incompatibility in that which existed when the <rs>Union</rs> was formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4334"/>They have found an incompatibility inconsistent with union in that which existed when <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> sent her rice to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> and New York brought in their funds for her relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4335"/>The fact is that from that day to this, the difference between the people of the colonies has been steadily diminishing, and the possible advantages of the <rs>Union</rs> in no small degree augmented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4336"/>The variety of product of soil and of climate has been multiplied, both by the expansion of our country and by the introduction of new tropical products not cultivated at that time; so that every motive to union which your fathers had, in a diversity which should give prosperity to the country, exists in a higher degree today than when this Union was formed, and this diversity is fundamental to the prosperity <pb id="p.629" n="629"/> of the people of the several sections of the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4337"/> It is however, to-day, in sentiment and interest, less than on the day when the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4338"/>Diversity there is-diversity of character-but it is not of that extreme kind which proves incompatibility; for your <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> man, when he comes into <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, adopts our opinions and our institutions, and frequently becomes the most extreme man among us. As our country has extended, as new products have been introduced into it, this Union and the free trade that belongs to it have been of increasing value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4339"/>And I say, moreover, that it is not an unfortunate circumstance that this diversity of pursuit and character still remains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4340"/>Originally it sprang in no small degree from natural causes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4341"/><placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> became a manufacturing and commercial State because of her fine harbors, because of her water-power, making its last leap into the sea, so that the ship of commerce brought the staple to the manufacturing power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4342"/>This made you a commercial and a manufacturing people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4343"/>In the <rs>Southern States</rs> great plains interpose between the last leaps of the streams and the sea. These plains were cultivated in staple crops, and the sea brought their products to your streams to <pb id="p.630" n="630"/> be manufactured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4344"/>This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> beginning of the differences. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4345"/>Then your longer and more severe winters, your soil not so favorable for agriculture, in a degree kept you a manufacturing and a commercial people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4346"/>Even after the cause had passed away-after railroads had been built-after the steam-engine had become a motive power for a large part of manufacturing machinery, the natural causes from which your people obtained a manufacturing ascendancy and ours became chiefly agriculturists, continued to act in a considerable measure to preserve that relation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4347"/>Your interest is to remain a manufacturing, and ours to remain an agricultural, people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4348"/>Your prosperity, then, is to receive our staple and to manufacture it, and ours to sell it to you and buy the manufactured goods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4349"/>This is an interweaving of interests which makes us all the richer and happier. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4350"/>But this accursed agitation, this intermeddling with the affairs of other people, is that alone which will promote a desire in the mind of anyone to separate these great and glorious States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4351"/>The seeds of dissension may be sown by invidious reflections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4352"/>Men may be goaded by the constant attempts to infringe upon rights and to disturb tranquillity, and in the resentment which follows it is not <pb id="p.631" n="631"/> possible to tell how far the wave may rush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4353"/>I therefore plead to you now to arrest fanaticism which has been evil in the beginning, and must be evil in the end. You may not have the numerical power requisite, and those at a distance may not understand how many of you there are desirous to put a stop to the course of this agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4354"/>For me, I have learned since I have been in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> the vast mass of true State-rights Democrats to be found within its limits-though not represented in the halls of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4355"/>And if it comes to the worst-if, availing themselves of a majority in the two Houses of Congress, they should attempt to trample upon the <rs>Constitution</rs>; if they should attempt to violate the rights of the <name>States</name>; if they should attempt to infringe upon our equality in the <rs>Union</rs>--I believe that even in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, though it has not had a representative in Congress for many a day, the State-rights Democracy, in whose breasts beats the spirit of the <name>Revolution</name>, can and will whip the black Republicans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4356"/>I trust we shall never be thus purified, as it were, by fire; but that the peaceful progressive revolution of the ballot-box will answer all the glorious purposes of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4357"/>And I marked that the distinguished orator and statesman who preceded me, in addressing <pb id="p.632" n="632"/> you, used the words <quote>national</quote> and <quote>constitutional</quote> in such relation to each other as to show that in his mind the <num value="1">one</num> was a synonym of the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4358"/>I say so: we became national by the constitutional, the bond for uniting the <name>States</name>, and national and constitutional are convertible terms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4359"/> Your candidate for the high <orgName>office of Governor</orgName>, whom I have been once or twice on the point of calling Governor, and whom I hope I may be able soon to call so, in his remarks to you has presented the same idea in another form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4360"/>And well may <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> orators, without even perceiving what they are saying, utter sentiments which lie at the foundation of your colonial as well as your subsequent political history, which existed in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> before the <name>Revolution</name>, and have existed ever since, whenever the true spirit which comes down from the revolutionary sires has swelled and found utterance within her limits. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4361"/> It has been not only, my friends, in this increasing and mutual dependence of interest that we have found new ties to you. Those bonds are both material and mental.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4362"/>Every improvement or invention, every construction of a railroad, has formed a new reason for our being <num value="1">one</num>; every new invention, whether it has been in arts or science, in war or in <pb id="p.633" n="633"/> manufactures, has constituted for us a new bond and a new sentiment holding us together. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4363"/> Why, then, I would ask, do we see these lengthened shadows which follow in the course of our political history?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4364"/>Is it because our sun is declining to the horizon?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4365"/>Are they the shadows of evening, or are they, as I hopefully believe, but the mists which are exhaled by the sun as it rises, but which are to be dispersed by its meridian of glory?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4366"/>Are they but the little evanishing clouds that flit between the people and the great objects for which the <rs>Constitution</rs> was established?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4367"/>I hopefully look toward the reaction which will establish the fact that our sun is still in the ascendant, that the cloud which has so long covered our political horizon is to be dispersed, that we are not again to be divided on parallels of latitude and about the domestic institutions of States--a sectional attack on the prosperity and tranquillity of a nation-but only by differences in opinion upon measures of expediency, upon questions of relative interest, by discussion as to the powers of the <name>States</name> and the rights of the <name>States</name>, and the powers of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>; such discussion as is commemorated in this picture of your own great and glorious <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0037.0042.00633.02202" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Sidney,,,:2"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>, when he specially addressed our best, most <pb id="p.634" n="634"/> tried, and greatest man, the pure and incorruptible <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n0037.0042.00634.02203" reg="nearbymention:Calhoun,John,C.,,"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>, represented as intently listening to catch the accents of eloquence that fell from his lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4368"/>Those giants strove each for his conviction, not against a section, not against each other; they stood to each other in the relation of personal affection and esteem, and never did I see <persName n="Webster,Mister,,,," id="n0037.0042.00634.02204" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Sidney,,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName> so agitated, never did I hear his voice falter, as when he delivered the eulogy on <persName n="Calhoun,,John,C.,," id="n0037.0042.00634.02205" reg="default:Calhoun,John,C.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4369"/> But allusion was made to my own connection with your great and favorite departed statesman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4370"/>Of that I will only say, on this occasion, that very early in my congressional life <persName n="Webster,Mister,,,," id="n0037.0042.00634.02206" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Sidney,,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName> was arraigned for an offence which affected him most deeply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4371"/>He was no accountant, and all knew that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4372"/>He was arraigned on a pecuniary charge &mdash; the misapplication of what is known as the <orgName n="Secret Service Fund" type="fund">secret-service fund</orgName>-and I was <num value="1">one</num> of the committee that had to investigate the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4373"/>I endeavored to do justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4374"/>I endeavored to examine the evidence with a view to ascertain the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4375"/>It is true I remembered that he was an eminent American statesman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4376"/>It is true that, as an American, I hoped he would come out without a stain upon his garments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4553"/>Finally, at the proper time, and on the attainment by the territory of sufficient strength and population for self-government, to receive it into the <rs>Union</rs> on a footing of entire equality with the original States-sovereign and self-governing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4554"/>All this is no more inconsistent with the true principles of <q direct="unspecified">popular sovereignty,</q> properly understood, than the temporary subjection of a minor to parental control is inconsistent with the doctrines of the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, or the exceptional discipline of a man-of-war or a military post with the principles of republican freedom. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4555"/>The usual process of transition from a territorial condition to that of a State was, in the first place, by an act of Congress authorizing the inhabitants to elect representatives to a <pb id="p.659" n="659"/> convention to form a State Constitution, which was then submitted to Congress for approval and ratification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4556"/>On such ratification the supervisory control of Congress was withdrawn, and the new State authorized to assume its sovereignty, and the inhabitants of the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> became citizens of a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4557"/>In the cases of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></dateStruct>, and <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> and <placeName reg="Michigan" key="tgn,7007520">Michigan</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></dateStruct>, the failure of the inhabitants to obtain an <q direct="unspecified">enabling act</q> of Congress, before organizing themselves, very nearly caused the rejection of their applications for admission as States, though they were eventually granted on the ground that the subsequent approval and consent of Congress could heal the prior irregularity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4558"/>The entire control of Congress over the whole subject of territorial government had never been questioned in earlier times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4559"/>Necessarily conjoined with the power of this protectorate, was of course the duty of exercising it for the safety of the persons and property of all citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, permanently or temporarily resident in any part of the domain belonging to the <name>States</name> in common. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4560"/>Logically carried out, the new theory of <q direct="unspecified">popular sovereignty</q> would apply to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> adventurous pioneers settling in the wilderness before the organization of any Territorial government by Congress, as well as <pb id="p.660" n="660"/> afterward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4561"/>If <q direct="unspecified"> sovereignty</q> is inherent in a <num value="1000">thousand</num> or <num value="5000">five thousand</num> persons, there can be no valid ground for denying its existence in a dozen, as soon as they pass beyond the limits of State governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4562"/>The advocates of this novel doctrine, however, if rightly understood, generally disavowed any claim to its application prior to the organization of a Territorial government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4563"/>The Territorial Legislatures, to which Congress delegated a portion of its power and duty to <q direct="unspecified"> make all needful rules and regulations respecting the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>,</q> were the mere agents of Congress, exercising an authority subject to Congressional supervision and control &mdash; an authority conferred only for the sake of convenience, and liable at any time to be revoked and annulled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4564"/>Yet it is proposed to recognize in these provisional, subordinate, and temporary legislative bodies, a power not possessed by Congress itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4565"/>This is to claim that the creature is endowed with an authority not possessed by the creator, or that the stream has risen to an elevation above that of its source. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4566"/>Furthermore, in contending for a power in the <rs>Territorial Legislatures</rs> permanently to determine the fundamental, social, and political institutions of the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>, and thereby virtually to prescribe those of the future <pb id="p.661" n="661"/> State, the advocates of <q direct="unspecified"> popular sovereignty</q> were investing those dependent and subsidiary bodies with powers far above any exercised by the <name>Legislatures</name> of the fully organized and sovereign States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4567"/>The authority of the <rs>State Legislatures</rs> is limited, both by the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> and by the respective State constitutions from which it is derived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4712"/>As her senator, I endeavored plainly to state her position in the annexed remarks addressed to the <name>Senate</name> in taking leave of the body: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4713"/><quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>I rise, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, for the purpose of announcing to the <name>Senate</name> that I have satisfactory evidence that the <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">State of Mississippi</placeName>, by a solemn ordinance of her people, in convention assembled, has declared her separation from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4714"/>Under these circumstances, of course, my functions are terminated here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4715"/>It has seemed to me proper, however, that I should appear in the <name>Senate</name> to announce that fact to my associates, and I will say but very little more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4716"/>The occasion does not invite me to go into argument, and my physical condition would not permit me to <pb id="p.688" n="688"/> do so, if it were otherwise; and yet it seems to become me to say something on the part of the <rs>State</rs> I here represent on an occasion so solemn as this. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4717"/>It is known to <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> who have served with me here that I have for many years advocated, as an essential attribute of State sovereignty, the right of a State to secede from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4718"/>Therefore, if I had not believed there was justifiable cause, if I had thought that <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> was acting without sufficient provocation, or without an existing necessity, I should still, under my theory of the government, because of my allegiance to the <rs>State</rs> of which I am a citizen, have been bound by her action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4719"/>I, however, may be permitted to say that I do think she has justifiable cause, and I approve of her act. I conferred with her people before that act was taken, counselled them then that, if the state of things which they apprehended should exist when their convention met, they should take the action which they have now adopted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4720"/>I hope none who hear me will confound this expression of mine with the advocacy of the right of a State to remain in the <rs>Union</rs>, and to disregard its constitutional obligations by the nullification of the law. Such is not my theory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4721"/>Nullification and secession, so often confounded, are, indeed, antagonistic <pb id="p.689" n="689"/> principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4722"/>Nullification is a remedy which it is sought to apply within the <rs>Union</rs>, and against the agent of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4723"/>It is only to be justified when the agent has violated his constitutional obligations, and a State, assuming to judge for itself, denies the right of the agent thus to act, and appeals to the other States of the <rs>Union</rs> for a decision; but, when the <name>States</name> themselves, and when the people of the <name>States</name> have so acted as to convince us that they will not regard our constitutional rights, then, and then for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, arises the doctrine of secession in its practical application. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4724"/>A great man who now reposes with his fathers, and who has often been arraigned for a want of fealty to the <rs>Union</rs>, advocated the doctrine of nullification because it preserved the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4725"/>It was because of his deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4726"/>seated attachment to the Union-his determination to find some remedy for existing ills short of a severance of the ties which bound <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> to the other States--that <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0037.0045.00689.02318" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,John,C.,,:4"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> advocated the doctrine of nullification, which he proclaimed to be peaceful, to be within the limits of State power, not to disturb the <rs>Union</rs>, but only to be a means of bringing the agent before the tribunal of the <name>States</name> for their judgment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4727"/>Secession belongs to a different class of <pb id="p.690" n="690"/> remedies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4728"/>It is to be justified upon the basis that the <name>States</name> are sovereign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4729"/>There was a time when none denied it. I hope the time may come again when a better comprehension of the theory of our Government, and the inalienable rights of the people of the <name>States</name>, will prevent anyone from denying that each State is a sovereign, and thus may reclaim the grants which it has made to any agent whom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4730"/>soever. </p> 
<p>I, therefore, say I concur in the action of the people of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, believing it to be necessary and proper, and should have been bound by their action if my belief had been otherwise; and this brings me to the important point which I wish, on this last occasion, to present to the <name>Senate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4731"/>It is by this confounding of nullification and secession that the name of a great man whose ashes now mingle with his mother earth has been invoked to justify coercion against a seceded State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4732"/>The phrase <quote>to execute the laws</quote> was an expression which <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0037.0045.00690.02319" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,A.,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> applied to the case of a State refusing to obey the laws while yet a member of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4733"/>That is not the case which is now presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4734"/>The laws are to be executed over the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and upon the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4735"/>They have no relation to any foreign country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4736"/>It is a perversion of terms-at least, <pb id="p.691" n="691"/> it is a great misapprehension of the case &mdash; which cites that expression for application to a State which has withdrawn from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4737"/>You may make war on a foreign state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4738"/>If it be the purpose of gentlemen, they may make war against a State which has withdrawn from the <rs>Union</rs>; but there are no laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to be executed within the limits of a seceded State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4739"/>A State finding herself in the condition in which <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> has judged she is &mdash; in which her safety requires that she should provide for the maintenance of her rights out of the Union-surrenders all the benefits (and they are known to be many), deprives herself of the advantages (and they are known to be great), severs all the ties of affection (and they are close and enduring) which have bound her to the <rs>Union</rs>; and thus divesting herself of every benefit-taking upon herself every burden-she claims to be exempt from any power to execute the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> within her limits. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4740"/>I well remember an occasion when <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> was arraigned before the bar of the <name>Senate</name>, and when the doctrine of coercion was rife, and to be applied against her, because of the rescue of a fugitive slave in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4741"/>My opinion then was the same that it is now. Not in a spirit of egotism, but to show that I am not influenced in my own <pb id="p.692" n="692"/> opinions because the case is my own, I refer to that time and that occasion as containing the opinion which I then entertained, and on which my present conduct is based.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4742"/>I then said that if <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>-following her purpose through a stated line of conduct &mdash; chose to take the last step which separates her from the <rs>Union</rs>, it is her right to go, and I will neither vote <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar</measure> nor <num value="1">one</num> man to coerce her back; but I will say to her, <name n="God" type="God">God</name> speed in memory of the kind associations which once existed between her and the other States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4743"/> It has been a conviction of pressing necessity, it has been a belief that we are to be deprived in the <rs>Union</rs> of the rights which our fathers bequeathed us, which has brought <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> to her present decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4744"/>She has heard proclaimed the theory that all men are created free and equal, and this made the basis of an attack upon her social institutions; and the sacred <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> has been invoked to maintain the position of the equality of the races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4745"/>That <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> is to be construed by the circumstances and purposes for which it was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4746"/>The communities were declaring their independence; the people of those communities were asserting that no man was born, to use the language of <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n0037.0045.00692.02320" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, booted and spurred, to ride over the rest of mankind; <pb id="p.693" n="693"/> that men were created equal, meaning the men of the political community; that there was no divine right to rule; that no man inherited the right to govern; that there were no classes by which power and place descended to families; but that all stations were equally within the grasp of each member of the body politic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4747"/>These were the great principles they announced; these were the purposes for which they made their declaration; these were the ends to which their enunciation was directed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4748"/>They have no reference to the slave; else, how happened it that among the items of arraignment against <persName><foreName>George</foreName> <genName n="3">III</genName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4749"/>was that he endeavored to do just what the <rs>North</rs> has been endeavoring of late to do, to stir up insurrection among our slaves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4750"/>Had the <name>Declaration</name> announced that the negroes were free and equal, how was the prince to be arraigned for raising up insurrection among them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4751"/>And how was this to be enumerated among the high crimes which caused the colonies to sever their connection with the mother-country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4752"/>When our Constitution was formed, the same idea was rendered more palpable; for there we find provision made for that very class of persons as property; they were not put upon the footing of equality with white men, not even that of paupers and convicts; but, so far as representation <pb id="p.694" n="694"/> was concerned, were discriminated against as a lower caste, only to be represented in the numerical proportion of <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4753"/>So stands the compact which binds us together. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4754"/> Then, <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, we recur to the principles upon which our Government was founded; and when you deny them, and when you deny to us the right to withdraw from a Government which, thus perverted, threatens to be destructive to our rights, we but tread in the path of our fathers when we proclaim our independence and take the hazard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4755"/>This is done, not in hostility to others, not to injure any section of the country, not even for our own pecuniary benefit, but from the high and solemn motive of defending and protecting the rights we inherited, and which it is our duty to transmit unshorn to our children. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4756"/>I find in myself, perhaps, a type of the general feeling of my constituents toward yours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4757"/>I am sure I feel no hostility toward you, <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> from the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4758"/>I am sure there is not <num value="1">one</num> of you, whatever sharp discussion there may have been between us, to whom I cannot now say, in the presence of my <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, I wish you well; and such, I am sure, is the feeling of the people whom I represent toward those whom you represent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4759"/>I, therefore, feel that I but express their desire <pb id="p.695" n="695"/> when I say I hope and they hope for peaceable relations with you, though we must part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4760"/>They may be mutually beneficial to us in the future, as they have been in the past, if you so will it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4761"/>In the course of my service here, associated at different times with a great variety of <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, I see now around me some with whom I have served long; there have been points of collision, but, whatever of offence there has been to me, I leave here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4762"/>I carry with me no hostile remembrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4763"/>Whatever offence I have given which has not been redressed, or for which satisfaction has not been demanded, I have, <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, in this hour of our parting, to offer you my apology for any pain which, in the heat of the discussion, I have inflicted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4764"/>I go hence unencumbered by the remembrance of any injury received, and having discharged the duty of making the only reparation in my power for any injury offered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4767"/>On the morning of the day he was to address his colleagues, the crowd began to move toward the <rs type="place">Senate Chamber</rs> as early as <time value="7oclock">seven o'clock</time>. By <num value="9">nine</num> there was hardly standing room within the galleries or in the passway behind the forum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4768"/>The <rs>Senators</rs>' cloak-room was crowded to excess, and the bright faces of the ladies were assembled together like a mosaic of flowers in the doorway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4769"/>The sofas and the passways were full, and ladies sat on the floor against the wall where they could not find seats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4770"/>There brooded over this immense crowd a palpitating, expectant silence which was afterward remarked as very unusual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4771"/>I sent a servant at <time value="7oclock">seven o'clock</time>, who, with a friend of hers, kept my seat and that of my companion, until the morning hour had expired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4772"/>The gallery of the reporters was occupied by the <rs>Diplomatic Corps</rs> and their respective families. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4774"/>Curiosity and the expectation of an intellectual feast seemed to be the prevailing feeling, and I, who had come from a sleepless night, all through the watches of which war and its attendants, famine and bloodshed had been predicted in despairing accents, looked on this festive crowd and wondered if they saw beyond the cold exterior of the orator-his deep depression, his desire for reconciliation, and his overweening love for the <rs>Union</rs> in whose cause he had bled, and to maintain which he was ready to sacrifice all but liberty and equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4775"/>We felt blood in the air, and mourned in secret over the severance of tender ties both of relationship and friendship; but a cloud covered all the rest, and our hearts were <quote>exceeding sorrowful even unto death;</quote> we could even guess at the end. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4778"/>He glanced over the <name>Senate</name> with the reluctant look, the dying cast on those upon whom they gaze for the last time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4779"/>His voice was at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> low and faltering, but soon it rang out melodiously clear, like a silver trumpet, to the extremest verge <pb id="p.698" n="698"/> of the assembly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4780"/>The music of his voice prevented the great volume of sound from jarring upon the ears of his audience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4781"/>Unshed tears were in it, and a plea for peace permeated every tone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4782"/>Every graceful gesture seemed to invite to brotherly love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4783"/>His manner suggested that of <num value="1">one</num> who parts from his family, because even death were better than estrangement. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4784"/>He was listened to in profound silence, broken only by repeated applause, which his face revealed he deprecated before the <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice-President</rs> called the audience to order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4785"/>The orator was too grief-stricken and too terribly in earnest to think of the impression he might create upon others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4786"/>Had he been bending over his bleeding father, needlessly slain by his countrymen, he could not have been more pathetic or inconsolable. </p>
