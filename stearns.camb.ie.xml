<head>Preface</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>It has never been my practice to introduce myself to distinguished persons, or to attempt in any way to attract their attention, and I now regret that I did not embrace some opportunities which occurred to me in early life for doing so; but at the time I knew the men whom I have described in the present volume I had no expectation that I should ever write about them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>My acquaintance with them, however, has served to give me a more elevated idea of human nature than I otherwise might have acquired in the ordinary course of mundane affairs, and it is with the hope of transmitting this impression to my readers that I publish the present account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Some of them have a world-wide celebrity, and others who were distinguished in their own time seem likely now to be forgotten; but they all deserve well of the republic of humanity and of the age in which they lived.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2139"/>I have heard something of his quick temper: that he was indignant at this or that man's behavior, but never that his anger outlasted for a moment the mischief done or threatened to the good cause, or ever stood in the way of his hearty co-operation with the offenders, when they returned to the path of public duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2140"/>I look upon him as a type of the <orgName n="American Republican" type="newspaper">American republican</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2141"/>A man of the people, in strictly private life, girt with family ties; an active and intelligent manufacturer and merchant, enlightened enough to <pb id="p.283" n="283"/> see a citizen's interest in the public affairs, and virtuous enough to obey to the uttermost the truth he saw,--he became, in the most natural manner, an indispensable power in the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2142"/>Without such vital support as he, and such as he, brought to the government, where would that government be?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2143"/>When <num value="1">one</num> remembers his incessant service; his journeys and residences in many States; the societies he worked with; the councils in which he sat; the wide correspondence, presently enlarged by printed circulars, then by newspapers established wholly or partly at his own cost; the useful suggestions; the celerity with which his purpose took form; and his immovable convictions,--I think this single will was worth to the cause <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> ordinary partisans, well-disposed enough, but of feebler and interrupted action.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2144"/>These interests, which he passionately adopted, inevitably led him into personal communication with patriotic persons holding the same views,--with <num value="2">two</num> <rs type="role2">Presidents</rs>, with members of Congress, with officers of the government and of the army, and with leading people everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2145"/>He had been always a man of simple tastes, and through all his years devoted to the growing details of his prospering manufactory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2146"/>But this sudden association now with the leaders of parties and persons of pronounced power and influence in the nation, and <pb id="p.284" n="284"/> the broad hospitality which brought them about his board at his own house, or in New York, or in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, never altered <num value="1">one</num> feature of his face, <num value="1">one</num> trait in his manners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2147"/>There he sat in the council, a simple, resolute Republican, an enthusiast only in his love of freedom and the good of men; with no pride of opinion, and with this distinction, that, if he could not bring his associates to adopt his measure, he accepted with entire sweetness the next best measure which could secure their assent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2148"/>But these public benefits were purchased at a severe cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2149"/>For a year or <num value="2">two</num>, the most affectionate and domestic of men became almost a stranger in his beautiful home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2150"/>And it was too plain that the excessive toil and anxieties into which his ardent spirit led him overtasked his strength and wore out prematurely his constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2151"/>It is sad that such a life should end prematurely; but when I consider that he lived long enough to see with his own eyes the salvation of his country, to which he had given all his heart; that he did not know an idle day; was never called to suffer under the decays and loss of his powers, or to see that others were waiting for his place and privilege, but lived while he lived, and beheld his work prosper for the joy and benefit of all mankind,--I count him happy among men.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2152"/>Almost I am ready to say to these mourners, <pb id="p.285" n="285"/> Be not too proud in your grief, when you remember that there is not a town in the remote <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">State of Kansas</placeName> that will not weep with you as at the loss of its founder; not a Southern State in which the freedmen will not learn to-day from their preachers that <num value="1">one</num> of their most efficient benefactors has departed, and will cover his memory with benedictions; and that, after all his efforts to serve men without appearing to do so, there is hardly a man in this country worth knowing who does not hold his name in exceptional honor.
