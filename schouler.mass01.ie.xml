<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>About this time,&mdash;a few days subsequent, however,&mdash;a gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,7013352" n="1.000 11" reg="baltimore, baltimore independent city, maryland">Baltimore</placeName> came out to <placeName reg="Back River, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,2142203">Back-river</placeName> Bridge, about <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> this side of the city, and told the bridge-keeper that he had come to give information which had come to his knowledge of vital importance to the road, which he wished communicated to me. The nature of this communication was, that a party was then organized in <placeName key="tgn,7013352" n="1.000 11" reg="baltimore, baltimore independent city, maryland">Baltimore</placeName> to burn our bridges, in case <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0152.0002.00060.00536" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> came over the road, or in case we attempted to carry troops for the defence of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 4" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>The party, at that time, had combustible materials prepared to pour over the bridges; and were to disguise themselves as negroes, and be at the bridge just before the train in which <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0152.0002.00060.00537" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> travelled had arrived.

This man appeared to be a gentleman and in earnest, and honest in what he said; but he would not give his name, nor allow any inquiries to be made as to his name or exact abode, as he said his life would be in peril were it known that he had given this information; but, if we would not attempt to find him out, he would continue to come and give information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>He came subsequently several times, and gave items of information as to the movements of the conspirators; but I have never been able to ascertain who he was.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>He scouted the idea that there was any such thing on foot; said he had thoroughly investigated the whole matter, and there was not the slightest foundation for such rumors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>I then determined to have nothing more to do with <persName n="Kane,Marshal,,,," id="n0152.0002.00061.00543" reg="mostcommon:Kane,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Marshal">Marshal</roleName> <surname>Kane</surname></persName>, but to investigate the matter in my own way, and at once sent for a celebrated detective, who resided in the <rs>West</rs>, and whom I had before employed on an important matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>He was a man of great skill and resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>I furnished him with a few hints, and at once set him on the track with <num value="8">eight</num> assistants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>There were then drilling, upon the line of the railroad, some <num value="3">three</num> military organizations, professedly for home defence, pretending to be Union men, and, in <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> instances, tendering their services to the railroad in case of trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>Their propositions were duly considered; but the defence of the road was never intrusted to their tender mercies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing done was to enlist a volunteer in each of these military companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>They pretended to come from New Orleans and <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, and did not appear to be wanting in sympathy for the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>They were furnished with uniforms at the expense of the road, and drilled as often as their associates in arms; became initiated into all the secrets of the organization, and reported every day or <num value="2">two</num> to their chief, who immediately reported to me the designs and plans of these military companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/><num value="1">One</num> of these organizations was loyal; but the other <num value="2">two</num> were disloyal, and fully in the plot to destroy the bridges, and march to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 4" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, to wrest it from the hands of the legally constituted authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>Every nook and corner of the road and its vicinity was explored by the chief and his detectives, and the secret working of secession and treason laid bare, and brought to light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>Societies were joined in <placeName key="tgn,7013352" n="1.000 11" reg="baltimore, baltimore independent city, maryland">Baltimore</placeName>, and various modes known to, and practised only by, detectives, were resorted to, to win the confidence of the conspirators, and get into their secrets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>The plan worked well; and the <pb id="p.62" n="62"/> midnight plottings and daily consultations of the conspirators were treasured up as a guide to our future plans for thwarting them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>It turned out, that all that had been communicated by <persName n="Dix,Miss,,,," id="n0152.0002.00062.00544" reg="mostcommon:Dix,John,A.,,:2"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Dix</surname></persName> and the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,7013352" n="1.000 11" reg="baltimore, baltimore independent city, maryland">Baltimore</placeName> rested upon a foundation of fact, and that the half had not been told.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>It was made as certain as strong circumstantial and positive evidence could make it, that there was a plot to burn the bridges and destroy the road, and murder <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0152.0002.00062.00545" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> on his way to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 4" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, if it turned out that he went there before troops were called.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>If troops were <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> called, then the bridges were to be destroyed, and <placeName reg="Washington cut">Washington cut</placeName> off, and taken possession of by the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>I at once organized and armed a force of about <num value="200">two hundred</num> men, whom I distributed along the line between the <rs>Susquehanna</rs> and <rs>Baltimore</rs>, principally at the bridges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>These men were drilled secretly and regularly by drill-masters, and were apparently employed in whitewashing the bridges, putting on some <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="7">seven</num> coats of whitewash, saturated with salt and alum, to make the outside of the bridges as nearly fireproof as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>This whitewashing, so extensive in its application, became the <measure n="9days" type="date">nine days</measure> wonder of the neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>Thus the bridges were strongly guarded, and a train was arranged so as to concentrate all the forces at <num value="1">one</num> point in case of trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>The programme of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0152.0002.00062.00546" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was changed; and as it was decided by him that he would go to <placeName reg="Harrisburg, Dauphin, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013694">Harrisburg</placeName> from <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, and thence over the <rs>Northern Central</rs> road by day to <placeName key="tgn,7013352" n="1.000 11" reg="baltimore, baltimore independent city, maryland">Baltimore</placeName>, and thence to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 4" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>We were then informed by our detective, that the attention of the conspirators was turned from our road to the <rs>Northern Central</rs>, and that they would there await the coming of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0152.0002.00062.00547" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>This statement was confirmed by our <placeName key="tgn,7013352" n="1.000 11" reg="baltimore, baltimore independent city, maryland">Baltimore</placeName> gentleman, who came out again, and said their designs upon our road were postponed for the present, and, unless we carried troops, would not be renewed again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>Thus matters stood on his arrival in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>I felt it my duty to communicate to him the facts that had come to my knowledge, and urge his going to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 4" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> privately that night in our sleeping-car, instead of publicly <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> after, as was proposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1130"/>The reason for this distinction has never been given.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1131"/>The material of these commands was of the best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1132"/>They were young men who had a taste for military duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/>They were from the middle walks of life, and depended upon their health and hands for support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1134"/>Most of them were mechanics, farmers' sons, and clerks in stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1135"/>They bought their own uniforms, and paid company assessments out of their own pockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1136"/>They were public-spirited, full of life, and knew their duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1137"/>Many of the companies had honorable records, running back to the war of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, of which they were proud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1138"/>They had rivalries and jealousies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1139"/>They demanded their right position in the regimental line, and would have it. They obeyed their officers because they were their officers, and held positions by their votes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1140"/>They chose the color and style of their own uniforms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1141"/>If a rival company wore blue, they would have gray or red. The uniforms in a regiment were variegated, like the colors of a rainbow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1142"/>They were made more for show than use, as active service proved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1143"/>Yet they cost much money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1144"/>But it was no <num value="1">one</num>'s business but their own, as they paid the bills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1145"/>They had their pet names, as well as the regimental letter, and they preferred being known by the name they had themselves chosen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1146"/>Thus there were the N. E. G.'s and B. L. I.&apos;s, the <q direct="unspecified">Tigers,</q> the <q direct="unspecified">Savages,</q> and the <q direct="unspecified">Guards.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1147"/>Each had its friends and followers, and each its enemies and detractors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1148"/>Yet beneath all these there was a substratum of genuine good feeling, and a soldierly pride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1149"/>The very opposition they received from those who laughed or sneered at the militia cemented them in closer union, and made them more determined to be militia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1150"/>Their armories were their own. There they could meet and drill, and talk back at the outside world, free from interruption, as in their own homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1151"/>These they adorned with pictures of old generals, photographs of former captains, and fac-similes of the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1152"/>There they talked of bygone <pb id="p.84" n="84"/> musters and sham fights, and of excursions to neighboring cities and States, and of receptions given in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1153"/>The dates of prominent events were fixed by the year of such a spring training or fall review.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1154"/>The politics of the members were not of the intense type.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1155"/>Their votes were generally given to men who were friendly to the military, and politicians sometimes made nominations with a view to catch their votes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1156"/>On public affairs, they were simply friends of their country, with a strong leaning toward liberal legislation and popular rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1157"/>They were, of all the community, the least fanatical in religion, and the least dogmatic in politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1158"/>They took a broad view of their country and its institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1159"/>They were stronger Union men than they could explain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1160"/>If the <rs>Union</rs> was attacked, it was their duty to defend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1161"/>This they knew, and were ready.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1162"/>There was no hatred in their hearts to any living man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2002"/>Sir,&mdash;Having reference to the letter of <persName n="Boutwell,the Honorable,George,S.,," id="n0152.0003.00141.01465" reg="default:Boutwell,George,S.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Boutwell</surname></persName>, I beg leave to say, that, after you showed it me this morning, I found that the only really suitable vessel in port for the purpose indicated was on the point of being sold for <measure n="75000dollars" type="currency">$75,000</measure>. Just before the war, her owners asked <measure n="70000dollars" type="currency">$70,000</measure> for her, which I thought a little too high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2003"/>Under the circumstances, however, she seemed to me cheap; and I took the responsibility of buying her, intending to offer her to you or to the <rs>General Government</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2004"/>I have since applied to the underwriters and merchants to take and own half of the ship, if the <rs>State</rs> will take the other half, with the understanding that she is to be managed as an armed transport, used to convey troops and stores, at the prices current for other transports; and, when not so used, to act as <orgName n="Coast Guard" type="military">coast-guard</orgName> or despatch vessel, under the management of a Government agent or agents.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2005"/>It is hoped, upon this basis, to make her pay her way, with little or no loss, besides doing good service, and keeping up the confidence of our citizens and the fears of our enemies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2006"/>If you approve the plan, I should like to have you own such part of her as I cannot get readily taken by the underwriters; also, proportion of her outfit, which I estimate at under <measure n="10000dollars" type="currency">$10,000</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2007"/>She can at once load coal and the stores ordered, get on board the guns, which the <rs type="place">Navy Yard</rs> will lend us temporarily, and be ready for troops or other service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2008"/>I have inquired also about other vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2009"/>The only suitable propeller is a small vessel of about <num value="300">three hundred</num> tons, nearly new, due here to-night, which can be bought for a trifle under <measure n="30000dollars" type="currency">$30,000</measure>. She would make a good temporary gunboat; could carry her crew, a good load of stores upon a pinch, and a few troops, not many.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2010"/>If you are disposed to have another vessel, she is the most available, and is not dear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2011"/>I think, if you wish it, the merchants and underwriters would take part of her,&mdash;probably half.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2012"/>She would be well adapted to the <orgName n="Coast Guard" type="military">coast-guard</orgName> now being raised.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2013"/>In addition to these, I have found a side-wheel ship of about <num value="1000">one thousand</num> tons, older than the others, and having the single advantage of light draught of water,&mdash;a good serviceable ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2014"/>She can be bought on reasonable terms to-day,&mdash;<hi rend="italics">not cheap</hi>, not very dear,&mdash;but, in my <pb id="p.142" n="142"/> opinion, not so desirable as either of the others, unless some new arrangement arises.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2242"/>He informed <persName n="Hicks,Governor,,,," id="n0152.0003.00157.01599" reg="mostcommon:Hicks,George,A.,,:1"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Hicks</surname></persName> that the soldiers of his command were armed only against insurgents and disturbers of the peace of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2243"/>He received from the <rs>Governor</rs> and <rs>Mayor</rs> assurances of the loyalty of the <rs>State</rs> to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2244"/>He told the <rs>Governor</rs> and <rs>Mayor</rs>, that, supported by the authorities of the <rs>State</rs> and city, he should repress all hostile demonstrations against the laws of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; and would protect both himself and the city of <placeName reg="Annapolis, Anne Arundel, Maryland" key="tgn,7013303">Annapolis</placeName> from any disorderly persons whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2245"/>Therefore, when he was subsequently informed of the probable insurrection, he could do nothing less than make the offer he did, as it came within the pledge he had given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2246"/>He proceeds, <q direct="unspecified">The question seemed to me to be neither military nor political, and was not to be so treated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2247"/>It was simply a question of good faith and honesty of purpose.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2248"/>He then speaks of <q direct="unspecified">the benign effect</q> which his offer had upon the people of <placeName key="tgn,7013303" n="1.000 6" reg="annapolis, anne arundel, maryland">Annapolis</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2249"/>The people had returned to their homes, and peace and order everywhere prevailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2250"/><q direct="unspecified">Confidence took the place of distrust, friendship of enmity, brotherly kindness of sectional hate; and I believe to-day there is no city in the <rs>Union</rs> more loyal than the city of <placeName reg="Annapolis, Anne Arundel, Maryland" key="tgn,7013303">Annapolis</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2251"/>I think, therefore, I may safely point to the results for my justification.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2252"/>He also says,&mdash;the <q direct="unspecified">neighboring county of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 4" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName></q> had a few days before elected a Union delegate to the <name>Legislature</name> by a vote of <num value="4000">four thousand</num> out of <num value="5000">five thousand</num> ballots,&mdash;This vote <q direct="unspecified">is among the many fruits of firmness of purpose, efficiency of action, and integrity of mission.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2253"/>But, as he may have to act hereafter <q direct="unspecified">in an enemy's country, among a servile population, when the question may arise as it has not yet arisen, as well in a moral and Christian as in a political and military point of view, what shall I do?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2254"/>The remainder of the letter we give entire&mdash; 
<text><body> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2255"/>I appreciate fully your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs>'s suggestion as to the inherent weakness of the rebels, arising from the preponderance of the servile population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2256"/>The question, then, is, in what manner shall we take advantage of that weakness?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2257"/>By allowing, and of course causing, <pb id="p.158" n="158"/> that population to rise upon the defenceless women and children of the country, carrying rapine, arson, and murder&mdash;all the horrors of <placeName reg="Republica Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">San Domingo</placeName> a <num value="1000000">million</num> of times magnified&mdash;among those whom we hope to re-unite with us as brethren, many of whom are already so, and all who are worth preserving will be, when this horrible madness shall have passed away or be threshed out of them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2258"/>Would your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> advise the troops under my command to make war in person upon defenceless women and children, of any part of the <rs>Union</rs>, accompanied with brutalities too horrible to be named?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2259"/>You will say, <name n="God" type="God">God</name> forbid!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2260"/>If we may not do so in person, shall we arm others so to do, over whom we can have no restraint, exercise no control, and who, when once they have tasted blood, may turn the very arms in their hands against ourselves as a part of the oppressing white race?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2261"/>The reading of history, so familiar to your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs>, will tell you, the bitterest cause of complaint which our fathers had against <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, in the war of the <name>Revolution</name>, was the arming by the <rs>British Ministry</rs> of the red man with the tomahawk and the scalping-knife against the women and children of the colonies; so that the phrase, <quote>May we not use all the means which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and nature have put in our hands to subjugate the colonies?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2262"/>has passed into a legend of infamy against the leader of that ministry who used it in Parliament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2263"/>Shall history teach us in vain?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2264"/>Could we justify ourselves to ourselves, although with arms in our hands, amid the savage wildness of camp and field, we may have blunted many of the finer moral sensibilities, in letting loose <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of worse than savages upon the homes and hearths of the <rs>South</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2265"/>Can we be justified to the <rs>Christian</rs> community of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2266"/>Would such a course be consonant with the teachings of our holy religion?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2267"/>I have a very decided opinion upon the subject; and if any <num value="1">one</num> desires&mdash;as I know your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> does not&mdash;this unhappy contest to be prosecuted in that manner, some instrument other than myself must be found to carry it on. I may not discuss the political bearings of this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2268"/>When I went from under the shadow of my roof-tree, I left all politics behind me, to be resumed only when every part of the <rs>Union</rs> is loyal to the flag, and the potency of the <rs>Government</rs> through the ballot-box is established.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2269"/>Passing the moral and <name>Christian</name> view, let us examine the subject as a military question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2270"/>Is not that State already subjugated which requires the bayonets of those armed in opposition to its rulers to preserve it from the horrors of a servile war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2271"/>As the least experienced of military men, I would have no doubt of the entire subjugation of a State brought to that condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2272"/>When, therefore,&mdash;unless I am better advised,&mdash;any community in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> who have met <pb id="p.159" n="159"/> me in an honorable warfare, or even in the prosecution of a rebellious war in an honorable manner, shall call upon me for protection against the nameless horrors of a servile insurrection, they shall have it; and from the moment that call is obeyed, I have no doubt we shall be friends, and not enemies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2273"/>The possibility that dishonorable means of defence are to be taken by the rebels against the <rs>Government</rs> I do not now contemplate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2274"/>If, as has been done in a single instance, my men are to be attacked by poison, or, as in another, stricken down by the assassin's knife, and thus murdered, the community using such weapons may be required to be taught, that it holds within its own border a more potent means for deadly purposes and indiscriminate slaughter than any which it can administer to us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2275"/>Trusting that these views may meet your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs>'s approval, I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant, </p><closer> <signed><persName n="Butler,,Benjamin,F.,," id="n0152.0003.00159.01600" reg="default:Butler,Benjamin,F.,,"><foreName n="Benjamin">Benj.</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName>  <surname>Butler</surname></persName>.</signed> </closer></body></text> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2276"/>The letter of <persName n="Andrew,Governor,,,," id="n0152.0003.00159.01601" reg="nearbymention:Andrew,John,A.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName> was not written for publication: whether the reply of <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0152.0003.00159.01602" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Benjamin,F.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> was written for that purpose, the reader can judge for himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2277"/>To the surprise of the <rs>Governor</rs>, both letters appeared in the public prints shortly after the reply of <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0152.0003.00159.01603" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Benjamin,F.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> was received by him. <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0152.0003.00159.01604" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Benjamin,F.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> gave as <num value="1">one</num> reason for the publication, that the <rs>Boston</rs> correspondent of the <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New-York Tribune</orgName> had referred to the correspondence in <num value="1">one</num> of his letters to that paper; and stated that the correspondent had received information concerning them from the <rs>Governor</rs>'s private secretary, (<persName n="Browne,Colonel,A.,G.,," id="n0152.0003.00159.01605" reg="expanded:Browne,Albert,G.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <surname>Browne</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2278"/>This charge was emphatically denied by the secretary, in a letter addressed to <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0152.0003.00159.01606" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Benjamin,F.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>, and he also obtained from the <name>Tribune</name> correspondent a letter denying, in the fullest and broadest sense, that he had given him the information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2279"/>Copies of these letters are on file in the <orgName n="Department of the Executive" type="government">executive department</orgName> in the <rs type="place">State House</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2280"/>The letters of <persName n="Andrew,Governor,,,," id="n0152.0003.00159.01607" reg="nearbymention:Andrew,John,A.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName> and <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0152.0003.00159.01608" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Benjamin,F.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> are interesting and important as an exhibition of the sentiments of the <num value="2">two</num> gentlemen respecting the proper course to pursue in regard to the slave population in a rebellious State, and also as to what was the proper course to pursue in the exigency which then existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2281"/>The Government had called for troops to proceed without delay to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 4" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, which was threatened by <pb id="p.160" n="160"/> rebel forces from <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2282"/>The troops had been called from their homes and workshops, and sent from the <rs>State</rs> to perform this duty, not to put down a negro insurrection in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2283"/>They had not volunteered for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2284"/>They were to go to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 4" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> with all possible despatch, and report to the <name>United-States</name> officers in command of that post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2285"/>The capital of the nation was in imminent peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2286"/>They were to defend it against the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2287"/>Thus <persName n="Andrew,Governor,,,," id="n0152.0003.00160.01609" reg="nearbymention:Andrew,John,A.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName> remonstrated against their being diverted, in violation of express orders, from the purpose for which they had been called into action.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2289"/>The General goes into a long argument upon the question of slave insurrections, illustrating his meaning by references to the atrocities of <placeName reg="Republica Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">San Domingo</placeName>, and the barbarities committed by the <rs>Indian</rs> allies of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in the war of the <name>Revolution</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2290"/>It is not our intention, however, to pursue this subject further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2291"/>The correspondence makes an interesting episode in the war record of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, and therefore could not properly be passed over without remark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2292"/>Nor is it necessary now to criticise the argument used by <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0152.0003.00160.01612" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Benjamin,F.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>, to show how utterly, at that time, he misunderstood and wrongly appreciated the character of the colored race in the <rs>Southern States</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2293"/>The only notice which <persName n="Andrew,Governor,,,," id="n0152.0003.00160.01613" reg="nearbymention:Andrew,John,A.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName> took of <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0152.0003.00160.01614" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Benjamin,F.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s letter was in a letter addressed to him, dated <dateStruct value="1861-05-21"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="21">21</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, from which we extract as follows:&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2295"/>And therefore, although your paper, by its discussions of questions not logically arising out of that to which it is in professed reply, has the tendency to mislead the reader injuriously to myself, yet I cannot persuade my own judgment that I should do otherwise than wrong, considering our mutual and public relations, were I to join <pb id="p.161" n="161"/> issue, and go to trial before the popular tribunal of newspaper readers.

<p>The delay at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 4" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> in calling for more troops, and the apparent neglect with which the <rs>Governor</rs>'s letters were treated, did not change his purpose nor daunt his spirit.

The preceding pages of this work have exhibited, in an imperfect and feeble manner, a portion of the services which he rendered to his State and country in the hour of its greatest peril,&mdash;we say imperfect and feeble, because much which he did was never put in writing, and many of his best thoughts and wisest suggestions were the inspiration of the moment, and conveyed to his friends and subordinates in colloquial conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2986"/>We had <pb id="p.217" n="217"/> known him long and well; and, during the <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> of his administration as <rs type="role" reg="Governor">Governor</rs> of this Commonwealth, our connection was official and confidential.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2987"/>We saw him every day, and had occasion to consult him upon nearly every matter in relation to the part which <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> took in the war. He was <num value="1">one</num> of the few men whom we have known, upon whom public life worked no detriment to the simplicity, honesty, and kindness of their character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2988"/>No man ever appeared in his presence to make a dishonest proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2989"/>If any <num value="1">one</num> approached him for such a purpose, he would not have had the hardihood to make it. His mind was active, and labor appeared to give him strength, rather than weakness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2990"/>It was the wonder of us all, how he could stand so much bodily and mental labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2991"/>When not absent from the city upon business connected with the war, at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 4" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, he was in his room at the <rs type="place">State House</rs>, like a skilful and steady pilot at the helm, guiding the <rs>Ship</rs> of State.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2995"/>Never despair of the republic, was his motto, and guide of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2996"/>He infused hope into minds bordering almost on despair, and his acts corresponded with the promptings of his heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2997"/>We well remember <num value="1">one</num> night, when the news of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0152.0005.00217.02116" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,B.,,:2"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s retreat reached <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>; the papers were filled with accounts of the terrible disaster; the names of the dead and wounded of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>' bravest and best were arrayed in the ghastly bulletins transmitted from the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2998"/>That very night, the <rs>Governor</rs> said, <q direct="unspecified">We must issue a new order, call for more men, incite recruiting, inspire hope, dispel gloom; this is the time which requires boldness, firmness, and every personal sacrifice.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2999"/>The order was <pb id="p.218" n="218"/> issued; it aroused the latent energies of the people; young men, who had not before thought of volunteering, offered themselves as recruits, eager to press forward to fill the gaps which disaster and death had made in our ranks: and so it was all through the war. He always had a kind word for the soldiers and their families, and he felt every word he spoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3000"/>It was no lip-service; it was no honeyed phrase; it was no politician's flattery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3001"/>It was earnest talk, kind talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3002"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> felt it, and were wiser men and truer patriots because of it.</p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3005"/>It was fitting that the heart of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> should sigh when <persName n="Andrew,,John,A.,," id="n0152.0005.00218.02118" reg="default:Andrew,John,A.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName> died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3006"/>It was fitting that his remains should be borne to the grave by those who knew him best, and loved him most,&mdash;the funeral cortege, as it wound its solemn way from the church in <address><street n="Arlington Street">Arlington Street</street></address> around the <name>Common</name>, past the <rs type="place">State House</rs>, over the broad avenue leading from the city; the march of the <name>Cadets</name>, with reversed arms, keeping step to the funeral dirge; that the sidewalks should be crowded with well-dressed men and women, who bowed their heads, or raised their hats, as the coffin moved before them to its resting-place in <placeName reg="Mount Auburn, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2140130">Mount Auburn</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3007"/>He was a private citizen when he died; he held no office; he had no honors to bestow: but his was a name beloved and cherished in all loyal hearts, and his was a death that moved them to the inmost core.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3008"/>He died when his manhood was in its prime; when the fruits of his wisdom and knowledge were ripening, and the future was holding out, with favoring hand, the highest honors of the republic; but&mdash;</p> <lg type="pentameter"><l>&lsquo;He has gone on the mountain,</l> <l>He is lost to the forest,</l> <l>Like a summer-dried fountain,</l> <l><hi rend="italics">When our need was the sorest</hi>.&rsquo;</l></lg>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3730"/>The Governor promised the <rs>President</rs> and <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> to aid in their completion to the extent of his ability; but, having given his promise <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0152.0005.00281.02686" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,Thomas,W.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> to furnish certain regiments for him, he asked that his promise to <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0152.0005.00281.02687" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,Thomas,W.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> should be fulfilled before undertaking to recruit new regiments for <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0152.0005.00281.02688" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Peter,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3731"/>In part fulfilment of this qualified promise, however, he designated the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 26">Twenty-sixth Regiment</orgName>, then nearly completed, and the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 28">Twenty-eighth Regiment</orgName>, when completed, to form the contingent of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> for <orgName n="command"><persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0152.0005.00281.02689" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Peter,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3733"/>He established a camp in <placeName reg="Lowell, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013975">Lowell</placeName>, and another in <placeName reg="Pittsfield, Berkshire, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014416">Pittsfield</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3734"/>He promised persons commissions, which no <num value="1">one</num> could issue but the <rs>Governor</rs>; he appointed recruiting officers, and enlisted men, and, in so doing, wholly ignored the act of Congress, and the orders and authority of the <rs>Governor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3735"/>The Governor had either to succumb or resist; to sink the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-chief</rs> of the <rs>State</rs> and become a mere recruiting officer, to issue commissions to men whom he did not know or respect, or to sustain the whole dignity of his position as a magistrate, and his honor as a gentleman.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3737"/>Without any of the pride which mere place sometimes gives, without any of the arrogance which power sometimes nourishes, without desire of self-aggrandizement or unmerited personal favor, with an entire absence of that <q direct="unspecified">insolence of office</q> which weak men <pb id="p.282" n="282"/> often show, he was at the same time the proudest, the firmest, the most determined enemy of any thing like mere pretension, come from whatever source it might.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3738"/>He never took a position which he had not <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> well considered; and, when his position was taken, nothing but a clear conviction that he was wrong could make him change from it. Though no man cared less for power than he did, no man was more conscientious and scrupulous in the exercise of it. His authority as Governor he regarded as delegated to him by the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3739"/>He held it in trust, to be exercised for their benefit, and to be trampled upon by no man. Hence, what may have appeared to some who have read this correspondence as matters of no moment, and which might have been passed by without objection, the <rs>Governor</rs> viewed as an indignity to the office he filled, involving principles which could neither be compromised with honor, nor ignored with silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3740"/>By pursuing this firm and steady course, he was enabled in the end to preserve inviolate the rights of the <rs>State</rs>, the dignity of its chief officer, and the demands of public justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3741"/>It was these traits of character which made him honored and respected while living, and caused him to be mourned for when dead, even as the children of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName>, when bondmen in a strange land, mourned their captivity, and hung their harps upon the willows which grew by the waters of <placeName reg="Babylon, Suffolk, New York" key="tgn,2067899">Babylon</placeName>. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4186"/>This rule was based upon the principle of selecting the best men he could find, without regard to personal or political affinities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4187"/>Whenever he could obtain the services of an experienced and educated officer to command a Massachusetts regiment, he commissioned him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4199"/>When a vacancy occurred after the regiment left the <rs>State</rs>, his rule was to wait until a recommendation of a person to fill the vacancy was received from the officer in command of the regiment, which recommendation required the approval and <pb id="p.320" n="320"/> indorsement of the officer in command of the brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4200"/>If the person recommended appeared, by the roster, to be junior to others of the same rank, the colonel was written to for his reasons for deviating from the military rule of seniority: if the reasons returned were satisfactory and properly indorsed, the promotion was made, and the commission issued; but, if the reasons given were not satisfactory,&mdash;if they disclosed favoritism, family influence, or unjust prejudice,&mdash;the appointment was not made, but the officer properly in the line of promotion was commissioned.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5645"/></p> 
<p>The officer thinks my rule is unjust, because some companies of the regiment have been mustered in sooner than others, and therefore the term should commence by companies, and not as a regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5646"/>Such <pb id="p.431" n="431"/> a rule would be an absurdity.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5649"/>It is true that some companies are formed and mustered in before others; but in making regiments, there must be a beginning and an ending, and this applies to companies as well as to regiments, for there is always a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> man and a last man in a company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5650"/>Why not apply the same rule to the term of service of men in a company, and let the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> who enlisted be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to be discharged?</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6167"/>The large number of persons who deserted from some of the regiments may surprise many readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6168"/>It is a fact, considered without explanation, not creditable to our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6169"/>Nearly all the desertions took place before the regiments left the <rs>State</rs>, and very few of the men belonged to <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6170"/>They came from other States, stimulated to enlist by the offer of large <pb id="p.475" n="475"/> bounties, and intending to desert as soon as they received the money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6171"/>The offer of large bounties by the cities and towns brought to the surface a class of men known as recruiting agents, who offered for a given sum to fill the quotas of the cities and towns who employed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6172"/>As a general rule, these persons were irresponsible and corrupt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6173"/>They opened offices in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, advertised their business in the newspapers, employed runners as bad as themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6174"/>To these agents many of the town authorities made applications for men. They were met with fair promises, for which they paid much money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6175"/>Neither the <rs>State</rs> nor the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> at this time paid bounties for <measure n="9months" type="date">nine months</measure> men. The bounties were paid by the several municipalities in the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6176"/>The men were obtained by these agents, sent to camp, and mustered into the service, put in uniform, and, as soon as opportunity offered, they deserted; having received their pay beforehand from the broker or agent, with whom, in many instances, they were in collusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6177"/>Some of them were afterwards arrested, and forwarded to their regiments; but the great majority escaped.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6178"/>The bounties paid by the towns varied in amount, ranging all the way from <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">fifty dollars</measure> to <num value="500">five hundred</num>; very few, however, were paid more than <measure n="200dollars" type="currency">two hundred dollars</measure> each; and the average amount, for the <num value="17143">17,143</num> <measure n="9months" type="date">nine months</measure> men, was a fraction over <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">one hundred dollars</measure> a man, which, by an act of the <name>Legislature</name>, was, in great part, reimbursed to the towns from the <rs>State</rs> treasury, to the total amount of <measure n="2300921dollars" type="currency">$2,300,921</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6179"/>Early in the month of <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, a disgraceful and cruel riot broke out in the <placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567">city of New York</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6180"/>It was instigated by persons who sympathized with the rebel cause, and wished it success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6181"/>The pretext for the mob was opposition to the law of Congress instituting a draft of men to fill our regiments at the seat of war. The successes of our arms at <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, were not to their tastes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6182"/>The rebel element in that city, therefore, seized hold of the act of Congress, and inflamed the ignorant masses to a degree which found no vent except in riot and bloodshed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6183"/>The vengeance of this mob, like that of all other mobs, expended its force upon the very poorest and most helpless of the community,&mdash;the <pb id="p.476" n="476"/> colored people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6184"/>Their Orphan Asylum was attacked, and the inmates fearfully abused, and the rioters,&mdash;imitating the <rs>Paris</rs> riots at the outbreak of the <rs>French Revolution</rs>,&mdash;hanged some of their victims to the lamp-posts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6185"/>The defection in New York spread to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, and to other parts of the country; but nowhere was life so brutally assailed, and property placed in jeopardy, as in the former city.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6186"/>Reliable information was received at the <rs type="place">State House</rs> that a riot was likely to take place in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6187"/>The Governor took immediate means to prevent it. The chief point of attack of the rioters was to be the armory of the <orgName type="regiment" key="11Battery">Eleventh Battery</orgName>, in <address><street n="Cooper Street">Cooper Street</street></address>, in which were deposited the guns of that company,&mdash;the only available cannon in the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6188"/>It became apparent, on the afternoon of the <dateStruct value="--14"><day reg="14">14th</day></dateStruct>, that an outbreak would at least be attempted; and active preparations to meet the exigency were immediately made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6189"/>The alarm spread also to the cities of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, <placeName reg="Roxbury, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015002">Roxbury</placeName>, <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName>, <persName n="Lowell,,,,," id="n0152.0009.00476.04118" reg="mostcommon:Lowell,Charles,R.,,:7"><surname>Lowell</surname></persName>, and New Bedford; and applications were made by the authorities of those places to the <rs>Governor</rs> for military assistance to maintain order, which requests were granted to the full extent demanded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6190"/>A brief abstract of the orders issued, having reference to the anticipated riots, will illustrate the active energy and determined resolution of the <rs>Governor</rs> to suppress all insubordination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7128"/>Many of the town officers were inexperienced, and were oftentimes defrauded by a class of men who represented themselves as recruiting agents, who had men at their command, to fill quotas for a certain sum of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7129"/>The town authorities, anxious to avoid a draft, gave a too willing ear to the representations of these men, and paid the town's money, before the men had been mustered in, and proper credits given to the towns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7130"/>When the muster and descriptive rolls were received at the <rs type="place">State House</rs> from the <name>United-States</name> mustering officers, and from the various camps of rendezvous, they did not show, in many instances, that the men had been enlisted, and were credited to the towns which had advanced the local bounty; so that towns which were supposed to have filled their quotas were still deficient in the number of men required of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7131"/>These failures caused much dissatisfaction, and, as a matter of course, the blame was attributed to the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</rs>, who it was supposed made out the rolls, and gave the credits, neither of which were true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7132"/>These failures to obtain credits were discussed in some of the newspapers in the <rs>State</rs>, and especially in a paper called the <orgName n="Vineyard Gazette" type="newspaper">Vineyard Gazette</orgName>, published in <placeName reg="Edgartown, Martha's Vineyard, Dukes" key="tgn,2049741">Edgartown, Dukes County</placeName>. <pb id="p.551" n="551"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7134"/>In this letter the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</rs> pointed out the very evils which the convention complained of, and contained suggestions which, adopted by the authorities at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 4" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, would have prevented their continuance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7136"/>It was the intention of the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</rs> to have taken no notice of the proceedings of the convention, or of the discussions in the newspapers, or of a <q direct="unspecified">circular signed by <persName n="Pease,,Richard,L.,," id="n0152.0010.00551.04590" reg="default:Pease,Richard,L.,,"><foreName>Richard</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Pease</surname></persName> and others,</q> dated <placeName key="tgn,2049741" n="1.000 10" reg="edgartown, martha's vineyard, dukes">Edgartown</placeName>, <dateStruct value="-06-13"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="13">13</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7139"/>I had seen this circular before; and I have read also articles in the <orgName n="Vineyard Gazette" type="newspaper">Vineyard Gazette</orgName>, upon the subject spoken of in the circular.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7140"/>I have not deemed it my duty to reply to these attacks, knowing as I did how utterly groundless they all were, so far as they regarded the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</rs>, or the clerks in his office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7141"/>From what I learn, the complaint is, that certain towns have enlisted, and paid local bounties to men whose names appear upon the muster and descriptive rolls in this office, credited to other towns; and, in some cases, names appear upon the muster-rolls as from <num value="1">one</num> town, and upon the descriptive rolls as from another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7142"/>Another class is of men whose names appear credited to no town upon the muster-rolls, and, upon the descriptive rolls, <pb id="p.552" n="552"/> to the town where they properly belong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7143"/>For these errors, discrepancies, and omissions the parties blame the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</rs>, or the clerks in his office,&mdash;with what justice let the following facts show.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7144"/>The rolls in this office show the names of about <num value="85000">eighty-five thousand</num> men. It would be strange, if, in making out these rolls, there should not have been some errors; but I believe them to be the most correct rolls in the possession of any State; and I know this is the opinion of <persName n="Breck,Major,,,," id="n0152.0010.00552.04593" reg="mostcommon:Breck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Breck</surname></persName>, <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7145"/>If they are not correct, it has not been the fault of any <num value="1">one</num> in this office; for, from the very beginning of the <rs>Rebellion</rs> until now, it has been the constant and unremitting endeavor of every <num value="1">one</num> in this office to have the rolls correct.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7146"/>But it appears that the gentlemen who find fault suppose that the rolls are made in this office, and under my immediate supervision; when the truth is, the rolls are made at the camps, by the officers in charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7147"/>When it is reported to me that a company or regiment is recruited to the proper standard, and the muster-rolls completed, an order is issued to the <name>United-States</name> mustering officer to go to camp, and muster it in. <num value="3">Three</num> copies of the roll are made out: <num value="1">one</num> is sent to the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, <num value="1">one</num> is retained by the captain of the company, and <num value="1">one</num> is sent to me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7148"/>These rolls are properly signed by the mustering officer, who certifies, <q direct="unspecified">on honor,</q> that they are correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7149"/>I then issue an order to the officer in command of the camp to have the <q direct="unspecified">descriptive roll</q> made out; and he has always been urged to see that they are made out correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7150"/>Before the company or regiment leaves the <rs>State</rs>, these rolls are deposited in this office, and are open to the inspection of any responsible person who wishes to examine them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7151"/>At the commencement of the <rs>Rebellion</rs>, and up to a very recent day, the muster-rolls used by the <name>United-States</name> authorities did not show the residence of the person; and it was on account of this defect that I had a form of blank made, which is known as a <q direct="unspecified">descriptive roll;</q> on this roll the residence of the person is given, and it has been from this roll that certificates for the <rs>State</rs> aid have been issued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7152"/>These rolls have been regarded as so correct, that the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> has requested copies for his office, where the muster-rolls of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> regiments or companies have been lost, or were never returned to his office.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7153"/>Your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> will see, by the above simple statement, that the rolls, about which complaint is made, are not made by me, or by any <num value="1">one</num> in this office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7154"/>They are made in the several camps, under the supervision of officers appointed by your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> to command them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7155"/><pb id="p.553" n="553"/> They are all properly certified to by the <name>United-States</name> mustering and company officers; and, in regard to the descriptive rolls, generally by the adjutant of the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7156"/>These rolls remain on file here, to be consulted whenever necessary.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7157"/>I might here close this communication, but I wish to add something more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7158"/>Few complaints were ever made that the rolls were incorrect until lately, and that since the inauguration of the system of offering large State and local bounties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7159"/>This system warmed into life a certain class of men known as recruiting or substitute brokers, who agree to fill the quotas of towns for a specified sum. I have not a high opinion of this class; and I have no doubt that many of the selectmen and town agents have been grossly swindled by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7160"/>Numerous cases have come to my knowledge, where they have given certificates that they had furnished the men, and that the men had been mustered in, when the facts were not so; and bounty money has been paid to recruits and brokers before any assurance could be given that the recruit would be accepted, and credited to the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7161"/>I have no doubt, that, in many cases, the recruit and broker were fellow-partners in the swindle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7162"/>Again, I have no doubt that gross wrong has been done by these brokers in this way; viz., men who go into new regiments can only be mustered in when the company is filled: this sometimes takes weeks, and months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7163"/>The broker's recruit goes to camp; and, before the muster is made, the broker sells the man again, and he turns up at last as a recruit for a certain ward in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, when he originally enlisted, it may be, for the quota of <placeName key="tgn,2049741" n="1.000 10" reg="edgartown, martha's vineyard, dukes">Edgartown</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7164"/>The <orgName n="Vineyard Gazette" type="newspaper">Vineyard Gazette</orgName> says that <placeName key="tgn,2049741" n="1.000 10" reg="edgartown, martha's vineyard, dukes">Edgartown</placeName> paid local bounties to the men who enlisted for the quota of that town, and were not credited to it, the sum of <measure n="10375dollars" type="currency">$10,375</measure>, and lays the blame upon this office.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7165"/>I have already shown that this office had nothing to do with making out the rolls, or with giving credits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7166"/>I regret that any town should have expended this sum without gaining any reward; but, instead of finding fault with innocent parties, I respectfully submit, that the taxpayers of the town might properly ask the gentlemen, who confess that they paid the money, why they paid it before they had positive knowledge that the men were credited to the quota of their town?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7167"/>Common prudence would seem to dictate this course.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7168"/>When <persName n="Devens,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n0152.0010.00553.04594" reg="mostcommon:Devens,Charles,,,:5"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Devens</surname></persName> had command of the camp at <placeName key="tgn,7015824" n="1.000 2" reg="long island city, queens, new york">Long Island</placeName>, a few months ago, he brought to my attention the fact, that some selectmen, who had received enlistment papers from this office, had signed the same in <hi rend="italics">blank</hi>, and had left them with brokers in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, to get the men, and fill out the certificates, which certificates read as follows:&mdash; <pb id="p.554" n="554"/> <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7169"/></p> 
<p>I certify, on honor, that I have minutely inspected the volunteer,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7170"/>&mdash; &mdash;, previously to his enlistment, and that he was entirely sober when he enlisted; that, to the best of my judgment and belief, he is of lawful age; and that, in accepting him as duly qualified to perform the duties of an able-bodied soldier, I have strictly observed the regulations which govern the recruiting service.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7171"/>Then follows a description of the person recruited.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7172"/>Only last week, a roll was presented at this office of <num value="64">sixty-four</num> men in the navy, with a request that they be credited to a certain town in this vicinity, sworn to by the chairman of the selectmen, that the men <q direct="unspecified">were legal citizens of said town, and liable to do military duty therein.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7173"/>And yet <num value="36">thirty-six</num> of these men were rebel prisoners, taken at <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge, Tenn.</placeName>, sent to the military prison at <placeName reg="Rock Island, Rock Island, Illinois" key="tgn,7014353">Rock Island, Ill.</placeName>, where they took an oath of allegiance, and afterwards sent to <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, where they were enlisted as sailors, and were put on board the receiving ship <quote><placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7174"/>Not a man of them had ever been in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> before.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7175"/>I do not state these facts to find fault with town or city authorities: I have daily evidence of their arduous, patriotic, and ofttimes ill-requited labors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7176"/>And if they have trusted bad men, and paid their money upon false statements, they have done so with an honest purpose, and with a belief that they were doing the best they could for their several constituencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7177"/>They, however, should be upon their guard, and should act upon the same principle in paying local bounties, that I do in paying State bounties; which is, not to make out a payroll for State bounties, until I have a roll in this office, signed by the mustering officer, showing the city and town to which the men are credited.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7178"/>Many of these brokers are sharp practitioners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7179"/>They work for money, and not for the cause; their motto seems to be, <q direct="unspecified">to suckle armies, and dry-nurse the land.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7180"/>I wish to state, that in every instance where it has been in my power to correct rolls, and give the towns the proper credit, I have done what I could to accomplish it. I have written frequently to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 4" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> on the subject, sometimes with success, sometimes without.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7181"/>I have also had frequent interviews with <persName n="Clarke,Major,,,," id="n0152.0010.00554.04595" reg="mostcommon:Clarke,James,Freeman,,:3"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Clarke</surname></persName> for the same object; and he has done what he could to correct errors growing out of the vicious system of recruiting through irresponsible and corrupt brokers.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8318"/>There was nothing in his nature unkind or ungenerous; no <num value="1">one</num> understood better than he did the position of affairs, both <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8319"/>Pre-eminent in his devotion to his country while the war lasted, he was the advocate of carrying it on by vigorous measures to the end.

<p>The waste of war has left the land-owners poor in all save their lands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8327"/>Their mules, machinery, fences, buildings, tools, have been absorbed by the enemy, or destroyed, or worn out to an extent hardly to be appreciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8329"/>Without money or credit, the planter can neither buy mules, corn, bacon, small stores, cloth for the support of the freedmen, nor can he pay them their needful wages, while making the crop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8469"/>In the year <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, a statement was printed, giving the names of towns from which contributions had been received during that year, and summing up as follows: In <placeName key="tgn,7007515" n="1.000 23" reg="maine">Maine</placeName>, <num value="155">155</num> towns; <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName>, <num value="65">65</num>; <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName>, <num value="206">206</num>; <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, <num value="301">301</num>; towns in other States, <num value="8">8</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8470"/>Probably this represented fairly the proportions of other years, though it does not indicate at all the relative values of the contributions.
