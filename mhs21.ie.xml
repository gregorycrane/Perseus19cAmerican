<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>The <placeName reg="Mystic River, New London, Connecticut" key="tgn,2534275">Mystic river</placeName>&mdash;which geologically has a peculiar interest as having in the preglacial period actually been the <rs>Merrimac</rs>, carrying the greater stream by a short cut from near <placeName reg="Lowell, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013975">Lowell</placeName> to <placeName reg="Massachusetts Bay, Massachusetts, United States" key="tgn,7007518">Massachusetts Bay</placeName>&mdash;has, since the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> settlements, borne <num value="2">two</num> names in different parts of its course, although the entire valley has been known as that of the <rs>Mystic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>From its confluence with the <rs>Charles</rs>, near the <rs type="place">Navy Yard</rs>, up through its tidal reaches, or what were tidal until the building of the dam and locks at <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 7" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>, up to the <rs type="place">Mystic Lakes</rs>, it has been called the <rs>Mystic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>Above the lakes, from <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> down through <placeName key="tgn,2051000" n="1.000 43" reg="woburn, middlesex county, massachusetts">Woburn</placeName> and <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, it appears to have been always known as the <rs>Aberjona</rs>, a name that is found in the early records of <placeName key="tgn,2051000" n="1.000 43" reg="woburn, middlesex county, massachusetts">Woburn</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>Since most of our names of rivers, ponds, hills, etc., are of <name>Indian</name> origin, it has usually been assumed to be an aboriginal designation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>To many, however, the name, with its <q direct="unspecified">jona,</q> has suggested a Scriptural derivation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>And since many place-names have come from those of persons living in the neighborhood, it has also been somewhat fantastically suggested that perhaps the name is a corruption of <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Abbie Jones' river">Abbie Jones' river</placeName>,</q> just as the <name>Greater</name> New York borough of the <rs>Bronx</rs> derives its picturesque name from an old-timer named Broncks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>But there is no evidence in behalf of either of these assumptions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>Just now, however, having had occasion to look up some facts in relation to the famous expedition of the <num value="3">three</num> <persName n="Sprague,,,,," id="n0334.0021.00057.00375" reg="mostcommon:Sprague,Richard,,,:1"><surname>Sprague</surname></persName> brothers, <persName><foreName>Ralph</foreName></persName>, <persName><foreName>Richard</foreName></persName> and <persName><foreName>William</foreName></persName>, pioneers in the settlement of <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName>, across country through the woods from <placeName reg="Salem, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014447">Salem</placeName>, I find that in the <rs>Charlestown</rs> records it is related that this party <q direct="unspecified">lighted <pb id="p.58" n="58"/> of a place situate and lying on the north side of <placeName key="tgn,1122705" n="1.000 1" reg="Charles River, Massachusetts, United States, North and Central America">Charles river</placeName>, full of <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0334.0021.00058.00376" reg="mostcommon:Indians,nomatch:0"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, called Aberginians.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>Often as I had read that account, I had never before attached any particular significance to the name of those <name>Indians</name> other than that it seemed so different from Algonquin nomenclature in general, except that it was somewhat suggestive of <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Virginians,,,,," id="n0334.0021.00058.00377" reg="mostcommon:Virginians,nomatch:0"><surname>Virginians</surname></persName></q> and might possibly have come from the circumstance that <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> was originally regarded as a part of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>Now a place name is often derived from the name of the people who live there, or the name of the people may come from that of the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>We are here informed that the <name>Indians</name> of that neighborhood were called <q direct="unspecified">Aberginians.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>And is there not a striking resemblance between that name and <q direct="unspecified">Aberjona</q>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>And in face of this extraordinary resemblance is it not reasonable to infer that the name of those Indians came either from that of the river on whose banks they lived, or that the river took its name from the <name>Indians</name>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>It would require only a transition from a single vowel to make <q direct="unspecified">Aberginians</q> identical with <q direct="unspecified">Aberjonians.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>Hence it seems quite natural to assume that Aberjona was originally the name of the entire river, from its source down to the sea, instead of being limited to the section above the lakes as at present&mdash;the lakes, or ponds, being simply slackwater and a tidal basin, respectively, in the river.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>In the same <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName> records occurs the following passage describing <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName> or <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Mishawum</placeName>, peninsular as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> settlers found it: <q direct="unspecified">Upon surveying, they found it was a neck of land, generally full of stately timber, as was the main, and the land lying on the east side of the river called <placeName reg="Mistick river">Mistick river</placeName> (from the farm <persName n="Cradock,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0021.00058.00378" reg="mostcommon:Cradock,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cradock</surname></persName>'s servants had planted, called <placeName reg="Mistick">Mistick</placeName>, which this river led up unto) and indeed generally all the country round about was an uncouth wilderness, full of timber.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/></p> 
<p>The name <q direct="unspecified"><address><street n="Mystic road">Mystic</street></address>,</q> as applied to this river, has been derived by some students of history not from the <rs>English</rs> word, but has been held to be of <name>Indian</name> origin, coming <pb id="p.59" n="59"/> from the <name>Algonquin</name> <q direct="unspecified">Mistuck,</q> signifying <q direct="unspecified">great tidal river,</q> or estuary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>But according to this early record the name of the river came from that of the <rs type="place">Cradock farm</rs> in <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 7" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>In that event it might naturally have been limited to the lower reaches of the stream, taking the place of the original name, the <rs>Aberjona</rs>, which was retained for the upper portion.

<head>A Midwinter Ramble.</head> <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>The glorious sunshine of a recent winter morning was an allurement that decided the writer to take a woodland ramble that had been long deferred, and <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> found him at <address><street n="High street">High street</street></address>, looking into the waters of <placeName reg="Meetinghouse Hill, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2505110">Meeting-house</placeName> brook.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>So he said, <q direct="unspecified">Well, old brook, I've seen you many times before in your straight-jacket at <address><street n="High street">High street</street></address>, and in your serpentine wriggling ere you lost yourself in the river; but I'll make your acquaintance today in your sylvan home, see what your wanderings are and from whence you come.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/></p> 
<p>After passing the fences each side the lane to the <rs type="place">Hall farm</rs>, a vision of beauty appeared in the miniature falls, as the brook descends in an even sheet over the granite cope beneath, and between the higher wall on either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>Below the lowest fall an iron-railed bridge spans the stream, and above each the brook widens, as if to linger awhile, while further up the stones that lie in its course hold it a little and give the waters a musical voice in their plunge.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>Great willows have their roots by its side, and <num value="1">one</num> has <num value="14">fourteen</num> distinct trunks growing from <num value="1">one</num> common base.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/><num value="2">Two</num> of these, a few feet up, have so crowded each other as to grow together as <num value="1">one</num>, but they separate again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>The brook was altogether silent as to the <num value="13">thirteen</num> superstition.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>Another bridge is here, with a larger willow that has felt the effects of storm and time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>Great branches have been torn from it, the rents and scars have been filled up with masonry, thus saving the life of that remaining, much as some old veteran of many batties <pb id="p.67" n="67"/> has been patched and mended, and enabled to continue in service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>Beneath its shade <num value="1">one</num> can rest on the benches there provided, or drink from the cool spring that boils up from the ground at the brook's edge and overflows the stony basin about it. Some kindly hand has placed an iron post and drinking cup beside it for thirsty ramblers&mdash;cold water ramblers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>Across a mown field flows the brook with even course; then the rambler climbed a stone wall and entered the woodland, known as the <name>Fells</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>The ramble was attended with little difficulty, the frozen ground affording a firm footing, though the <q direct="unspecified">record</q> <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> that followed must have told upon the frost, and only a few patches among the shady nooks gave evidence of the snow that had been.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>Here and there the brook divides, and uniting again, forms miniature islands, while across the slowly moving waters were quaint bridges of <persName n="Frost,,Jack,,," id="n0334.0026.00067.00401" reg="default:Frost,Jack,,,"><foreName>Jack</foreName> <surname>Frost</surname></persName>'s architecture.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>Beautiful to look at, but too frail for use, except for the brownies or elves of the forest, the rambler sought the help of some convenient boulder or fallen tree for the few crossings he made, unless, indeed, the brook narrowed enough to admit of a step across.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>Soon he entered a narrow valley where the hills arose on either side and between them lay a level ridge before his view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>Through this is an opening where flowed the brook, and through this pass, in the distance, the still rising and surrounding hills are seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>To the right is another opening some rods nearer, which is lined with stone walls on either side.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>Yes, this is the <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Bower,,,,," id="n0334.0026.00067.00402" reg="mostcommon:Bower,nomatch:0"><surname>Bower</surname></persName></q> (so called <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> ago), the site of the ancient mill, where the early dwellers of <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Meadford">Meadford</placeName></q> came with their corn for grinding; and here, possibly, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lumber was sawed in the old town by power.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>It is more than probable that boards for some of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 7" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>'s old houses were here sawed, for there is record of a saw-mill at this spot <measure n="240years" type="date">two hundred and forty years</measure> ago.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>Yes, there was power here and lots of it, too, in those old days, colony days <q direct="unspecified">when we were under the <rs>King</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>And possibly some of the trees had the king's broad arrow on them, too, but they are long gone now.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>The walled enclosure is the old raceway, and below, at the open end, is the wheel-pit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>That great pile of rocks is the foundation of the mill that was elevated almost <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure> from the brook below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>Great trees have grown, and the culvert through the dam is closed by the accumulated debris, but a climb to the top reveals the extent of the old mill pond, and the course of the brook as it slowly meanders through it. <pb id="p.68" n="68"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>All about in the hills the ledges crop out, and on these are great boulders, left by the retreating glacier, ages ago. Grim and dark, they stand like sentinels on guard; some broken by frost, moss-grown and hoary-headed, they were old when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> settlers came.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>Just here the rambler's vision of the ancient time and the early dwellers, that was accompanied by the music of the rippling brook, was interrupted by the calls and appearance of the moth brigade, and the sawing, scraping and creosote daubing reminded him of the presence of the modern pests and the alarming proportions they assume.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>Farther up, the brook is crossed by the road leading from <address><street n="Forest street">Forest street</street></address> to <placeName reg="Ram's Head hill">Ram's Head hill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>Here is a rustic bridge, and for some distance the declivity is but slight, and the stream broadens and lingers in the shady groves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>Again a cart-path into the woods crosses it, and here is a ruined bridge, the stone abutments still good, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>A little further a diminutive grove of white birches gleams in the sunlight and overshadows the stream, and just beyond looms up the lofty dam of the <rs>Winchester South</rs> reservoir.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>This forms a barrier across the valley and cuts off further search for the source of <placeName reg="Meetinghouse Hill, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2505110">Meeting-house</placeName> brook, once called Marrabel's or Marble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>Its original source was over half a mile farther on in <placeName reg="Turkey Swamp, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2733396">Turkey swamp</placeName>, but the rambler found no swamp or turkeys there, as the reservoir occupies its place.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>With the exception of the woodsmen, he met no <num value="1">one</num> to converse with during his tramp, but found constant pleasure in the sylvan solitude by exploring the shady nooks and peering into the sparkling waters of the stream, catching a glimpse ever and anon of its shy denizens, as they darted quickly under sheltering rocks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>The shadows of the trees were long, even at <time value="12pm">noon</time>, and the handy camera secured him some views as souvenirs of a pleasant ramble on an equally pleasant midwinter day.</p></quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1178"/>By courtesy of the present occupant, the <rs>Medford Publishing Company</rs>, a view of it is given in our frontispiece.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1181"/>At the time of taking this view but few changes had been made in the building, those made needful by the erection of the brick structure which had been built against its southern end.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1189"/>It is also noticeable that in the newer building adjoining, the present occupant also succeeds several others in the same line as his own.

At that time the artistic front door, the big chimney and capacious fireplaces of the <rs>Porter</rs> residence were removed, and the living rooms devoted to business,&mdash;drugstore, apothecary-shop, pharmacy&mdash;such was the evolution, but of this some other can speak or write with certainty.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1217"/>With this page at disposal is timely reference to a few facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1218"/>The Society conserved its original investment in the old home (given therefor) by the purchase of its present site, the balance remaining going to the new structure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1219"/><hi rend="italics">Contrary</hi> to current report, the <rs type="place">City of Medford</rs> <hi rend="italics">did not give this land</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1221"/><pb id="p.96" n="96"/></p> 
<p>Much has since been done, yet it is still incomplete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1222"/><measure n="2000dollars" type="currency">Two thousand dollars</measure> are needed to finish, of which <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> is required to pay the outstanding bills long overdue to indulgent creditors, and deferred by war conditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1223"/>It is now proposed to raise this sum in <num value="400">four hundred</num> shares of <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure> each, to be entirely paid in by <dateStruct value="1919-04-01"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="1">1</day>, <year reg="1919">1919</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1224"/>This will leave the <name>Society</name> free of debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1225"/>There has never been any construction (which means <hi rend="italics">destruction</hi>) loan, and the work has been done at absolute cost, but held up by war conditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1226"/>Despite these, the management of current expense has been economical, and the year will close with little or no deficit.</p>
