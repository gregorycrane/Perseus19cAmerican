<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>They fired at <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Massie,,,,," id="n0285.0002.00008.00076" reg="mostcommon:Massie,nomatch:0"><surname>Massie</surname></persName>'s battery</orgName>&mdash;which was on extreme left of our division, where <persName n="Ramseur,General,,,," id="n0285.0002.00008.00077" reg="mostcommon:Ramseur,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Ramseur</surname></persName> had his Headquarters&mdash;from <num value="2">two</num> directions, and I retired to the rear.

Not very long after I had dined, great excitement commenced by the cavalry with the led horses dashing in from a road coming in from the left, opposite to my camp, and saying that the <rs>Yankees</rs> were pursuing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>The extreme left of our lines was occupied by dismounted cavalry in breastworks; the position was very weak, and the men weaker, so that both <persName n="Lomax,General,,,," id="n0285.0002.00008.00079" reg="mostcommon:Lomax,John,Tayloe,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lomax</surname></persName>, who commanded the cavalry, and <persName n="Ramseur,General,,,," id="n0285.0002.00008.00080" reg="mostcommon:Ramseur,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Ramseur</surname></persName>, considered that, if an attack was made against our left (which was very probable), it was very questionable whether it would be repulsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>I recall, this moment, this additional incident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>The suggestion was deemed of sufficient importance to refer to <persName n="Benjamin,Mister,,,," id="n0285.0003.00022.00197" reg="mostcommon:Benjamin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Benjamin</surname></persName>, then <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and <persName n="Tucker,Mister,,,," id="n0285.0003.00022.00198" reg="nearbymention:Tucker,Randolph,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Tucker</surname></persName> and I interviewed him about it. These <num value="2">two</num> great lawyers expressed the view that the principles which protected citizens of the <rs>Southern States</rs> were, to say the least, of doubtful application to us, and that it would probably go rather hard with us if we should be captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>He was requested to assist in the work of transferring some old flint-locks belonging to the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName> into percussion muskets, and all of us insisting that he could thus render far more valuable service than by enlisting in the ranks, he rather reluctantly yielded and went to work.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/>The night was very dark and gloomy, and we could not see a light anywhere, except an occasional glimmer about the town; but we knew pretty nearly where the vessel was, and with our glasses in the evening understood her build and structure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1984"/>The stroke of the muffled oars was almost noiseless, and suddenly the dark hull of the ship loomed up; and it seemed almost at the same moment there came from her the shout: <q direct="unspecified">Boat, ahoy!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1985"/>Then we heard the loud and cheering cry from <persName n="Wood,,,,," id="n0285.0023.00140.01546" reg="nearbymention:Wood,John,Taylor,,"><surname>Wood</surname></persName>: <q direct="unspecified">Give way, boys,</q> which was caught up and echoed along both lines of boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1986"/>Then rang out and sharp from the ship the rattle, calling the men to quarters for action, and now the fight was on. No need for orders now to these disciplined men. I suppose the distance was about <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure>, and while our men were straining at their oars, we heard the sharp click of rifles, and the only reply we could make was by the marines (<num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> being in each boat), who delivered their fire with great coolness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1987"/>It seems to me now that of all the uncomfortable things a fighting man might have to do, that of pulling an oar with his back to his foe must be the most trying and disheartening, but not a man weakened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1988"/>In less time than is required to tell of this, we were into her. Our boat struck the vessel just abaft the wheelhouse, where the guards make a platform, an admirable place for getting on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1989"/>The ship's armory, where all the small arms were kept, was in a room just there under the hurricane deck, and they did not stop to reload, but loaded guns were handed to the men, as fast as they could fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1990"/>It seemed like a sheet of flame, and the very jaws of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1993"/>Now the fighting was furious, and at close quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1994"/>Our men were eager, and as <num value="1">one</num> would fall another came on. Not <num value="1">one</num> faltered or fell back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1995"/>The cracking of fire arms and the rattle of cutlasses made a deafening din. The enemy gave way slowly, and soon began to get away by taking to the ward room and engine room hatches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1998"/>In a short time I heard the cry: <q direct="unspecified">We surrender.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2753"/>They advanced in beautiful order in <num value="3">three</num> lines; but before they had gone far, the wounded and the frightened came running back in large numbers, and it was impossible to tell when the main body came back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2757"/>As we neared the point from which we had been repulsed the day before, heavy colums advanced upon both flanks, and our artillery, having exhausted their ammunition, did not fire a shot at them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2758"/>Being unsupported by an advance upon any other part of the line, and having but <num value="1">one</num> line, the enemy paid his undivided attention to us; and our only safety from utter annihilation was in retreat.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2983"/>As I stood at the ford that night the men, as they passed, would call out the number of their regiment, or the name of their battery, soon finding their own places, and when <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0285.0034.00213.02563" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> afterwards, settled on the hills around <placeName reg="Bunker Hill, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117622">Bunker Hill</placeName>, the men had reorganized themselves and were ready to fight again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2984"/>As stated before, after seeing the entire army cross the river, I found my way to our battery-tired, hungry, and anxious to find something to eat. It happened that a stray chicken got in my way and found its way into the frying pan in a very short time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2985"/>Up to that time, so far as I know, no orders had been issued to those <num value="5">five</num> batteries; we were left there with about <num value="175">175</num> infantry, under <persName n="Pryor,General,Roger,A.,," id="n0285.0034.00213.02564" reg="default:Pryor,Roger,A.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Roger</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Pryor</surname></persName>, as a shadow of support for the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2987"/>Like the poor innocent that I was, I took the guns and left the chicken, and when my duty with the guns was over I returned to find both <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n0285.0034.00213.02566" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,James,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> and my chicken gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2988"/>He left orders, however, that we were to remain on the bluff as long as possible, and when driven away by larger and longer range guns to retire as quickly as possible upon the rear of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2989"/>With the exception of the odor of fried chicken and <num value="2">two</num> peaches that I had found on a tree near the battery, I had nothing to eat all that day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2990"/>During the morning we had some little firing, but were exceedingly annoyed by the infantry lying in the bed of the canal and concealed in a house and barn opposite our battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2991"/>Finding this picket fire was coming too fast and close, I determined to burn the barn with shrapnel, if possible, and I think that by <num value="1">one</num> shot during this fire I gave <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0285.0034.00213.02567" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> at least <num value="4">four</num> good hours in which to make his way back to <placeName reg="Bunker Hill, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117622">Bunker Hill</placeName>&mdash;the position that he had selected to meet <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0285.0034.00213.02568" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,H.,,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, if that general chose to follow him. I observed an officer and an orderly riding down the hill towards the barn and house alluded to above, and, having cut the fuse and being just about to give the order to fire, I concluded to try a shot at these <pb id="p.214" n="214"/> men instead of at the barn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2992"/>So moving the trail slightly to the left and giving the gun a very slight elevation, I was delighted to see, upon the explosion of the shrapnel, that both men had been knocked from their horses to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2993"/><num value="1">One</num> of them was evidently killed, the other badly wounded; but after about half an hour he succeeded in getting on his horse, with the assistance of the rail fence, and rode to the rear.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2994"/>From what occurred afterwards, I am satisfied that these men came with orders for the men hidden in the barn, house and bed of the canal to charge across the river at a given signal; because just about that time a battery of <num value="20">20</num>-pound <name type="weapon">Parrotts</name>, which we had observed for an hour or <num value="2">two</num> on the extreme left of the enemy's line, commenced firing; and though the distance was estimated to be about <measure n="2.5miles" type="distance">two miles and a half</measure>, their shots fell within a few feet of our guns, though none of them exploded where they struck, but ricochetted over our heads to where <orgName n="infantry"><persName n="Pryor,General,,,," id="n0285.0034.00214.02569" reg="nearbymention:Pryor,Roger,A.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pryor</surname></persName>'s infantry</orgName> was lying in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2995"/>Our guns, being smooth bore, could not, of course, fight a battery of <num value="20">20</num>-pound <name type="weapon">Parrotts</name>, so we withdrew just below the brow of the hill and awaited further orders.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2996"/>Upon the withdrawal of our guns the firing of this battery ceased, and being very tired, to say nothing about being sleepy and hungry, I stretched myself on the ground and went to sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2997"/>How long I slept I have no idea, but was awakened by a most tremendous fire of artillery all along the line of the hill on the north bank of the river, and noticed particularly that our friends of the <num value="20">20</num>-pound <name type="weapon">Parrotts</name> had the range of the top of our hill in a most uncomfortable manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2998"/>As I rose to my feet I found the whole woods on the other side ablaze with the fire of heavy guns, ranging from <measure n="3inch" type="distance">3-inch</measure> rifles to <num value="24">24</num>-pound Howitzers&mdash;probably some <num value="25">twenty-five</num> guns altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2999"/>How many infantry were in the bed of the river and crossing the canal it would be hard to tell, but, from my frightened condition, I thought there were a <num value="1000000">million</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3000"/>The river was full of men over half way across, cheering and firing as they came on.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3001"/>The men of our battery, together with those belonging to other batteries on the bluff, were mixed in helter-skelter race for the road, the whole field and road being crowded with men, guns, horses, limber chests without the guns, caissons, officers on horseback and on foot, all in a confused mass and all making the best time possible to where they expected to find the rear of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0285.0034.00214.02570" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3002"/>I had been so sound asleep that I was somewhat dazed by the noise of the guns and the rattling of muskets, the bursting of shells, and the <pb id="p.215" n="215"/> general confusion around me. For the moment I did not notice that the gun of which I had charge was still standing unlimbered on the edge of the hill, but calling <num value="2">two</num> men, <num value="1">one</num> named <persName><foreName>Solomon</foreName></persName>, and the other named Manoni, both of whom promptly returned, we succeeded in limbering the gun, the men mounted the horses, and we were quickly following the procession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3003"/>For probably a mile the <rs>Yankee</rs> guns commanded the gorge up which this road ran, and every step of it I took at a gait that would have done credit to <persName n="Gilpin,,John,,," id="n0285.0034.00215.02571" reg="default:Gilpin,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Gilpin</surname></persName> on his famous ride.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3004"/>It is no use denying the fact, I ran as fast as my horse could carry me, through the crowded road or through fields, where possible, and the men of my gun followed me. At the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> turn, which was the road running towards <placeName reg="Georgetown, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2347734">Shepherdstown</placeName>, we turned from the column, intending to go there and find where the rear of the army was. Just after turning into this road, I came across my old comrades, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="3Howitzers">3d Howitzers</orgName>, with their horses unhitched, guns parked both men and horses endeavoring to get supper of some kind, utterly unconscious that the <rs>Yankees</rs> had crossed the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3005"/>They had evidently been forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3006"/>It was only a few minutes before the battalion was hitched up and on their way also to the rear, as fast as possible.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4287"/>On the <dateStruct value="--21"><day reg="2">21st</day></dateStruct> we had been marching all day, and passed through the town of <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName> not a great while before night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4288"/>My regiment came to a halt just in the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4289"/>We were received by the citizens with open arms, and what was much more to our liking, with a bountiful supply for the inner man. All were not able to take advantage of what was offered, as we only stopped for a few seconds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4290"/>Fortunately for myself, I halted just opposite a store containing almost everything, and the occupant thereof rushed out, bearing in <num value="1">one</num> hand a plate piled up with apple pies and in the other a plate filled with dried or smoked fish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4291"/>I made a grab, and got a goodly portion of pie in <num value="1">one</num> hand and a number of fish in the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4292"/>Many of the other soldiers did the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4293"/>Never did viands taste better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4294"/>The <q direct="unspecified">pies</q> were consumed then and there, and the fish kept for future use. <pb id="p.304" n="304"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4295"/>Soon after leaving the town we were halted in an open field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4296"/>Night was coming on, and ominous clouds were looming up, with lightning and thunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4297"/>Soon it began to rain in torrents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4298"/>I have always maintained I never saw it rain so hard before or since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4299"/>The storm was soon over, and then commenced the fun. It was laughable to see the men standing on their heads, or getting their feet up in the air to let the water run out of their boots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4300"/>By the time we started again it was pitch dark, and not <num value="1">one</num> of us privates, I will venture to say, knew where we were going.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4301"/>I surely did not. On we plodded, hour after hour, with the darkness so dense that you couldn't see your file leader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4302"/>We crossed several streams very much swollen by the recent rains, which made fording very difficult, but on we went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4303"/>There were <num value="2">two</num> regiments in front of mine in the line of march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4304"/><num value="1">One</num>, I think, was the gallant <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num>, led by that dashing officer, <persName n="Rosser,Colonel,Tom,,," id="n0285.0043.00304.03873" reg="default:Rosser,Tom,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName> <surname>Rosser</surname></persName>, now General.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4305"/>Somewhere about midnight, when nothing was to be heard but the splash, splash of the horses' feet in the wet roads, the stillness was suddenly broken by a tremendous yell far to the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4306"/>We in the rear knew then something had been found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4307"/>Orders soon came down the line to quicken up. The yelling at the front became fiercer and fiercer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4308"/>By the time my regiment got upon the scene of action, it was pretty much all over, and by the flashes of lightning we found that we were standing in the midst of the <rs>Federal</rs> tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4309"/>Just then <persName n="Rosser,Colonel,,,," id="n0285.0043.00304.03874" reg="nearbymention:Rosser,Tom,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Rosser</surname></persName>, with his sword drawn and dripping with blood, rode up to <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0285.0043.00304.03875" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, who was close by, and said in his own emphatic language: <q direct="unspecified">General, I have been giving them h&mdash;ll, cutting and slashing right and left.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4310"/></p> 
<p>It was a pitiable sight to see those Federal soldiers running here and there, and clad only in their night garments, which consisted, of course, only of undergarments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4311"/>They had no hats nor shoes, and wherever <num value="1">one</num> was seen he was soon captured or cut down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4312"/>It was an awful and exciting time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4313"/>Soon after my regiment came up <persName n="Newton,Captain,William,B.,," id="n0285.0043.00304.03876" reg="default:Newton,William,B.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Newton</surname></persName>, of <orgName type="company" n="Company G">Company G</orgName>, was ordered to take a squad of men and proceed to the railroad to cut the telegraph wire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4314"/>I formed <num value="1">one</num> of the squad, but what we were to cut with I could not see. Sabres are good for cutting flesh and breaking bones, but they can't cut suspended wire very easily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4315"/>Some of the <rs>Gloucester</rs> cavalry got mixed up with us as we proceeded in the pitch dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4316"/>Finally we reached the railroad at a high embankment, and it was well for us that we did, for by the flashes of lightning, which were still very vivid, we could see, by climbing to the top of the embankment, a <pb id="p.305" n="305"/> line of <orgName n="Federal Infantry" type="infantry">Federal infantry</orgName> drawn up ready for action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4317"/><persName n="Newton,Captain,,,," id="n0285.0043.00305.03877" reg="nearbymention:Newton,William,B.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Newton</surname></persName> called for volunteers to climb a pole and cut the wire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4318"/>We had all seen the danger ,and knew the risk, and as we had nothing to cut with, and a telegraph pole is not the easiest thing in the world to climb, we were rather slow to respond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4319"/>But there was a volunteer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4320"/>He was a small man from the <rs>Gloucester</rs> troops that had joined us. As he jumped to the front, he exclaimed: <q direct="unspecified">I will go; <placeName reg="Gloucester, Gloucester, Virginia" key="tgn,2111950">Gloucester</placeName> has never backed out yet,</q> and up he went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4321"/>He had reached the top of the pole and was trying his best to get the wire in <num value="2">two</num>, when there came a vivid flash of lightning and the <rs>Yankees</rs> saw him. They were not slow in firing a volley right across the track.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4322"/>It seemed to me the whole heaven was full of bullets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4323"/>The man up the pole dropped down with a thud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4324"/>We were sure he had been killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4325"/>but the next moment he rolled down the embankment and jumped up all right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4326"/>We could do nothing with the wire, so <persName n="Newton,Captain,,,," id="n0285.0043.00305.03878" reg="nearbymention:Newton,William,B.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Newton</surname></persName> took us back to the company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4327"/>Out from the tents were packed all of <placeName><persName n="Pope,General,,,," id="n0285.0043.00305.03879" reg="mostcommon:Pope,Billy,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pope</surname></persName>'s headquarters</placeName> wagons, and many others, I suppose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4328"/>Several had been set on fire, which illuminated the camp in every direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4329"/>I got permission to do a little foraging on my own hook, and rode down among the burning wagons.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4330"/>There were many laughable scenes, as well as serious ones, that memorable night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4331"/>I don't suppose time can ever efface them from my memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4332"/>As I passed in the rear of <num value="1">one</num> wagon&mdash;and I ought to mention here that these wagons were all packed and ready to move out at any moment&mdash;I saw a soldier trying to get the cork out of a bottle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4333"/>He got impatient with the obstinate cork and so he struck the neck of the bottle on the wagon tire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4334"/>There was an explosion, and he dropped the bottle like a hot cake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4335"/>I yelled to him that he was a fool; that that was the best stuff he ever drank; that it was champagne.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4336"/>He said there was plenty of it in the wagon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4337"/>I made him hand me out a bottle, which I stored away in my saddle-pockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4338"/>I then proceeded to a wagon which had not been molested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4339"/><num value="2">Two</num> fine, fat horses were tied behind it. I untied <num value="1">one</num> of them and transferred my saddle from my own horse to this old <name>Yankee</name> cuss, and I had ample time to regret it afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4340"/>I had no notion of turning my horse adrift, for I considered him as fine an animal as there was in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4341"/>After changing saddle and bridle to the other horse, I tied the halter strap of my horse in the ring of the saddle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4342"/>I then climbed up into the wagon, which was chock full of camp equipage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4343"/>I soon slashed the cover off with my knife, <pb id="p.306" n="306"/> so that I could have full play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4344"/>I tackled a big leather trunk, and as I heaved it out on the ground it struck the front wheel and the top and bottom parted company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4345"/>It evidently belonged to an officer of high rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4346"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing I pulled out was on elegant cocked hat with royal black plumes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4347"/>Then followed dress uniform coats and pants, and fatigue jackets, all with epaulets, and superb underwear of every description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4348"/>I was rich.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4349"/>I strapped to my saddle and around my person everything that I needed, and some things that I had better have left where I found them; but then I didn't know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4350"/>Among other valuable things was an elegant pair of field-glasses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4351"/>I put the strap of the case over my neck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4352"/>There was a cylindrical tin box, a foot or more long, containing drawings and maps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4353"/>I should have carried those to <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0285.0043.00306.03880" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, but I did not, and left them where they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4354"/>Then I found my <q direct="unspecified">evil genius,</q> which was a pint flask half full of good whiskey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4355"/>I sampled it then and there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4356"/>When I had enough I mounted my new capture and started out. I hadn't gone far when I was hailed by a man standing over a <num value="5">five</num>-gallon runlet, with the head knocked in. He asked me if I didn't want something to drink.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4357"/>I took out the flask which I had gotten from the trunk, and handed it to him, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> unscrewing the top. He simply immersed it in the whisky and let it run full, and handed it back to me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4358"/>I was sitting on my horse, and screwing on the top with the reins hanging loose, when all on a sudden the <rs>Yankees</rs>, who had crept up under cover of darkness, opened a terrible fire on us. At the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> discharge the old <name>Yankee</name> horse bolted right over a wagon pole, and on he went into pitch darkness, through bushes and over gullies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4359"/>Before I could gather up the reins he was running away with me. At the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> bound the halter strap to the horse I was leading broke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4360"/>As a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> mishap, <num value="1">one</num> stirrup leather gave way. I had to hold on by my knees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4361"/>Whither he was carrying me I could not tell, for it was dark, and the bushes were raking me fore and aft, and I expected every moment to be dragged off. I finally succeeded in hauling him up. Then I felt around to see what damage had been done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4362"/>And <q direct="unspecified">I am sorry to relate,</q> I was as poor a man as you would wish to see. Every vestige of my plunder was gone, except the field-glasses, which were around my neck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4363"/>The bushes had scraped me clean; haversack and all were gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4364"/>I couldn't find my company, and I didn't know where I was. I stopped and tried to locate myself and to listen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4365"/>While so engaged I heard some <num value="1">one</num> groaning, apparently far below me. I could not understand it, so I <pb id="p.307" n="307"/> called to know who was there, and the reply came back: <q direct="unspecified">It's me; <persName n="Finney,,Harry,,," id="n0285.0043.00307.03881" reg="default:Finney,Harry,,,"><foreName>Harry</foreName> <surname>Finney</surname></persName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4366"/>And sure enough, it was <persName n="Finney,Lieutenant,H.,B.,," id="n0285.0043.00307.03882" reg="default:Finney,H.,B.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Finney</surname></persName>, of the <rs>Powhatan</rs> troop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4367"/>He begged me to help him, saying he was badly hurt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4368"/>I then found that I was standing on the edge of a very deep gully, and <persName n="Finney,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0285.0043.00307.03883" reg="nearbymention:Finney,H.,B.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Finney</surname></persName> was at the bottom of it. I fastened my horse and went to his rescue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4369"/>He could scarcely walk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4370"/>His horse had played him an ugly trick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4371"/>I managed to get him up the steep bank and put him on my horse, and as daylight was coming on, took him back to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4372"/>During the day I got another horse and put him on it, and he joined some of his own company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4373"/>I soon found some of my comrades, and together we rejoined the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4374"/>I learned from some of the men that a soldier from the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 6">6th regiment</orgName> had captured my lost horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4375"/>I lost no time in hunting him up, but had hard work getting him back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4376"/>After much persuasion and many promises, I finally succeeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4377"/>Had I stuck to him all the time, I should have come out of that raid much better off than I did.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4378"/>We captured a great many prisoners, among them a woman in man's uniform and with a gun; destroyed quantities of stores and wagons, brought off all the horses, and got back without the loss of a single man, so far as I know.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4385"/>The Confederate statesmen, who then included the leading minds in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, did not propose any change in the government, and they only amended the old Constitution so as to make it conform to the construction which they put upon it, and which was consistent with the origin and history and intention of the original Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4386"/>They hoped that if war could be avoided, all the other States, except <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> ones, would come in and form an amended Union under the amended Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4388"/>I am bound to say that this Confederate hope was superficial and baseless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4389"/>They never did understand that the war was not for abolition of slavery, but was a war for dominion of the strong over the weak; of conquest, of selfishness, of avarice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4390"/>Abolition and humanity were the pretexts; preservation of the <rs>Union</rs> the mockery, but the reality was the money there was in it, and the money there would be in it when the rich, productive, agricultural South should be made serfs to the vigorous, active, intelligent, greedy North.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4391"/>The war was a contractors' war. They pushed it on to get contracts, and then pressed it further to make those contracts good.</p>

<p>The reports of the <rs n="Appomattox Campaign" type="campaign">Appomattox campaign</rs> embraced in Volume <num value="46">46</num> of the <rs>Official Records</rs> of the war, have an intense interest for all engaged in that memorable campaign of <dateStruct value="1865-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1865-04-"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, throwing light, as they do, on many questions whose solution has awaited the detailed information embodied in these official reports.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4587"/>It has long been a problem to many of us, not only how <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0285.0047.00322.04155" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> was ever able to reach <placeName reg="Appomattox Courthouse">Appomattox Courthouse</placeName>, nearly <placeName><distance reg="100miles">one hundred miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName></placeName>, but even how it could get away from the <rs type="place">Petersburg</rs> and <placeName reg="Richmond line">Richmond lines</placeName>, confronted and threatened as that army was, by such odds, and hampered by abundant lack of even food to sustain physical life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4588"/>What these numerical odds were, is shown by the figures of official returns, as published in this volume; but neither figures nor description can represent other differences arising from our deplorable inferiority in supplies and equipment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4589"/><pb id="p.323" n="323"/> What this meant and entailed can never be adequately known but by those who endured the toils of that retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4590"/><persName n="Ewell,General,,,," id="n0285.0047.00323.04156" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,B.,Stoddert,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Ewell</surname></persName> says in his report, when accounting for the absence of over <num value="3000">3,000</num> of his men at the time of his surrender, that <q direct="unspecified">it was caused mainly by the fatigue of <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> and nights almost constant marching, the last <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> with nothing to eat. Before our capture I saw men eating raw fresh meat as they marched in ranks.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4591"/>The memory of many others can verify or liken this experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4592"/>On the other hand, by way of contrast, here is a report (<ref n="page 1234">p. 1234</ref>) of a division commissary of the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 25">25th corps</orgName> of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0285.0047.00323.04157" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, in which he says: <q direct="unspecified">During the entire march from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> to <placeName reg="Appomattox Courthouse">Appomattox Courthouse</placeName>, the troops have had issued to them full marching rations, and have not been a day without food.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4593"/>It is small wonder that men thus supplied and not bothered with fighting their way, could push on ahead, as this corps did, and succeed in absolutely blocking <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0285.0047.00323.04158" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s further progress from <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4594"/>The contract suggested by this statement of the relative means of mere subsistence but deepens the problem presented by the great numerical superiority of the <rs>Federal</rs> army, which outnumbered its adversary by at least <num value="70000">seventy thousand</num> men. This superiority enabled <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0285.0047.00323.04159" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> to concentrate and throw around <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0285.0047.00323.04160" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s right more men than the latter had in his whole army, while yet confronting and threatening every part of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0285.0047.00323.04161" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s lines with superior forces.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4595"/>Hence the problem that has long puzzled some of us. How could <num value="46000">forty-six thousand</num> half-starved, half-clad men, wanting almost everything but guns and ammunition, defending a line of some <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure> against forces <num value="3">three</num> times their number, maintain their position as long as they did, and when this position was no longer tenable, how was it that they could break away and extricate themselves from the toils spread by a swarming foe?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4596"/>How could and how did they ever get away from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4597"/><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0285.0047.00323.04162" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, in his dispatch of <dateStruct value="-04-2"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="2">2</day></dateStruct>, announcing the necessity of the evacuation, says: <q direct="unspecified">It will be a difficult operation, but. I hope, not impracticable.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4598"/>However, he did extricate himself, and marched his diminishing army to <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName>, hungry and worn, badgered and fighting at every step, like a wounded lion brushing away obstacles in front and turning on enemies on flanks and in rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4599"/>For <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> was kept up the unequal contest of fighting and marching, till at last, brought to bay, the army found itself absolutely surrounded and every egress stopped by superior forces; but not until they had inflicted on their foes a loss of <num value="10">ten</num> <pb id="p.324" n="324"/> <num value="1700">thousand seven hundred</num> men (<ref n="page 597">p. 597</ref>). How could and how did they even sustain themselves so long?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4600"/>The answer to these questions will be variously given according to difference of information or prejudice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4601"/><num value="1">One</num> solution probably is given in the reports of the <rs>Federal</rs> cavalry operations, which bring us information, long sought for, as to the force that was fought and beaten off by the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Company">First company</orgName> of Richmond Howitzers and other artillery on the evening before the surrender.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4602"/>If the few artillerymen armed with muskets, who helped to defend that column, could be magnified by apprehension or lack of judgment into <num value="2">two</num> divisions of infantry, it may explain the chariness of the enemy generally in closing in on the worn and diminishing forces that punished and repulsed so many assaults on their flanks and rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4603"/>And it may also help to explain the constantly recurring assertion of these reports that the <rs>Federal</rs> assaults were repulsed <q direct="unspecified">by superior force.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4604"/>If these assertions be true, and as far as they are true, it is the highest testimony to generalship that, with inferior numbers, could yet muster superior force at points of contact, and reminds us of the <rs>Tarheel</rs>'s explanation of the confidence of <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s soldiers, that they were never scared on going into a fight under him, because they always knew that, though the enemy had a bigger army, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0285.0047.00324.04163" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Thomas,J.,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> would have more men <q direct="unspecified">that</q> at the place where the real fighting was to be.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4605"/>Though not entirely germane to our present subject, but as a side light illustrating the situation and helping to form opinion on the questions stated above, the following extract may be taken from the report of <persName n="Wright,General,,,," id="n0285.0047.00324.04164" reg="mostcommon:Wright,T.,R.,B.,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Wright</surname></persName>, commanding the <num value="6" type="ordinal">Sixth</num> Federal corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4606"/>Describing the battle of <placeName reg="Sailor's Creek, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2646522">Sailor's Creek</placeName>, he says (<ref n="page 906">p. 906</ref>): <q direct="unspecified">The <orgName type="division" n="divisions 1">first</orgName> and <orgName type="division" n="divisions 3">third divisions</orgName> charged the enemy's position, carrying it handsomely, except at a point on our right of the road crossing the creek, where a column, said to be composed of the <rs>Marine</rs> brigade and other troops which had held the lines of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 38" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> previous to the evacuation, made a countercharge upon that part of our lines in their front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4607"/>I was never more astonished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4608"/>These troops were surrounded; the <orgName type="division" n="divisions 1">first</orgName> and <orgName type="division" n="divisions 3">third divisions</orgName> of this corps were on either flank; my artillery and a fresh division in their front, and some <num value="3">three</num> <orgName>divisions of <persName n="Sheridan,General,,,," id="n0285.0047.00324.04165" reg="nearbymention:Sheridan,P.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sheridan</surname></persName></orgName>'s <orgName n="cavalry">cavalry</orgName> in their rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4609"/>Looking upon them as already our prisoners, I had ordered the artillery to cease firing, as a dictate of humanity; my surprise, therefore, was extreme when this force charged upon our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4610"/>But the fire of our infantry, which had already gained their flanks; the capture of their <pb id="p.325" n="325"/> superior officers already in our hands; the concentrated and murderous fire of <num value="6">six</num> batteries of our artillery within effective range, brought them promptly to a surrender.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4611"/></p> 
<p>Well might he be astonished, and his surprise be extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4612"/>But the spirit that animated that desperate countercharge is largely the explanation of the fact, and solution of the problem, of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0285.0047.00325.04166" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> ever reaching <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4613"/>We are not, however, writing the history of the campaign nor describing the strategy and movements of the armies; our present concern is with the experience and fate of <num value="1">one</num> company of artillery, a single unit of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0285.0047.00325.04167" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, whose proudest memory is that they shared the glory of that army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4614"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="1Company">First Company</orgName> of Richmond Howitzers, attached to <orgName n="artillery battalion"><persName n="Cabell,,,,," id="n0285.0047.00325.04168" reg="mostcommon:Cabell,William,H.,,:2"><surname>Cabell</surname></persName>'s artillery battalion</orgName>, had since <dateStruct value="1864-07-"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, been posted in the works at <placeName reg="Dunn's Farm">Dunn's Farm</placeName>, about half way between <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 38" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4615"/>The artillery on this part of the lines had an easy time, the enemy on their front being so little troublesome that the battery did not fire a shot during the <rs type="season">fall</rs> and <rs type="season">winter</rs> of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>-&lsquo;<num value="65">65</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4616"/>Well housed and sheltered, the command passed the winter in comparative comfort as contrasted with the severe trials of other parts of the lines, while the nearness to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 38" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, the home of many of the company, enabled them to supplement the scant commissary rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4617"/>The battery had always been well manned, and at the opening of the campaign it numbered over <num value="120">one hundred and twenty</num> present for duty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4618"/>With these full ranks, it had also been fortunate in maintaining generally the character of its personnel, despite the changes and chances of <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> war service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4619"/>The genial, not to say jovial, memories of that winter at the <rs type="place">Dunn House</rs> will always remain as a glowing illustration of the degree of happiness that men can make for themselves under adverse circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4620"/>There was material in that company to stock half a dozen of the average theatrical or concert troupes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4621"/>In history, science and literature, some groups could have given elementary lessons to half the societies devoted to those cults.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4622"/>While the <q direct="unspecified">Presbyterian Board</q> was luminous in theology, and might have instructed many half-fledged doctors of divinity, the <name>Agnostics</name> of another mess could give points to <persName n="Darwin,,,,," id="n0285.0047.00325.04169" reg="mostcommon:Darwin,nomatch:0"><surname>Darwin</surname></persName>, at least in the humorous treatment of science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4623"/>There was not wanting even the study of ancient and modern languages, while the <rs>Company</rs> <orgName n="Glee Club" type="club">Glee Club</orgName> was a delight to themselves and to everybody who ever heard them sing, from major-generals down, or rather, perhaps, from privates up, for many of those privates had a way of thinking of themselves as rather better than some major-generals, though always <pb id="p.326" n="326"/> respectful and hospitable to that or any other rank when they came to spend a social evening around the company camp-fires.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4624"/>With a membership representing nearly all callings and professions, some of them men of culture and knowledge of the world, there was a generous comradeship, and the common devotion and daily peril of life and limb wrought bonds of brotherly friendship that relieved the severity of discipline and the irksome restraints of soldier life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4625"/>But the <rs type="place">Dunn House</rs> and all other camps were but temporary and uncertain rests, and its end came in the last days of <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, when the sounds of furious fighting around <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> told of the opening of another campaign, and warned everybody to be ready to move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4626"/>How our lines were broken around <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> is a story familiar to many of us, and the glory of the ensuing campaign has been often rehearsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4627"/>So bright is its record of constancy and heroic deeds that its memory is to-day the proudest recollection of every man who stood to his colors and endured to the end, though doomed to end in disaster and surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4628"/>This halo of glory has almost obscured the hardships of that terrible week during which the army marched day and night, with no regular supplies, but depending on such precarious subsistence as could be obtained by foraging in a depleted section of country, while the very air was rife with sounds and omens of disaster.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4629"/>On the fall of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, the <rs type="place">Dunn House</rs> lines were evacuated, during the night of <dateStruct value="-04-2"><day type="name">Saturday</day>, <month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="2">2</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4630"/>Not many miles had been marched when, early the next morning, the sound of explosions and the smoke of conflagration told the fate of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 38" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and that the enemy was between the company and their homes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4631"/>What this means can only be known by those who have endured such an experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4632"/>But, with what haste they could, the battery moved over wretched roads crowded with soldiers and teams, splashing and tugging through mud and mire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4633"/>On every hand were signs of hurry and confusion, and all day long hungry stomachs complained of waning commissary stores, and nights were made miserable through want of sleep and rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4634"/>The poor horses, in bad condition even when resting in camp, were giving out, and by the time <placeName reg="Amelia Courthouse">Amelia Courthouse</placeName> was reached, the teams were so broken down by hard marching and want of rest, and the prospect of supplies was so hopeless that the caissons were abandoned and destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4635"/>This dire necessity was a fact ominous of disaster, as it was throwing away <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of the ammunition, leaving only that in the limber <pb id="p.327" n="327"/> chests of the guns for the contingency of a fight in immediate prospect&mdash;a supply that would be soon used up in any brisk battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4636"/>There was, however, no alternative, as the teams were so exhausted that further hauling of the caissons was impossible, and the horses must be used to relieve the gun teams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4637"/><persName n="Pendleton,General,,,," id="n0285.0047.00327.04170" reg="mostcommon:Pendleton,William,N.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pendleton</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Chief of Artillery">Chief of Artillery</rs>, reports that <num value="95">ninety-five</num> caissons, mostly loaded, were here abandoned and destroyed (<ref n="page 1281">p. 1281</ref>). There was probably any amount of private thinking and unpleasant reflection here going on in the minds of officers and men, but this company had long ago learned the lesson that their only duty was obedience to orders, and it is safe to say that so long as <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0285.0047.00327.04171" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> ordered, their confidence was unimpaired in the belief that the movement was right and the best and the proper thing to do.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4638"/>At <placeName reg="Amelia Courthouse">Amelia Courthouse</placeName> the batteries of <orgName n="battalion"><persName n="Cabell,,,,," id="n0285.0047.00327.04172" reg="mostcommon:Cabell,William,H.,,:2"><surname>Cabell</surname></persName>'s battalion</orgName> were put into the column of artillery and trains under <persName n="Walker,General,Lindsay,,," id="n0285.0047.00327.04173" reg="default:Walker,Lindsay,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Lindsay</foreName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName>, and moved to the right and west of the main body of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4639"/>From the information now attainable there were probably a <num value="100">hundred</num> pieces of artillery in this column which was pushed on in advance of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4640"/>Being thus screened in rear, the column did not participate in the daily fighting in which the main body was engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4641"/>Not until the evening of the <num value="8" type="ordinal">8th</num> was it struck by the <rs>Federal</rs> cavalry, who had pushed to the front and across the head of the army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4642"/>About <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time> that evening the command had reached a point opposite <placeName reg="Appomattox Station">Appomattox Station</placeName>, some <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> beyond the courthouse, and had turned off from the road for rest and such food as was available for man or beast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4643"/>Halting in the field, as each piece drove up, the teams were unhitched and given their scant food, or allowed to graze while the men were busied making their corn coffee and cooking probably the remnants of an old cow, from which rations had been dealt and eaten that morning within an hour after her slaughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4644"/>In this irregular bivouac so little was the nearness or approach of an enemy suspected that no sort of a guard had been set, and when the report of arms and the sight of Federal cavalry in the wood skirting the field, startled officers and men from their little mess fires or slumbers, the surprise was complete and astounding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4645"/>So sudden and unexpected was the attack, and so near were the enemy when <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> discovered, that a brisk determined charge would have brougnt them within the battery before a piece could be unlimbered and loaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4646"/>For there is nothing more helpless than artillery when surprised, if once the line of battery can be carried by a quick rush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4647"/>It is then <pb id="p.328" n="328"/> a mere matter of, shooting down unarmed cannoneers and driving them from their guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4648"/>Why such a rush was not made and everything captured on the spot, has often been the wonder of old Howitzers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4649"/>Their wonder will grow to amazement when they learn from the reports of this volume that at least <num value="2">two</num> divisions of cavalry were at hand and engaged in that attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4650"/>But luckily there was no such charge, and in a moment quick orders sent cannoneers flying to their posts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4651"/>Never were guns more quickly unlimbered, loaded and brought into action, nor in any battle of the war did the company perform a neater or more expeditious piece of work than on that field, under circumstances that might well have demoralized and stampeded them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4652"/>In an incredibly short time the confusion of a surprised camp was suppressed and every gun was pouring canister into the ranks of the enemy, who had advanced to the edge of the woods, less than <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards distant</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4654"/>It looked like a desperate chance, but every gun of the battery was gotten away, and the last memory of that field is, just about dusk, of a thin line of artillerymen armed with muskets and a few dismounted cavalry, whose firing kept back the enemy while the last gun to leave the field could be tugged out of a ditch in which it had stalled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4655"/>It is not claimed nor meant that these assaults were repelled by this battery alone, for there were other batteries along that road, of whose experience and fate we know not.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4686"/>It is impossible now to give the impressions, pure and simple, or the recollections of that night, untinged with the subsequent knowledge of what the morrow had in store for us. Forward and on, walking sometimes in sleep, holding on to tail of gun or wagon, as is the belief and assertion of some, who believe they remember the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4687"/>Tired out drivers urged on poor, jaded beasts, ready to drop with fatigue, hunger and thirst, but seemingly kept up to their work by sharing the feeling that those guns must be saved, while conscious of danger threatening from the rear, that might at any moment materialize in shots and sabre strokes of charging squadrons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4688"/><pb id="p.331" n="331"/></p> 
<p>The soldier obeying orders has no right to think for himself, but everybody could see that this march was a retreat, getting away with all possible haste from an enemy, and without power of defence should he overtake or head off the column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4689"/>It was clearly apparent to the understanding of the simplest private that the attack that evening had been a complete surprise; that the enemy had appeared when and where no <num value="1">one</num> expected him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4691"/>And, where was the infantry?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4692"/>There was evidently something very seriously wrong when a train of artillery like this was left without support to shift for itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4693"/>Where was the army and what doing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4694"/>Often enough before now it had been necessary to retire before superior force, but always with some degree of order, and with the cheering sight or sound of infantry near by, in whose company there was such a comforting feeling of safety and security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4695"/>The whole campaign of the previous year had been such a retiring, from the <rs>Rapidan</rs> to <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4702"/>For it was a familiar fact that on a march a geographical question might bring information of any number of miles to or from any known or unknown locality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4703"/>It is the impression of some of those marchers that night that nobody knew where we were nor how many miles were gone over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4705"/>The very haltings seemed evidence of ignorance of the route or of indecision, as if commanders knew not whither to turn or go. But on and on, through the dark hours, tired teams and men were urged on by the tired and impatient <pb id="p.332" n="332"/> officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4708"/>It was simply and merely running away from an enemy, because of no chance of present defence against him; trying to save those guns and rejoin the main body of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4709"/>As to the expectations of what the morrow's fate might be, no man can now speak with certainty of his hopes or forebodings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4710"/>Almost certainly, though, nobody anticipated the actual result, except possibly a few officers, to whom had come rumors of the negotiations pending the last <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4711"/>The slow coming dawn found the company still trudging on the road between <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName> and somewhere else, probably <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>, and the rising sun has seldom looked down on a group of men and animals more completely wearied out. After sunrise the battery was countermarched on this road, probably on orders to come back and meet the army, should it succeed in forcing its way out, as was attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4712"/>The result of that attempt is known to everybody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4713"/>In the absence of official reports, it is impossible to state exactly the orders received from <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0285.0047.00332.04195" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4714"/>Their effect and the alternative of inability to rejoin the army were disclosed in a scene that ended the company's service&mdash;a scene that baffles description, but whose memory will ever remain with every man then present.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4715"/>The catastrophe and the end had come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4716"/>What that meant we know now better than could be realized under the stunning sensations of such a calamity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4717"/>So overwhelming were the emotions excited by it, that even the weariness and hunger of the last day and week were forgotten, and the exhaustion of physical forces was replaced by something like the energy of despair, when orders were given to destroy the battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4718"/>Moving off into a field, intersected with gullies and ravines, the guns were spiked, dismounted and buried, and the carriages cut to pieces; a piece of work that was thoroughly and completely done, in soldierly fashion, by the sturdy arms that wielded hammers and axes that morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4719"/>Those guns, if found by the enemy, should be useless to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4720"/>Limber chests, trails and wheels were chopped and split into small kindling wood, with a <pb id="p.333" n="333"/> grudging feeling that the enemy might find and use it to warm them and cook their rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4721"/>The harness was cut to pieces and the horses turned loose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4722"/>And this was the end; or rather, the end was learned when the company was mustered, the roll called, and the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> &mdash;his voice choked with emotion&mdash;announced that orders had been received to destroy the battery and disband the company if found impossible to rejoin the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4723"/>The order informed the company that they were free to accept terms of surrender and go home, or else to make their way to <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> and join <orgName n="army"><persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0285.0047.00333.04196" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Albert,Sidney,,:7"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4725"/>Announcement of the end of the world would hardly have been received with more amazement and consternation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4726"/>Tear bedewed eyes and husky voices betrayed emotions that strong men could not repress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4727"/>The orderly sergeant, Bloackadar, could scarcely get through the roll-call, and could not find voice, or forgot, to give the command to break ranks, and this last order to the company was given by <persName n="McCreery,Sergeant,,,," id="n0285.0047.00333.04197" reg="mostcommon:McCreery,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Sergeant">Sergeant</roleName> <surname>McCreery</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4728"/>It is a good and satisfying record, that at that last roll-call every man was present or satisfactorily accounted for, with possibly <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> exceptions.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4729"/>Disbanded and free, with the sky above and earth beneath, and every man with untrammelled liberty to go whither he pleased; to help himself to a horse or to anything else that was common property, after the few remaining rations were shared from the wagon; free from roll-calls and obedience to somebody else's orders, and, above all, free to decide&mdash;every man for himself, individually&mdash;the question of further warfare or peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4730"/>Truly, a momentous question for men who had been so long obeying orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4731"/>There were numbers of men in that company who had served from the very commencement of the war. From a sense of duty, and from free choice, they had gone into the army, sacrificing personal freedom and everything for the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4732"/>Their motives were the same as those of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0285.0047.00333.04198" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, and in their humble sphere they had tried to do their duty, relying on him for leadership.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4733"/>Few men of that company or of that army had fought for love of fighting or for the glory of war, or even from mere hate of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4734"/>At any and all times they would gladly have echoed <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0285.0047.00333.04199" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s wish that those people would only go home and let us alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4735"/>With such motives and under such leadership, but <num value="1">one</num> result had ever been contemplated; it would have been a kind of treason to expect any other conclusion than final victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4736"/>But here was the end of the <pb id="p.334" n="334"/> company and the army, and what should they do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4737"/>No officers, no command, but free choice for every man to act on his own sense of right and duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4738"/>Never, probably, was there a more curious <orgName n="War Council" type="council">council of war</orgName> than that held by members of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> detachment, and presumably by other detachments or messes, consulting together as to what they should do.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4739"/>A detachment of private soldiers, absolved by their commander-in-chief from further service under his command, met to consider and advise for themselves, whether the war was ended, and what they should do. Stationing a man in the road to watch for and surrender to the enemy, if he should appear, as momentarily expected, the detachment gathered under the trees, and the situation was summarily discussed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4740"/>After a brief deliberation, it was pretty unanimously decided that the surrender of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0285.0047.00334.04200" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> meant the end of the war, rendering futile the hope of further resistance, as <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0285.0047.00334.04201" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Albert,Sidney,,:7"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s surrender must soon follow.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4742"/>Some few members of the company, deciding that they were <q direct="unspecified">in for the war,</q> and that it was not for them to judge when it was over, did make their way to <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> to join <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0285.0047.00334.04202" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Albert,Sidney,,:7"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4743"/>It was a matter of individual judgment as to the end of the war.
