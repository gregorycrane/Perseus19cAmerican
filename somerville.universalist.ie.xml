<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>As I am <num value="1">one</num> of the back numbers, it is not inappropriate, perhaps, that I should speak of memories and associations stretching back not only to <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> ago, to the time of the organization of this parish, but to the times and events and work before, that made possible this church.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>There are <num value="2">two</num> ways by which we can most thoroughly appreciate our privileges and blessings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>There may be others, but <num value="2">two</num> are essential to that appreciation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/><num value="1">One</num> is by being deprived of them, according to the poet's line, <q direct="unspecified">Blessings brighten as they take their flight.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/></p> 
<p>It is a sort of paradox, perhaps, to say we sometimes live too near our friends really to know and appreciate them; when they are gone we know them better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>A mountain cannot be seen in its magnificent proportions by standing at its base.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>It needs the perspective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>So our blessings often need this perspective in order that they may be more fully comprehended and appreciated when they go or are taken from us. That is <num value="1">one</num> way. The other way by which we come more thoroughly to know and appreciate these blessings is by earning them, and especially if we sacrifice and perhaps suffer in the attainment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Inherited wealth is not so thoroughly appreciated by those who come into its possession as by those who earn it by hard toil and persistent endeavor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>Now, friends, you and I and the world have come into the possession of a great inheritance, <num value="1">one</num> of the richest ever bestowed upon the race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>It is the inheritance of our <persName><foreName>Universalist</foreName></persName> faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>No <num value="1">one</num> who does not read the story of how it came into existence as our organized church, can fully appreciate what a blessing it has been to the human mind and heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>But, like all great movements <pb id="p.35" n="35"/> and reforms&mdash;and certainly this is <num value="1">one</num> of them&mdash; it came not but through that much tribulation by which people are enabled to enter the kingdom of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>The blood of the martyrs has ever been the seed of the church, and the seed of great reforms.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>Our fathers and mothers also suffered from this intense prejudice, bitter persecution, and absolute hatred because they believed in the living <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, who is the <name>Saviour</name> of all men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>My memory goes back to something of this attitude of the public, for I was born and brought up in my father's home, a Universalist clergyman of the earlier years of our history, and as a boy I heard it talked about.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>And those of the younger ministry and younger laymen know but little, only as they have read, of the almost hand-to-hand fight in which our fathers were engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>They toiled, and we have entered into their labors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Every inch of ground had to be persistently disputed, and then to keep it the soldiers of the great salvation had to stand upon the field with their armor on, and their spiritual weapons sharpened for the conflict.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Those were days of controversy, and sometimes of even fierce dispute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>That to uproot the errors of men should have been sometimes construed into personal attacks, and that this should have drawn upon them the ill &mdash; will and the slanders of the bigots, that they writhed under the severe castigation, and sought in the retaliation of personal abuse what they could not answer by argument and reason cannot be thought strange by those familiar with the religious history of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>It needed just such stalwart blows as were struck by those of the earlier time of our church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>It needed such men <pb id="p.36" n="36"/> as would not move timidly to their work, or carefully measure the rod with which the folly, and the bigotry, and the almost unscrupulous opposition was chastised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>It needed just such sturdy pioneers to go into the wilderness and hew down the forests, and make plain a highway for the <rs>Lord</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>It needed just such men to clear the fields, and put in the breaking &mdash; up plow, beam deep, and tear out the roots, and turn up the furrows to the warm sunshine, in order that others might follow and harrow and sow, and weed and reap, and gather the harvest into garners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>It needed the work of pulling down and laying the foundations that others might build thereupon, that in after years the sound of the hammer might be heard in the construction and rearing our holy temple unto the <rs>Lord</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>You young people of to-day are living when the rough corners of the old theology against which they so manfully battled have been broken off, and its harsher features softened.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>There is <num value="1">one</num> thing you may be assured of, that it required no little courage in those early days of our church to face this opposition and this social and religious ostracism.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>In <num value="1">one</num> respect there has been quite a revolution in the habits of men and women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Then few women dared to venture into the assembly where there was <persName><foreName>Universalist</foreName></persName> preaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>It is the men who more largely keep away from church-going to-day, and the women who attend.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>But this timidity was not entirely confined to the women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>Many men fought shy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>It is a fact that it was a matter of curiosity, as well as fear, <pb id="p.37" n="37"/> that took possession of some people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>They got the idea that there was a sort of performance indulged in. And people would gather on the outside of the building and creep up and peek in at the windows.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Oh, yes, I think it was the play of <quote>The <num value="40">forty</num> Thieves,</quote> for I saw about that number looking in at the windows.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/></p> 
<p>I want to remind you, friends, of the priceless inheritance you possess in the faith for which this church stands,&mdash;a faith that has done more in the last century and in these last <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> to vindicate the ways of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to man than any other; a faith to which all the <rs>Christian</rs> churches are indebted for the broadening and sweetening of their faiths until it would shock the sense of justice to hear in any <orgName n="Protestant Church" type="church">Protestant church</orgName> the old doctrine of divine vengeance preached, that frightful nightmare that held human souls in the bondage of fear, and drove sensitive men and women into despair, and even to insanity &mdash;the thought that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> had ordained and foreordained that the greater portion of mankind should be doomed to a hell of literal fire and brimstone forever and ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>What a change has been wrought since the earlier years of our church, when that hydra-headed dragon was very much in evidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>Yes, in the time of my earlier ministry it had not ceased to seek whom it might devour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>And didn't we put up a good fight in those earlier years against such horrible thoughts about <name n="God" type="God">God</name>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>And didn't we enjoy it, too, as much as the <rs>Rough Riders</rs> enjoyed the battle of <placeName reg="San Juan Hill, Snohomish, Washington" key="tgn,2640534">San Juan Hill</placeName>, when it is said the leader called out to the soldiers as they were going into battle, <q direct="unspecified">Give them hell, boys!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>We didn't say that; it was the other fellows who said that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>We said, <q direct="unspecified">We're going to knock hell out of you,</q> and we proceeded to do it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Be glad and rejoice that you belong to a church that <pb id="p.38" n="38"/> has had a providential mission assigned it, and is fulfilling that mission, and working its sweet way into hearts, and homes, and churches, and governments, and the thrill of the divine faith in the fatherhood of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the brotherhood of man, and in the assurance that life and death <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> mercy underlies, is being felt, and is bearing fruit in all the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>It has broadened the thought of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and of human destiny with the process of the suns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>Now, in seeking to pass judgment upon these years, according to these high standards, there is <num value="1">one</num> fact that must be kept in mind, and that is that the value of any given gain in almost every field of human activity and experience depends in great part upon the number and strength of the obstacles and difficulties which have been met and overcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>An army may march a <measure n="100miles" type="distance">hundred miles</measure> through the enemy's country without a particle of opposition presenting itself; but that achievement is as nothing compared with a single mile that is won at some strategic point stubbornly defended and yielded only at <pb id="p.40" n="40"/> the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>In times of strife and stress, how often we say that if we hold our own we are doing well, justly declaring that the simple maintenance of the old position and power is in reality growth and progress!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>This occasion, then, gives us our subject for to-day: The vitality of religion as tested by the changes and experiences of the past <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>What we want to bring into clearest light is the fact that religion and faith have during this half-century been on trial as perhaps never before since the morning of Christianity; that they have been tested and tried as by fire, and that <persName n="Burke,,,,," id="n0213.0005.00040.00397" reg="mostcommon:Burke,nomatch:0"><surname>Burke</surname></persName>'s penetrating reflection that man is a religious animal has been abundantly verified in the history of these <measure n="5decades" type="date">five decades</measure> during which some of you have worshipped together as an organized church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>During this time the political, intellectual, and religious events have been of such capital importance that the age stands alone and supreme in the annals of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>And every <num value="1">one</num> of these events has deeply and profoundly affected faith and the spiritual life of man; every <num value="1">one</num> of them has moved and violently disturbed the very foundations of the creeds and dogmas of the fathers, and with every upheaval and readjustment in thought the cry has been that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> was being destroyed, that religion, morality, and character had received a fatal blow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>Probably we do not fully realize the tremendous transformations through which the thoughts of men passed in the last half of the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>It might justly be characterized as a period of war; long and bitter have been the conflicts between the hosts of the old and the new, between the past and the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>It is not too much to say that you who have lived during the last <num value="2">two</num> generations have witnessed the clash of the spirit of <num value="20">twenty</num> or more centuries with the spirit of the <num value="20" type="ordinal">twentieth</num> century, and you have beheld the banner of victory planted surely and permanently with the army of modern thinkers and believers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/><pb id="p.41" n="41"/></p> 
<p>Taking now the wide survey, we see <num value="3">three</num> and possibly <num value="4">four</num> great major facts of history that no discerning eye can easily escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, that stupendous struggle in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> known as the <rs>Civil War</rs>; then the rise and progress of the scientific method in the pursuit of truth, and the new theories and doctrines that arose and gained world-wide acceptance as the result of the use of this method; in the third place, parallel with and, to some extent, the outcome of science and evolution, we see the birth of what may very properly be called the new Bible; and lastly, and nearest to our day of all, we cannot fail to note the deep flood of materialism and commercialism that has swept through and over the national life of the new world and out to the far corners of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>These I take to be the great, imperial facts of the last half-century,&mdash;the <rs>Civil War</rs>, the rise of science, the birth of the new Bible, and the marvelous growth of the commercial spirit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>And the central lesson that we want to draw from a brief study of these epoch-making events is that each and every <num value="1">one</num> of them with almost cyclonic force affected the faith of man in the unseen, and that after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> effects of these political and intellectual convulsions had passed, that eternal and inevitable faith of man in <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, in goodness, and in heaven rose with a new purity and a greater glory than it had ever known before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>Therefore, for this reason, above all other reasons, this period must be regarded as the grandest in the history of the race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>Never before had religion or faith to face so many and such mighty forces that at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sight seemed to be antagonistic, if not wholly fatal, and yet religion and faith have come forth from the conflict stronger than at the beginning, having won to their ranks many of those who were counted and who indeed counted themselves as the enemies of Christianity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>Neither time nor desire will permit us to enter with any fullness into the religious effects of that Titanic <pb id="p.42" n="42"/> struggle of the early sixties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>There can be no doubt, however, but that the cause of real religion was helped rather than hindered by the war, although at least <num value="1">one</num> of the great dogmas of the <rs>Christian</rs> faith was badly shattered as the result of that <num value="5">five</num>-years' ordeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>Any such all-absorbing and critical movement as that war must of necessity have greatly lessened the opportunity for religious forces to carry on their work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>Homes were broken up, churches were depleted of men and means, and the whole thought of the people centred on political and military matters, rather than upon the things of faith and <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>But the law of compensation ever moves with silent and majestic order to its great ends, and, all in all, the trial of the finest life of the nation in the awful fires of this desperate clash of arms was of inestimable value, for from it all faith in the great essentials of religion arose with an added purity and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>We may well believe that the contention of many is right, that <num value="1">one</num> of the unplanned, but most blessed and beneficent, results of the war was the weakening of the doctrine of everlasting punishment; it took just some such tremendous trial to disabuse men's mind of that barbarous and terrible dogma, so firmly rooted had it become in human thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>Here were multitudes of men rushing to exposure, suffering, and death for country, freedom, and unity, who had never made any profession of religion, who had not complied with the historic and creedal conditions of salvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>These men, strongest, and bravest, and finest of the nation, laid down their lives for absolutely unselfish purposes, and yet, according to the tenets of the traditional belief, they must go away into endless punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>The heart, the intelligence, and the conscience of a grateful people recoiled from the idea, and from the moment that their faithful service was fully appreciated, the dogma of an absolutely hopeless future for them received a blow from which it could never recover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>The creeds, the church, religion were tried by <pb id="p.43" n="43"/> this fire, and real religion came forth purified and glorified.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>But a severer test of faith invites our notice: faith as affected by science and evolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>At the beginning of the last half of the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century, the theological world was resting quietly and comfortably in the consciousness of the strength of its teaching and prestige.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>For the most part, the <rs>Roman</rs> and Protestant churches held complete dominion over the mind of Christendom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>They were the custodians of all truth, their systems of doctrines, differing in detail, all rested upon the same great philosophy of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>You know the general outline of it all. Some <measure n="6000years" type="date">6,000 years</measure> ago man was made perfect; the race sinned in <persName n="Adam,,,,," id="n0213.0005.00043.00398" reg="mostcommon:Adam,nomatch:0"><surname>Adam</surname></persName>'s sin; the calamity and crisis were so great that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> came to earth in the person of <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> and died for men, to satisfy himself, and man's participation in this priceless grace depended upon his open and formal profession of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0213.0005.00043.00399" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:2"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>; those who made this profession were endlessly blessed, all others endlessly cursed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>The <rs type="document">Bible</rs> was literally true; not <num value="1">one</num> single mistake did it contain, and the most vindictive words of warring kings were of equal value and authority with the sublime passages of the <name>Psalms</name>, of the prophets, and of <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>The world was obedient and quiet, when suddenly, like some profound disturbance in a clear sky, a book appeared that was to start an intellectual movement that in the end was destined to give a new birth to the human mind and shake creeds and faiths to their final foundations, yea, even to completely destroy some of the foundation stones upon which faith and religion were supposed to rest.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>Can we wonder that the theologians were alarmed beyond measure?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>Here they had been teaching <pb id="p.44" n="44"/> this theology for centuries: Man created perfect a few <num value="1000">thousands</num> of years ago, he has fallen from his glorious estate, the whole history is in the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, and so on to the completion of the system.

Man created perfect!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>No, far from that; rather, the evidence is that for a period reaching through ages and aeons this animal we call man has been climbing and struggling up to his present exalted position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>The world a few <num value="1000">thousands</num> of years old!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>Absurd; deep down in the valleys of ancient Eastern rivers were imperishable records that made a new book of Genesis and furnished the facts for a new chronology that makes the conclusion unescapable that man existed <num value="1000">thousands</num> upon <num value="1000">thousands</num> of years before the time that the church fixed as the hour of his creation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>Not for a moment does any evidence present itself leading to such a faith; <q direct="unspecified">progress is the law of life,</q> and always has been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>And then the theologians saw that if there had been no fall, there was no need for the sacrificial service of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0213.0005.00044.00409" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:2"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> in any artificial sense.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>Is it strange that the leaders of opinion in the church should cry out that all of this was an attempt to dethrone <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> was dead, that it was all contrary to the <name>Scriptures</name>, and that if this doctrine prevailed, interest in religion would be destroyed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>They did not understand that the word evolution was not a name for a new power, but for a new method, and that there could be an added glory and majesty given to the <name>Creator</name> by an orderly and eternal method in creation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>Such is the irony of time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>But the thing to hold fast to is that, in this intellectual and theological revolution, the real high and fine faith of humanity was neither destroyed nor impaired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>The truth of a saying of <persName n="Bacon,,,,," id="n0213.0005.00045.00414" reg="mostcommon:Bacon,E.,A.,,:2"><surname>Bacon</surname></persName> is well shown in this connection: <q direct="unspecified">Slight tastes of philosophy may perchance move <num value="1">one</num> to atheism, but fuller draughts lead back to religion.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>But now the reaction has come, as it was bound to come; the great thing in the thought of the age is no longer this new and true method by which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has been working, it is fact of the power behind the method, the intellect and love behind the method.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>The earlier workers in science may have been skeptical in regard to some of the final facts of the <rs>Christian</rs> faith, but theirs were only the slight tastes of truth, but the fuller draughts of <persName n="Fiske,,,,," id="n0213.0005.00045.00417" reg="mostcommon:Fiske,nomatch:0"><surname>Fiske</surname></persName> and <persName n="Drummond,,,,," id="n0213.0005.00045.00418" reg="mostcommon:Drummond,nomatch:0"><surname>Drummond</surname></persName> led men back to religion and to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and to a nobler faith than the traditions and the dogmas of the centuries ever knew.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>We have already hinted at the character of the modern Bible which reverent and consecrated students of the <name>Scriptures</name> have made possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>Our only purpose in turning to it here is to show that, although the old literally inspired book of authority has gone never to return, the great essential ideas contained therein have not been injured in the slightest degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>Rather, belief in <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, in freedom and power through righteousness, and in the larger destiny was never so strong as at present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>Doubtless the fathers would have said, in fact they did say, that if it were shown that the old theory of special and mechanical inspiration was not true, then the most powerful sanction for the truths and laws and the faith which the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> teaches has been destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>But we have proven that this is not so; the vitality, the inevitableness <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> of religion is too great and real to be disastrously affected by any book, or man, or event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>We have a different Bible, but man's cry for truth and <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is just as impassioned and his faith in truth and <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is just as strong as before science and scholarship began their noble work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>So, too, it is good to be able to say that the new Bible is speaking to men with a nobler authority than did the <name>Scriptures</name> of the fathers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>Its place in the thought and heart of the world is secure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>A fuller and truer knowledge of its natural history has given added power to its divine message.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> single accent of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> voice has been hushed or lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>Seen in the new perspective, its heavenly heights of faith, and hope, and love stand out in clearer light above the fogs and mists of doubt, above the wisdom and the weakness of this world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>As the supreme revealer of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> will and love, it is counted the most precious possession of all the written words that have ever been given to mankind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> the war, then evolution, then the higher criticism, and now last, and perhaps strongest of all, the spirit of religion is called upon to contend with the secularism, the materialism, the commercialism of the last quarter of a century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>The irrepressible conflict now is that between high and clean social and personal ideals on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, and the power of mammon on the other, and if <num value="1">one</num> were a prophet, he might venture to say that faith, hope, and love are passing through a greater trial and are being more severely tested than they ever were by any of these forces and changes which we have considered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>Just as <num value="25">twenty-five</num> or <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> ago the great men of the age were scientists, so now the great names of our part of the world, at least, are those of merchant princes, financiers, and politicians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>The earlier movement was an intellectual materialism, the later is a commercial materialism, and there can be little question but that the last is more subtle, more insidious in its workings, and more dangerous to the spiritual life of man. <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> <persName n="Darwin,,,,," id="n0213.0005.00047.00419" reg="nearbymention:Darwin,Charles,,,"><surname>Darwin</surname></persName> and his co-laborers sought truth, making the mistake at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of thinking that matter and the facts of matter were all that were real.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>The leaders of to-day seek money and the power money can give, making the still more serious error of thinking that money, which may purchase freedom from the consequences of outraged social laws, can likewise placate the everlasting laws of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>And yet in this commercial intoxication, signs are not wanting to show that the higher faith is still present and vigorous, and that a reaction of righteousness is already setting in. The spirit of unity is invading almost every communion; all pulpits more and more are placing the emphasis of religion upon the same changeless essentials of faith; as never before spiritual things are magnified; and there is less that is artificial, less of make-believe in the whole <orgName n="Christian Church" type="church">Christian church</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>The vast fortunes annually given for the noblest social purposes, the growing liberality of the sects, the vigorous and confident efforts being made to establish peace and good will between industrial interests and between nations&mdash;all of these are indicative of the vitality, the virility, and the power of that force that we call religion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>It has been a great and good half-century; all in all, the world has not seen its like before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>As never before the cause of real religion has triumphed gloriously; it has come forth from all opposition more powerful than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>Man is a religious being; faith in <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and good is inevitable; the forms, the creeds, and the churches of religion may be utterly destroyed, but for faith and religion themselves there is no death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>The history of these years since the fathers <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> met together to form this society shows that neither wars, nor the wisdom of this world, nor the love of gain and gold can destroy man's interest in the deepest things of life, in <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, in duty, and in destiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>Worship it holds to be the highest and noblest act of the human mind and the supreme need of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>In worship retreat and release are found from the cares and burdens of this world, and strength, courage, and inspiration are given for daily duty and efficient service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>It teaches personal righteousness as the end and object of religious endeavor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>It says to all men, <q direct="unspecified">Sirs, ye are brethren, why do ye wrong <num value="1">one</num> to another?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>It champions the cause of the weak and the oppressed, and insists that men are of much more value than money, and that the essence of social and political liberty is only found in absolute freedom of opportunity for each man to make the most of the faculties that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has given him.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>Our worship is supported by voluntary contributions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>No price is placed upon any seat or sitting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>No fixed tax is asked of any man, each pledging the amount per week that he feels he can afford, and is given his choice of any unoccupied seat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>We have no chief seats, and we are not forever calling for money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>No <num value="1">one</num> but the treasurer knows what any contributor gives, and a man paying <measure n="5cents" type="currency">five cents</measure> a Sunday may be alongside of him who gives <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">$5</measure> every week.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>There is welcome in this method.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/><hi rend="italics">Our Needs, and Yours</hi>.&mdash;We need men as well as women, and we believe that men need the church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>The well-known witticism of the <name>Hebrew</name> trader, who, speaking of another, said that if he had any religion, <q direct="unspecified">it was in his wife's name,</q> applies to many men, both <name>Jew</name> and <name>Christian</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>And, as an editorial writer in the <orgName n="Boston Herald" type="newspaper">Boston Herald</orgName> pointed out some years ago, it is vastly better to have religion in your wife's name than not to have it at all. He tells us that <q direct="unspecified">If the wife is uplifted and beautified by her faith, if it enables her to diffuse sweetness and light through the house, the husband is gaining the greatest blessings from hiring a pew he never condescends <pb id="p.99" n="99"/> to, sit in himself, and is reached by the prayer and preaching he never listened to, in a way for which he may be devoutly thankful.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/></p> 
<p>And there is much of truth in these words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>No person, man or woman, can be deeply stirred and strongly moved by a service of worship without making life better and happier for those of the same household, for friend and neighbor, and for all <num value="1">one</num> meets and greets along the way of life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>And yet somehow or other the feeling still remains that this reasoning, true though it may be, does not settle the question, and that a man's duty to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> cannot be thus vicariously performed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>It is all very well for a man to hire a pew for his wife, and it is very fine and fortunate for him that she comes from church filled with the light of truth and the beauty of goodness, and is thus able the easier to smooth his troubled brow and make home a delightful retreat from the world and its cares.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>But how about the wife?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>She, too, has cares and troubles, and perhaps would appreciate more of that spirit of kindness, and gentleness, and humility, and service which it is the object of worship to invoke in the hearts of all those who gather in <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>If it is helpful to the husband to have the wife bring this finer life into the home from the church, it ought to be stated the other way, that it would be equally helpful to the wife to have the husband bring the strength of manly kindness and thoughtfulness from the same church to the same home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>Surely the rule works both ways.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>The truth is that no well man who is not called to labor upon the <name>Sabbath</name> has any fair and reasonable excuse for failing to worship <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/><hi rend="italics">Our Invitation</hi>.&mdash;There are probably nearly <num value="400">400</num> families of known <placeName reg="Universalists">Universalists</placeName> in various sections of our city who might rightfully be expected to be more or less interested in the <placeName reg="Deerhead, Essex, New York" key="tgn,2282701">Cross</placeName>-street Church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>More than half of <pb id="p.100" n="100"/> these are already actively identified with our work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>Those who are not have cordial invitation to join us in our worship and church life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>We want you to feel that the offices of our church are at your service, and that anything we can do to help you will be gladly done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>This invitation includes, too, all those who have no regular church home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>The children of such families will be welcomed to our <orgName n="Sunday School" type="school">Sunday School</orgName>, and will be placed in classes under competent teachers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>Parents are urged to set a good example by attending church, and thus making Sunday not only a day of rest from their usual labors, but a day of growth in the high and fine things that belong to character, to duty, and to destiny. </p></div1>
