<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/><emph>W</emph>HEN, a few months ago, in a conversation with <num value="1">one</num> of your members, I expressed a willingness to give your Society, not a lecture, but a heart-to-heart talk on <q direct="unspecified"><placeName>Medford</placeName>, as I Knew It <measure n="50Years" type="date">Fifty Years</measure> Ago,</q> I did not realize what I was taking upon myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>The limitations of my subject as implied in my promise did not once occur to me. The whole history of the town seemed back of me, and I had vague visions at the moment of the references I should be able to make to eminent citizens of the past; to the great captains of industry in the way of ship-building, who had laid the foundations of the town's prosperity; to the leaders of public thought, and, in the purely intellectual line, to those <num value="2">two</num> famous daughters of the town, <persName n="Brooks,,Maria,Gowen,," id="n0334.0002.00000.00002" reg="default:Brooks,Maria,Gowen,,"><foreName>Maria</foreName> <foreName>Gowen</foreName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName> and <persName n="Child,,Lydia,Maria,," id="n0334.0002.00000.00003" reg="default:Child,Lydia,Maria,,"><foreName>Lydia</foreName> <foreName>Maria</foreName> <surname>Child</surname></persName>, who years before had shed a permanent literary flavor over the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Surely there was an embarrassment of riches in the way of material for such a talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>It was not until after many weeks, and when the date assigned me was growing near, that I sat myself seriously to the task of preparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Then the truth <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> dawned upon me. I realized, to my consternation, that up to that time I had been living in a state of delusion, and that instead of the free and unlimited scope I had expected, I was bound by the letter of my promise and agreement to confine myself to speak only of the town as I knew it when, a boy of <num value="19">nineteen</num>, I wandered into its precincts, and that my area of treatment lay wholly between the autumn of <dateStruct value="1853--"><year reg="1853">1853</year></dateStruct> and the summer of <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>All the rich material of the past was thus barred out, and all the still richer material of the years which followed I could make no use of.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> I felt strongly tempted to write and withdraw my promise, but after due consideration I concluded that I might, in the way of anecdote and comment, manage to shed some sidelights on <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> life and society, even in that brief space of time, that might be of passing interest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>I doubt if in all the years of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>'s history there was ever a more stagnant period than during those <measure n="9months" type="date">nine months</measure>. I am not finding fault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It suited me well enough, for I needed quiet surroundings for my work; but it was unfortunate for your sakes here tonight that it didn't provide me with more stirring material than I shall be able to give you. I was young when I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> came to the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>I knew no <num value="1">one</num>, and my life was spent much to myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>I made few acquaintances, but I was naturally of an inquiring mind, and while most of the people I met with were apparently oblivious of my existence, I kept my eyes and ears open.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>My <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> coming to <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> was the result of a painful episode in my family history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>When I was a child I used to hear my mother, who died nearly <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> ago at the age of <num value="90">ninety</num>, tell the story of her brother who died in <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, away from his home, at the age of <num value="16">sixteen</num>, and who was buried in the old ground across the street from here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>His father, my grandfather, had, with several of his neighbors, obtained the charter for a new town in <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName>, and had emigrated there with his family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The conditions were unfavorable, however, and the little community suffered from lack of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It was finally decided that half a dozen of the younger men should return to <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> and seek employment, sending home regularly a portion of their wages, thus relieving the stress upon the little community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>My uncle was then young in years, but a man in size and intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>He begged to be <num value="1">one</num> of those <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> chosen, and his prayer was granted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>With his companions, carrying his little bundle, he walked a <placeName><distance reg="100miles">hundred miles</distance> to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>That was in the year <dateStruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>In that year <persName n="Magoun,,Thatcher,,," id="n0334.0002.00003.00004" reg="default:Magoun,Thatcher,,,"><foreName>Thatcher</foreName> <surname>Magoun</surname></persName> was building his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> vessel on the <rs>Mystic</rs>, and thither the young lad hurried in pursuit of work, which he at once obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>On the <dateStruct value="--2"><day reg="2">second</day></dateStruct> <time>day</time> after his arrival he fell from the deck to the ship's bottom and was instantly killed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>All the rest of the remaining years of her life his mother was filled with a longing to visit and look upon his last resting place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>But that comfort was denied her. The hard days of the pioneers were not yet past, and a few years later she, too, was taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>At the time my mother was <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> old&mdash;too young, <num value="1">one</num> would suppose, for even so sad an event to make a permanent impression, yet so heavy and sudden was the blow, and so keen was the sorrow in the household, that it remained until the day of her death, nearly <measure n="90years" type="date">ninety years</measure> later, <num value="1">one</num> of the most vivid and painful of her memories.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>And so the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, vessel built on the <rs>Mystic</rs> after colonial times was baptized in the blood of this <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName> boy, and as <num value="1">one</num> of the results of his tragic and untimely fate I am sitting here and talking to you tonight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>When I left my <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName> home <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> later to seek, as my uncle did, my fortune, my mother exacted a promise from me that I sometime would visit <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, find the grave, and mark it with a stone, no matter how humble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It was a year or <num value="2">two</num> before the opportunity came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/><num value="1">One</num> beautiful day in early <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, in <dateStruct value="1853--"><year reg="1853">1853</year></dateStruct>, I started out from my <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> boarding-house on my long delayed mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It was a day to be remembered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The sky was clear, the air bracing, and my lightheartedness was altogether unbefitting the solemnity of my errand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>After leaving Charlestown Neck it was a plunge into the real country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/><placeName reg="Winter Hill, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2777828">Winter Hill</placeName> was bare of buildings, save here and there a farmhouse, and on either side were fields of corn and spacious gardens, pastures, <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> and green trees where are now paved streets and rows upon rows of handsome houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Down in the marshes to the right were the busy brickyards, and near by, a standing rebuke to the civilization of the time, were the ruins of the <rs>Ursuline Convent</rs>, destroyed by a mob a few years before.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Passing down <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address> on this side the hill, I stopped to study the <name>Royall</name> mansion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>I knew nothing of its name or history, but the place carried with it an unmistakable flavor of the past, and that was an element which always attracted me. So on past the <rs type="place">Medford House</rs>, over the bridge, past the little branch railroad station and <placeName reg="City Hall">City Hall</placeName>, into the square.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>As I entered the square, things had a strangely familiar look.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>There are so many things in old-fashioned <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> villages that look alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It reminded me of certain <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName> villages with which I was familiar, the type, I have since found, of <num value="9">nine</num> out of <num value="10">ten</num> of those anciently planted in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, the main feature consisting of two broad streets crossing each other at right angles, the intersection forming what is always and everywhere known as <q direct="unspecified">the square,</q> round which are clustered the various stores of the town, the postoffice, and the oldest church, the town pump always in the center.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>This last was my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> objective point, for my long walk had made me thirsty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>I was not so thoroughly permeated with my errand as to be oblivious of everything else, and I spent a comfortable and instructive hour in <q direct="unspecified">sizing up</q> the town before I turned my steps toward the old burying-ground, directed by a little girl, who was curious to know if I <q direct="unspecified">was going to have a funeral,</q> and who seemed to be genuinely disappointed when I assured her I was not. The wall which skirted the yard was in a dilapidated condition at that date, the town, or the church society having it in charge, evidently feeling sure that none of those in the enclosure would ever try to get out, and equally sure that nobody outside would be anxious to get in, and so regarded its mending as unnecessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>A <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> diligent investigation availed nothing in the way of locating the spot of which I was in search.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>I should have been sure of that in the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The world is too busy with its own affairs to take note of the friendless and penniless who leave it, and the only consolation I had in my disappointment was that the nameless dust I had vainly sought nourished the grass above it equally with that of those of more lofty name and lineage which had mingled with it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>While I was resting on the broken wall, from my investigations among the dilapidated stones and unmarked mounds, I was accosted by a pleasant faced young fellow who had been watching me, and who thought I might be searching for some rare botanical specimen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>He assured me there was nothing but the commonest weeds and plants in the yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>When I explained that I was simply trying to locate a grave his curiosity suddenly cooled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Later I formed a closer acquaintance with him. You of a later generation know him as <persName n="Bishop,,Nat,,," id="n0334.0002.00005.00005" reg="default:Bishop,Nat,,,"><foreName>Nat</foreName> <surname>Bishop</surname></persName>, who later, as a man, brought honor upon himself and his native town as an explorer and naturalist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>His home at that time was on <address><street n="Salem street">Salem street</street></address>, and very near this spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>I recall his taking me there once or twice, and of meeting his mother, who impressed me as a superior woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>A vague and altogether uncertain memory connects the <name>Bishops</name> with <persName n="Smith,,T.,P.,," id="n0334.0002.00005.00006" reg="expanded:Smith,Thomas,P.,,"><foreName>T.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Both were property holders on the street, and I think their estates joined.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>It was now <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time>. I had eaten nothing since <num value="7">seven</num> that morning, and became suddenly conscious of an appetite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>As a result I began to look about for the means of satisfying it. Walking back to the square I began hunting for a restaurant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>I soon found that my search was labor lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>There was no restaurant, but a man whom I asked furnished the information that I could get a good dinner at <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Baker,,Betsy,,," id="n0334.0002.00005.00007" reg="default:Baker,Betsy,,,"><foreName>Betsy</foreName> <surname>Baker</surname></persName>'s</q> for <measure n="50cents" type="currency">fifty cents</measure>, and appeared surprised that I didn't know that <persName n="Baker,,Betsy,,," id="n0334.0002.00005.00008" reg="default:Baker,Betsy,,,"><foreName>Betsy</foreName> <surname>Baker</surname></persName>'s was the <rs type="place">Medford House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Now, half dollars were not as plenty then as they are today, and besides, <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> if the truth must be told, I had n't half a dollar in my pocket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Hungrier than ever, I wandered down <address><street n="Salem street">Salem street</street></address>, when <persName n="Withington,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00006.00009" reg="mostcommon:Withington,nomatch:0"><surname>Withington</surname></persName>'s bakery caught my eye. <q direct="unspecified">They make things to eat, here,</q> I said to myself, <q direct="unspecified">and of course they sell them.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>A course of reasoning I subsequently found correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>I shall never forget that dinner, which I ate off the counter, while the girl in attendance watched me as if she expected I was going through the whole stock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/><num value="3">Three</num> doughnuts, half a dozen cookies, quarter of an apple pie, with a glass of milk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>I have eaten dinners at <persName n="Parker,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00006.00010" reg="mostcommon:Parker,nomatch:0"><surname>Parker</surname></persName>'s, <persName n="Young,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00006.00011" reg="mostcommon:Young,nomatch:0"><surname>Young</surname></persName>'s, the <name>Touraine</name>, and the <name>Waldorf</name>-<placeName reg="Astoria, Queens, New York" key="tgn,7015838">Astoria</placeName> since then, but never <num value="1">one</num> with a better appetite, or which went so directly to the spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>I remember it, too, for another reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>There was <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> person present, who watched my gastronomic performances with evident astonishment and admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>His floury appearance and white jacket showed him to be a baker, probably <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Withington,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0002.00006.00012" reg="mostcommon:Withington,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Withington</surname></persName>'s employees, and as soon as he opened his mouth I knew that he was an Irishman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>As I wiped my mouth with my handkerchief after finishing my meal, he opened upon me. Our conversation ran something like this:&mdash;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/><q direct="unspecified">Ye come out here from <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">Yes.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">Wid a team?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">No.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">By the cars?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">No, on foot.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">Are ye lookina fur a job?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">No.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">Are ye a baker?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">No, I was never inside a bakeshop before.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">Well, then, if ye footed it out from <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> this hot day, and ye are n't a baker, and ye don't want a job, what the divil are ye here for, anyway?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/></p> 
<p>Whereupon I explained with considerable particularity my errand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>He looked disgusted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/><pb id="p.7" n="7"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">It's the women are the fules!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>he commented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/><q direct="unspecified">Here ye've come thrampina out to a place where ye've no business, to find the bones of a man that's been rotten for <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>, and that nobody remembers?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Well, and what would ye do if ye found 'em?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Tell me that!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/></p> 
<p>I could not tell him, and our conversation ended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>I returned to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> that afternoon, but I was n't satisfied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>There was something about the atmosphere of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> that appealed to me, and the following week I packed my <rs n="carpet bag" type="product">carpet bag</rs> and went back, this time by train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>I found a boarding place in the square, in the house on the corner of <address><street n="Forest Street">Forest</street></address> and <address><street n="Salem Street">Salem</street></address> streets, where <persName n="Cotting,,Timothy,,," id="n0334.0002.00007.00013" reg="default:Cotting,Timothy,,,"><foreName>Timothy</foreName> <surname>Cotting</surname></persName> afterward erected his brick block.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>A baker named <persName n="Richardson,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00007.00014" reg="mostcommon:Richardson,C.,A.,,:1"><surname>Richardson</surname></persName> occupied <num value="0.5">one half</num>, while the other was lived in by <persName n="Gibbs,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0002.00007.00015" reg="mostcommon:Gibbs,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gibbs</surname></persName>, the worthy watchmaker, whose store was just opposite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>On the opposite corner of the same streets stood an ancient building, the <rs type="place">Tufts house</rs>, I think it was called, with <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> immense trees in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>At that time it was occupied&mdash;the lower half, at least&mdash;by <persName n="Peak,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0002.00007.00016" reg="mostcommon:Peak,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">a Mr.</roleName> <surname>Peak</surname></persName>, whose family later toured <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> as the <q direct="unspecified">Bell Ringers.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/></p> 
<p><persName n="Peak,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0002.00007.00017" reg="mostcommon:Peak,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Peak</surname></persName> was a skilful barber, as well as a hustling periodical dealer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>He was a slender, active man, with a face that showed the traces of smallpox.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>He was a good talker, as well as a good walker, and seemed to do a thriving business.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Just below, and only separated from the <name>Cotting</name> bakery by an alley, was a big wooden tenement building, far gone in decay, which was fortunately swept out of existence some years ago. Its site is now covered by the brick block already referred to. On the opposite side of <address><street n="High street">High street</street></address> and near the <placeName reg="City Hall">City Hall</placeName> was the residence of <persName n="Usher,,James,M.,," id="n0334.0002.00007.00018" reg="default:Usher,James,M.,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Usher</surname></persName>, the latest historian of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, I believe, to establish a newspaper in town.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Just above <persName n="Usher,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0002.00007.00019" reg="nearbymention:Usher,James,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Usher</surname></persName>'s, in a modest little store, kept by <persName n="Winneck,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0002.00007.00020" reg="mostcommon:Winneck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">a Mr.</roleName> <surname>Winneck</surname></persName>, was the postoffice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>It may be that I was a trifle impatient at times, but it used to seem to me that <persName n="Winneck,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0002.00007.00021" reg="mostcommon:Winneck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Winneck</surname></persName> took his duties too seriously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/><pb id="p.8" n="8"/> There were no letter-carriers in those days, and everybody had to come to the office to get or send letters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>I recall, even now, with a feeling of irritation, the deliberation of the postmaster in handling the mails, and how he rebuked the impatience of the waiting people with a gleam of his glittering eye.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The low brick block which curved from <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address> round into <address><street n="Ship street">Ship street</street></address> is much the same as it was then, though I think not <num value="1">one</num> of the old-time tenants remains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>These reminiscences of a by-gone period in the town's history may seem to your younger members overdrawn, but I have tried hard to keep within exact limits, and to describe things just as I saw and remember them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>We may well imagine that the project was thoroughly discussed, and the record is, <q direct="unspecified">there shall be a meting-house at or before <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> ninetie <num value="4">four</num> and is to be finished by the <dateStruct value="-10-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct> following (or sooner if it can be) on the land of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>&mdash;&mdash;Willis near the gate by marble brook on a rock on&mdash;north side of Oborn Rode.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Having thus decided to build, the next important thing was to appoint a committee to do so, the choice falling upon <placeName reg="Peter Tufts">Peter Tufts</placeName>, <persName n="Brooks,,Caleb,,," id="n0334.0006.00027.00097" reg="default:Brooks,Caleb,,,"><foreName>Caleb</foreName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName> and <persName n="Willis,,Thomas,,," id="n0334.0006.00027.00098" reg="default:Willis,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Willis</surname></persName>, who represented the extreme ends as well as the center of the town.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>No chance for any boodle or graft in this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>It will be noticed that this covenant or contract was by a different committee, in the town's behalf, than the <num value="1">one</num> before named, and that Lef<hi rend="sup">t</hi> <placeName reg="Peter Tufts">Peter Tufts</placeName> evidently no longer refused to serve, but appears to be the chairman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>We may suppose that with the meeting-house to be completed the following <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> the builders soon got at the work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>A few observations at this point may not be inappropriate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/><placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> had then no building ordinance, so the builders were at no trouble or loss of time in securing a permit to build, or ascertain the grade or street line from the city engineer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>No questions of drainage bothered them, and the foundation (<q direct="unspecified">the rock near marble brook</q>) <pb id="p.30" n="30"/> would be perfectly satisfactory to the building inspector of today.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>We would have had no fire stops to insist on, as there was no chimney, and the frame was not the <q direct="unspecified">balloon construction</q> of later times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Its timbers probably grew on <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> stumps, most likely of oak of goodly size, and hauled to the site by teams of oxen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Then the axemen put in their work, squaring the logs, hewing to a line with mathematical precision, and making the chips fly merrily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>Next the framers had a hand in the work, making great mortises, gains and tenons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>Splices there were no need of, and probably there were none, as no timber was over <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure> in length.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The tools they used were clumsy and uncouth compared with those of mechanics of today, but the men knew how to handle them, and accomplished their work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Those were days when buildings sprang not up in a night like the gourd of <persName><foreName>Jonah</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Not only the timber of the frame, but the boards that <q direct="unspecified">covered and inclosed it,</q> were made from the logs at the building's site, and in this we may find a reason for the <q direct="unspecified">liberty</q> the inhabitants had in the matter of <q direct="unspecified">meterials,</q> and also of the <q direct="unspecified">time and menes.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/></p> 
<p>The <q direct="unspecified">currant mony of N. E.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>was not so plenty or so current as that of today, and doubtless some men whose names do not appear in that <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> subscription list had trees growing on their farms that made good timber or boards, shingles or clapboards, laths or <q direct="unspecified">lower flore.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>Some other <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> men could handle the whip-saw, and they had their opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>Somewhere on the slope of the hill was made a saw-pit of stone and timber, and on this the great pine logs and smaller oak timbers were placed <num value="1">one</num> at a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/><num value="1">One</num> man above on the log and another below in the pit worked the saw up and down, down and up, till board after board and the smaller joists of oak were made in sufficient quantities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Great boulders that any <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> farmer was glad to have out of his pasture formed the foundation walls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>No cellar was needed, for their was no furnace or steam heater, <pb id="p.31" n="31"/> and so no need of space for fuel storage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>The floor beams were only hewed on <num value="1">one</num> side, instead of all <num value="4">four</num>, and laid flush in great open pockets cut in the sills, and also supported by other boulders, so that when the solid men (and women) of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> assembled thereon, they felt secure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>A floor of boards laid upon these, and all was ready for the eventful day of the raising.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>The great timbers, <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="12inches" type="distance">twelve inches</measure> square if of pine and <num value="8">eight</num> if of oak, had all been fitted tenon in mortise and securely pinned together, and lay upon the floor in <num value="4">four</num> sections, ready to be raised to a perpendicular position, a whole broadside at once, and all the town came to do it, or see it done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>We have been unable to find any account of <hi rend="italics">this</hi> <q direct="unspecified">raising,</q> though at that of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> meeting-house it was said <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">there was no <num value="1">one</num> hurl</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Does this intimate that at the earlier ones some accident occurred?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>We may trust not, though such had been the case elsewhere when it was thought necessary to provide a liberal allowance of rum, lemons, cider and sugar <q direct="unspecified">to make the tackle work smoothly.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/></p> 
<p>When in position the frame was <q direct="unspecified">inclosed</q> by the carpenters with boards placed horizontally and with edges bevelled to overlap and shed the driving rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>The roof timbers were <q direct="unspecified">covered</q> with boards extending from eaves to ridge-pole, which was hewed on <num value="2">two</num> sides to fit the angle of the roof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Meanwhile other workmen had been busy on the farms of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>The great pine trees that years before had been felled and had escaped the burning, whose stately trunks were free of knots, and from which the outer sapwood had decayed, were cut into shorter pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>These split into thin sections, piled up to season, and afterward shaven smooth with a drawknife, formed the clapboards and shingles with which the walls and roof were finished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>The former were the longer, thinner at the upper <hi rend="italics">edge</hi>, and overlapping each other horizontally and at the ends by a bevelled joint, made a wind-and weather-proof covering.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>The shingles were the shorter, and were thinnest at <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> the upper end, and their manufacture has in the last few decades become a lost art for which the <hi rend="italics">reliable</hi> builders of the present day sigh in vain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>While the frame was fastened with wooden pins, the boards, clapboards and shingles were secured with nails, and here was another example of co-operative industry and a home market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>All the nails were hand made and in many cases home made, even the children assisting in beating out on a little anvil each single nail from an iron rod of suitable size.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Every nail was placed where it would do the most service, and none wasted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>Next in order in the <q direct="unspecified">couenant</q> was <q direct="unspecified">the walls [to be] bricked.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/><persName n="Clay,,,,," id="n0334.0006.00032.00118" reg="mostcommon:Clay,nomatch:0"><surname>Clay</surname></persName> was abundant in <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, and bricks but lightly burned were packed into the spaces between the joists and timbers of the framework, being laid in clay instead of mortar of lime and sand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>Such construction may be found in the oldest houses of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, and adds much to their warmth and protection against the spread of fire.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>The <q direct="unspecified">Couenant</q> called for <q direct="unspecified">Dors &amp; windows &amp; Glafs,</q> and <q direct="unspecified">to lay a lower flore.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>This required more skilled workmen&mdash;they were the joiners, who made the window-frames and sashes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>Of <q direct="unspecified">Dors</q> there must have been at least <num value="2">two</num>, and probably both in the external wall, with some attempt at ornament in their finish and makeup, while the <q direct="unspecified">flore</q> was made of pine from the primeval forest, and well seasoned, as it had need to be, for the boards were wide, as were those that sealed the sides of the room up to the window-sills.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>The town, on the <dateStruct value="1695-11-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month>, <year>1695</year>,</dateStruct> voted to have a pulpit and deacons' seat made, as well as <q direct="unspecified">the body of seats,</q> and have the walls <q direct="unspecified">plaistered with lime,</q> thus increasing the outlay to <measure n="80l." type="pounds"><num value="80">eighty</num> pounds</measure>. It was tedious work <hi rend="italics">sawing</hi> the great logs into lumber, so the laths were split in narrow and thin strips varying in width and thickness, and nailed on the joists, concealing the bricks already laid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>Lime was made by burning oyster shells, and hair to mix with it may have come from <pb id="p.33" n="33"/> the tannery at <placeName reg="Whitmore Brook, Windsor, Vermont" key="tgn,2768796">Whitmore brook</placeName>, while a plenty of sand was also to be had near by. Only the walls were thus coated, but doubtless the mud-wasps did their share among the roof timbers and king-posts, which, with the beams, were left exposed to view.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>The <q direct="unspecified">body of seats</q> were a series of long wooden benches without any backs, which occupied the central portion of the <q direct="unspecified">flore</q> and were movable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>The pulpit was elevated several feet, requiring a stairway to enter it upon the left-hand side, and was not complete without a sounding-board suspended above it, while the deacons' seat was in front of the stairs and facing the <q direct="unspecified">body of seats.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/></p> 
<p>We may well imagine that the good people of <placeName reg="Meadford">Meadford</placeName> assembled in their new meeting-house with gladness and a commendable pride at its completion in <dateStruct value="1696--"><year reg="1696">1696</year></dateStruct>, but there was probably no service of dedication, as we term it today.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>On <dateStruct value="1696-05-25"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="25">25</day>, <year reg="1696">1696</year></dateStruct>, the town directed the selectmen to get a sufficient title to the land on which it had been built, and on <dateStruct value="1699-03-06"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="6">6</day>, <year reg="1699">1699</year></dateStruct>, the deed was voted to be placed in the keeping of <persName n="Wade,Major,Nathaniel,,," id="n0334.0006.00033.00119" reg="default:Wade,Nathaniel,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>Nathaniel</foreName> <surname>Wade</surname></persName>, and a copy made in the town record book by the town clerk.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>Age, wealth, generosity in contribution, and social distinction or <q direct="unspecified">quality,</q> were the factors that entered into the problem the committee had to solve, and how much jealousy and heart burnings, ill-concealed ofttimes, family quarrels and the like were thus engendered!

<p>When <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> completed, the only special seats of prominence in the meeting-house were the deacons' seat and <q direct="unspecified">the little pue under the pulpit.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>The latter was in full view of the congregation, but neither its occupant or the preacher were in sight of each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>Early the next year (<dateStruct value="1697--"><year reg="1697">1697</year></dateStruct>) the town voted to build a <q direct="unspecified">seatt</q> forward on each side the house, the front of said seats to be <q direct="unspecified">borded and battened . . . the front of the foreseatt and the seat on the women's side, to be built from the pue to the place left for stairs into a gallery; and the seat to be made on the men's side to reach from the deacons' seat or shorter, which is left to the discretion of the selectmen</q> and seating committee.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>Here we have an insight at the interior arrangement and plan of the ancient structure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/><q direct="unspecified">The pue</q> was what was later termed <q direct="unspecified">the little pue under the pulpit.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>the present <address><street n="High street">High street</street></address>. The foreseat joined the pulpit and little pew, and extended to the right and was a step higher than the main or <q direct="unspecified">lower flore.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>Then extending along the easterly side wall to within <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure> of the front corner was a platform <num value="1">one</num> step high, whose front was <q direct="unspecified">borded &amp; battened.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>This construction was less expensive than panel work, and formed a screen before the women's seats, as does that in the present <placeName reg="Unitarian church">Unitarian</placeName> and <placeName reg="West Medford Congregational church">West Medford Congregational Churches</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>This was on the women's side of the meeting-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>On the opposite, or men's side, a similar <q direct="unspecified">seatt</q> was built, only there was no foreseat, the space being occupied by the pulpit stairs and deacons' seat.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>How long it took to build the fore-gallery we may not know, but it had not been long in use when the town voted, on <dateStruct value="1700-01-31"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg="31">31</day>, <year reg="1700">1700</year></dateStruct>, <q direct="unspecified">that only <hi rend="italics">men</hi> should sit in the front gallery.</q>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>It is open to doubt whether the seat on the men's side, next the wall, was constructed in the same manner as the women's seat, as at this same town meeting it was directed that the seat where <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Hall,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0006.00035.00130" reg="mostcommon:Hall,Dudley,C.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr</roleName> <surname>Hall</surname></persName> and <persName n="Wyre,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0006.00035.00131" reg="mostcommon:Wyre,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr</roleName> <surname>Wyre</surname></persName> sits</q> should be built up the same as where the <q direct="unspecified">woman sits.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>That wasn't all, either.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>The <num value="2">two</num> back seats were to be taken out and the women were to be seated at each side, at the discretion of the <q direct="unspecified">committee to seat the town.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>This committee might seat the <hi rend="italics">town</hi>, but seating the <hi rend="italics">women</hi> was another matter, as we shall see later.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>The women were fond of ornament, even <measure n="200years" type="date">two hundred years</measure> ago, and the town had, in constructing <hi rend="italics">their</hi> front seat, had a row of nicely turned <q direct="unspecified">banesturs</q> placed along the top of the <q direct="unspecified">borded &amp; battened</q> front, forming a grille or screen of pretty effect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>Now the men had their innings, and it was voted the seat on the men's side should be built up the same as that on the women's, and be finished or ornamented likewise with <q direct="unspecified">banesturs,</q> and the town foot the bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/><pb id="p.36" n="36"/></p> 
<p>Well, the men might have their seats raised and their ornamental <hi rend="italics">banesturs</hi> if they liked, <hi rend="italics">but</hi> for the women to come down from their seats in the <hi rend="italics">fore-gallery</hi> was too much to be endured in silence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>The echoes of the indignant protest that the men of <placeName reg="Medford town">Medford town</placeName> heard in <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> come down to us in the vote of <dateStruct value="1700-03-03"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="3">3</day>, <year reg="1700">1700</year></dateStruct>, <q direct="unspecified">to part the front gallery in the midst, the <num value="1">one</num> halfe for men, and the other halfe for women <hi rend="italics">notwithstanding</hi> any former vote to the <hi rend="italics">Conterary</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>This momentous question settled, the pew of <persName n="Wade,Major,,,," id="n0334.0006.00036.00132" reg="nearbymention:Wade,Nathaniel,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Wade</surname></persName> claimed attention.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>Notice these extracts from the town records contain often the word <hi rend="italics">liberty</hi>. It is somewhat ominous and prophetic of the day that came <measure n="75years" type="date">seventy-five years</measure> later, when <persName n="Hall,Captain,,,," id="n0334.0006.00036.00136" reg="mostcommon:Hall,Dudley,C.,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Hall</surname></persName> and the <rs>Medford Minute Men</rs> marched up <address><street n="High street">High street</street></address> to <placeName reg="Lexington, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013888">Lexington</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>Another thing; the preciseness of the record and the detail of description furnish the data from which we are able to furnish a plan of <q direct="unspecified">ye Olde Metinghouse.</q>

<p>Accustomed to the drawing and use of plans as has been the writer, it seems fitting to present a plan of this ancient edifice that will agree with the ancient record book of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>The placing of certain families in these various pews seems not to have lessened the duties of the seating committee, for on <dateStruct value="1701-05-19"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="19">19</day>, <year reg="1701">1701</year></dateStruct>, Left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>At the next yearly meeting the question of alterations seems not to have come up; but the town had a reckoning with <persName n="Bradshaw,Ensign,John,,," id="n0334.0006.00037.00143" reg="default:Bradshaw,John,,,"><roleName n="Ensign">Ensign</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bradshaw</surname></persName>, and it was found that for labor performed and the minister's board, <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">from the beginning of the world unto this day</hi>,</q> there was due him (errors excepted) the sum of <measure n="16l." type="pounds">&pound; <num value="16">16</num></measure>, 16s, 6d.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>Everyone was expected to attend morning prayer in the schoolroom, but expectations were not always realized, the pupils residing at Mystic Mansion not liking the distance on a cold morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>We attended whatever church our parents desired, and were conveyed to and from the edifice in a brightly painted omnibus, with the name, <placeName reg="Mystic Hall Seminary">Mystic Hall Seminary</placeName>, lettered on the sides near the top.

<p>The course of study was composed as follows: <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, a preparatory course for young pupils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>And let me add here, that although the seminary was originally intended for what was termed a <q direct="unspecified">finishing school,</q> I read <q direct="unspecified">that so many young ladies presented themselves for finishing touches when the outlines of an education were not plainly discernible, it was thought best to receive the little misses, and ere long a class would graduate thoroughly educated, as well as elegant and graceful.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>The Intermediate and Collegiate Departments were divided into Freshman, Sophomore, Junior and Senior years; also an optional course and resident graduate course.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>I will add for the information of the younger, and perhaps some of the older ones present, to whom Grecian painting is unknown, that it was accomplished in the following manner: A steel engraving or lithograph was saturated with water and stretched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>When dry it was like a drumhead, and <pb id="p.57" n="57"/> was then varnished on the back until it became transparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>Oil paints were applied on the reverse, and no shading was necessary, that being supplied by the original.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>It was merely the coloring of a print to suit the fancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>It was an economical as well as rapid style of painting, as all the paint remaining on the palette was mixed together and used as background.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>A little touch of paint on the face of the picture was sometimes added, then a thin coat of varnish, and it was ready for the frame &mdash;or the rubbish pile, as <num value="1">one</num> chose.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>It is needless to say that lessons were memorized, by this I mean every word in geography or history must be letter perfect, particular stress being laid on rules in arithmetic and grammar; and a method was employed by a teacher in geography that I have never seen elsewhere, although it may have been used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>Very large maps were hung on the wall, and the teacher named the rivers, mountains, capes, or whatever might be the day's lesson, and pointed them out, while the pupils chanted them after her in a sing song rhythm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>This brings forcibly to mind the way we learned our multiplication table in the public school, each table being sung with a terminating <pb id="p.58" n="58"/> chorus of <q direct="unspecified"><num value="5">Five</num> times <num value="5">Five</num> is <num value="25">Twenty-five</num>,</q> to the air of <persName n="Doodle,,Yankee,,," id="n0334.0009.00058.00258" reg="default:Doodle,Yankee,,,"><foreName>Yankee</foreName> <surname>Doodle</surname></persName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>Then the order went forth that all young ladies who wished to be excused must ask before the dessert was served.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>I have already mentioned that there was a large, wellequipped gymnasium and bowling alley connected with the school, and the suits worn on those occasions were what were known as <q direct="unspecified">bloomers,</q> although some preferred to call them <q direct="unspecified">Turkish costumes.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>Those pupils boarding at Mystic Mansion were obliged to cross the railroad, and then take the wide walk through the field which led to the school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>During the noon hour a long frieght train used to switch off and back down the track opposite the mansion to wait for the <rs>Lowell</rs> express to pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>As there was a stringent rule that the pupils must not leave the seminary grounds without permission, the younger ones used to crawl under the cars, and it was quite a stump (I believe it is called <q direct="unspecified">stunt</q> now) to crawl under when we could hear the clink as each car began to move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>What saved us from mutilated limbs I do not know, unless it was the same cherub that used to sit up aloft and look out for the life of poor <persName n="Jack,,,,," id="n0334.0009.00058.00259" reg="mostcommon:Jack,nomatch:0"><surname>Jack</surname></persName>, said cherub no longer being needed in these days of steam.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>All these minor societies were eclipsed by the <rs>Mystic Alliance</rs>, which included all that were eligible by age, sometimes otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>At the end of the term (there were <num value="2">two</num> terms in the year) there was a reunion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>I saw in the <rs>Medford</rs> paper to which I have referred, a copy of an order of exercises <pb id="p.60" n="60"/> which you probably all read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>These exercises commenced at <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>Then came award of prizes, given by some of the visiting committee, and the presentation of a gold medal to each graduate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>If the reunion came in <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>, and the weather permitted, a collation was served under the trees in the garden, and a number of pupils showed their proficiency in horsemanship.
