<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>The Register has recently presented <num value="2">two</num> interesting articles relative to <placeName>Medford</placeName>'s water supply and its distribution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>No elaborate system of great central reservoir and underground pipes conveys the lacteal fluid to our kitchen; it is still delivered by the pint or quart by a hurrying man or boy, as in the olden days, and the business is now ably conducted by a few well-known people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>When <placeName>Medford</placeName> was a farming town, as in the old time, ere the rise of ship-building, more butter and cheese was made and less milk sold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>With its increased population and the growing city of <placeName reg="Boston">Boston</placeName> there came a market for milk, and the business increased accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>The wagon business felt its influence, also, and Medford-built milk wagons were in demand, because of their excellent and thorough workmanship.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/><num value="75">Seventy-five</num> cans of <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> <num value="8">eight</num> quarts each was the usual quantity he delivered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The milkmen usually wore a long blue frock, and jumped from the wagon steps with big can in <num value="1">one</num> hand and a tin quart measure in the other, leaving the horse, who had learned the route, to stop at his own sweet will, which depended somewhat upon the proximity of the next customer's house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>In cold weather that quart measure varied a little as the mercury lowered toward zero, doubtless adding to the milkman's profits, and some canny housewives were known to kindly furnish some boiling water before receiving their daily supply, thriftily saving the mixture obtained for the family pig,&mdash;perhaps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Beside the kitchen door was the printed <q direct="unspecified">milk score,</q> with blank spaces numbered up to <num value="31">thirty-one</num>, in which the milkman marked any <q direct="unspecified">extra milk</q> supplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Among <persName n="Ober,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00006" reg="nearbymention:Ober,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ober</surname></persName>'s customers was the famous <placeName reg="Mystic Hall Seminary">Mystic Hall Seminary</placeName>, though it had a few cows of its own. The price at that time was <measure n="5cents" type="currency">five cents</measure> per quart, but during the war rose to <measure n="12cents" type="currency">twelve cents</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>No inconsiderable number of householders kept cows of their own and supplied a neighbor or <num value="2">two</num> with milk.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The writer recalls his own experience, in the early morning of his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of housekeeping, of going to a neighbor <measure n="0.25mile" type="distance">a quarter mile</measure> away (<placeName reg="West Medford">West Medford</placeName> was thinly settled then), pitcher in hand, ere breakfast for <num value="2">two</num> was served.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The <measure n="4cents" type="currency">four cents</measure> paid for that pint of milk was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> item (after the parson's fee) of his household expense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Before evening a regular supply was engaged from another neighbor who had, besides a cow, several boys who distributed the surplus of milk on their way to school.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>After a few years we, too, found a cow&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">a good thing to have in the family,</q> which had increased somewhat&mdash; and also supplied some neighbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Several others did likewise, till there came to be too much quarrel over the free pasturage we depended on, and we reluctantly parted with old <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Brindle,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00007" reg="mostcommon:Brindle,nomatch:0"><surname>Brindle</surname></persName>,</q> and called in the regular milkman again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>This was in <dateStruct value="1880--"><year reg="1880">1880</year></dateStruct>, when more than a dozen cows <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> might have been seen tethered by a long rope or chain on the vacant land between <address><street n="Boston Avenue">Boston Avenue</street></address> and the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Our own experience was, doubtless, like that of others, and as more houses were built the family cow (and pig as well) was crowded out.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Now nobody sees the quart measures of those days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>After a time the practice of leaving each customer's supply in a small can came in vogue, and this is superseded by the glass bottles, with dealer's name, and of duly prescribed size, all according to law.</p>
