<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Who can ever forget the stirring scene as the enemy gallantly debouched from the woods on that day, brigade front, moving across the open ground to attack, colors flying and men cheering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Our young commander rode slowly up and down his line, his glorious boyish face flushing through its bronze, his voice deep with the joy of hotly-impending fight, speaking briefly to each battery-commander: <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, shoot the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> man who pulls a lanyard before I raise my sabre as the signal.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Can you ever forget how he waited and waited until the enemy seemed almost in the guns&mdash;then his sabre flashed suddenly and swiftly in the air, and the double canister tore with dreadful accuracy through the cheering lines which seemed to fall as <num value="1">one</num> man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Yet <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> time did these gallant fellows attempt to reach the heights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Then it was that the men of this Battalion, seized as it were by a sort of delirium of disdainful daring, dropping sponge-staff and lanyard, sprang upon the parapets and bade them <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">Come on</hi></q> with such a roar of defiance that the whole attacking line, without a shot being fired on our side, broke and fled under that fierce yell which no man ever yet heard unmoved on the field of battle.&mdash;Yet, once more, comrades, it seems but yesterday that as <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0271.0002.00007.00018" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,:2"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> attempted to force the passage of the <rs>North Anna</rs>, following this flag we galloped into action at <placeName reg="Jericho Ford">Jericho Ford</placeName>, all <num value="20">twenty</num> guns, with cannoneers mounted, while the men of <persName n="Heth,,Harry,,," id="n0271.0002.00007.00019" reg="default:Heth,Harry,,,"><foreName>Harry</foreName> <surname>Heth</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="division">division</orgName>, on whose front we came into battery, roared out their rough soldier's greeting with <q direct="unspecified">make way, men, make way right and left, <hi rend="italics">here comes the fighting Battalion</hi>!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Infantry is a term of somewhat recent date.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/><pb id="p.30" n="30"/></p> 
<p>And splendid illustrations of the courage, the endurance and the patriotism of man have these infantry soldiers given on the historic battle-fields of Earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>Besides the sickness which was decimating our ranks, we were now greatly troubled by <num value="1">one</num> of the most unjust and unwise measures of the <rs>Confederate Congress</rs>&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">An act for organizing battalions of sharpshooters.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>This law, according to <persName n="Pemberton,General,,,," id="n0271.0003.00036.00308" reg="mostcommon:Pemberton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pemberton</surname></persName>'s construction of it, provided that details should be made of men, without their consent, for the purpose of organizing battalions of <q direct="unspecified">sharpshooters,</q> the officers of which were to be appointed on the recommendation of division or department commanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>The men felt that Congress had acted in bad faith towards them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>They had enlisted under laws which guaranteed to them the right to select their own organizations and elect their own officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>It was thought that the law was made in the interest of young aspirants for office, who lacked the ability to secure promotion by their merits and the choice of the soldiers they were to command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>Men were to be torn from their comrades, friends, neighbors and officers of their choice, and turned over to the tender mercies of strangers whose ability for command was untried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>Earnest protests and expostulations were made at headquarters by regimental and battalion commanders generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>A deaf ear was turned to their entreaties for justice to the men of their commands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>Every regiment in the department was invaded, <pb id="p.37" n="37"/> and where volunteers could not be obtained [and very few were found willing to go] compulsory details were required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>The mistake consisted in allowing compulsory details, which had not been contemplated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>But it seemed as if the <rs>General</rs> was afraid that he could not get volunteers enough to provide places for his favorites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>He was utterly regardless of the entreaties of the men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>This quota was divided among the <num value="10">ten</num> companies in a manner as just as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>Each captain was directed to name the men to be detailed from his company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>The law contemplated a select organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>The captains determined that it should be select (?). Every <num value="1">one</num> who had a worthless fellow in his company detailed him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>This was done, and the captain detailed the <num value="2">two</num> successful candidates (?). In another company a purse was raised by contribution and <num value="2">two</num> men were hired to volunteer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>The attack was to be made before morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>Our engineers had never contemplated the possibility of attack from that direction, and had constructed no defences of any kind on the water front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>The creek, which runs by the peninsula on which the village was built, reaches for <num value="40">forty</num> or <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> to the high land and then recedes very gradually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>There is nothing by way of defence between us and the enemy at night except a boat picket of <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> men. But for this notice of the intention of the enemy to move on us, such an attack as had been planned would almost certainly have been successful if made with boldness and energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>The enemy could have formed along our water front almost as quickly as our troops could have been gotten under arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>If our boat pickets could have been secured so that no alarm would have been given we might have been taken completely by surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>As soon as the information was received I assembled <pb id="p.57" n="57"/> the regiment and made known to them what was expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>We applied to the engineers for intrenching tools, but it was found impossible to supply us, in time for the emergency, with more than <num value="1">one</num> spade for every <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>The men worked with a will, as soldiers always do when they believe that they, and not some other command, will fight behind the works which they are set to constructing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>The spades were kept busy, the men relieved each other at short intervals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>By thus recognizing the responsibility of rulers to their subjects for the due execution of their trusts, and the right of resistance by the people in case of abuse thereof, he established the sacred right of revolution, in the assertion of which the people of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> expelled the <name>Stuarts</name> from the throne, and the <rs>American</rs> colonies established their independence.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>On emerging from a revolution in which their rights of selfgov-ernment had been so strenuously denied, in which they had endured such sufferings and perils, and had so narrowly escaped from complete subjugation, it might naturally be expected that in thereafter establishing a general government among themselves, the colonies would have been careful in guarding the nature and terms of their consent thereto and in leaving open a safe and peaceful mode of retiring there from, whenever, in their judgment, it should endanger their rights or cease to promote their welfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>The question of the right of secession had its birth prior to the formation of the present <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>Those articles, let it never be forgotten, contained an express provision that the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">Union of the States</orgName> created thereby should be <q direct="unspecified">perpetual.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>In view of this clause, it was vehemently contended that, without the consent of all, <pb id="p.72" n="72"/> no portion of the <name>States</name> had the right to withdraw from a Union which all of them had solemnly covenanted with each other should last forever.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>These objections were overborne by the <rs>Convention</rs> of <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>, and the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> had its origin in the assertion of the right of the <name>States</name> to secede from the confederation previously existing; for the going into effect of that Constitution was, by its terms, made to depend, not upon the assent of all the <name>States</name>, but upon the assent of <num value="9">nine</num> only, each <num value="1">one</num> of them acting separately and independently.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/></p> 
<p>I must halt here in the enumeration of the plain historical facts and overwhelming authorities upon which rested the great doctrine that the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> was purely a federal compact between sovereign and independent States, deriving its force and authority from the free and individual consent of the several States in their separate political capacities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>In these essential respects it did not differ from the articles of confederation, but only, as before stated, in the extent and mode of execution of the powers granted to the general government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1020"/>The entire argument against the right of secession rested on a denial of this doctrine.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1021"/>That denial was never made by any respectable authority until, during the nullification and agitation of <dateStruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">3</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0271.0004.00074.00528" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Charles,L.,,:1"><surname>Webster</surname></persName> and Story stepped into the lists as champions of an indissoluble Union.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/>These were great men and great lawyers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>They saw, and indeed a reference to their works will show that they admitted that, if the doctrine above stated was correct, the right of secession could not be successfully disputed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/>They therefore took bold ground against it. They denied that the <rs>Constitution</rs> was a compact at all. They denied that, even if a compact, it was <num value="1">one</num> to which the <name>States</name> were the parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/>They asserted <pb id="p.75" n="75"/> that the government created thereby was a National, and not a Federal Government They asserted that the <rs>Constitution</rs> was ordained and established by the consent, not of the <name>States</name>, but of <q direct="unspecified">the whole people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in the aggregate,</q> and could only be undone by like consent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>In view of the historical record which I have faintly sketched, and which might have been indefinitely extended, the mind is stupefied at the utter impotence of human language as a vehicle of thought, when it encounters such opposite interpretations of a written instrument, and discovers that after the lapse of <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure>, time sufficient to have consigned to their tombs nearly every <num value="1">one</num> of those who had aided in its confection, a construction should be advanced diametrically opposed to what they had declared, in every form, to be their veritable meaning.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>Of course, it would not be possible for me, within the limits of this address, to state all the arguments advanced by <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0271.0004.00075.00529" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Charles,L.,,:1"><surname>Webster</surname></persName> and Story in support of their theory, or the answers made to them; but <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of the most salient deserve attention.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>To show that the government was National and not Federal, they seized upon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> resolution adopted by the convention, which declared that a <q direct="unspecified">National Government ought to be established, consisting of a supreme legislative, executive and judiciary.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>This resolution was proposed before the convention was full; and how shall we restrain our wonder at the reliance placed upon it, when, in the record of the further proceedings of the convention, we learn that, upon motion of <persName n="Ellsworth,,,,," id="n0271.0004.00075.00530" reg="mostcommon:Ellsworth,nomatch:0"><surname>Ellsworth</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Connecticut" key="tgn,7007159">Connecticut</placeName>, and upon his expressed objection to the term <q direct="unspecified">National,</q> the resolution was altered, <hi rend="italics">nem</hi>. <hi rend="italics">con</hi>., so as to read that <q direct="unspecified">the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> ought to consist,</q> etc. Thus the convention expressly repudiated the term <q direct="unspecified">National Government,</q> and substituted therefor words expressive of the <rs>Federal</rs> character of the government; and indeed, as already shown in the letter recommending the ratification of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, the convention expressly described it as the <q direct="unspecified">Federal Government of these States.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/></p> 
<p>The grand <hi rend="italics">cheval de battaille</hi> of their argument, however, was the preamble of the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself, which declares that <q direct="unspecified">We, the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>* * * * * * ordain and establish this Constitution for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States of America</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/></p> 
<p>There is no doubt that these words, more than all other considerations combined, have lent force to the argument of those who supported the <rs>National</rs> theory of the government, and had the plain <pb id="p.76" n="76"/> explanation of their use, which has since been given, been advanced at the time when the question arose, it is doubtful if that theory would ever have attained the acceptation which it received.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>What is that explanation, so apparent and conclusive, and yet, so far as I am aware, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> advanced after the war by that great publicist, <persName n="Bledsoe,,Albert,Taylor,," id="n0271.0004.00076.00531" reg="default:Bledsoe,Albert,Taylor,,"><foreName>Albert</foreName> <foreName>Taylor</foreName> <surname>Bledsoe</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>It is this: The original draft of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, instead of using in its preamble the words <q direct="unspecified">We, the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>,</q> used the words <q direct="unspecified">We, the people of the <name>States</name> of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>,</q> etc., specifying each State by name as parties to the compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>So matters stood until the language of the <rs>Constitution</rs> was submitted to the revision of a <q direct="unspecified">committee on style.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>That committee discovered that under the provisions relative to the mode of ratification which directed that the accession of any <num value="9">nine</num> States should carry the <rs>Constitution</rs> into effect, the naming of all or any of the <name>States</name> in the preamble was impracticable, because it might well be that all the <name>States</name> would not ratify, and it would be impossible to state in advance which <num value="9">nine</num> of them would do so. How, then, were they to be named?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1036"/>It thus became absolutely necessary to strike out the enumeration of the <name>States</name>, and to substitute some general phrase which should embrace those States which should ratify and exclude those which should reject the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/>Such a phrase was discovered in the words, <q direct="unspecified">the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>,</q> by which the convention surely did not intend to alter the entire nature of the instrument, but only meant the respective peoples of the several States, not named only because unknown, which should thereafter become parties, and by consenting to the proposed Union, become thereby <hi rend="italics">United</hi> States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1052"/>In union the sails of their commerce whitened every sea, wealth poured in affluent streams into their laps, education flourished, science and art took root and grew apace, and those ancient foes, religion and toleration, liberty and law, public order and individual freedom, locked hands and worked together to magnify and glorify the grandest, happiest and freest people that ever flourished <q direct="unspecified">in the tides of time.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1624"/>When the original <num value="13">thirteen</num> colonies threw off their allegiance to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, they became independent States, <q direct="unspecified">independent of her and of each other,</q> as the great <rs>Luther Martin</rs> expressed it in the <rs>Federal Convention</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1627"/>And that this separate recognition was deliberate and intentional, with the distinct object of recognizing the <name>States</name> as separate sovereignties, and not as <num value="1">one</num> nation, will sufficiently appear by reference to the <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> volume of <persName n="Bancroft,,,,," id="n0271.0006.00121.01263" reg="mostcommon:Bancroft,nomatch:0"><surname>Bancroft</surname></persName>'s <hi rend="italics">History of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1629"/>And it was by this ratification that the <rs>Constitution</rs> was established, to use its own words, <q direct="unspecified">between the <name>States</name> so ratifying the same.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1630"/>It is then a compact between the <name>States</name> as sovereigns, and the <rs>Union</rs> created by it is a federal partnership of States, the <rs>Federal Government</rs> being their common agent for the transaction of the <rs>Federal</rs> business within the limits of the delegated powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1631"/>As to the new States, which have been formed from time to time from the territories, when they were in the territorial condition, the sovereignty over them, respectively, was in the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Union</rs>, and when <pb id="p.122" n="122"/> they, respectively, formed a constitution and State government and were admitted into the <rs>Union</rs>, the sovereignty passed to them respectively, and they stood in the <rs>Union</rs> each upon an equal footing with the original States, parties with them to the constitutional compact.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1632"/>In the case of a partnership between persons for business purposes, it is a familiar principle of law, that its existence and continuance are purely a voluntary matter on the part of its members, and that a member may at any time withdraw from and dissolve the partnership at his pleasure; and it makes no difference in the application of this principle if the partnership, by its terms, be for a fixed time or perpetual&mdash;it not being considered by the law sound policy to hold men together in business association against their will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1633"/>Now if a partnership between persons is purely voluntary and subject to the will of its members severally, how much more so is <num value="1">one</num> between sovereign States; and it follows that, just as each State separately, in the exercise of its sovereign will, entered the <rs>Union</rs>, so may it separately, in the exercise of that will, withdraw there from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1634"/>And further, the <rs>Constitution</rs> being a compact, to which the <name>States</name> are parties, <q direct="unspecified">having no common judge,</q> <q direct="unspecified">each party has an equal right to judge for itself as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress,</q> as declared by <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n0271.0006.00122.01264" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Madison,Mister,,,," id="n0271.0006.00122.01265" reg="mostcommon:Madison,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Madison</surname></persName>, in the celebrated resolutions of &lsquo;<num value="98">98</num>, and the right of secession irresistibly follows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1635"/>But aside from the doctrine either of partnership or compact, upon the ground of State sovereignty, pure and simple, does the right of State secession impregnably rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1636"/>Sovereignty, as defined by political commentators, is <q direct="unspecified">the right of commanding in the last resort.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1637"/>And just as a State of the <rs>Union</rs>, in the exercise of this right, by her ratification of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, delegated the powers therein given to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and acceded to the <rs>Union</rs>; so may she in the exercise of the same right, by repealing that ratification, withdraw the delegated powers, and secede from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1638"/>The act of ratification by the <rs>State</rs> is the law which makes the <rs>Union</rs> for it, and the act of repeal of that ratification is the law which dissolves it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1639"/>It appears, then, from this review of the origin and character of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>, that when the <rs>Southern States</rs>, deeming the constitutional compact broken, and their own safety and happiness in imminent danger in the <rs>Union</rs>, withdrew therefrom and organized their new Confederacy, they but asserted, in the language of <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0271.0006.00122.01266" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, <q direct="unspecified">the rights of their sires, won in the war of the <name>Revolution</name>, <pb id="p.123" n="123"/> the <rs>State</rs> sovereignty, freedom and independence which were left to us as an inheritance to their posterity forever</q> and it was in defence of this high and sacred cause that the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldiers sacrificed their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1640"/>There was no need for war. The action of the <rs>Southern States</rs> was legal and constitutional, and history will attest that it was reluctantly taken in the last extremity, in the hope of thereby saving their whole constitutional rights and liberties from destruction by Northern aggression, which had just culminated in triumph at the presidential election, by the <orgName n="North Union" type="union">union of the North</orgName> as a section against the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1641"/>But the <rs>North</rs>, left in possession of the old government of the <rs>Union</rs>, flushed with power, and angry lest its destined prey should escape, found a ready pretext for war. Immediately upon secession, by force of the act itself, the jurisdiction of the seceding States respectively, over the forts, arsenals, and dockyards within their limits, which they had before ceded to the <rs>Federal Government</rs> for federal purposes, reverted to and reinvested in them respectively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1642"/>They were of course entitled to immediate repossession of these places, essential to their defence in the exercise of their reassumed powers of war and peace, leaving all questions of mere property value apart for separate adjustment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1643"/>In most cases the seceding States repossessed themselves of these places without difficulty; but in some the forces of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> still kept possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1644"/>Among these last was <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, in the harbor of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston, South Carolina</placeName>. <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> in vain demanded the peaceful possession of this fortress, offering at the same time to arrange for the value of the same as property, and sent commissioners to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 5" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> to treat with the <rs>Federal Government</rs> for the same, as well as for the recognition of her independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1646"/>Of course the <rs>Confederacy</rs> could not continue to allow a foreign power to hold possession of a fortress dominating the harbor of her chief Atlantic seaport; and the <rs>Federal Government</rs> having sent a powerful expedition with reinforcements for <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> at last proceeded to reduce it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1651"/>The odds in numbers and means in favor of the <rs>North</rs> were tremendous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1652"/>Her white population of nearly <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num> was fourfold that of the strictly Confederate territory; and from the border Southern States and communities of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">West Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Delaware" key="tgn,7007239">Delaware</placeName>, she got more men and supplies for her armies than the <rs>Confederacy</rs> got for hers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1656"/>Again, the <rs>North</rs>, as a manufacturing and mechanical people, abounded in factories and workshops of every kind, immediately available for the manufacture of every species of supplies for the army and navy; while the <rs>South</rs>, as an agricultural people, were almost wanting in such resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1657"/>Finally, in the possession of the recognized government, the <rs>North</rs> was in full and free communication withall nations, and had full opportunity, which she improved to the utmost, to import and bring in from abroad not only supplies of all kinds, but men as well for her service; while the <rs>South</rs>, without a recognized government, and with her ports speedily blockaded by the <rs>Federal</rs> navy, <pb id="p.125" n="125"/> was almost entirely shut up within herself and her own limited re sources.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>That arm of her strength was at the beginning of the war in an efficient state, and it was rapidly augmented and improved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/>By it, the <rs>South</rs> being almost without naval force, the <rs>North</rs> was enabled to sweep and blockade her coasts everywhere, and so, aside from the direct distress inflicted, to prevent foreign recognition; to capture, <num value="1">one</num> after another, her seaports; to sever and cut up her country in every direction through its great rivers; to gain lodgments at many points within her territory, from which numerous destructive raids were sent out in all directions; to transport troops and supplies to points where their passage by land would have been difficult or impossible; and finally to cover, protect and save, as by the navy was so often done, the defeated and otherwise totally destroyed armies of the <rs>North</rs> in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1664"/>Few great established nations in all time have ever exhibited capacity and direction in government equal to hers, sustained as she was by the iron will and fixed persistence of the extraordinary man who was her chief; and few have ever won such a series of brilliant victories as that which illuminates forever the annals of her splendid armies, while the fortitude and patience of her people, and particularly of her noble women, under almost incredible trials and sufferings, have never been surpassed in the history of the world.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>Here, in the <rs>North</rs>, that is naturally presumptuous and arrogant in her vast material power, and where consequently but little attention has, in general, been given to the study of the nature and principles of constitutional liberty, as connected with the rights of States, there is, nevertheless, an increasing understanding and appreciation of the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause, particularly here in the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States, whose position and interests in the <rs>Union</rs> are, in many respects, peculiar, and perhaps require that these States, quite as much as those of the <rs>South</rs>, should be the watchful guardians of the <rs>State</rs> sovereignty.

Hitherto there has been no effort made to popularize the navy, our officers, trained in an illustrious and exclusive service, have looked with a feeling akin to contempt on both the praise and blame of the periodical press, hence the only records of the navy are to be found in dry and terse official dispatches, exceedingly uninteresting to unprofessional readers, and unintelligible to the great mass of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1814"/>From <persName n="Gorgas,General,,,," id="n0271.0008.00138.01325" reg="mostcommon:Gorgas,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gorgas</surname></persName>'s paper, already referred to, we find that the total capacity of the department for the manufacture of infantry ammunition was about <num value="0.5">a half</num> a round a day to the man, or in other words <num value="45">forty-five</num> rounds per man in <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1815"/>Hence the consumption of ammunition in camp, and while the army was doing no serious fighting, appeared to be more than half the capacity of our arsenals to supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1816"/>This large waste of ammunition came from the want of care exercised in camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1817"/>Many soldiers thought of their cartridge-boxes only when about to go into battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1818"/>Little care was taken by many of them in camp to prevent their cartridges from getting wet; indeed cartridge-boxes were often cut up to mend shoes, and the question of ammunition left to be decided when an emergency for its use arose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1819"/>In some regiments the good discipline of the line officers prevented or checked this waste, as it did the throwing away of bayonets, &amp;c., but in a great number of cases the regimental discipline of officers not trained originally to war was loose in regard to these matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>To correct the evil, a system of reports was prepared, by which the exact condition of the ordnance in the hands of the men was obtained every <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure>, and the difference between the present and the preceding reports had to be accounted for, even down to every round of ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1821"/>Orders were issued from army headquarters providing for the inspections on which these reports were to be based, and also directing that all damage to ammunition, arms, and equipments, due to carelessness or neglect, should be charged against the men or officers who were to blame; the sum to be deducted on their next pay roll.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/>In this way the soldier was held to a strict responsibility for the property in his possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>If he broke or threw away his bayonet, or cut up his cartridge-box, or fired away his ammunition when not in battle, or allowed it to spoil, he was made to pay for it, and so frequent and exact were the inspections that there was little room for escape from the penalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/>It often seemed hard to charge such damages against the poor pittances which the private soldier received in depreciated currency, but in this as in many other cases the exigencies of the situation would not admit of the neglect or mild enforcement of this regulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/>This system of reports, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> adopted in the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>, was extended through the agency of <persName n="Gorgas,General,,,," id="n0271.0008.00139.01326" reg="mostcommon:Gorgas,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gorgas</surname></persName> to the other armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1826"/>The results were quite marked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2391"/>To him the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName> was not the territory over which the flag floated and the laws were administered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2392"/><pb id="p.176" n="176"/> It was a system of government embracing a general government for general purposes, and local governments for local purposes, each like the spheres in the heavens, to be confined to its own orbit, and neither could invade the domain of the other without chaos and ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2393"/>In the solution of all problems, in the discussion of all questions, in the shaping of all policies, he looked to the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2394"/>As the fierceness of the storm only intensifies the gaze of the mariner on the star that shall lead him out of darkness and danger, so the greater the peril the more earnestly he contended for the principles of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2395"/>He regarded the <rs>American</rs> system of government as the wisest ever devised by the wisdom of men, guided by a beneficent <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> which seemed to have chosen them for the highest achievements of the race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2396"/>He esteemed it not only for his own, but for all people the greatest production of man, the richest gift of heaven except the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> and Christianity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2397"/>But to him the <name>States</name> were as much a part of that system as the general government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2398"/>His indissoluble union was composed of indestructible States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2399"/>He opposed sectionalism under any guise, and from any quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2400"/>As long as it spoke the truth, he honored and loved the flag of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2401"/>For so long, wherever it floated, from the dome of the <rs>National Capitol</rs> at home, or under foreign skies; leading the armies of the <rs>Republic</rs> to deeds of highest valor in war, or signalizing the peaceful pursuits of commerce; at all times and everywhere, at home or abroad, on the land and on the sea, in peace or war, its stripes uttered <num value="1">one</num> voice&mdash;of good will to its friends and proud defiance to its enemies&mdash;while the stars that glittered upon its ample folds told of free and equal States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2402"/>Thus looking at it he could exclaim with patriotic fervor: Flag of the <rs>Union</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2403"/>Wave on, wave ever; wave over the great and prosperous North; wave over the thrifty and historic East; wave over the young and expanding West; wave over our own South, until the <rs>Union</rs> shall be so firmly planted in the hearts of all the people that no internecine war shall break our peace, no sectionalism shall disturb our harmony!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2404"/>Flag of the free!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2405"/>Wave on, until the nations looking upon thee shall catch the contagion of freedom; wave on until the light of knowledge illumines every mind, the fires of liberty burn in every breast, the fetters fall from every limb, the bonds are loosed from every conscience, and every son of earth and angel of heaven rejoices in the universal emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2406"/>There never was a time in his distinguished career when he would not have arrested and stricken down any arm lifted against that flag speaking the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2407"/>But he would have it wave <pb id="p.177" n="177"/> over <q direct="unspecified">States, not provinces; over freemen, not slaves;</q> and there never was a time when flaunting a lie, by whomsoever borne, he would not have despised and trampled upon it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2408"/>Though loyal to <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and the <rs>South</rs> during the period of separation, he rejoiced at their restoration to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2409"/>No mariner tossed through long nights on unchosen and tempestuous seas ever hailed the day of return to tranquil port more gladly than he hailed the day of the restoration of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2410"/>No son driven by fortunes he could not control from the paternal roof, ever left that roof with sadder parting than he left the <rs>Union</rs>, or returned from the storms without to the shelter of home with wilder transport of joy than he felt when the <rs>South</rs> was again admitted to <q direct="unspecified">our <placeName reg="Father's house">Father's house</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2414"/>Wisely appreciating this principle after the admission of the true representatives of the people in Congress, with voice and pen, he devoted all the powers of his great mind, and all the impulses of his patriotic heart, to the re-establishment of that cordial respect and good feeling between the sections upon which alone our American system, more than all others, depends for permanent union and peace.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2740"/>They rushed forward in companies, and were organized into regiments after reaching <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and often in the face of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2741"/>It was the assembling by clans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2742"/>The young men of a neighborhood formed themselves together into a company at the call of some <num value="1">one</num> who had been a leader in the community; the company was in fact but a representative part of the community from which it came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2743"/>A letter from home to any individual member was of interest to all. The neighborhood news was of equal concern to the captain as to the humblest private, and the box from home was sure to be shared in common.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2744"/>The casualties of battle affected the whole community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2745"/>Though the member or members of <num value="1">one</num> family escaped in any engagement, there was no room for joy, for death was sure to have been among some of their neighbors.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2748"/>Every private, as well as every officer, fought every engagement in the presence, as it were, of his home people, and he could not afford to disgrace them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2749"/>This was the great incentive, no doubt, to the extraordinary perseverance and patience of our soldiers amidst the greatest privation, as well as of the individual valor of men who could hope for no particular notice in orders or reports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2750"/><pb id="p.203" n="203"/></p> 
<p>But while this clanship organization doubtless had its great advantages it was not without its evils, and chief among these was the disproportionate consequence of the captains during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> part of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2751"/>The captain was the great man. He was the head of a family of a community, of a part of the same community he had left behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2752"/>To him had been committed, by their fathers and mothers, the tender boys who had gone out with him&mdash;boys who had never been away from home before&mdash;and who he was charged to look after as his own children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2753"/>How he did this, what he did and said, and how he behaved, whether he was kind and gentle, or cross, and how he took care of his men, was sure to be known at home, and talked over at the firesides, as the family sat through the long winter evenings thinking of how the boys were suffering in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2754"/>The colonel and other field officers were scarcely of as much consequence, even though they did ride, while the captain walked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2755"/>This at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was the source of some trouble in camp, and led naturally to some insubordination, and when it did not go to that extent, at least for some time impaired the regimental discipline.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2756"/>As an illustration of the false view of the character of the company organization in the formation of an army, let me remind you of the multitude of company colors with which we went to war. A stand of colors was presented to every company almost, before it left home, and brave and glorious were the pledges given that it should wave on the bloody fields in advance of all others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2757"/>But they were soon all sent ignominiously to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2758"/>The Southern cross&mdash;the <rs>Confederate</rs> battle flag&mdash;we found quite enough to follow and to guard.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2759"/>So, too, each company came into service with a name which the members did not doubt they would make immortal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2760"/>A collection of these names would form an interesting chapter in the history of our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2761"/>There were of course the <orgName n="Washington Artillery" type="artillery">Washington Artillery</orgName>, from New Orleans, and the <rs>Washington</rs> <orgName type="mil" key="Light">Light Infantry</orgName>, from <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, and Jefferson Guards innumerable, and so on.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2762"/>In our own regiment (<orgName type="regiment" key="1SCVolunteer"><persName n="Gregg,,,,," id="n0271.0013.00203.01803" reg="nearbymention:Gregg,Maxey,,,"><surname>Gregg</surname></persName>'s First South Carolina volunteers</orgName>) we had <num value="1">one</num> company from <persName n="Horry,,,,," id="n0271.0013.00203.01804" reg="mostcommon:Horry,nomatch:0"><surname>Horry</surname></persName> district, which boldly assumed the title of <q direct="unspecified">Rebels</q>&mdash;the <q direct="unspecified">Horry Rebels</q>&mdash;and the <name>Huguenot</name> name of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>'s <pb id="p.204" n="204"/> lieutenant of Revolutionary story, was soon disrespectfully, if not abbreviated, at least changed, into <q direct="unspecified">Horrid Rebels,</q> which the company bore with great complacency until it became <orgName type="company" n="Company F">company F</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2887"/>Our system of battle required too much exposure of our officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2888"/>Our officers had to lead rather than to direct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2889"/>It was example and not order so much by which our troops were guided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2890"/>And undoubtedly it was fearfully expensive in officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2891"/>Again and again regiments, and sometimes even brigades, came out of battle under subalterns Had our men been better drilled many valuable officers might have been spared to have devised, guided and directed subsequent battles.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2892"/>A distinguished Federal officer, who has frequently discussed this matter with me, has constantly maintained that in fact the troops of our army were better disciplined than their's.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2893"/>Our system of recruiting was certainly wiser than that of the <rs>Federals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2894"/><pb id="p.213" n="213"/> At each call for more troops the <rs>Governors</rs> of the <rs>Northern States</rs> insisted upon furnishing them in new organizations&mdash;regiments, batteries, &amp;c. They would not forego the patronage of the appointment of the new officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2895"/>The result was that there was little or no veteran element in their new regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2896"/>With us, on the contrary, no new regiments were allowed after the reorganization in the spring of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2897"/>Volunteers and conscripts, as they came in, were assigned to the existing regiments, and soon assimilated with the veterans around them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2898"/>The <hi rend="italics">esprit de corps</hi> was thus preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2899"/>There were no regiments without histories and reputations to be preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2900"/>They carried on their colors the battles in which they had been engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2901"/>The system, too, of brigading our troops by States added greatly to their <hi rend="italics">esprit de corps</hi>, and the permanency of our division and corps organization had a most salutary effect in this direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3284"/>The last scene has closed upon an illustrious life, a life fraught with lessons of wisdom to the old, and with inspiration to the young of this generation The earth opens this day to receive in its bosom the most precious treasure which has been left to our bereft and stricken people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3285"/>The great and good man, whose name has so long been a household word in our land, goes to take his place among the silent congregation of the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3286"/>Until the day breaks, and the shadows flee away, he is buried from our sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3287"/>His presence is lost to us; but not his heroic virtues and the brilliant deeds which have given his name to history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3288"/>Stars have been extinguished in the sky whose light continues to travel through space and linger in our sight; and in the sphere of humanity there are examples of men so elevated above this world <pb id="p.246" n="246"/> that when they have ceased to live here they have not ceased to shine; their presence abides with us, and the radiance of their life remains to cheer and bless the world they have forsaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3289"/>The lamented friend whom we commemorate to-day was <num value="1">one</num> of this race of heroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3290"/>His life is an enduring inheritance to his country and to the <orgName n="Christ Church" type="church">church of Christ</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3291"/>Personally, he was a man of rare gifts, physical and mental.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3292"/>To these were added the advantages of finished culture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3293"/><placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> had endowed him for a career of distinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3294"/>The descendant of an honored house&mdash;allied by marriage to the family of our great <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 5" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>&mdash;he reflected in his character the ennobling influence of his early associations with the great and good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3295"/>Habits of temperance, frugality, industry, self-control, formed in youth, adhered to him through life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3296"/>With every temptation to luxury, he was an example of moderation; with every incentive to pride and ambition, his tastes were restrained within the limits of an elegant simplicity; and his whole life was <num value="1">one</num> of profound submission to the duties of the hour.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3297"/>The profession of arms which he had chosen was not likely to make him conspicuous during the reign of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3298"/>But his great mind had already asserted its power, and won for him a proud distinction among his cotemporaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3299"/>Indeed, his reputation was such at that period that when this institution was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> projected, upon a scale of grandeur commensurate with the circumstances which gave it birth, the attention of its founders was directed to him, and the wish was unanimous to make him the head of the institution, to usher it into life, and preside over its destiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3300"/><placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> had chosen for him another sphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3301"/>It is reserved for the convulsions of society to form heroes, as convulsions in nature produce mountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3302"/>The late war, so destructive of everything else, was fruitful in deeds of heroism almost without parallel in history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3303"/>Conspicuous above all others in that momentous struggle was your departed chieftain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3304"/>A great man was required, and great spirits were ready to gather around him. In what temper of mind he entered into this contest, I can speak with some confidence, from personal interviews with him soon after the commencement of hostilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3305"/><q direct="unspecified">Is it your expectation,</q> I asked, <q direct="unspecified">that the issue of this war will be to perpetuate the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3306"/><q direct="unspecified">The future is in the hands of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>,</q> he replied; <q direct="unspecified">but if the slaves in the <rs>South</rs> were mine, I would surrender them all, without a struggle, to avert this war.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3307"/>I asked him next upon what his calculations were based in so unequal a contest, and how he expected to win success; was he looking to divided counsels <pb id="p.247" n="247"/> in the <rs>North</rs>, or to foreign interposition?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3308"/>His answer showed how little he was affected by the hopes and fears which agitated ordinary minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3309"/><q direct="unspecified">My reliance is in the help of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3310"/><q direct="unspecified">Are you sanguine of the result?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3311"/>I ventured to inquire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3312"/><q direct="unspecified">At present I am not concerned with results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3313"/><name n="God" type="God">God's</name> will ought to be our aim, and I am quite contented that His designs should be accomplished, and not mine.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3314"/>What results might be expected when sentiments like these should be developed in action?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3315"/>Aims so pure and unselfish could not fail to produce in a strong character that intrepidity of soul; that singleness of purpose; that meekness of spirit in the midst of violence and passion; that self-abnegation in the hour of victory; that sublime heroism under adverse fortune, which made him the idol of his friends, and now command the respect and confidence of the civilized world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3316"/>Other men have gained great conquests, and filled the nations with their fame, but where do we find a man whose greatness was so pure from every earthly passion, and of whom it may be truly said, that he would have rejoiced to reform and bless the world without its being known that he was in it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3317"/>At the close of the war we follow him with admiration unabated to his chosen retirement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3318"/>His great mind harbored no resentments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3319"/>He uttered no complaints.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3320"/>He accepted the consequences of the war with a spirit of resignation which few can emulate, but which we all revere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3321"/>We thought now that his sun had gone down in night, but we were in error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3322"/>The joy and glory of nature are truthfully represented in activity, not in rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3323"/>The tired swan which has winged its distant flight from other scenes, and cleft its way through storm and tempest, does not seek an inglorious rest upon the still and motionless earth, but aims rather to fold its wings upon the lake, and in the quiet action of its waves to exercise and refresh its strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3324"/>The change in the life of this unconquerable man is not <num value="1">one</num> from labor to idle repose and inanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3325"/>He sought activity and usefulness, and he did not seek in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3326"/>I was seated at the close of day in my <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> home, when I beheld through the thickening shades of evening a horseman entering the yard, whom I soon recognized as <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0271.0017.00247.02085" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3327"/>The next morning he placed in my hands the correspondence with the authorities of <orgName n="Washington College" type="college">Washington College</orgName>, at <placeName reg="Lexington, Fayette, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013887">Lexington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3328"/>He had been invited to become president of that institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3329"/>I confess to a momentary feeling of chagrin at the proposed change&mdash;shall I say, revulsion?&mdash;in his history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3330"/>The institution was <num value="1">one</num> of local interest and comparatively unknown to our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3331"/>I named others more conspicuous, which would welcome him with ardor as their <pb id="p.248" n="248"/> presiding head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3332"/>I soon discovered that his mind towered above these earthly distinctions; that in his judgment the <hi rend="italics">cause</hi> gave dignity to the institution, and not the wealth of its endowment, or the renown of its scholars; that this door and not another was opened to him by <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, and he only wished to be assured of his competency to fulfill the trust, and thus to make his few remaining years a comfort and blessing to his suffering country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3333"/>I had spoken to his human feelings; he had now revealed himself to me as <num value="1">one</num> <q direct="unspecified">whose life was hid with <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0271.0017.00248.02086" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> in <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3334"/>My speech was no longer restrained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3335"/>I congratulated him that his heart had been inclined to this great cause, and that he was spared to give to the world this august testimony to the importance of <name>Christian</name> education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3336"/>How he listened to my feeble words; how he beckoned me to his side as the fullness of my heart found utterance; how his whole countenance glowed with animation when I spoke of the <rs>Holy Ghost</rs> as the great teacher, whose presence was required to make education a blessing, which otherwise might be the curse of mankind; how feelingly he responded, how <hi rend="italics">eloquently</hi>, as I never heard him speak before, can never be effaced from memory, and nothing more sacred mingles with my reminiscences of the dead.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3337"/>Into this new sphere of duty he entered with that steadfast spirit of devotion which adorned his whole life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3338"/>His example was needed to restore the drooping spirits of his countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3339"/>He felt it, and lavished all his strength in the effort to make them feel there was something to live for in the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3340"/>With the pale signet of death upon his brow, he toiled for the young under his care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3341"/>He fed them with his right hand and ruled them prudently with all his power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3342"/>He sought to kindle their ambition, to heal the wounds of their country, and above all things endeavored to raise them to a new and higher life with <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3343"/>Behold him, then, while distant nations were applauding his name, walking the daily round of duty, seeking only to do <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> will and conquer his own. With what success he addressed himself to this sublime mission, is attested by the rapid growth of the college under his charge, now become <num value="1">one</num> of the most thriving and vigorous institutions in the land.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3344"/>Very imperfect mention has been made of the religious character of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0271.0017.00248.02087" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3345"/>The lesson ought not to be lost upon a proud and gainsaying world, that its own chosen hero lived and died a Christian, in word and deed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3346"/>The world had its portion in him; his own portion was not on earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3347"/>The renown which he had won on the theatre of worldly distinction, he knew to be the breath of popular <pb id="p.249" n="249"/> applause, which must soon be hushed in the silence of the tomb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3348"/>The principalities and powers of this world, which had invoked his sword for their protection, he knew were doomed to an early oblivion; but in the religion of <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n0271.0017.00249.02088" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName>, his faith assured him that he was possessed of <q direct="unspecified">an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3349"/>The religion of our honored friend was not a creedless religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3350"/>His faith embraced all the doctrines of a pure and primitive Christianity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3351"/>He was a communicant in this church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3352"/>His children were baptized at her font Her ministers leaned upon his strong arm for support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3353"/>The church in the <name>Diocese</name> of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> derived strength from his frequent presence in her councils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3354"/>His last act was to preside at a meeting of the vestry of his parish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3355"/>Our beloved <persName n="Zion,,,,," id="n0271.0017.00249.02089" reg="mostcommon:Zion,nomatch:0"><surname>Zion</surname></persName> was the chief mourner in the funeral procession which followed him to the grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3356"/>A great writer has asserted that every nation is to be judged by its heroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3357"/>His countrymen would all consent to stand before the tribunal of history, and to accept as their representative in war and in peace the chivalrous and sainted <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0271.0017.00249.02090" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, for <q direct="unspecified"><name n="God" type="God">God</name> has set him among princes, even the princes of his people.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3358"/></p> 
<p>It remains for me to say, for the encouragement of the young men assembled before me, that the character which is here portrayed was not <num value="1">one</num> of sudden growth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3359"/>The church sheltered his early youth, as it shelters you. He was a good boy before he was a good man. Some youths are tempted to think it manly to defy authority, to be impatient, at least, under its discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3360"/>It is recorded of <persName n="Lee,,Robert,,," id="n0271.0017.00249.02091" reg="default:Lee,Robert,,,"><foreName>Robert</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, that during a life of <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> he never received a demerit, and he found it no hardship, so complete was his subjection to the law of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3361"/>Others are tempted to think of religion as a great humiliation, and to affect indifference and unbelief as a token of independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3362"/>You mourn <num value="1">one</num> to-day who was known as a devout <name>Christian</name>; and has the knowledg of this fact ever chilled the hearts of men towards him, or quenched <num value="1">one</num> ray of his glory?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3363"/>Did the valiant men who followed him to the field ever have cause to blush for his lack of heroism, or to wish that he were less a Christian?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3364"/>True religion adds to every man's power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3365"/>It helps to make men heroes, scholars, gentlemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3366"/>The religion of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0271.0017.00249.02092" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> is stronger than thrones and empires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3367"/>It invests a man with honor to be a Christian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3368"/>It is the only true honor, and a perishing world will shortly find it to be so. This life is hastening to its end. It is not in our power to arrest the progress of time, but we can improve it. We cannot prolong the bright morning of our days, but we can make <pb id="p.250" n="250"/> it productive in permanent results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3369"/>We cannot fix the evening rays of life in their shadowy horizon, but we can have our portion in that life which knows no change or decay, which is the ornament of youth, the joy of manhood, the glory of old age. <q direct="unspecified">Him that honoreth Me I will honor, and he that despiseth Me, shall be lightly esteemed.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4444"/>But hundreds of the enemy, who had advanced very near to our lines during the day, and were concealed among logs, ravines, &amp;c., availed themselves of this short truce, and retired to positions of safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4455"/>To meet this new danger our troops were thrown rapidly to the right and opened a hot fire upon the advancing zouaves, who, nevertheless, came dashing on, deploying from column into line, with the precision of veterans, as they neared our works, we mowing them down by scores, when they were ordered by their colonel to lie down, who, himself walked back and forward with as much apparent coolness, as if he were giving orders on parade.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4754"/>Dear brethren: The relations which we sustain to the various branches of the <orgName n="Christ Church" type="church">church of Christ</orgName> in our country, and the position which we hold in the army of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, induces us to address you upon the important subject of the religious instruction of the soldiers engaged in the sacred cause of defending our rights, our liberties and our homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4755"/>The <num value="1">one</num> universal subject of thought and of feeling is the war. The hearts of the people, with singular unanimity, are enlisted in the common cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4756"/>The object of special interest to all is the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4757"/>The political and social interests involved excite the patriotism and move the affection of all. There is little necessity for exhortation to love of country, or love to our sons and brothers, who are fighting and falling in our defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4758"/>These emotions, strong in the beginning, have become more intense from the heroic fortitude of our noble army, and from the wicked designs and infamous conduct of our enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4759"/>The history of the past <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> of the war has amazingly developed, and magnified the issues and strengthened and deepened the convictions under which the conflict began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4760"/>Base, beyond all conception, must that heart be which does not swell with patriotic devotion to our dear and suffering country, which is not stirred with deep and righteous indignation against our cruel and guilty foes, and which is not melted with profound and tender sympathy for the privations of our soldiers and the afflictions of our oppressed fellow-citizens in the invaded districts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4761"/>While these emotions may exist in some adequate measure, is the religious interest commensurate with the demand of the times?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4762"/>Is the church <pb id="p.349" n="349"/> as much alive to its duty as the <rs>State</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4763"/>Is the <rs>Christian</rs> as active and as earnest as the citizen?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4764"/>Duties never conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4765"/>Our patriotism will be all the stronger and purer when sanctified by religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4766"/>The natural sympathies require the controlling influence and the plastic power of the love of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0271.0025.00349.03196" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> for their proper regulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4767"/>To the political and social must be added the religious element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4768"/>To patriotism must be added the mightier principle of faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4769"/>Let love of country be joined to love of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>&mdash;let the love of our suffering brother be associated with the love of our crucified Saviour&mdash;let the temporal interests be connected with the eternal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4770"/><num value="1">One</num> duty should not be allowed to exclude another, nor <num value="1">one</num> emotion crowd from the heart the holier presence of another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4771"/>The church should clearly understand and fully estimate the relation which it sustains to the war, and the duty which it owes to the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4772"/>In an important sense the cause of the country is the cause of the church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4773"/>The principles involved are those of right, of truth, and of humanity, as well as of law, of constitutional liberty and of national independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4774"/>In a sense equally as true, and even more important is the fact, that the church, to the full extent of its ability and opportunity, is responsible for the souls of those who fall in this conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4775"/>Has she realized this solemn responsibility?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4776"/>Has she discharged her sacred duty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4777"/>With the opportunities which we have for estimating the work to be done, and of observing what has been accomplished, we are constrained to say that she has not. Surely her whole duty has not been done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4778"/>We tremble when we contemplate the results which may follow from such delinquency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4779"/>To estimate correctly the work which the church is called to perform, we must consider the vast number of our citizens who now compose the armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4780"/>All the men of the country, below the age of <num value="40">forty</num>, are in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4781"/>To these must be added many manly boys below, and many patriotic men above the prescribed ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4782"/>The intellectual and physical strength of the entire country is assembled in martial array.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4783"/>The ratio of religious instructors assigned by the bill for the appointment of chaplains (a bill in some important respects still defective) is <num value="1">one</num> chaplain for every regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4784"/>How has this arrangement been seconded by the church and the ministry?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4785"/>How many of the <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="600">six hundred</num> regiments are now supplied with faithful pastors?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4786"/>We have not the means of determining the number engaged in the whole service, but we give you the result as to our own corps&mdash;a body of troops commanded by that sincere <name>Christian</name>, <persName n="Jackson,Lieutenant-General,T.,J.,," id="n0271.0025.00349.03197" reg="expanded:Jackson,Thomas,J.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</roleName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, who has given special encouragement to the work of supplying the <pb id="p.350" n="350"/> corps with chaplains&mdash;not <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of the regiments of infantry are supplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4787"/>Some entire brigades have no chaplain at all. In the artillery attached to the corps the destitution is still greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4788"/>With these facts before us, is it too much to affirm that there are not <num value="200">two hundred</num> chaplains now in the field in all our armies?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4789"/>At the same time will not the statistics of the different churches in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> show an aggregate of <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6000">six thousand</num> ministers of the gospel?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4790"/>Ministerial brethren!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4791"/>ought this thing so to be?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4792"/>Church of the living <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, awake from your lethargy and arouse to your duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4793"/>We are well aware of the pure and lofty patriotism of the <rs>Southern</rs> ministry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4794"/>We know that your hearts are as truly and deeply enlisted in the cause of the country as ours; and we are also aware of the fact that a large number of chaplains are stationed at posts and laboring faithfully in hospitals, and many ministers of the gospel are serving as officers and as privates in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4795"/>But how great is the destitution in the field?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4796"/>And how many of our soldiers are perishing without the bread of life?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4797"/>There are no great difficulties in the way of obtaining an appointment for any suitable minister in any denomination of Christians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4798"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> has opened a wide and effectual door of access to the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4799"/>In the work itself there are no difficulties which zeal and faith cannot readily overcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4800"/>The chief obstructions are those which exist everywhere in the conflict between sin and holiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4801"/>There are no vices nor prejudices peculiar to the army which are any greater hindrances to the work of grace than those which are to be encountered in the cities and throughout the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4802"/>Our work is a hard work, and there are privations which must be endured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4803"/>The fare of the chaplain is that of the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4804"/>The exposures and discomforts to be encountered are in striking contrast with the previous lives of most ministers of the gospel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4805"/>The health of some has failed in the service, and some, indeed, have laid down their lives for their brethren, but to many the change of habits has been beneficial, and the feeble have come to endure hardness as good soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4806"/>The chaplain, however faithful, will at times be discouraged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4807"/>Men will seem to take little interest in his preaching; profanity, card-playing and Sabbath-breaking, will be on the increase, his presence often will be no restraint upon vice, and when he has faithfully discharged his duty he may meet with censure and ridicule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4808"/>In camp life there is an indolence of mind produced, and an aversion to serious thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4809"/>There is also a disposition to seek entertainment in all manner of foolish <pb id="p.351" n="351"/> talking and jesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4810"/>On the march, and on an active campaign, the attention is much absorbed, and time is often wanting for religious duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4811"/>The carelessness and open apostacy of professors of religion are here, as well as everywhere else&mdash;a great hindrance to the success of the gospel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4812"/>The readiness with which chaplains have resigned their places, or absented themselves from their regiments, is a source of discouragement to the soldiers and to their brethren who remain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4813"/>In the hasty opinions and sweeping judgments of many in and out of the army, the deficiencies of some have been unjustly attributed to others, and the failure of a few regarded as the failure of all. But these you perceive, brethren, are essentially the same difficulties, in a different form, which the minister of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> must encounter everywhere in this sinful world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4814"/>Our chief ground of discouragement, however, is in ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4815"/>With more faith in <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and more love for the souls of men, with more of the spirit of our blessed <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, we should behold greater and more precious results.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4816"/>If there are discouragements peculiar to our work, there are peculiar encouragements also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4817"/>We believe that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is with us, not only to own and bless His word to the salvation of men, but that His blessing rests upon our cause and attends our armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4818"/>It is a high privilege and a great satisfaction to preach to soldiers to whom <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has given such signal victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4819"/>The moral influence of a just and righteous cause is a happy introduction to, and a good preparation for the holier cause of religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4820"/>The objects for which our soldiers are fighting possess incalculable power in controlling the naturally demoralizing influence of war. We are thankful to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for the large number of <name>Christian</name> officers who command our armies and aid us in our work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4821"/>The presence of so many pious men in the ranks gives us a church in almost every regiment to begin with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4822"/>The intercourse and communion of <name>Christian</name> brethren in the army is as intimate and precious as anywhere upon earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4823"/>It is an interesting fact, that by this work ministers of the different denominations are brought into closer and more harmonious co-operation, thus promoting the unity and charity of the whole church, and greatly encouraging each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4824"/>Many of the greatest temptations to vice are excluded from the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4825"/>There is much time for profitable reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4826"/>The near approach of death excites to serious thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4827"/>Religious reading is sought and appreciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4828"/>Many opportunities for personal kindness to the sick and the wounded on the battlefield and in the camp bind grateful hearts to faithful chaplains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4829"/>In preaching the word, conducting prayer-meetings and Bible-classes, <pb id="p.352" n="352"/> by circulating the <name>Scriptures</name> and other religious reading, and by frequent conversation in private, we have ample opportunity for doing our <rs type="role2">Master</rs>'s work and laboring for immortal souls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4830"/>Our greatest encouragement, however, has been from the presence and power of the <rs>Holy Spirit</rs> among us. He who has led our armies to victory, conducting them, like the hosts of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName>, with the pillar of cloud and of fire by night and by day, has also encamped round about us, and the tabernacle of the <rs>Lord</rs> has been in the midst of our tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4831"/>We believe there have been more powerful and blessed revivals of religion <hi rend="italics">in</hi> the army than <hi rend="italics">out</hi> of it during the last <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>. We know of a large church in which almost all the additions for more than a year have been of young men visiting their homes on furloughs from the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4832"/>At this very time a most interesting and extensive work of grace is in progress amongst the troops stationed in and around the desolated city of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4833"/>The evidences of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> love and mercy are thus brought into immediate and striking contrast with the marks of the cruelty and barbarity of man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4834"/>Brethren, do not these movements of the <rs>Holy Ghost</rs> indicate where <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> ministers should follow, and in what work they should engage?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4835"/>Our work, though hard, is a pleasant work, and we feel it to be a precious and glorious work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4836"/>Much more has been accomplished than has been made known abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4837"/>Comparatively few publications have been sent out by the chaplains, but many earnest and faithful sermons have been preached, many copies of the <rs>Holy Scriptures</rs> have been put into the hands of the soldiers by chaplains and colporters, and much printed matter in the form of religious newspapers and tracts has been circulated and eagerly read; precious communions have been held, and souls have been added to the <orgName n="Christ Church" type="church">church of Christ</orgName>, of such as, we believe, shall be saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4838"/>Eternity alone can disclose the extent of the blessed work which faithful chaplains have accomplished in our armies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4839"/>We have told you these things, brethren, that your interest might be increased in this cause and in ourselves, as identified with the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4840"/>If we have only mentioned what was before familiar to you, we desire to stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4841"/>We would respectfully, and in <name>Christian</name> love, submit the following suggestions for your consideration, earnestly beseeching your cooperation, your sympathy and your prayers:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4842"/>Let the church humble herself before her <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>&mdash;let all Christians, of every name in our land, engage in acts of humiliation and of prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4843"/>The frequent calls of our excellent and pious <rs type="role2">President</rs> to <pb id="p.353" n="353"/> this duty have been attended by evident tokens of the <name>Divine</name> favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4844"/>May the observance of the appointed day, which is now at hand, be followed by the signal blessing of Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and may the solemn day be kept holy unto the <rs>Lord</rs> by the army and by all the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4845"/>If ever a nation was called to prostrate itself at the foot of the cross, and to supplicate the mercy of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> with strong crying and tears it is this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4846"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name>, we believe, will deliver us from our enemies, but that deliverance must come in answer to prayer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4847"/>In order that our prayers may be heard, and our solemn days be not an abomination unto the <rs>Lord</rs>, we must put away sin from among us. There are sins, both of a national and individual character, which are rapidly engendered in a time like this&mdash;a spirit of recklessness and profanity&mdash;a disregard of the laws of life and of property&mdash;too great a reliance upon an arm of flesh&mdash;and it may be, under peculiar aggravations, a sinful feeling of malignant and bloodthirsty revenge has been indulged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4848"/>But, more than all, a spirit of unhallowed greed, of unrighteous extortion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4849"/>Ill-gotten gains will prove a curse to the individual, and injurious to the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4850"/>It is no time for amassing wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4851"/>Can the true patriot, can the true <rs>Christian</rs> grow rich in the hour of his country's peril?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4852"/>If in any proper and legitimate manner, without injury to others, money is accumulated, give it to your country, give it to the poor, give it to the suffering families of the soldiers, send a chaplain to the army, and assist in the support of his family while he is engaged in the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4853"/>Let the <orgName n="Jesus Christ Church" type="church">church of Jesus Christ</orgName> clear herself of this sin, and let not the hidden wedge and the <name>Babylonish</name> garment be found in her tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4854"/>By precept and example let the church seek to foster a generous and self sacrificing spirit among all classes of the people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4855"/>Brethren, send us more chaplains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4856"/>The harvest truly is great, the laborers are few. We send abroad to the churches the <rs>Macedonian</rs> cry, Come and help us. The work is an earnest, a pressing work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4857"/>Now is emphatically the accepted time for the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4858"/>The cause will not brook delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4859"/>A series of battles, which may speedily follow the opening of the campaign, will sweep away <num value="1000">thousands</num> of our brave comrades and friends&mdash;<num value="1000">thousands</num> of your own sons and brothers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4860"/>Then come while it is called to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4861"/>Come up to the help of the <rs>Lord</rs>, to the help of the <rs>Lord</rs> against the mighty, and escape the curse of <placeName reg="Meroz">Meroz</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4862"/>We especially appeal to the churches in their organized capacity, and ask of conventions, conferences, presbyteries and associations, to set apart men of the best talent and largest experience unto this <pb id="p.354" n="354"/> work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4863"/>Such a call, coming with the potential authority of a <orgName n="God Church" type="church">church of God</orgName>, would doubtless decide many of the ablest ministers in the country to cast in their lots with us. We cordially and earnestly invite the venerable fathers of the church to visit the army and preach for a few days or weeks in the regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4864"/>Such voluntary labors, in many instances, have been signally blessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4865"/>The churches should be willing to spare their pastors for this work, and seek temporary supplies from neighboring ministers; or, at least, all congregations might allow their ministers to visit the army for a time and labor for those who have gone forth in their defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4866"/>Have not the soldiers, who are away from their homes and churches, the right to claim a part of the time of their own pastors?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4867"/>But especially do we call upon the younger men in the ministry&mdash;and we call upon you, young men, because you are strong&mdash;come, take part in this sacred cause and this holy fellowship with us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4868"/>If the ministers of the gospel, below the age of <num value="40">forty</num>, are exempted from ordinary military duty, are they not bound to serve their country and the army in the capacity of chaplains?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4869"/>Have you a right to stay away while this destitution exists?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4870"/>We urge no extreme or fanatical view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4871"/>Let all the regiments be supplied, and still the vast majority of ministers will remain at home with their congregations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4872"/>We plead only for that which is just and equal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4873"/>And we feel that we but do this when we maintain that congregations should assist in the support of the families of chaplains while laboring in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4874"/>Such an arrangement would give hundreds of excellent men to the work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4875"/>Brethren, pray for us. To know that we are constantly remembered at a throne of grace&mdash;in the churches and in the families&mdash;in the public and in the private devotions of the people of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>&mdash;will greatly encourage our hearts and strengthen our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4876"/>Prayer should be made without ceasing to the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and Father of our <rs type="role2">Lord</rs> and Saviour <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n0271.0025.00354.03198" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName> in behalf of our cause, our country, our officers and our soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4877"/>Pray for us, that we may be faithful, and that our labors may be blessed in the conversion of souls.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4878"/>We ask these things of you, dear brethren, because we believe that the final success of our arms is intimately connected with the fidelity of the church in fulfilling its duty to the army, and closely related to the religious character of the army itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4879"/>It was remarked by <num value="1">one</num> of our distinguished and <name>Christian</name> generals, that <q direct="unspecified">the only ground of apprehension to be felt is from the want of piety in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4880"/>Were all the soldiers sincere Christians and praying men, in <pb id="p.355" n="355"/> a cause like ours, they would be invincible.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4881"/>In such an army there would be <num value="2">two</num> distinct sources of success in addition to the ordinary elements of military power&mdash;the loftier courage derived from <name>Christian</name> faith, and the direct blessing of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in answer to prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4882"/>If the want of faithfulness on the part of the church, the impiety of the army and the people, should prevent <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> blessing, then the unfaithfulness of the church will have blasted our hopes, destroyed our country, and left a continent in ruins.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4883"/>There should be no separation made between the army and the country, between the soldier and the citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4884"/>The army is composed of the people, and the soldiers are citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4885"/>At this very time the soldiers in the field are the only electors of representatives for many of the congressional and legislative districts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4886"/>Those who achieve our independence are the same who must maintain it. The sole governors of the country, for <num value="1">one</num> generation at least, will be the survivors of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4887"/>Those who win the battles, must make, administer, enforce and obey the laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4888"/>If these be depraved and godless through the neglect of the church, and their want of moral integrity and elevation destroy the government, and bring upon the land the curse of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, then in vain the mighty sacrifice of treasure and of blood&mdash;in vain the army of our martyred dead&mdash;in vain the sacred gift bequeathed from bleeding sires to sons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4889"/>Better never to have fought and won the victory, than afterwards to forfeit it and lose the blessing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4890"/>This may be the last struggle for constitutional liberty which will be made on this continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4891"/>The progress of the race, the happiness of <num value="1000000">millions</num> is involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4892"/>A grand responsibility rests upon our young republic, and a mighty work lies before it. Baptized in its infancy in blood, may it receive the baptism of the <rs>Holy Ghost</rs>, and be consecrated to its high and holy mission among the nations of the earth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4893"/>This, we fondly hope, will be the last year of this bloody war. But of that no <num value="1">one</num> can certainly know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4894"/>How ardently is a permanent and honorable peace desired!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4895"/>For this object united prayers should go up continually to the throne of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> by night and by day. Weeping between the porch and the altar, <orgName type="college" n="Zion college">Zion</orgName> should lift up her voice without ceasing unto her Saviour and her <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4896"/>This war must be regarded by all <name>Christian</name> men as a chastisement from the hand of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> on account of our sins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4897"/>The object of all chastening is purification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4898"/>War, pestilence and famine, when they came upon <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> ancient people, were designed to turn them from their sins, and to bring them back to his love and service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4899"/>When that result was accomplished <pb id="p.356" n="356"/> the chastisement was removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4900"/>Has the church in our afflicted land learned aright the chastening lessons of her <name n="God" type="God">God</name>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4901"/>Have the rulers and the people, like those of <placeName key="tgn,2113290" n="1.000 4" reg="nineveh, warren, virginia">Nineveh</placeName>, repented before the judgments of the <rs>Lord</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4902"/>In some hopeful measure this undoubtedly has been the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4903"/>We believe that in humility, in sincerity of faith, in thankfulness for mercies, and in prayerfulness, there has been improvement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4904"/>Men have been called to sacrifice self for principle, and freely has the sacrifice been made by <num value="1000000">millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4905"/>A tenderer charity, and a larger benevolence than ever before, open the hands and fill the hearts of many.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4906"/>A higher estimate has been placed upon <hi rend="italics">truth</hi> and upon <hi rend="italics">right</hi> by a people resisting unto blood, striving against sin. We may indulge the hope that the results which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> designed are following from the war. And when they are accomplished the war will cease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4907"/>The coming of peace will be insured, and will be hastened by our fidelity in duty and our devotion in prayer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4908"/>But, brethren, our great argument with you is the salvation of the souls of men, the salvation of our sons and brothers, the salvation of our dear soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4909"/>We plead for those who are ready to lay down the life that now is. Shall they lose also the life which is to come?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4910"/>If the sacrifice of the body is demanded shall that of the soul be made?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4911"/>If time is forfeited must eternity be lost?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4912"/>The great object for which the <orgName n="God Church" type="church">church of God</orgName> was instituted upon earth is the same as that for which the <name>Son</name> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> died upon the cross&mdash;the glory of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in the salvation of men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4913"/>We urge you, then, by this last and greatest of all considerations, to aid us in this blessed work by your presence, your sympathies, your contributions and your prayers.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5009"/>So far as the part taken by that brigade in that engagement is concerned, I am entirely familiar with it, as I commanded the <orgName type="regiment" key="4VAInfantry">Fourth Virginia infantry</orgName>, <num value="1">one</num> of its regiments, and therefore know, from personal observation, what I write.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5014"/>As I never saw <pb id="p.365" n="365"/> the ground in daylight, when my attention might have been called to distances, I will only say, I think we were some <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of a mile in front of the <rs type="place">Chancellorsville House</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5015"/>The brigade remained in this position during the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5016"/>With daylight, artillery firing commenced, and very soon furious infantry firing was heard on the right of the plank road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5017"/>During the night the enemy had constructed some temporary breastworks on the right of the plank road, from which they were driven in the attack referred to.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5018"/>Soon after, the <orgName n="Stonewall Brigade" type="brigade">Stonewall Brigade</orgName> was moved from the left to the right of the plank road, and moved some distance to the right; then moved by the front, and again direction was changed to the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5019"/>About this time <persName n="Paxton,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n0271.0028.00365.03256" reg="mostcommon:Paxton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Paxton</surname></persName>, commanding, was mortally wounded&mdash;for we were under fire all this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5020"/>A word of explanation here will serve to explain what followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5021"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="2VAInfantry">Second Virginia infantry</orgName> was on the right of the brigade; my regiment was the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> in line, with the <num value="5" type="ordinal">Fifth</num>, <num value="27" type="ordinal">Twenty-seventh</num> and <num value="33" type="ordinal">Thirty-third</num> to my left, but their order in line I do not now remember.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5022"/>The order given us was to follow the movements of the regiment on the right of the brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5023"/>After crossing the plank road some distance, then moving by the front, and again changing direction to the right, we were brought near the temporary breastworks from which the enemy had been driven in the early morning, and behind which were then lying the troops who had captured them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5024"/>I, did hear then the name of the brigade in our front, who had participated in the morning attack, but I do not now remember it. (I hope this article will fall under the eye of some member of that command, and that they will remember it.) As I have stated, we had now approached near the breastworks, and were moving by the right flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5025"/>In the left company of the regiment to my right the command was given, <q direct="unspecified">By the left flank, march.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5026"/>This I promptly gave to my regiment, and it was repeated to the <num value="3">three</num> regiments to my left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5027"/>I have never heard any explanation of the order given to the company to my right, and have no doubt there was some mistake; but at the instant I had no reason to question it, and I promptly obeyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5028"/>The result was that the company to my right, my regiment and the <num value="3">three</num> regiments to my left moved by the front over the troops and breastworks into the woods beyond; and, moving forward some <num value="100">one hundred</num> or <measure n="150yards" type="distance">one hundred and fifty yards</measure>, we became engaged with the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5029"/>I naturally supposed that we were supported on the right and left in this advance, but it turned out that only the left company of the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA2">Second Virginia</orgName> <pb id="p.366" n="366"/> and the other <num value="4">four</num> regiments of the brigade were engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5030"/>We became exposed to a very heavy concentrated fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5031"/>I quickly took in the situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5032"/>I saw we could not drive the enemy, and that we were suffering a terrible loss of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5033"/>I ordered the men to retire behind the breastworks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5034"/>The regiments to my left, following my movement, also fell back.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5035"/>To show the terrific fire to which we were exposed, I will state that I went into that fight with <num value="350">three hundred and fifty</num> muskets, and in less than <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> I had <num value="160">one hundred and sixty</num> men killed and wounded.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5612"/>To attempt again (in the face of these repeated rejections of all conference with us), to send commissioners or agents to propose peace, is to invite insult and contumely, and to subject ourselves to indignity, without the slightest chance of being listened to.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5836"/>Or were we to be considered honorable soldiers of a war illustrated by the greatest gallantry, the highest chivalry, the brightest genius that the English-speaking race have ever exhibited?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5837"/>Were we to be regarded by our contemporaries&mdash;the gallant soldiers of the successful side&mdash;as their equals in patriotism and purity of motive, and by succeeding generations as worthy of places beside the armies of the <rs>Union</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5838"/>These were not merely sentimental questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5839"/>They were pressing and vital ones, upon the answer to which our future welfare and happiness largely depended.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5840"/>As outcasts we would rapidly degenerate into the outlaws of the community, and would be thrust aside as unworthy of respect and debarred an equal opportunity of earning the support of ourselves and those dear to us. As respected citizens of the <rs>State</rs> and the <rs>Union</rs> we would live happily among our people, would receive proofs of their confidence and esteem, and leave to our children the priceless heritage of honored fame and name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5841"/>To Marylanders these questions were more vital than to those who had their own State organizations to justify them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5842"/>We had no defence except the law of war as defined by and practiced under the law of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5843"/>And it was of overwhelming necessity that our position should be ascertained to be that of soldiers, and not of rebels and traitors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5844"/>The question came home to me personally in a very pressing way. I was under indictment in the <rs>Federal</rs> and State courts for treason in committing acts of war in the <rs>Sharpsburg</rs> and <rs>Gettysburg</rs> campaigns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5845"/>I knew perfectly well what the law was. The only doubt was as to how far the courts of the successful side would give the unsuccessful side the benefit of it. Rebellion is insurrection against lawful government, which is unlawful in itself, in which every <num value="1">one</num> who assists, aids or abets it is equally guilty, and personally responsible to the law for his crime, and which has no legal consequences, and can have none, for it is against all law. After it is suppressed there only remain the criminal trial and the punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5846"/>War is a status between nations, countries or parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5847"/>As soon as it occurs, it changes at once the relation of every person subject to either party; each <num value="1">one</num> becomes bound to obey his own country, and ceases to be personally responsible for actions committed by command of its authority, civil or military.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5848"/>All the people on <num value="1">one</num> side become <pb id="p.431" n="431"/> legally enemies to all those on the other side, and no connection or communication is lawful between them unless by permission of their respective authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5849"/>All business ceases, all compacts are dissolved between them, and they are as if they existed on separate planets, Therefore if the war between the <name>States</name> was determined to have been rebellion, every citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> who had aided it would have been guilty of treason and liable to the law for his actions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5851"/>But if that war was held to be civil war, with all the legal consequences of public war, then there was no treason and no penalty for it&mdash;no personal responsibility for acts of lawful war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6121"/>About a fortnight after the completion <pb id="p.455" n="455"/> of the arrangements, in respect to the above contract, I received a cypher despatch from the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs> on the subject of getting ships in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName>, and as it affords conclusive proof of the hopes that were held out, and the expectations which were aroused at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 9" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> in consequence, I think a portion of its contents may properly be given here as a part of the facts necessary to a full understanding of that strange episode in the war which forms the chief subject of this chapter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6122"/>The following is an extract from the above-mentioned despatch, dated <q direct="unspecified"><placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 9" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, <dateStruct value="1863-05-26"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="26">26th</day>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct></q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6123"/>My letter of the <dateStruct value="--6"><day reg="6">6th instant</day></dateStruct>, enclosed you a copy of a Secret Act of Congress relative to building ships abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6124"/>Since that letter was written, I have received additional assurances, which I regard as satisfactory, that iron-plated ships-of-war can be constructed in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> by <name>French</name> builders, and delivered to us ready for service upon the high seas or elsewhere.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6125"/> Heretofore I have brought to your attention an intimation which I deem not unworthy of notice, from the quarter whence it reached me, that <num value="1">one</num> or more of the ironclads of the <rs>French Navy</rs> might be so transferred as to come into our possession, and as I have heard, only incidentally from you on the point, and know that you have recently, by your visit to <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName>, had an opportunity of learning the value of this suggestion, I again ask your attention to it.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6126"/><q direct="unspecified">The immediate possession of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> good armored ships, capable of entering the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, would be of incalculable value to us, and though the hope of thus obtaining them is not sanguine, I still deem it proper to attempt it. You will, therefore, if you have not already acted, take such measures for this purpose as you may deem best.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6127"/></p> 
<p>In reply to the portion of the foregoing despatch, which referred to the possible purchase of <num value="1">one</num> or more ironclads from the <rs>French Navy</rs>, I informed <persName n="Mallory,Mister,,,," id="n0271.0039.00455.04192" reg="mostcommon:Mallory,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Mallory</surname></persName> that <q direct="unspecified">inquiries have been, and continue to be, made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6128"/>Most of the ironclads already built, or now under construction for the <rs>European</rs> powers, are either too large, and of too heavy draft, for our especial purposes, or they are mere <orgName n="Floating Battery" type="battery">floating batteries</orgName>, too small and heavily armed to cross the <rs>Atlantic</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6129"/></p> 
<p>The subject was fully discussed with <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n0271.0039.00455.04193" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Slidell</surname></persName>, and he did not see how the negotiation could be opened in such a way as to get the proposition before the <rs>Emperor</rs>, unless it should appear that he had determined to recognize the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName> independently of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and there was no evidence that he intended to take any such decisive step alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6131"/>Personally, I fully agreed with <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n0271.0039.00456.04195" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Slidell</surname></persName>, and on the general question I subsequently wrote to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs> as follows:</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6132"/><q direct="unspecified">You may rely upon it that the purchase of men-of-war from any of the <rs>European</rs> navies is not practicable under existing circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6133"/>The transaction would necessarily be managed through intermediaries, who, from the very nature of the negotiations, would be forced to sacrifice principle by prevaricating, and then all sorts of objectionable means would have to be used, even bribery, and after all we would only get cast-off vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6136"/>On the <dateStruct value="1863-11-23"><day reg="23">23d</day> of <month reg="11">November</month>, <year>1863</year>,</dateStruct> I reported that the armored vessels were quite <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> finished, and that the corvettes would probably be ready for sea within the contract time, but by that date affairs began to change in their aspect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6137"/>The American papers began to discuss the probable destination of the ships, and it was stated that <persName n="Dayton,Mister,,,," id="n0271.0039.00456.04196" reg="mostcommon:Dayton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Dayton</surname></persName>, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> Minister, had addressed a protest to the <rs>French</rs> government against their completion, and it was even affirmed that he had been assured by the <rs>Minister</rs> of Marine that none of the ships would be allowed to leave <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6138"/>Commenting upon these uncomfortable rumors, in a subsequent despatch (<dateStruct value="1863-11-26"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="26">26th</day>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>,) to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs>, I wrote as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6139"/></p> 
<p> The extent to which the system of bribery and spying has been, and continues to be, practised by the agents of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, is scarcely credible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6140"/>The servants of gentlemen, supposed to have Southern sympathies, are tampered with, confidential clerks, and even the messengers from telegraph offices, are bribed to betray their trust, and I have lately been informed that the <rs>English</rs> and <rs>French</rs> post-offices, hitherto considered immaculate, are now scarcely safe modes of communication.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6144"/>We know that the stolen papers contain evidence that the ships are for us, for the fact has been so stated by the <rs>Minister</rs> of Marine to <num value="1">one</num> of the builders, but the <rs>French</rs> government has only thus become aware of a transaction it was perfectly well informed of before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6145"/>Indeed, I may say, that the attempt to build ships in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> was undertaken at the instigation of the <rs>Imperial</rs> government itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6146"/>When the construction of the corvettes was in progress of negotiation, a draft of the proposed contract was shown to the highest person in the <rs>Empire</rs>, and it received his sanction&mdash;at least I was so informed at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6147"/>At any rate, I have a copy of the letter addressed to the builders by the <rs>Minister</rs> of Marine, giving authority to arm the corvettes in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName>, and specifying the number of guns, and I have the original document signed by <persName n="Laubat,,M.,Chasseloup,," id="n0271.0039.00457.04200" reg="default:Laubat,M.,Chasseloup,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <foreName>Chasseloup</foreName> <surname>Laubat</surname></persName> himself, granting like authority for the rams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6148"/>It can never, therefore, be charged that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> government, through its agent, has violated the neutrality of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> by attempting the construction of ships in her ports, and if <persName n="Dayton,Mister,,,," id="n0271.0039.00457.04201" reg="mostcommon:Dayton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Dayton</surname></persName> has received the assurances we see printed in the <rs>American</rs> papers, the time is rapidly approaching when the policy of the <rs>Imperial</rs> government, in reference to American affairs, must be positively and definitely expressed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6149"/>The builders are still sanguine that they will be allowed to send ships to sea, but I confess that I do not see any such assurance in what they say, and the manner in which the protest of the <rs>American Minister</rs> had been received is well calculated to confirm my doubts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6150"/>When <persName n="Dayton,Mister,,,," id="n0271.0039.00457.04202" reg="mostcommon:Dayton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Dayton</surname></persName> went to the <rs>Minister</rs> of Foreign Affairs with a complaint, and with copies of certain letters to substantiate it, the <rs>Minister</rs> might have said, <q direct="unspecified">These are alleged copies of the private correspondence of <num value="2">two</num> prominent and highly respected <name>French</name> citizens; they could only have come into your possession by means of bribery or treachery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6151"/>I cannot, therefore, receive them as evidence, and must insist that you produce the originals, and explain how you came to be possessed of them.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6152"/>It strikes me that such a course would have effectually silenced <persName n="Dayton,Mister,,,," id="n0271.0039.00457.04203" reg="mostcommon:Dayton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Dayton</surname></persName>, and we could have felt <pb id="p.458" n="458"/> some assurance of getting our ships to sea. Instead of this, the stolen letters have been received without hesitation, and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> officials profess to be satisfied with the action, or promised action, of the <rs>French</rs> government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6153"/>The builders are sent for, and warned by the <rs>Minister</rs> of Marine, and although those gentlemen come from their interviews still possessed by the belief that the ships will be allowed to depart, and thus, as I said before, excite hopes, I cannot be blind to the significancy of the above circumstances.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6154"/>My belief is, that the construction of the ships will not be interfered with, but whether they will be allowed to leave <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> or not will depend upon the position of affairs in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> at the time of their completion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6155"/>If at that time our cause is in the ascendant, the local authorities will be instructed not to be too inquisitive, and the departure of our ships will be connived at. If, on the contrary, the <rs>Federal</rs> cause prospers, the affair of the <q direct="unspecified">Confederate ships</q> will be turned over to the responsible Ministers of the <rs>Empire</rs>, who will justify their claim to American gratitude by a strict enforcement of the neutrality of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6156"/>Hoping always for the best, I shall not permit any fears to create delay in the progress of work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6157"/>The ships shall be ready as soon as possible, and every effort shall be made to get them to sea in the manner least calculated to compromise the <rs>French</rs> authorities if they choose only to be judiciously blind.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6160"/>That policy has been pronounced sooner than I anticipated, and the <rs>Emperor</rs>, through his <rs type="role" reg="Minister">Ministers</rs> of Foreign Affairs and of Marine, has formally notified the builders that the ironclads cannot be permitted to sail, and that the corvettes must not be armed in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName>, but must be nominally sold to some foreign merchant and despatched as ordinary trading vessels.

<p>After more than <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> of a warfare scarcely equalled in the number, magnitude and fearful carnage of its battles; a warfare in which your courage and fortitude have illustrated your country, and attracted not only gratitude at home, but admiration abroad, your enemies continue a struggle in which our final triumph must be inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6234"/>Their malignant rage aims at nothing less than the extermination of yourselves, your wives and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6237"/>They design to incite servile insurrection and light the fires of incendiarism whenever they can reach your homes, and they debauch the inferior race, hitherto docile and contented, by promising indulgence of the vilest passions as the price of treachery.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6239"/>Fellow-citizens, no alternative is left you but victory, or subjugation, slavery and the utter ruin of yourselves, your families and your country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6240"/>The victory is within your reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6241"/>You need but stretch forth your hands to grasp it. For this and all that is necessary is that those who are called to the field by every motive that can move the human heart, should promptly repair to the post of duty, <pb id="p.467" n="467"/> should stand by their comrades now in front of the foe, and thus so strengthen the armies of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> as to insure success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6242"/>The men now absent from their posts would, if present in the field, suffice to create numerical equality between our force and that of the invaders&mdash;and when, with any approach to such equality, have we failed to be victorious?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6243"/>I believe that but few of those absent are actuated by unwillingness to serve their country; but that many have found it difficult to resist the temptation of a visit to their homes and the loved ones from whom they have been so long separated; that others have left for temporary attention to their affairs, with the intention of returning, and then have shrunk from the consequences of their violation of duty; that others, again, have left their posts from mere restlessness and desire of change&mdash;each quieting the upbraidings of his conscience by persuading himself that his individual services could have no influence on the general result.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6244"/>These and other causes (although far less disgraceful than the desire to avoid danger, or to escape from the sacrifices required by patriotism) are, nevertheless, grievous faults, and place the cause of our beloved country, and of everything we hold dear, in imminent peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6245"/>I repeat, that the men who now owe duty to their country, who have been called out and have not yet reported for duty, or who have absented themselves from their posts, are sufficient in number to secure us victory in the struggle now impending.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6246"/>I call on you, then, my countrymen, to hasten to your camps, in obedience to the dictates of honor and of duty, and summon those who have absented themselves without leave, or who have remained absent beyond the period allowed by their furloughs, to repair without delay to their respective commands; and I do hereby declare that I grant a general pardon and amnesty to all officers and men within the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, now absent without leave, who shall, with the least possible delay, return to their proper posts of duty, but no excuse will be received for any delay beyond <measure n="20days" type="date">twenty days</measure> after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> publication of this proclamation in the <rs>State</rs> in which the absentee may be at the date of the publication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6256"/>As the time drew near when you who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> entered the service might well have been expected to claim relief from your arduous labors and restoration to the endearments of home, you have heeded only the call of your suffering country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6260"/>It is, therefore, deemed appropriate, and, it is hoped, will be equally acceptable, to make a general acknowledgment, instead of successive special responses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6265"/>Already the pulse of the whole people beats in unison with yours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6266"/>Already they compare your spontaneous and unanimous offer of your lives, for the defence of your country, with the halting and reluctant service of the mercenaries who are purchased by the enemy at the price of higher bounties than have hitherto been known in war. Animated by this contrast, they exhibit cheerful confidence and more resolute bearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6267"/>Even the murmurs of the weak and timid, who shrink from the triale which make stronger and firmer your noble natures, are shamed into silence by the spectacle which you present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6268"/>Your brave battle-cry will ring loud and clear through the land of the enemy, as well as our own; will silence the vainglorious boastings of their corrupt partisans and their pensioned press; and will do justice to the calumny by which they seek to persuade a deluded people that you are ready to purchase dishonorable safety by degrading submission.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6271"/>On the other hand, debt, taxation, repetition of heavy drafts, dissensions, occasioned by the strife for power, by the pursuit of the spoils of office, by the thirst for the plunder of the public treasury, and, above all, the consciousness of a bad cause, must tell with fearful force upou the over-strained energies of the enemy.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6315"/>I cannot conceal from myself the fact that so much of the report as refers to my command (except some general compliments to the courage of a portion of my troops on <date>Wednesday</date>, the <dateStruct value="-12-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>) is in tone and spirit a thorough disparagement of both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6316"/>This tone runs through all its parts, and lies like a broad foundation underneath the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6317"/>At the same time the narrative of events is made to sustain the general spirit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6318"/>While the report of the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs> fails, as I think, to do justice to the behavior of my division on <date>Friday</date>, the <dateStruct value="-01-2"><day reg="2">2d</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>; yet its strictures are chiefly leveled at my own conduct as an officer during all the operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6319"/>By direct statement and by unmistakable innuendo, it is throughout a reflection upon my capacity and conduct.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6320"/>Without referring to its contents in detail, I have to say, in respectful terms, that neither its material statements nor its equally material innuendoes can be maintained by proof; that its omission of important facts creditable to my division and myself is as remarkable as many of its affirmative statements; in a word, that in spirit and substance it is erroneous and unjust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6321"/><pb id="p.476" n="476"/></p> 
<p>I trust that nothing in the foregoing expressions passes the limit of military propriety, and that plainness of statement will be pardoned to <num value="1">one</num> who, even under the weight of superior military censure, feels that both he and his command have deserved well of their country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6322"/>Having met the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs> repeatedly on the field, and on <num value="3">three</num> occasions in council during the progress of the operations, without receiving from him the least indication of dissatisfaction with my conduct, I was not prepared to see a report, bearing a subsequent date, containing representations at variance with these significant facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6323"/>Nor was my surprise lessened when I observed that it was written after a correspondence with his corps and division commanders (I being <num value="1">one</num> of the latter), in which he invokes their aid to sustain him, and speaks of them as officers <q direct="unspecified">upon whom I (he) have ever relied as upon a foundation of rock.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6324"/></p> 
<p>The <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs> having written and forwarded his report before receiving those of his subordinate commanders, could have derived no assistance in its preparation from those usual official aids to the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs>, and since his position on the field prevented him from seeing many of the movements, especially those of <date>Friday</date>, the <dateStruct value="-01-2"><day reg="2">2d</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, it much concerns all affected by his statements to know something of those other, and to them unknown, sources of information to which he has given the sanction of his influence and rank as the head of the army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6325"/>I have felt that it would be improper, in a paper of this character, to enter upon a detailed vindication; yet, in view of the fact that the casualties of war may at any time render an investigation impossible, I hope that it has not been improper for me to place on record this general protest against the injurious statements and inferences of the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs>, particularly since, not anticipating his censures, I may not have been sufficiently minute in portions of my report.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6326"/>And in regard to the action of <date>Friday</date>, the <dateStruct value="-01-2"><day reg="2">2d</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, upon which the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs> heaped so much criticism, I have to say, with the utmost confidence, that the failure of my troops to hold the position which they carried on that occasion was due to no fault of theirs or of mine, but to the fact that we were commanded to do an impossible thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6327"/>My force was about <num value="4500">forty-five hundred</num> men; of these, <num value="1700">seventeen hundred</num> heroic spirits stretched upon that bloody field, in an unequal struggle against <num value="3">three</num> divisions, a brigade, an overwhelming concentration of artillery, attested our efforts to obey the order.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6427"/>When the war between secession and coercion ended, the <rs>Southern States</rs> were under every obligation which defeat could imply, or surrender impose, to abandon secession as a remedy for every grievance, real or supposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6428"/>Whatever might have been their convictions <pb id="p.485" n="485"/> touching the abstract right of secession, or the sufficiency of the causes which provoked its exercise, surrender was a confession of inability to maintain it by the sword, and honor and fair dealing demanded that the sword should be sheathed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6429"/>But defeat in a physical contest does not prove that the defeated party was in the wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6430"/>It is certainly no evidence of criminal motive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6431"/>It is a confession of weakness, not of crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6432"/>Were it otherwise, the robber is a law-abiding citizen and his victim a thief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6434"/>In a wicked world innocence and right are not at all incompatible with failure, sorrow and humiliation, else the man who fell among thieves on his way from <placeName key="possibilities=25" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Jerusalem</placeName> to <placeName key="possibilities=37" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Jericho</placeName> was a criminal, and his plunderers were entitled to the plaudits&mdash;the oil and the wine of all good Samaritans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6435"/>Nay, the <name>Saviour</name> himself was a malefactor, and his crucifiers were <name>Christian</name> gentlemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6436"/>Failure to dissolve the <rs>Union</rs>, and nothing more, was the confession of surrender, and the obligation to remain in the <rs>Union</rs> and discharge all its duties under the <rs>Constitution</rs> necessarily resulted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6437"/>So, on the other hand, the <rs>Northern States</rs>&mdash;the asserters of the right of coercion&mdash;were equally under every obligation to accept surrender, as meaning this and only this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6438"/>They proclaimed no other purpose in making the war of coercion, but to defeat secession and preserve the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6439"/>They had no right, political, moral or honor able, to enlarge the issue after the contest had ended, and the issue made by the contest was exhausted and determined.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6440"/>The Southern States and people accepted, in a frank and liberal spirit, all the just consequences of their defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6441"/>They abandoned secession, and the doctrine of secession, as a practical remedy for all grievances, past or future, and for all time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6442"/>They did more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6443"/>Property in slaves was not the cause of the war. It was not the great fundamental right for which the <rs>Southern States</rs> went into secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6444"/>It was only an incident to that right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6445"/>The right of the <name>States</name> to regulate their own internal affairs, by the exercise of the powers of government which they had never delegated, and the conviction that independence was necessary to preserve that right of selfgovern-ment, was the great, moving, inspiring cause of the seceding States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6446"/>There was not a day of the struggle when the <rs>Southern</rs> people would not have surrendered slavery to secure independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6447"/>But slavery was the particular property which, it was believed, was endangered without independence, and which, therefore, made the assertion of secession necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6448"/>The disciples of coercion denied this, and asserted <pb id="p.486" n="486"/> they had no intention of interfering with slavery in the <rs>States True</rs>, a war-proclamation of emancipation was issued finally, and a movement was made to amend the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, as if to make this emancipation effectual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6449"/>But this was avowedly done as a threat, to induce a surrender to avoid such a result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6450"/>Yet, promptly after surrender, the <rs>Southern</rs> people waived the discussion of all technicalities on this question, and relieved their late enemies of all necessity to enter upon such discussion, and, in conventions assembled, each State for itself most solemnly abolished slavery in their borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6451"/>To protect the negro in his freedom was more than a corollary to this emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6452"/>It was a duty which the preservation of society made necessary in each State, and by each State for itself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6453"/>But the <rs>Northern States</rs> and people were not satisfied with these prompt and manly concessions by our people of every legal, necessary, reasonable, and even incidental result of defeat in the war. The war being over, our arms surrendered, our government scattered, and our people helpless, they now determined not only to enlarge the issues made by the war, and during the war, but they also determined to change those issues, and make demands which had not before been made, which, indeed, had been utterly disclaimed in every possible form by every State of the <rs>North</rs>, and every department of the <rs>Federal</rs> government&mdash;legislative, executive and judicial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6454"/>Nay, they now made demands, which they had in every form declared they could have no power or right to make without violating the <rs>Constitution</rs> they had sworn to support, and destroying the <rs>Union</rs> they had waged the war itself to preserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6455"/>Over and over, during the war, they proclaimed in every authoritative form to us and to foreign governments that secession was a nullity, that our States were still in the <rs>Union</rs>, and that we had only to lay down our arms and retain all our rights and powers as equal States in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6456"/>We laid down our arms, and immediately they insisted our States had lost all their rights and powers in the <rs>Union</rs>, and while compelled to remain under the control of the <rs>Union</rs>, we could only do so with such rights and powers as they might accord, and on such terms and conditions as they might impose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6457"/>Over and over again, during the war, they, in like authoritative forms, proclaimed that our people had taken up arms in defence of secession under misapprehension of their purposes toward us, and that we had only to lay down our arms and continue to enjoy in the <rs>Union</rs> every right and privilege as before the mistaken act of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6458"/>We laid down our arms, and they declared we were all criminals and <pb id="p.487" n="487"/> traitors, who had forfeited every right and privilege, and were entitled to neither property, liberty or life, except through their clemency!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6459"/>Over and over again, during the war, they, in like authoritative forms, proclaimed that the seats of our members in Congress were vacant, and we had only to return and occupy them, as it was both our right and duty to do. Our people laid down their arms and sent on their members, and they were met with the startling proposition that we had neither the right to participate in the administration of the <rs>Union</rs>, nor even to make law or government for our own States!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6460"/>Addressing this Society in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, during the last summer, <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0271.0044.00487.04320" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> said: <q direct="unspecified">We were more cheated than conquered into surrender.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6461"/>The Northern press denounced this as a slander, and some of our Southern press deprecated the expression as <hi rend="italics">indiscreet</hi>! I aver to-night what history will affirm, that the <rs>English</rs> language does not contain, and could not form, a sentence of equal size, which expressed more truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6462"/>We were cheated not only by our enemies, but the profuse proclamations of our enemies, before referred to, were taken up and repeated by malcontents in our midst&ndash;any of them, too, who had done all in their power to hurry our people into secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6463"/>They coupled these professions and promises of our enemies with brazen assertions that the laws of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName> enacted to carry on the war were unconstitutional and void.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6464"/>They scattered these documents of twin falsehood and treachery among our people, to prove to them that they had a right to refuse supplies to the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6465"/>They scattered them through the army to convince soldiers it was no crime to desert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6466"/>And they scattered them among our enemies, to prove to them that our people were dividing, that our armies were weakening, and that they had only to take courage and keep up the struggle, and surrender was inevitable!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6467"/>Oh, my friends, we were fearfully, sadly, treacherously, altogether cheated into surrender!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6468"/>If the demands made after the war was over had been frankly avowed while the war was in progress, there would have been no pretexts for our treacherous malcontents; there would have been no division or wearying among our people; there would have been no desertions from our armies, and there would have been no surrender of arms, nor loss of our cause!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6469"/>Never! Never!!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6470"/>But the <rs>Northern States</rs> and people having made these demands as results of the war, when we could join no issue on them in battle, there were only legal and political forums left in which to test their justice and truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6471"/>Had sovereign States committed treason?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6472"/>Were <pb id="p.488" n="488"/> <num value="8000000">eight millions</num> of people traitors?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6473"/>Were leaders who had only obeyed their States and served their people criminals worthy of death?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6474"/>These were the great questions, and the most usual forums to determine such issues were the courts of law. There was certainly no hindrance to such a test.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6475"/>Our great chief was a prisoner&mdash;in a dungeon&mdash;<hi rend="italics">in chains</hi>! He was not only ready and willing to be tried, but demanded a trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6476"/>By himself he was most anxious to vindicate the innocence of his people; or, in himself, expiate their guilt by an ignominious death!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6477"/>Our enemies had the appointment of the judges, the formation of the court, the selection of the jury, the entire control and direction of the proceedings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6478"/>Why did they hesitate?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6479"/>why did they finally decline to try?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6480"/>Was it because of mercy, or a spirit of magnanimity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6481"/>Ah! we shall see directly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6482"/>No, they were gnashing their teeth with rage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6483"/>They knew that such a trial had no parallel in human history&mdash;they knew the whole world, and posterity for all time, would review it. <hi rend="italics">There was the written law, and they knew it had not been violated</hi>! <num value="8000000">Eight millions</num> of people, struggling as <num value="1">one</num> man for liberty, were not traitors, only because power and treachery combined to defeat and enslave them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6484"/>To try and convict, was to commit perjuries which would redden human nature with an eternal blush of shame&mdash;to try and acquit, was a judgment under oath by their own courts, that the war of coercion was itself but a gigantic crime against humanity, and a wicked violation of their own form and principles of government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6485"/>Here was the terible dilemma which confronted our accusers, and it was so palpable that all the insolence of recent triumph could not hide it, and they were left no resource but to pretend a mercy, whose necessity they despised, and turn the prisoner loose, after a long and most cowardly delay.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6486"/>The next forum in which our people had a right to be heard was the <rs>Congress</rs>&mdash;the <rs>National Councils</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6487"/>By every protest and profession of our enemies, before and during the war, the <rs>Union</rs> was preserved, and by the plain terms of the <rs>Constitution</rs> each State was entitled to representation in both branches of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6488"/>The refusal to test the crime of secession before the courts increased, if possible, the obligation to recognize this clear right of representation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6489"/>This was a rare opportunity for vindication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6490"/>The forms of government had afforded it to few defeated parties in history, and to none on such terms of fairness and equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6491"/>There was never a time when the intellect of a people was so needed for their vindication, and no people ever possessed grander intellects for the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6492"/>We had trained <pb id="p.489" n="489"/> statesmen, constitutional lawyers, skilled debaters, who were perfectly familiar with every fact, and learned in every principle involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6493"/>And, the very ablest and best of these, there was no reason to doubt every Southern State would at once, and with unanimity, return to Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6494"/>If this had been done, not only would the <rs>South</rs> have been vindicated, but the present horrible sectional acrimony, with all the black record of reconstruction, would have been avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6495"/>The reunion would have been made cordial, with secession abandoned and slavery abolished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6496"/>The Southern States would already have been far advanced in the work of material recovery, of social order and political contentment, and all the <name>States</name>&mdash;co-equals in a common Union&mdash;would be rejoicing in a manifest new lease of constitutional government and Republican liberty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6497"/>But the very reasons which made the return of our ablest men to Congress a glorious opportunity for us, made it a dreaded <num value="1">one</num> for our adversaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6498"/>Victors as they were in a physical contest, they were not willing to meet the vanquished in intellectual gladiatorship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6499"/>To protect themselves from this collision of mind they determined to add yet further crimes to their cowardice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6500"/>And now we approach the analysis of the most stupendous series of crimes ever perpetrated in human history by individuals or States, civilized or savage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6501"/>Unwilling to risk their own judges and juries, to pass legally upon the treason charged, our adversaries determined to punish without conviction&mdash;unwilling to hazard the power of equal debate upon the minds and consciences of their own people, they determined to condemn without a hearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6502"/>And why not?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6503"/>Their victims were unarmed and helpless, and the luxury of vengeance could have easy, safe, and unrestrained gratification.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6504"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> act was for Congress, composed chiefly of men who had been borne into their seats on the bloody tide of sectional hate and strife, to seize all legislative powers into their own hands, and exclude the <rs>Southern States</rs> not only from actual representation, but from the right of representatives.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6505"/>To justify this enormous usurpation, they declared the <rs>Southern States</rs> needed reconstruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6506"/>As this idea was wholly unknown to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, they boldly put themselves outside of the <rs>Constitution</rs> they had sworn to observe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6507"/>To make the work of reconstruction effective, they resolved that it belonged exclusively to Congress&mdash;the legislative department&mdash;and that the <orgName n="Department of the Executive" type="government">Executive department</orgName> could not, and should not, participate, except to furnish the military to aid in holding the victims still while the punishment was <pb id="p.490" n="490"/> being inflicted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6508"/>To prevent any embarrassing review of their measures, they further resolved that all questions arising under reconstruction were political and not judicial, and that therefore the courts could not, and should not, pass upon their constitutionality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6509"/>Thus fortified in their usurpations, and goaded by rancorous, blind, long-nurtured hate, they commenced the work of dissolving governments, destroying States, robbing, insulting and oppressing already impoverished and helpless people, and humiliating the white race!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6510"/>They entered each Southern State, and declared all existing governments to be illegal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6511"/>They outlawed and set aside all existing constituencies, the constituencies which originated State governments, and participated in forming the <rs>Federal</rs> government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6512"/>They created new constituencies, composed chiefly of ignorant negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6513"/>They offered to include in these new constituencies such of the resident whites as would consent that the usurpations were legal, and these punishments were just; and it must ever be a sad recital for all time, that some of our people were willing to barter their section, State, race and blood, for the privilege of aiding in this work of destruction, degradation, and infamy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6514"/>The future historian will weep bitter tears when he finds himself compelled to record this darkest exhibition of human treachery and depravity, and he will close up the chapter as, with nervous energy, he shall write the withering judgment of all decent humanity for all future ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6515"/>Cursed thrice, cursed forever, be the memories of such unnatural monsters among men!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6516"/>These motley constituencies of ignorance and vice, having no conception but in hate, no birth but in strife, no nursing but in usurpation, and no strength but in crime and treachery, were placed in each State under the appropriate lead of adventurous vagabonds&mdash;bankrupt in fortunes, and hungry for the spoil of their victims&mdash;paupers from birth in every sentiment of honor, and enjoying with keen relish the humiliation of their superiors!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6517"/>And these formed the government under which we have been dying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6518"/>Ignorant negroes have been made masters&mdash;proud, educated masters made slaves&mdash;robbers have been made rulers&mdash;thieves have been made detectives, all protected by Federal power, while humble submission to the remorseless demands of this insatiate wickedness has been made the only test of loyalty and devotion to that Union which our fathers helped to form in order to secure the blessings of liberty to them and their posterity!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6519"/>Many of the effects of this policy of reconstruction the future historian will have no difficulty in discovering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6520"/><pb id="p.491" n="491"/></p> 
<p>The <num value="1000000">millions</num> of taxes we have had to pay to feed these vampires upon our substances, and sickening eye-sores to our pride and honor&mdash;the <num value="1000000">millions</num> of debt piled up for our posterity to pay in bonds issued by these licensed gamblers upon the property, life and hope of the people of these States&mdash;the miscegenating orgies of loyal legislators, and reckless plundering of <rs n="carpet bag" type="product">carpet-bag</rs> governors&mdash;the readiness with which criminals were turned loose, and the equal readiness with which good citizens were arrested without warrant, tried without law, convicted without evidence, and hurried off to foreign prisons without mercy, only because they were suspected of having too much manhood to bear their wrongs with unmurmuring submission&mdash;how our lands were depreciated, our society demoralized, and all our most intelligent and virtuous citizens were denied all right to provide remedies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6521"/>These, and many more of like character, the future historian will easily see, and must see, though every glance, create nausea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6522"/>But there are other facts and incidents, not so patent to the world, and not on record, which may be found in every neighborhood, and which we ought to gather up as far as we can. Rich men have been made poor, proud men have been made humble, noble women have been insulted, innocent men have been imprisoned, many, very many, have been too weak to bear their sorrows and the sorrows of their country, and kind death has brought them a refuge from grief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6523"/>And yet the authors of all these wrongs boast of the great magnanimity and generosity they have exhibited to a fallen foe!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6524"/>They did not hang and exile our leaders, nor confiscate our property!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6525"/>What conqueror was ever before so manly and liberal?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6526"/>But they made slaves of masters, and masters of slaves, law makers of vagabonds, rulers of strangers, and tax gatherers of robbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6527"/>They declined to take life, only that they might make life a lingering death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6528"/>They did not drive us from home, only that they might make home the abode of sorrow and poverty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6529"/>They failed to confiscate our property by the usual act of government, that it might remain to be taken by negroes, thieves and strangers, as their own lawful spoil!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6530"/>Death, exile, confiscation, would end the punishment too soon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6531"/>Such vengeance craved longer revel and slower torture!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6532"/>And if we, who have been the witnesses to these horrors, and the victims of these wrongs, will only gather up and preserve the unwritten outrages and unrecorded griefs of the last <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure>, all posterity will, with <num value="1">one</num> voice, declare that the punishments inflicted by our adversaries upon the <rs>Southern States</rs> and people, under the name of reconstruction, for vindictiveness of <pb id="p.492" n="492"/> hate, for meanness of oppression, for cool, prolonged relish of torture, and for insatiate extravagance of plunder, are without parallel in precedent, civilized or heathen!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6533"/>It must be admitted that our enemies were wisely wicked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6534"/>They well knew it would never do to admit Southern intellect into the <rs>National Councils</rs> until their work was fully completed and had been made part of the fundamental law. Even when reconstruction had reached the point that the doors of Congress must be opened, they were only allowed to be opened to such as were participants in, and products of, the infamy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6535"/>The caressing fathers took only to their arms the dirty children their vengeance had begotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6536"/>In <dateStruct value="1872--"><year reg="1872">1872</year></dateStruct>, alarmed by what seemed to be a returning sense of justice at the <rs>North</rs>, aided by most remarkable concessions for peace and deliverance at the <rs>South</rs>, Congress removed the illegal disabilities imposed upon most of our leaders, though upon many even yet these dis abilities remain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6537"/>In the meantime most of our greatest men&mdash;who were most familiar with the facts of the past, so essential to our vindication&mdash;had passed away, or were rapidly passing away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6538"/>A very few of these were released from these bonds upon the use of their intellects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6539"/>But most manifestly a better opportunity had returned at last to the <rs>Southern</rs> people, and it was expected by our enemies and the world that this opportunity would be improved, and our very ablest men everywhere chosen to Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6540"/>And now comes the most curious chapter in our history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6541"/>It will puzzle the future historian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6542"/>Not a single man who was in full sympathy and accord with the <rs>Confederate</rs> administration, and who was intimate in the councils, and, daily as it progressed, familiar with the policy of that administration, has been called by our own people to a single prominent position, State or National!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6543"/>While many who gave aid and encouagement to the enemy, by disaffecting our people to that administration during the war of coercion, and refused to give counsel, or counseled consent during the baser war of reconstruction, have received high marks of confidence from our enemies, and high positions of honor from our people!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6544"/>Crowds of intellectual imbeciles, like flocks of noisy blackbirds in harvest time, rush forward to secure, by personal scramble and trade, those positions of heaviest trust and responsibility, and thus murder all hope of having any vindication of our dead, or justice for our living in the <name>Councils</name> of the <name>Nation</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6545"/>When such a State as <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, in such a crisis as this, for such a place as the <name>Senate</name>, repudiates such a statesman as <persName n="Hunter,,,,," id="n0271.0044.00492.04321" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><surname>Hunter</surname></persName>&mdash;familiar <pb id="p.493" n="493"/> with every fact of the <rs>Federal</rs> history, intimately familiar with every fact in Confederate councils, trained in debate, learned in constitutional law, courteous in manner, accurate in statement, powerful in logic, and respected even by our enemies&mdash;I think it is time to despair of doing anything in this generation to lift the <rs>South</rs> to her former position of influence and power in the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6546"/>To feed our people on frothy declamation now, however blown by procured newspaper puffs, is like feeding a starving multitude on unsubstantial snow-flakes, however piled up by capricious winds!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6547"/>There was never such a field for real, profound, patriotic statesmanship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6548"/>The very inferiority of Northern representatives, as compared with those they sent to Congress before the war, but increased the chances for Southern statesmen to remove, by proper debate in the national councils, the false theories and impressions which have been crowded into the minds of the <rs>Northern</rs> people, and thus return the general government to its constitutional limitations, restore to the <name>States</name> the free exercise of their reserved rights, and rescue from destruction for our enemies, as well as for ourselves, those great principles of constitutional government, which every purpose of the <rs>Confederates</rs> sought to maintain, and which every feature of coercion must logically tend to destroy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6549"/>Thus, denied by our enemies the opportunity of silencing by the solemn judgments of their own courts, the fierce accusations of criminality in secession, and denied by our enemies, and the follies of our own people, the glorious chance of vindicating our cause in high debate, and face to face with the chosen champions of our accusers, we have but <num value="1">one</num> resource left us for defence or vindication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6550"/>That resource is history&mdash;impartial and unpassioned, unoffice-seek-ing history!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6551"/>It is to secure a fair trial before this august tribunal that this Society has been organized to collect, prepare and perpetuate the evidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6552"/>Our enemies are exceedingly active in their efforts to get a false presentation of the testimony for the judgment of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6553"/>They are seeking to monopolize the possession of our own records.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6554"/>They readily pay more money for disjointed portions of Confederate archives than they did for the <rs>Madison</rs> papers, giving an account of the proceedings of the <rs>Convention</rs> that framed the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6555"/>It is shameful to see how much assistance they are re ceiving in their efforts to pervert and falsify our history from those malcontents who kept up such restless assaults on the <rs>Confederate</rs> administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6556"/>The men who quarrelled more with their own side, than with the enemy during the struggle, are among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> after the <pb id="p.494" n="494"/> war to rush to writing books, to give their account of the government they did so much to break down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6557"/>We owe it therefore to our dead, to our living, and to our children, to be active in the work of preserving the truth and repelling the falsehoods, so that we may secure for them and for us just judgment from the only tribunal before which we can be fully and fairly heard.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6558"/>If the full truth can be secured and preserved, we shall have nothing to fear in the comparison with our enemy which history will make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6559"/>The courage of our troops is beyond perversion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6560"/>The fact that we killed, wounded and captured a greater number of the enemy than we had soldiers in our armies, is a tribute to our gallantry and skill which the records of no civilized war can surpass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6561"/>With inferior arms and limited resources, shut up from supplies from the outside world, and with unfortunate and fatal divisions between the <rs>Southern States</rs> and among ourselves, we made a fight for independence which no people on earth ever yet equalled</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6562"/>Equally wonderful were the achievements of our statesmanship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6563"/>In the beginning we had neither government, nor army, nor navy, nor treasury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6564"/>All these we had to improvise in the very hearing of an arming foe, who had an established government, an organized army, a powerful navy, and all the sinews and appliances of war in extravagant abundance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6565"/>And yet, when the enactments and measures of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> shall be critically examined, they will be found to have sprung into existence with a wisdom, a vigor, an aptitude for the crisis and a strict conformity to all the principles of free institutions, which must challenge the admiration of publicists and statesmen for all time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6566"/>No people, ancient or modern, can look with more pride to the verdict which history will be compelled to render upon the merits and characters of our <num value="2">two</num> chief leaders&mdash;the <num value="1">one</num> in the military and the other in the civil service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6567"/>Most other leaders are great because of fortunate results, and heroes because of success.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6569"/>When the future historian shall come to survey the character of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0271.0044.00494.04324" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:39"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, he will find it rising like a huge mountain above the undulating plain of humanity, and he must lift his eyes high towards Heaven to catch its summit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6570"/>He possessed every virtue of other great commanders without their vices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6571"/>He was a foe without hate; a friend without treachery; a soldier without cruelty; a victor without oppression, and a victim without murmuring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6572"/>He was a public officer without <pb id="p.495" n="495"/> vices; a private citizen without wrong; a neighbor without reproach; a Christian without hypocrisy, and a man without guile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6574"/>He was obedient to authority as a servant, and royal in authority as a true king.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6575"/>He was gentle as a woman in life; modest and pure as a virgin in thought; watchful as a Roman vestal in duty; submissive to law as <persName n="Socrates,,,,," id="n0271.0044.00495.04327" reg="mostcommon:Socrates,nomatch:0"><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, and grand in battle as <persName n="Achilles,,,,," id="n0271.0044.00495.04328" reg="mostcommon:Achilles,nomatch:0"><surname>Achilles</surname></persName>!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6576"/>There were many peculiarities in the habits and character of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0271.0044.00495.04329" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:39"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, which are but little known, and which may be studied with profit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6577"/>He studiously avoided giving opinions upon subjects which it had not been his calling or training to investigate; and sometimes I thought he carried this great virtue too far. Neither the <rs>President</rs>, nor Congress, nor friends could get his views upon any public question not strictly military, and no man had as much quiet, unobtrusive contempt for what he called <q direct="unspecified">military statesmen and political generals.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6611"/>It is astonishing how men in high position, and supposed to be great, would make war on the whole administration for the most trivial personal disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6612"/>Failures to get places, for favorites of very ordinary character, has inspired long harangues against the most important measures, and they were continued and repeated even after those measures became laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6620"/>Conscription and impressment, especially were denounced as unconstitutional and void, and not binding on soldiers or people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6621"/>And then, the limited suspension of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> was made the occasion for a concerted movement on the <name>Legislature</name>, assembled in extra session, to array the <rs>State</rs> in hostility to the <rs>Confederate</rs> administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6622"/>It failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6629"/>Truer words never fell from nobler lips, nor warmed from the heart of a more devoted patriot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6631"/>It was his misfortune, and the misfortune of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, that this was not true of all who were in authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6635"/>This is not true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6636"/>I gave no advice on the subject, because I was not a military man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6642"/>I know that those who pressed the removal, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and most earnestly, in the <rs>Cabinet</rs>, were those who had been most earnest for <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0271.0044.00498.04357" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s original appointment to that command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6646"/>I will not give that history now. Much has been said and published on the subject which is not true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6647"/>I know why each member of that commission, on our part, was selected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6648"/>I received from <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0271.0044.00498.04359" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>'s own lips a full account of the <pb id="p.499" n="499"/> conversation between himself and the commissioners before their departure from <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 9" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6649"/>You have heard it said that the <rs>President</rs> embarrassed the commissioners by giving them positive instructions to make the recognition of independence an ultimatum&mdash;a condition precedent to any negotiations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6652"/>He gave them, in conversation, his views, but leaving much to their discretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6653"/>They could best judge how to conduct the conference when they met. His own opinion was, that it would be most proper and wise, so to conduct it, if they could, as to receive rather than make propositions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6654"/>While he did not feel authorized to yield our independence in advance, and should not do so, and while he did not desire them to deceive <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0271.0044.00499.04361" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, or be responsible for any false impressions <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0271.0044.00499.04362" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> might have, yet, he was willing for them to secure an armistice, although they might be satisfied that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0271.0044.00499.04363" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, in agreeing to it, did so under the belief that re union must, as a result, follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6655"/>I may add that <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0271.0044.00499.04364" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> had no hope of success, or of securing an armistice, after he learned that <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n0271.0044.00499.04365" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> was to accompany <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0271.0044.00499.04366" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>. <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0271.0044.00499.04367" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">is an honest, well-meaning man, but <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n0271.0044.00499.04368" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> is wily and treacherous.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6656"/></p> 
<p>I could detain you all night correcting false impressions which have been industriously made against this great and good man.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6657"/>Those who, during the struggle, prostituted public office for private gain; or used position to promote favorites; or forgot public duty to avenge private griefs; or were derelict or faithless in any form to our cause, are they who condemn and abuse <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0271.0044.00499.04370" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6658"/>And well they may, for of all such he was the contrast, the rebuke and the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6659"/>Those who were willing to sacrifice self for the cause; who were willing to bear trials for its success; who were willing to reap sorrow and poverty that victory might be won, will ever cherish the name of <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0271.0044.00499.04371" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, for, to all such he was a glorious peer, and a most worthy leader.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6661"/>I would question my own integrity and patriotism if I did not honor and admire both.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6667"/>The saddest chapter in Confederate history which the future historian will be called to write, will be that <num value="1">one</num> in which he shall undertake to define the real cause of our failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6668"/>For the truth must be told.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6669"/><num value="5000000">Five millions</num> of people, in such a country as we possess, were not conquered because our resources were inferior, or our enemies were so powerful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6670"/>All physical disadvantages are insufficient to account for our failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6671"/>The truth is, we failed because too many of our own people were not determined to win. Malcontents at home and in high places, took more men from <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0271.0044.00500.04379" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> than did <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0271.0044.00500.04380" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,:2"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6672"/>The same agencies created dissensions among our people, and we failed to win independence because our sacrifices ceased, our purpose faltered, and our strength was divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6673"/>Kind judge, let this sad chapter be short!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6674"/>But above all things we have least to dread in history on the merits of the issues which divided the contending parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6675"/>The Southern States and people must stand before the bar of history responsible for secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6676"/>The Northern States and people must stand before the same bar responsible for coercion and reconstruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6677"/>Weighed upon principle, by authority, and by effects and consequences, which of the <num value="2">two</num> positions is the more inimical to the <rs>Union</rs>, to constitutional government and to liberty?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6678"/>When the <name>States</name> formed the <rs>Union</rs>, several of them, especially New York and <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, expressly reserved the right to withdraw as a condition of ratification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6679"/>This reservation, by a well-established rule of construction, enured to all the parties to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6680"/>But no State recognized coercion to preserve the <rs>Union</rs> as a right or power, in the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, either express or resulting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6681"/>So, in the <pb id="p.501" n="501"/> very stipulations which made the <rs>Union</rs>, secession finds a justification, and coercion none.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6682"/>From <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, the ablest statesmen in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, both in the <rs>North</rs> and in the <rs>South</rs>, conceded the right of secession to the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6683"/>Some insisted it was a constitutional right, inhering in the sovereignty of the <name>States</name>, and conditioned in the terms of the compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6684"/>Others denied it was a constitutional right, but said it was only a revolutionary right, to be exercised for cause, and that infidelity to the terms, or the purposes of Union, would be sufficient cause to justify the act. But no accepted statesman, <name>North</name> or <name>South</name>, Whig or Democrat, ever contended or claimed that coercion was a right, either constitutional or revolutionary, during all that period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6685"/>So, upon the authority of all our great statesmen, including the very framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, secession will stand in history acquitted and justified, while coercion, upon the same authority, must be condemned as criminal and without excuse.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6686"/>Secession, consummated, would have divided the <rs>Union</rs>; the seceding States forming a new Union, and leaving the old Union in undisturbed enjoyment of the <name>States</name> remaining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6687"/>Coercion, consummated, would <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> destroy the chief character of the <rs>Union</rs>, by making it a Union of force, instead of a Union of consent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6688"/>In the next place, coercion, consummated, would destroy the <rs>Union</rs> and substitute consolidation instead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6689"/>The very word, union, implies the combination of separate wholes for a common purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6690"/>The moment you destroy the separate identity of the members, that moment Union ceases, and unity&mdash;consolidation&mdash;is accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6691"/>To destroy, is a greater crime than to separate or divide, and therefore, coercion is a greater crime against the <rs>Union</rs> than secession.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6692"/>Again: Secession did not interfere with the rights, or attack the sovereignty, or lessen the dignity or importance of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6693"/>Its real great purpose was to rescue all these from the consequences of threatened consolidation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6694"/>But coercion, in its very nature, asserts dominion over the <name>States</name>, and must destroy them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6695"/>Suppose we concede that secession would destroy the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6696"/>Which is the greater crime, to destroy the <rs>Union</rs>, the creature of the <name>States</name>, or the <name>States</name> which created the <rs>Union</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6697"/>But I have shown that coercion destroyed the <rs>Union</rs> as well as the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6698"/>Then, again, the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">Union of the States</orgName> was formed to secure the blessings of liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6699"/>Secession could not even impair the liberties of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6700"/>It interfered, in no way whatever, with the rights or privileges of the <rs>Northern States</rs> and people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6701"/>It sought only to make more secure the rights, liberties and <pb id="p.502" n="502"/> privileges of the <rs>Southern States</rs> and people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6702"/>But coercion, in destroying the <rs>Union</rs>, and making a consolidation, and in destroying the <name>States</name>, can have no logical result but in the destruction of all the liberties of all the people <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6703"/>Will our people never perceive the patent truth that coercion must work consolidation, and that consolidation must destroy the identity and powers of the <name>States</name> and the liberties of the people?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6704"/>To coerce a State, is necessarily to enslave the <rs>State</rs>, and to enslave the <rs>State</rs> is necessarily to enslave the people of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6711"/>And what is Reconstruction?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6712"/>It is the practical application of coercion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6713"/>It is logic turning to facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6714"/>It is coercion at its work.

<p>Is there a possible remedy for these evils?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6727"/>I should be uncandid if I did not confess to you I doubt it. There is no resurrection for dead Republics, and few have ever been restored to vigor and health after reaching our present state of decline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6728"/>I fear our people have not more intelligence and virtue than those whose histories we are but repeating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6729"/>But for <num value="1">one</num> I am willing to make the effort, and I exhort our Southern people to cherish no feeling inimical to success, and omit no duty that may promote it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6730"/>You know I never regarded secession as wise in act, for however legal or just it may or may not have been, as an abstract right I never believed it would prove practicable as a remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6733"/>But, for the sensitiveness of slavery, we might have made that fight only in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6734"/>Let therefore secession and slavery be buried out of sight, and, though late, let us make <num value="1">one</num> more determined effort in the forum of reason and at the ballot-box to save the treasures we are losing.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6736"/>There is but <num value="1">one</num> beginning for this work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6737"/>We must elevate the statesmanship of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6738"/>In all Republics an imbecile statesmanship has succeeded a civil war, and we have not escaped the scourge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6739"/>It is because men at such times rise into power on passion and hate, and not by merit and worth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6740"/>If you would purify statesmanship you must elevate it. Men of intellect, alive with ambition to lift up a falling State, are more apt to be moral, patriotic and honest, than hypocritical imbeciles who, dead to the capacity of this higher ambition, are alive only to trade, and barter in blood, religion and prejudice, in order to reap puffs, perquisites and salaries!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6741"/>In order to elevate our statesmanship, <num value="2">two</num> things, in my opinion, are indispensable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6742"/>In the first place, our people must abandon the insane habit of placing men in high civil positions simply because of military talents or success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6743"/><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0271.0044.00503.04387" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> was right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6744"/>It is contrary to the <pb id="p.504" n="504"/> very genius and safety of Republican institutions to place their civil administration in the keeping of men of military aptitude and training.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6745"/>Brave fighting is no evidence of able statesmanship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6746"/>It is usually evidence of the very contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6747"/>Otherwise, <persName n="Jack,Captain,,,," id="n0271.0044.00504.04388" reg="mostcommon:Jack,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Jack</surname></persName> was the foremost statesman of this age, and, instead of being hanged, ought to have been made <rs type="role2">President</rs> or <rs type="role2">Senator</rs> for life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6748"/>If this habit shall not cease, we shall not have a civil statesman for <rs type="role2">President</rs> this generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6749"/>In Congress, too, we have generals, and colonels, and captains, and lieutenants, sufficient to make a small army, and scarcely statesmen enough to form a good committee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6750"/>I will not allude unkindly to <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0271.0044.00504.04389" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6751"/>However much wrong he may have done otherwise, we, in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, owe him a debt, of which I have personal knowledge, and I shall never speak of him unkindly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6752"/>But I am speaking of a great principle, and if <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0271.0044.00504.04390" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> had adopted and acted upon the grand truth uttered by <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0271.0044.00504.04391" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, he would have lived deeper in the affections of his people and higher in the esteem of mankind than all the battles he has won, and all the presidential terms he can receive can ever secure for his name.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6753"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> thing, indispensable to the elevation of our statesmanship, is the reduction of congressional salaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6754"/>Upon principle, the legislators of a country, who have in their hands the purse of the people, ought not to have the power to help themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6755"/>I believe <persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n0271.0044.00504.04392" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,nomatch:0"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName> was right when he desired by constitutional provision to prohibit compensation to members of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6756"/>I am very sure the propositions of others in the <rs>Convention</rs> to fix the amount of the compensation in the <rs>Constitution</rs>&mdash;so that the members could not increase their own pay&mdash;was full of wisdom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6757"/><persName n="Madison,,,,," id="n0271.0044.00504.04393" reg="mostcommon:Madison,nomatch:0"><surname>Madison</surname></persName> uttered a truth when he said it was an indecent thing for members to fix their own compensation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6758"/>Then, again, high congressional salaries are wrong and hurtful in policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6759"/>They excite the merely mercenary, with desires to secure the seats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6760"/>This begets scrambling and trading in every election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6761"/>Men of high ability will not be parties to such contests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6762"/>Thus mercenary men get control of the <rs>Congress</rs>, and as they are chiefly moved by a passion that is insatiate&mdash;if the salary were a <measure n="100000dollars" type="currency">hundred thousand dollars</measure>&mdash;they would use the office to double the sum. This will finally reduce our statesmanship to <num value="1">one</num> governing standard&mdash;use money to get office, and use office to get money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6763"/>With few exceptions, Congress is now but a sad congregation of negroes, knaves and imbeciles, and no people ever won, or preserved, or recovered either liberty or right under such civil leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6764"/>You cannot scatter <pb id="p.505" n="505"/> a flock of carrion birds by railing at them, but if you burn up the stinking carcass that attracts them they will scatter themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6765"/>So we shall never get rid of these creatures from Congress by portraying their characters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6766"/>They cannot see the mischief they are doing, and, if they could, they have not manhood enough to be made ashamed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6767"/>But abolish the high salaries that tempt and feed them, and they will leave the places that furnish to them no other allurements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6768"/>If high salaries continue, the greatest age of American statesmanship is in the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6769"/>We shall never have another <persName n="Clay,,,,," id="n0271.0044.00505.04394" reg="mostcommon:Clay,Henry,,,:1"><surname>Clay</surname></persName> or <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0271.0044.00505.04395" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Charles,L.,,:1"><surname>Webster</surname></persName> or <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n0271.0044.00505.04396" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,John,C.,,:2"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> in the <rs>National Councils</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6770"/>These great men served willingly on a salary of <measure n="1500dollars" type="currency">fifteen hundred dollars</measure> and less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6771"/>The <rs>Butlers</rs> and Chandlers&mdash;with their negro and <rs n="carpet bag" type="product">carpet-bag</rs> allies&mdash;all but the spawn of a mad revolution&mdash;need <measure n="7500dollars" type="currency">seven thousand five hundred dollars</measure> to support their dignity!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6772"/>It is sad to see a Republic dying as other Republics have died, and the people still unable to see the evils which work death until life is extinct.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6773"/>But <num value="1">one</num> comfort the <rs>Southern</rs> people and their children must ever have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6774"/>Whether constitutional government shall continue or fail&mdash;whether the <name>States</name> shall remain or be obliterated&mdash;whether liberty shall be recovered, or die the death that knows no waking, <hi rend="italics">we shall be vindicated</hi>! If the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">Union of the States</orgName> under constitutional government, and securing the blessings of liberty, be recovered and perpetuated, the work can only be done by returning to the great principles for which we struggled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6775"/>The general government must be restrained within the limitations of its constitutional delegated powers, and the <name>States</name> restored to the unrestrained control of their domestic affairs, under their reserved rights or Union, States and liberty must perish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6776"/>If this glorious work shall have success, then the rejoicings of according States, and happy <num value="1000000">millions</num> from the <rs>Atlantic</rs> to the <rs>Pacific</rs>, and from the lakes to the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs>, will syllable forever the hallelujahs of Southern triumph!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6777"/>But if blindness, madness, hate and ambition shall continue, coercion and reconstruction, as accepted and approved principles of Federal administration, then the wail that shall come up from the universal wreck of Union, States and liberty, will drown the thunder in loud vindication of Southern wisdom and fidelity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6782"/>In consenting to accept the invitation of your Society to deliver an address to this meeting, I have thought I could not do better than to give you such information as I could gather in regard to <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> and the great struggle between constitutional principles and a physical Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6783"/>If in doing so, I shall appear somewhat in the character of a champion of my own State, I yet hope to be pardoned, both because such a position is not unbecoming a true son of the soil, and because it is almost the only theme with which I could deal without the consumption of more time and searching of records than my engagements would possibly permit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6784"/>I am induced to attempt this theme also because that, owing to the reluctance with which <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> went into the secession movement, and because there was a considerable Union feeling still left there, which made some manifestations of itself during the war, an impression has been sought to be made that she did not do altogether as much for the cause of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> as she might have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6785"/>And those who have assumed to write histories on the conflict, so far, have either designedly fed this unjust impression by a studied silence on the subject, or else they have been too much trammelled by the necessity of local panegyric to give ample motive to the <hi rend="italics">whole South</hi>. I desire to remove this impression, and to lay open the way for the truth of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6786"/>Confessing frankly that the great leaders of the war were furnished by other States, whose glories are the common property of the whole <rs>South</rs>, I desire to show what is true, that in the number of soldiers furnished, in the discipline, courage, and loyalty, and difficult service of those soldiers, in amount of material and supplies contributed, in the good faith and moral support of her people at large, and in all the qualities which mark self-sacrifice, patriotism, and devotion to duty, <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> is entitled to stand where her troops stood in battle, behind no State, but in the front rank of the <name>Confederation</name>, aligned and abreast with the best, the foremost and the bravest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6788"/>My familiarity with all the affairs of the <rs>State</rs> during the last <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of the war was such as to enable me to state facts with reasonable certainty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6789"/>The principal records of the <rs>State</rs>, covering that period, in the <orgName n="Department of the Executive" type="government">Executive department</orgName>, were seized and carried to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 5" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> by the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities in <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, where they yet remain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6790"/>And, though efforts have been made to that end, the officials would neither return the original nor permit copies to be made for the use of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6791"/>No doubt such a course was designed to serve some great and wise State policy, though exactly what it was, beyond the pleasure of irritating and disobliging our people, I have never been able to see.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6802"/>She was the last to move in the drama of secession, and went out at last more from a sense of duty to her sisters and the sympathies of neighborhood and blood than from a deliberate conviction that it was good policy to do so.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6880"/>In addition to providing for the soldiers in the field, there was still a more difficult task in providing for the destitute at home&mdash;a task which I think the military men did not appreciate properly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6881"/>For the comfort of soldiers travelling to and fro, wayside hospitals or inns were established at <placeName reg="Weldon, Halifax, North Carolina" key="tgn,2077124">Weldon</placeName>, <placeName reg="Goldsboroa">Goldsboroa</placeName>, <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7013949" n="1.000 4" reg="raleigh, wake, north carolina">Raleigh</placeName>, <placeName reg="Greensboroa">Greensboroa</placeName>, <placeName reg="Salisbury, Rowan, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076487">Salisbury</placeName>, <placeName reg="Charlotte, Mecklenburg, North Carolina" key="tgn,7013584">Charlotte</placeName>, and other chief points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6882"/>Here the sick, the wounded, and the furloughed, were entertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6883"/>But there were <num value="1000">thousands</num> of the families of the poor whose only supporters were in the army, and whom we were in duty bound to care for and keep from suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6884"/>Not only did justice and humanity require this, but good policy as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6885"/>When the paper which the husband in the army received became so depreciated that it would buy the wife and <pb id="p.515" n="515"/> children no bread, the strength and confidence of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> began to weaken at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6886"/>No cause, however just, no enthusiasm however zealous, could long withstand the cry of wife and children for food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6887"/>To meet this necessity granaries were established at several points in the <rs>State</rs>, and corn distributed in the most needy districts; committees were appointed in each county to look after the needy, and commissioners selected, whose sole duty it was to provide salt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6888"/>The State became for the time a grand almoner, and though from the very nature of the task it was impossible to effect the object completely, yet it is my opinion that no part performed in that great struggle was more deserving of praise than that effort which <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> made to provide for the poor families of those who were fighting for her independence on distant fields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6889"/>These efforts went to the very gist of our success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6890"/>Nor were these confined to the public authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6891"/><rs type="role2">Private</rs> charities and liberality abounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6892"/><placeName reg="Each county">Each county</placeName> has its list of neighborhood heroes, gray headed, quiet men, whose victories were won over the greedy passions of gain and the temptations of avarice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6893"/>They are pointed out yet as the men who would sell no corn except to soldier's wives, widows or mothers; who would sell no leather from their tanyards except to put shoes on their feet, and who did not raise in price or discount their money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6894"/>All honor to such men. And let history make mention of it as a fact, that in thus serving <name n="God" type="God">God</name> they were likewise rendering a service to their country quite as great as that of the armed soldiers, and far greater than that of the brawling politician.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6895"/>Nor did they stop with the giving of their goods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6896"/>Courage and patriotism usually go hand in hand with kindness of heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6897"/>Such an instance comes to my mind now in the person of old <persName n="Calton,,Thomas,,," id="n0271.0045.00515.04427" reg="default:Calton,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Calton</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Caldwell, North Carolina, United States" key="tgn,2001476">Burke county</placeName>, whose humble name I venture to give to the <name>Society</name> as worthy of your attention, and as a good sample of the grand but unglorified class of men among us who preserve the savor of good citizenship and ennoble our humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6900"/>Kind friends deputed an old neighbor to take the letter to him, and break the distressing news as gently as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6901"/>When made aware of his desolation, he made no complaint, uttered no exclanation of heart broken despair, but called his son in law, a delicate, feeble man, who had been discharged by the army surgeons, and said, whilst his frail body trembled with emotion, and tears rolled down <pb id="p.516" n="516"/> his aged cheeks: <q direct="unspecified">Get your knapsack, <persName><foreName>William</foreName></persName>; the ranks must be filled!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6903"/>Such were the efforts made in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, public and private, to avert the calamities of war and to sustain the spirits of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6904"/>I attribute the comparatively great efficiency of the <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> troops to these efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6905"/>In my opinion the causes of our ultimate failure begun by neglect of those at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6906"/>Our civil administrators lost the cause of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6907"/>Had it been equal in ability and tact to that displayed by our military administration&mdash;had the civilian done his part so well as the soldier&mdash;very different would have been the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6908"/>I do not mean by this to attack <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0271.0045.00516.04429" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:33"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> and his Ministers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6909"/>By no means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6910"/>They doubtless did what men could, situated as they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6911"/>I mean that class of men to whom the management of public sentiment in a Democratic government is usually entrusted failed of their part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6912"/>The <hi rend="italics">morale</hi> of our people at the beginning and for <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> thereafter was excellent; and, if it had been sustained, I maintain that we could have won, notwithstanding the fearful disparity of numbers and means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6913"/>But it was not kept up and to that defective statesmanship, which permitted the popular enthusiasm to die out, and even aided to extinguish it, must be attributed our ill success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6914"/>Few of our political leaders comprehended the situation at all when the troubles began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6915"/>In the first place, the war was resorted to in order to avoid <hi rend="italics">anticipated</hi>, not <hi rend="italics">existing</hi> evils; and the great masses of mankind who do not read <persName n="Burke,,,,," id="n0271.0045.00516.04430" reg="mostcommon:Burke,E.,A.,,:1"><surname>Burke</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hallam,,,,," id="n0271.0045.00516.04431" reg="mostcommon:Hallam,nomatch:0"><surname>Hallam</surname></persName> are only stirred permanently and deeply by present oppressions, which they <hi rend="italics">feel</hi>. Had a <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> of the outrages perpetrated since the war been inflicted upon us, or even attempted, before a blow had been stricken, there would have been no flagging of popular enthusiasm, no desertion, no <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName>, no military satrapies instead of States under the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6916"/>In the second place, the war once begun, our leaders either did not grasp the magnitude of the struggle, or, with an unwise want of candor, concealed it as much as possible from the popular intelligence, which reacted most injuriously upon the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6917"/>A frank avowal that the war would be long and desperate, and a call for volunteers to serve through its whole duration would have brought out the entire military strength of our people as well as the call for <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>. This short-sighted policy had to be repaired by a conscript act, and although it was necessary at the time, the blunder of those who created the necessity remains the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6918"/>Our people never recovered <pb id="p.517" n="517"/> from the damper inflicted on their enthusiasm by the anomalous spectacle of beholding men hunted down and tied to make them fight for freedom and independence!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6919"/>Suffering and disappointment began to produce discontent at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6920"/>Little was done to allay this feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6921"/>All eyes were turned to the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6922"/>The majority of our civic talent took service there, where, as a general thing, exultant politicians were buried without a corresponding resurrection of great generals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6923"/>The civic talent which remained at home mistook, to a wonderful extent, the temper of our people in other respects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6924"/>The Northern masses were kept up to war pitch by appeals for the preservation of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6925"/>It was a stirring war cry; filled with the most sacred associations of our fathers and their great deeds, and attuned to the proudest glories, moral and physical, of the <orgName n="American Citizen" type="newspaper">American citizen</orgName>, We had no slogan half so thrilling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6926"/>Our denunciation of abolition operated only upon the comparatively few who reflected upon its consequences, and foresaw the evils of a violated Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6927"/><num value="7">Seven</num>-<num value=".1">tenths</num> of our people owned no slaves, and, to say the least of it, felt no great and enduring enthusiasm for its preservation, especially when it seemed to them that it was in no danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6928"/>Our statesmen were not wise enough to put the issue on any other ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6929"/>In brief, it was not so arranged as that the causes of the war took hold upon the popular heart, and the real wonder is, that, sustained mainly by sectional pride and a manly, warlike spirit, the contest lasted so long as it did.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6930"/>Again: When our currency depreciated so that it would not pay the <rs>Government</rs> which issued it, a tithe law was enacted, seizing the people's goods by way of taxes, whilst their pockets were filled with the <rs>Government</rs> promises-to-pay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6931"/>Then there came another law, exempting from militia duty those who owned a certain number of slaves&mdash;an exceeding injurious measure, for which no possible advantage could atone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6932"/>These sources of discontent, added to much suffering at home, soon put matters beyond the remedial agency of the wisest statesmanship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6933"/>Enthusiasm died out; confidence fled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6934"/>Desertion began, and the deserter's place was filled by more conscripts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6935"/>The result was that not only were the discontent and suffering increased, but the just ratio between those who labor at home and those who serve in the field and consume was destroyed; so that the larger the army became the weaker it grew&mdash;lacking the healthy strength of well-organized communities behind it. Since the formation of States on the basis of civilization, and the barbarian tribes ceased to wage war by <hi rend="italics">migrating</hi> into the territory of their enemies, <pb id="p.518" n="518"/> there is perhaps no instance of a community stripped so bare of its industrial and productive forces as was the <rs>South</rs> in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6936"/><placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName>, during the <measure n="7Years" type="date">Seven Years</measure> War, is perhaps an exception to this assertion; I cannot remember any other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6937"/>From many districts-county sub-divisions&mdash;in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, I had, during <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, petitions signed by women alone, praying that A. B. might not be ordered away, as he was the only able-bodied man in their district to protect them, grind their grain, etc. But for our slaves, society could not then have moved on at all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6938"/>I have dwelt thus long on the reasons for my assertion that our cause was lost at home and not in the field in order to excuse the emphasis which I have given to domestic affairs in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> during this period, and the efforts which we made to remove these springs of discontent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6939"/>They are not unworthy of your notice, though not so exciting as stories of battles and sieges, because they go to the root of the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6940"/>And although we were not entirely successful in feeding all the poor and keeping down all discontent, yet much was done, and we had the proud satisfaction of knowing that more soldiers in better condition, hailing from old <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, were standing by the great <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> chieftains, <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0271.0045.00518.04432" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> and <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0271.0045.00518.04433" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, when the bugle sounded the melancholy notes of surrender, than from any other State of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6941"/>When it is remembered that <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> was devoted to the <rs>Union</rs>, and rejected secession until the very last, that much has been said about an unruly, disloyal Union element in her midst during the war, and that she has been accused of having an unusual amount of desertions from her ranks, it will be admitted, I trust, that we have a right to be proud that we are thus vindicated by the facts and figures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6942"/>Surely no portion of the <rs>Southern</rs> people can show a brighter record, a nobler devotion to good faith and order.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6943"/>So great was the prevalence of this unjust impression, that <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> could be easily detached from her duty to her confederates, that it seems there were some who presumed upon it for important purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6944"/>Soon after the failure of the <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> or <orgName n="Hampton Road Conference" type="conference">Hampton Roads Conference</orgName>, I was visited by <persName n="Graham,Governor,,,," id="n0271.0045.00518.04434" reg="mostcommon:Graham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Graham</surname></persName> (whose death we so recently deplore), who was then a Senator of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6945"/>After giving all the particulars of that Conference which had not appeared in the papers, and the prevailing impressions of Congressional circles about <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 9" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, etc., he informed me that a number of leading gentlemen there, despairing of obtaining peace through <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0271.0045.00518.04435" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:33"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, and believing the end inevitable and not distant, <pb id="p.519" n="519"/> had requested him to visit me and urge me as <rs type="role" reg="Governor">Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, to take steps for making separate terms with <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0271.0045.00519.04436" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and thus inaugurate the conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6946"/>That he had agreed to lay their request before me without promising to add his personal advice thereto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6947"/>I asked who these gentlemen were, and with some reluctance he gave me their names, chiefly <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> and Representatives in the <orgName n="Confederate Congress" type="Congress">Confederate Congress</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6948"/>I asked why these gentlemen did not begin negotiations for their own States with the enemy, and if they would come out in the papers with this request to me. He said they <hi rend="italics">could not</hi> take the initiative, they were so surrounded at home, and some trammeled by pledges, etc., as to render it impossible!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6949"/>I declined the proposition, of course, and asked him to say to those gentlemen, with my compliments, that in the mountains where I was raised, when a man was whipped he had to do his own hollowing; that the technical word <q direct="unspecified">enough,</q> could not be cried by proxy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6950"/>This piece of secret history will serve to show that there was a faintness of heart and a smiting together of knees in other parts of the <rs>South</rs> outside of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6951"/> 
<p>Note.&mdash;Since the synopsis of this was published, I have received a letter from an esteemed friend in <placeName reg="Hillsborough, Orange, North Carolina" key="tgn,7013708">Hillsboro, North Carolina</placeName>, who says he had a conversation with <persName n="Graham,Governor,,,," id="n0271.0045.00519.04437" reg="mostcommon:Graham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Graham</surname></persName> on the same subject, and that his recollection is that the proposition made to me was that I should take steps to withdraw the <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> troops from <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0271.0045.00519.04438" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, which would force him to surrender and thus end the war. It may be that my friend's recollection is correct.
