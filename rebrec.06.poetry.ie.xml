<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>But <num value="2">two</num> divisions &mdash; those of <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n0097.0126.00036.00412" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,John,H.,,:1"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName>'s and <persName n="Steele,,,,," id="n0097.0126.00036.00413" reg="mostcommon:Steele,nomatch:0"><surname>Steele</surname></persName>'s &mdash; were generally and closely engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>A portion of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n0097.0126.00036.00414" reg="nearbymention:Smith,Morgan,L.,,"><surname>Smith</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> made some advance under a terrible fire, in which the gallant <orgName type="regiment" key="MO6">Sixth Missouri</orgName> were most actively engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>This regiment crossed the levee, which had been occupied by the enemy as an earthwork, and was still, after being crossed, commanded by the enemy's cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>It however, led to an advance upon <persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n0097.0126.00036.00415" reg="nearbymention:Smith,Morgan,L.,,"><surname>Smith</surname></persName>'s line, but without any positive advantage to us. From certain points on the new line thus made, <placeName key="tgn,7018023" n="1.000 48" reg="vicksburg, warren, mississippi">Vicksburgh</placeName> could be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>The movements of the rebel troops in the city, and some portions of <placeName key="tgn,7018023" n="1.000 48" reg="vicksburg, warren, mississippi">Vicksburgh</placeName>, were clearly and fairly in view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>It was tempting to look straight in upon the beleaguered city, and still know that its occupation was improbable, if not impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>But so it was, and our troops lay down upon their arms on the night of the <num value="29" type="ordinal">twenty-ninth</num> with anxious hearts and high hopes that something might occur to make it practicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>The night of the <num value="29" type="ordinal">twenty-ninth</num> passed and the morning dawned without any new development being made, except that the enemy assumed a threatening position with their artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>It was evidently his intention to shell our camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>It having rained incessantly during the night, and our men having been exposed to it all, it was deemed advisable to place our troops in such a position that they would not be exposed to the enemy's cannon, and where they could examine their ammunition and clean their rusted arms, preparatory to further operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>In the mean time, our front was to be held firmly, and heavier artillery was to be placed in position behind earth-works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>The threatening preparations in front deterred the enemy from shelling the camps, and put him on his guard, for offensive operations on our part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>Wednesday was occupied by both armies in the presence of each other, throwing up new works, digging new pits, preparing for operations offensive and defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>During the afternoon of Tuesday the cries of our wounded could be heard, and an impromptu effort was made to recover them by a flag of truce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>Being irregular, and perhaps not authorized, and occasional skirmishes still going on, the flag was fired on by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>The wounded and dead of <persName n="Thayer,,,,," id="n0097.0126.00036.00416" reg="mostcommon:Thayer,nomatch:0"><surname>Thayer</surname></persName>'s and <orgName n="brigades"><persName n="Blair,,,,," id="n0097.0126.00036.00417" reg="mostcommon:Blair,nomatch:0"><surname>Blair</surname></persName>'s brigades</orgName> had to lie there and await the tedious process of official communication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>This is <num value="1">one</num> of the most horrible pictures which a battle-field presents, but frequently is unavoidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>It seems to have been so in this instance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>While a tear here and there was dropped for the dying and the dead, still the great purpose of the expedition were not accomplished, and generally our army looked forward to watch future movements.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/><dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> came and still no change from <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>The front was kept up by <persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n0097.0126.00036.00418" reg="nearbymention:Smith,Morgan,L.,,"><surname>Smith</surname></persName>'s and <orgName n="divisions"><persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n0097.0126.00036.00419" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,John,H.,,:1"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName>'s divisions</orgName>, while <orgName n="division"><persName n="Steele,,,,," id="n0097.0126.00036.00420" reg="mostcommon:Steele,nomatch:0"><surname>Steele</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> lay along <placeName reg="Chickasaw Bayou, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,2236232">Chickasaw Bayou</placeName>, ready to meet the enemy if they should make a deployment in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>Every thing was quiet on the line, and this being a favorable opportunity, a flag of truce was sent to the enemy for the purpose of recovering and attending to our dead and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/>The flag was duly recognized, the message was received and was answered, allowing us <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure> to bury our dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>The cessation of hostilities consequent to the removal of our dead and wounded, gave the sharp-shooters and pickets an opportunity to converse with each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>The conversation was opened by our pickets, by asking: <quote>How far it was to <placeName key="tgn,7018023" n="1.000 48" reg="vicksburg, warren, mississippi">Vicksburgh</placeName>?</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/>A <num value="1000">thousand</num> questions were asked, and all answered in the same defiant way.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/>While this interesting parley was going on, the wounded and dead were removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>In a very short time the field was cleared, and every thing was again quiet on the lines.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>The camps were soon astir again; orderlies and aids were galloping to and from the various division and brigade headquarters; of course it could be interpreted to mean nothing else than further orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>The critical and trying position of our army lent an additional interest to orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>They were important, for <orgName n="division"><persName n="Steele,,,,," id="n0097.0126.00036.00422" reg="mostcommon:Steele,nomatch:0"><surname>Steele</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> was ordered to make a night assault on <placeName reg="Haines's Bluff">Haines's Bluff</placeName>, while the other division commanders were to hold their fronts firm and advance, if they could, while <persName n="Steele,,,,," id="n0097.0126.00036.00423" reg="mostcommon:Steele,nomatch:0"><surname>Steele</surname></persName> was storming the enemy's works at <placeName reg="Haines's Bluff">Haines's Bluff</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>The movement preparatory to this was, for <persName n="Steele,,,,," id="n0097.0126.00036.00424" reg="mostcommon:Steele,nomatch:0"><surname>Steele</surname></persName> to mask his division from the enemy's look-outs by marching down <placeName reg="Chickasaw Bayou, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,2236232">Chickasaw bayou</placeName> to the river, put his troops on board the transports and steam quietly up the <rs>Yazoo</rs>, and before daylight debark his troops under the enemy's guns at <placeName reg="Haines's Bluff">Haines's Bluff</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>In this matter the gunboat and mortar fleets were to play an important part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>The river was lined with torpedoes, and it was necessary to clear it out before the transports could go up. This being accomplished, they were to take a position further up the river from the point of debarkation, and engage the batteries, while the troops should advance to the <rs type="place">Bluffs</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>During the day, the boilers of the steamboats designated for the hazardous business were protected by bales of hay and otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>Pilots and river men were shaky, and anxiously inquired what it meant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>No information was imparted, as the whole plan was to be kept strictly secret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1036"/><pb id="p.37" n="37"/></p> 
<p>When night came, <orgName n="division"><persName n="Steele,,,,," id="n0097.0126.00037.00425" reg="mostcommon:Steele,nomatch:0"><surname>Steele</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> marched noiselessly down the bayou, and embarked on the transports as quietly as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/>The men were instructed to be as quiet as possible on the boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/>From the orders given out, they gathered that something perilous was on hand, and seemed to be impressed with the danger they had soon to encounter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1039"/>So <orgName n="division"><persName n="Steele,,,,," id="n0097.0126.00037.00426" reg="mostcommon:Steele,nomatch:0"><surname>Steele</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> lay down to sleep at <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> that night expecting to awake to the performance of a sanguinary duty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/>During the night the fleet made a reconnoissance up the river; they attempted to work at the torpedoes, but the fog was so heavy that they could not accomplish any thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>It was also discovered that several pilots had deserted to the enemy, who would probably inform the enemy of the plan in time for him to thwart it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/>These and other reasons thus delayed the execution of this perilous undertaking &mdash; a plan which, if successful, would have been <num value="1">one</num> of the most brilliant and daring exploits of the present war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/>There was a fence half-way up the hill, and near the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line of works, which it was necessary for his troops to climb over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/>The General sheathed his sword for the purpose, and in climbing over the fence, the lower part of it was caught, which reversed the scabbard, and the sword noiselessly slipped out. He started back after other regiments in his brigade, and not having occasion to use it, he did not miss it until after the enemy had possession of the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>He regretted it very much, as it was presented to him for distinguished services in the <rs>Indian</rs> war which occurred some years ago on the frontier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>Whilst our dead were being taken off the field under the flag of truce, a soldier of the <orgName type="regiment" key="IW4">Fourth Iowa</orgName> discovered it, and slipped it on the platter which was being used to convey a wounded man off the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/>It was restored to the <rs>General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1049"/>The casualties are not as great as at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> supposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1070"/>On the morning of the <num value="9" type="ordinal">ninth</num> of this month, our regiment and the <orgName type="regiment" key="4ILCav">Fourth Illinois cavalry</orgName> started out with a guide for the retreat of the guerrillas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1162"/>The General was laid up with his wound, but on the occasion referred to, he was well enough to be bolstered in a chair, and was engaged in writing a letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1163"/>Our conversation soon turned to the <rs n="Battle of Antietam" type="battle">battle of Antietam</rs>, when he referred, with considerable enthusiasm, to what he characterized as the wonderful account of the battle given by the reporter for the <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi>. <quote>It was,</quote> said he, <quote>a perfect reproduction of the scene and all its incidents; and it is a marvel to me how you writers can perform such tasks.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1165"/><quote>I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> noticed him when we were in the hottest portion of the fight, early in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1166"/>My attention was then attracted to a civilian, who sat upon his horse, in advance of my whole staff; and though he was in the hottest of the fire, and the shot and shell were striking and sputtering around us like so much hail, he sat gazing on the strife as steady and as undisturbed as if he were in a quiet theatre, looking at a scene upon the stage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1167"/>In all the experience which I have had of war, I never saw the most experienced and veteran soldier exhibit more tranquil fortitude and unshaken valor than was exhibited by that young man. I was concerned at the needless risk which he invited, and told <num value="1">one</num> of my aids to order him in our rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1168"/>Presently, all my aids had left me, on <num value="1">one</num> service and another; whereupon, turning to give an order, I found no <num value="1">one</num> but this young stranger at my side.

He rode off with alacrity, through a most exposed position, returned with the answer, and served me as an aid through the remain der of the fight, till I was carried from the ground.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1242"/>Every crack in the floor appeared to be swarming with vermin, and none of us could say we were free from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1244"/>But few had cups, and those who had none, had to go without the pleasure of drinking cold soup, which had never heard of such an article as salt.
