<head>Preface.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>During the year <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, I chronicled the various events mentioned in the following pages, just as they impressed me by actual observation, or by authorities deemed reliable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Though my manuscript contained all the facts here presented, except a few notes made from official data, I have never considered it in suitable shape for publication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>In rewriting it, I have stricken out certain criticisms and passages hastily set down in camp or on the march, and I hope that I have improved the expression in various ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>I have endeavored to make the work a <hi rend="italics">panoramic</hi> view of military operations and events on the borders of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> and the <placeName reg="Oklahoma" key="tgn,7007707">Indian Territory</placeName> during the year <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>. <measure n="18years" type="date">Eighteen years</measure> have now elapsed since I collected the material from which my Memoirs are written, and I have not as yet met with a single book pretending to give any kind of an account of <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> the military operations of our army for any <num value="1">one</num> year during the rebellion, in that portion of the <placeName reg="Trans-Mississippi">Trans-Mississippi</placeName> region mentioned in the following chapters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Though <num value="1">one</num> might, by rummaging the archives of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, get material enough out of general orders and official reports of battles, skirmishes, etc., in that region, to enable him to write a small volume, he would get very little of the kind of material that I collected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>I noted not only the movements of the army with which I was connected, and the battles and minor engagements which it fought, but I also turned aside now and then to note a good many other things; as, for instance, the thoughts and feelings of the soldiers on various subjects, as reflected in their conversations around their camp fires and on the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>I have also given short descriptions of the country we marched over and around our camps; the <hi rend="italics">pro</hi> and <hi rend="italics">con</hi> opinions of officers and soldiers in regard to the policy of the <rs>Government</rs>, in emancipating the slaves and of enlisting the freedmen into the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>And on several occasions I give a moment's thought to natural phenomena, which were subjects of conversation in the camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The critical reader may, perhaps, think that I have in <num value="1">one</num> instance purposely arranged my composition <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> to show that <quote>coming events cast their shadows before.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>But I have not. The facts, however, show that they sometimes do. <persName n="Shelby,General,,,," id="n0009.0001.00017.00001" reg="mostcommon:Shelby,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Shelby</surname></persName>'s raid through <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1863-10-"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, affords an example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The approaching storm was indicated nearly a week before the invasion by the main force took place, and we are almost made to hear the distant rumbling of artillery carriages and caissons, and the faint tramping of marching squadrons. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Should it be asked why I have allowed <measure n="18years" type="date">eighteen years</measure> to elapse before printing my <hi rend="italics">chronicles</hi>, I reply because I felt that they should have a more careful and critical revision than I have been able to give them until lately, before going to the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>A literary composition even of this kind, like other art compositions, as in painting and sculpture, for instance, is always susceptible of improvement in the manner of presentation, without affecting its truthfulness in regard to the matter treated of. I have no doubt but that much more trimming and pruning might have been done to good advantage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>I felt such an interest in the anti-slavery cause before the war, that <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, to me, always meant a principle, and I left home at an early age to join the <rs>Free State</rs> party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It was, therefore, a real pleasure to me to <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> chronicle everything that I thought would be of interest in the future pertaining to <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> soldiers in the war. At the same time I endeavored to do full justice to the soldiers of other States serving with us in that section. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Though, no doubt, I always clearly show where my sympathies lie in the discussion of any given question, yet I do not believe that I have, in any instance, displayed strong partisan bias.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Nor have I been tempted to write anything for the purpose of producing a sensation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Future generations of that portion of the <name>Trans</name>-<placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> country covered by my Memoirs will doubtless wish to know what part, if any, the people took in the <name>Great War</name> of the <rs>Rebellion</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>But there has been, as yet, very little published in permanent and accessible form, from which they will be able to obtain the desired information, although nearly all the able-bodied men were in the <rs>Federal</rs> and <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName>, and the storms of war raged furiously over that section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>A few sketches of <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> campaigns have been written, but mere sketches are evanescent and pass away in a generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>I hope that I have done something towards filling up the hiatus which exists during the period of the most exciting events in our history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/><pb id="p.19" n="19"/> </p> 
<p>If the reader will endeavor to put himself in my place during the period covered by my <hi rend="italics">memoirs</hi>, he will then see the marches, battles, skirmishes, reconnoissances, reviews, etc., as I saw them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>As he passes about the camp alone from time to time, he will see refugees, men, women and children, of almost every conceivable color and condition, except that none of them appear to be provided with much of this world's goods and means of happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Passing to the hospitals, he will see the sick and wounded, men bleeding and mangled and torn by shot and shell, by small arms, and by the cuts and thrusts of swords and bayonets; he will see them bearing wounds, from the slightest contusions to limbs torn from their bodies; he will hear men groaning and pleading to die, that they may be relieved from their intense suffering; he will hear others, with piteous expressions upon their quivering lips, praying to be taken to their homes to die surrounded by their families and friends; he will see comrades who, but a few days before, were beaming with health and buoyant with life and hope, with the dark shadows of death seizing upon their countenances; and the grief-stricken forms of the dear ones these noble men left behind, when they staked their lives in defense <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> of their country and their homes, will rise up before him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>But passing from these scenes of death and woe, his mind is permitted to dwell upon other subjects less gloomy, and which tend to make the heart glad instead of making it ache.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>On the march and under clear blue skies, he will cross silver-eddying streams or mountain-brooks leaping and splashing and foaming along.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>And by the wayside he will drink from crystal springs bubbling out of the earth, as beautiful as sparkling fountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The scenes are constantly changing, and always interesting to anyone of healthy mind and body; and he will see landscapes of every conceivable variety, from the forest-covered mountains and hills of <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> to the grass-covered prairies and plains of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, and from the deep green of spring to the rich and variegated tints of autumn, and the snow-covered ground of winter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It is proper that I should express my indebtedness to <persName n="Gallaher,Captain,William,,," id="n0009.0001.00020.00002" reg="default:Gallaher,William,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Gallaher</surname></persName>, <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0001.00020.00003" reg="mostcommon:Phillips,William,A.,,:7"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>' <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Adjutant General">Assistant Adjutant-General</rs>, for many kindnesses and courtesies in connection with the writing of my <hi rend="italics">Memoirs</hi> while we were attached to the <rs>Indian</rs> division.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>And during the latter part of the year I received from <persName n="Blair,General,C.,W.,," id="n0009.0001.00020.00004" reg="default:Blair,C.,W.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Blair</surname></persName>, the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> of the <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> post of <placeName key="tgn,2036378" n="1.000 33" reg="fort scott, bourbon, kansas">Fort Scott</placeName> and the <rs>District</rs> of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254"><rs type="direction">Southern</rs> Kansas</placeName>, many acts of kindness and words of encouragement, for which I feel under deep obligations to him. As he was <num value="1">one</num> of the most accomplished orators in the <rs>State</rs>, and a man of rare culture and refinement, I have always considered myself fortunate that I made his acquaintance, and was permitted to regard him as my friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>I have never met any <num value="1">one</num> who came nearer my ideal of the perfectly accomplished gentleman than <persName n="Blair,General,,,," id="n0009.0001.00021.00005" reg="nearbymention:Blair,C.,W.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Blair</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>It will perhaps be thought by some that I have given undue prominence to the operations of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0001.00021.00006" reg="mostcommon:Phillips,William,A.,,:7"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>' division</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>But I think that any <num value="1">one</num> who will follow the operations of this division, will agree with me that I have not magnified its achievements or overestimated the merits of its commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Considering the number and kind of troops with which he had to operate, and the long line of communication he had to keep open from his advanced position, there was not perhaps another officer in our army who accomplished so much with a single division of troops. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>I hope that I have made the work worthy of being welcomed by the young men and women who have grown up since the war, and who desire to become acquainted <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> with the great events in which their fathers participated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>To thus commemorate the grand achievements of the men with whom I served, has afforded me real pleasure, for I felt that never before have the soldiers engaged in a great struggle deserved such a measure of gratitude of future generations as those whose heroic actions I have recorded.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>When I commenced my <hi rend="italics">Memoirs</hi> I felt sure that shortly after peace should be established between all sections of the country, the military operations with which I was connected as an humble participant would be regarded by many with deep interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>I therefore thought it worth while to undertake to chronicle the important events that came under my notice during the year <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, as I had done during the year <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>I commenced to write the following memoirs at <placeName reg="Rhea's Mills, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,2615994">Rhea's Mills, Washington County, Arkansas</placeName>, on the <dateStruct value="1862-12-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> day of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>In my chronicles I said that as our offensive operations are temporarily suspended; and as we are expecting orders shortly to move northward towards the <placeName key="tgn,7007523" n="1.000 161" reg="missouri">Missouri</placeName> line; a <hi rend="italics">resume </hi>of our operations since we came into this section last fall will be useful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Our batteries were well handled and did excellent service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>They dismounted several of the enemy's guns, knocked the wheels off some of their gun carriages and caissons, and by exploding shells killed a good many of their artillerymen and artillery horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>I saw near the peach orchard on the hill where this fierce contest was waged over the taking and retaking of the batteries above mentioned, nearly all the horses that belonged to those batteries within a radius of <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure>, and I noticed that many of them had been killed by exploding shells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>Indeed in some instances they were dreadfully mutilated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>I account for the enemy's loss in killed and wounded being larger than ours in this way. In the first place I am satisfied that <orgName n="army"><persName n="Hindman,General,,,," id="n0009.0002.00047.00078" reg="mostcommon:Hindman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hindman</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> was not as well organized and equipped as ours; though he unquestionably had several divisions of well organized troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>In the second place, I don't believe that the great body of his troops were as eager for the fray as ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>I sincerely believe that a large proportion of our soldiers were actually eager for the contest, and went into it with confidence of their strength and in the justice of our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>They felt too, that our officers would not blindly lead them into a contest in which they would be put to disadvantage in every respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Our small arms also were perhaps as a general thing superior to the small arms of the enemy, though some of their infantry regiments were armed with fine <placeName key="tgn,2317638;tgn,7014117" n="0.205 000000.8181	placename;tgn,2317638;enfield, hampshire county, massachusetts,Hampshire,Massachusetts,United States,North and Central America;0.068 000000.2727	placename;tgn,7014117;enfield, hartford, connecticut,Hartford,Connecticut,United States,North and Central America" reg="enfield, hampshire county, massachusetts,Hampshire,Massachusetts,United States,North and Central America;enfield, hartford, connecticut,Hartford,Connecticut,United States,North and Central America">Enfield</placeName> muskets with the crown stamped <pb id="p.48" n="48"/> upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>When it could be done conveniently it was probably the intention to pick up these costly arms whenever a soldier was killed or fell severely wounded, but in many instances this would have been impossible, hostile bullets were flying so thick and fast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>Several women whom I saw on the field the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> day after the battle, looking for dead or wounded relatives and friends, told me that the rebel authorities had conscripted every able bodied man in the <rs>State</rs> they could get, and put him into the army, and that the conscripts were always sure to be put into the front ranks, poorly armed and equipped, so as to draw our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fire, and so that their best trained and equipped soldiers could be reserved for the fiercest and most important contests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>From inquiries that I have made, I have no doubt but that a good many men who were indifferent as to the results of the war, and many others whose sympathies were more with the <rs>Government</rs> than with the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, were killed and wounded in .this battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>But in times like the present, if not indeed upon all questions of public and private interests, men should have decided convictions, and support them by all honorable means in their power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>On account of the few openings in the woods, his batteries could not find a sufficient number of good positions from which to sight our troops and batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>And being obliged to stick to the same positions all the afternoon, our batteries soon got their range from the smoke which arose from them, and knocked them to pieces fearfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>Our batteries constantly shifted their positions and consequently suffered very little loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>Only at the peach orchard above mentioned, did the enemy attempt to use any of his batteries at short range with grape and canister, and we have seen how that performance ended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>The batteries of both our divisions, about <num value="42">forty-two</num> pieces, all the afternoon poured a constant and terrific shower of shot and shell into the dense woods which seemed to afford the enemy shelter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>The day after the battle, in passing through this woods with an officer and several comrades, the number of torn and mutilated bodies of rebel soldiers, scattered here and there, told us plainly enough that the forest had afforded the enemy very little shelter, that though it had concealed them from our view, it had not concealed them from our exploding shells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>A few days after the <rs n="Battle of Prairie Grove" type="battle">battle of Prairie Grove</rs>, <persName n="Blunt,General,,,," id="n0009.0003.00052.00084" reg="nearbymention:Blunt,James,G.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Blunt</surname></persName> ordered his supply and baggage trains back from <placeName reg="Fayetteville, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,7014258">Fayetteville</placeName> to <placeName reg="Rhea's Mills, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,2615994">Rhea's Mills</placeName>, and our division went into camp again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>But the farms are not large like the farms in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>We have found almost sufficient forage to supply our animals, and we have also replenished the larder of the commissariat to some extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>The cattle and hogs taken from disloyal people of this section furnish us with fresh beef and pork.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>The water-power mills on the never-failing mountain streams, have rarely been burned, and turn out a good deal of flour, which is applied to subsisting the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>All commissary and quartermaster supplies for our division, with the exception of those that this section furnishes, are transported by <num value="4">four</num>-mule teams from <placeName reg="Fort Scott, Bourbon, Kansas" key="tgn,2036378">Fort Scott, Kansas</placeName>, a distance of <measure n="140miles" type="distance">one hundred and forty miles</measure>. <orgName n="division"><persName n="Herron,General,,,," id="n0009.0003.00053.00087" reg="nearbymention:Herron,Frank,J.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Herron</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> is supplied from <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532">Springfield, Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Though our base of supplies is this great distance from us; and though most of the country our trains pass over is infested with guerrilla bands that annoy our escorts by now and then picking off a trooper with their rifles or muskets, yet we have not, up to the present time, lost a train or suffered any inconvenience for want of full rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>A considerable body of our cavalry has, however, been detached from actual field service to perform escort duty, during the <rs type="season">autumn</rs> and <rs type="season">winter</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>But taking into account the amount of this kind of service, and the fact that scouting parties or reconnaissances are daily sent out in every direction, our cavalry horses are in remarkably <pb id="p.54" n="54"/> good condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>That they have stood the campaign so well, I think is due to the fact that they have been collected mostly from <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, a climate not differing perceptibly from this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>Last spring the <orgName type="regiment" key="2OHCav">Second Ohio cavalry</orgName> accompanied us on an expedition known as the <quote><hi rend="italics"><address><street n="Indian burial">Indian</street></address>, Expedition</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>The men of that regiment were mounted on fine horses brought from <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706"><rs type="direction">northern</rs> Ohio</placeName>, which were in splendid condition when the regiment left <placeName key="tgn,2036378" n="1.000 33" reg="fort scott, bourbon, kansas">Fort Scott</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>I have therefore felt convinced since that <quote>Expedition</quote> that our native animals are more suitable for army service in this section than horses raised <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="500miles" type="distance">five hundred miles</measure> north of this latitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>After an active campaign, camp life becomes monotonous to the soldier, and he begins to crave new excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>We remained in camp at <placeName reg="Rhea's Mills, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,2615994">Rhea's Mills</placeName> about <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> after the <rs n="Battle of Prairie Grove" type="battle">battle of Prairie Grove</rs> without undertaking any other important movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>Reconnaissances have of course been sent out at intervals of a few days, but in each instance return to camp without discovering any indications of the enemy in force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>But, on the evening of <dateStruct value="-12-26"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="26">26th</day></dateStruct>, I received <pb id="p.55" n="55"/> instructions to issue to the number of men reported present for duty in each company of our regiment, <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure> rations suitable for carrying in haversacks, and to be ready to march at <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time> on the morning of the <num value="27" type="ordinal">27th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>At the time designated all the cavalry, infantry and artillery, except a force deemed sufficient to guard our trains and camp, under <persName n="Solomons,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n0009.0003.00055.00088" reg="mostcommon:Solomons,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brig.-General</roleName> <surname>Solomons</surname></persName>, were in column and in readiness to march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>Very few, if any, of the officers knew where we were going, or the exact object of the expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>It was thought by some that we were going to attack the rebel army in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName> &mdash; and <placeName key="tgn,7013924" n="1.000 80" reg="fort smith, sebastian, arkansas">Fort Smith</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>It did not seem probable that it was the intention of <persName n="Blunt,General,,,," id="n0009.0003.00055.00089" reg="nearbymention:Blunt,James,G.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Blunt</surname></persName> to attack the main body of the rebel army, as we had recently received information that it was encamped around <placeName key="tgn,7013924" n="1.000 80" reg="fort smith, sebastian, arkansas">Fort Smith</placeName>,on the south side of the <placeName key="tgn,7019842" n="1.000 46" reg="arkansas river, united states, north and central america">Arkansas river</placeName>, <placeName><distance reg="4miles">four miles</distance> above <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName></placeName>.-Even if our force had been sufficiently strong to make our success reasonably certain, it was difficult to see how we should get our army across the river as rapidly as would be required, as we have had no pontoon trains such as the eastern armies are furnished with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>We thought it possible that the commanding general wished to take a more advanced position, to occupy <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName>, and to clear the country all north of the river of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>There were, however, serious difficulties to be encountered in taking this view of the-matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>Our base of supplies would be further removed from us; besides our supply trains would be obliged to pass over the <rs type="place">Boston Mountains</rs>, a rough and rugged region.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>But with a-line of stations in our rear we thought <pb id="p.56" n="56"/> that the army might move to <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName>, as we were in complete possession of <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172"><rs type="direction">western</rs> Arkansas</placeName> north of the river. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>I need not, however, recount further what our thoughts were in regard to the ultimate object of the expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>Suffice it to know that <persName n="Blunt,General,,,," id="n0009.0003.00056.00090" reg="nearbymention:Blunt,James,G.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Blunt</surname></persName> had information that a brigade of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> cavalry, under command of <persName n="Crump,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0003.00056.00091" reg="mostcommon:Crump,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Crump</surname></persName>, was encamped at <placeName key="possibilities=33" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Dripping Springs</placeName>, <placeName><distance reg="8miles">eight miles</distance> <offset>north</offset> of  <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName></placeName>, and that he wished to capture them or break up their camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>He was also informed that large quantities of quartermaster and commissary supplies were stored at <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName>, and that <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> steamboats were coming up the river from <placeName reg="Little Rock, Pulaski, Arkansas" key="tgn,7013897">Little Rock</placeName> with cargoes of supplies for <orgName n="army"><persName n="Hindman,General,,,," id="n0009.0003.00056.00092" reg="mostcommon:Hindman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hindman</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> encamped in the neighborhood of <placeName key="tgn,7013924" n="1.000 80" reg="fort smith, sebastian, arkansas">Fort Smith</placeName>, and that the steamboats would probably reach <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName> about the time he calculated we would get there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>If we could capture and destroy those supplies and steamboats, and capture or break up <persName n="Crump,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0003.00056.00093" reg="mostcommon:Crump,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Crump</surname></persName>'s camp it would of course cripple the rebel army in <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> to a very great extent,besides it would add to its demoralization, which was already great since the <rs n="Battle of Prairie Grove" type="battle">battle of Prairie Grove</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>We heard even before that battle that their supplies were scanty in many respects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>I don't think that the rebel soldiers had any genuine coffee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>We heard that they had not, and I saw in the haversacks on a number of their dead bodies at <placeName reg="Prairie Grove, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009301">Prairie Grove</placeName>, nothing but a kind of meal made of parched corn, a piece of bacon and a piece of black looking bread, which we could not eat unless we felt the pinch of hunger more keenly than <pb id="p.57" n="57"/> we have at any time in the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>When I saw their dead bodies scattered over the field, I could not help feeling that most of them surely had no definite notion of what they were fighting for. Though in death, particularly of a soldier who has died on the battle field in the midst of fire and smoke and dust and excitement, I suppose we cannot judge accurately how he looked when living; yet I think that most of the enemy's dead I saw on the field must have been poor men; who probably never owned a slave, nor never would have owned <num value="1">one</num> even if slavery were permitted to remain an institution of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Under such circumstances I sincerely pity those men who are sacrificing their lives to perpetuate and sustain an institution that never has had, and never will have, any sympathy for them in their ignorance and poverty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Should I or my brother fall any day, we know that we shall have fallen in defense of our government, which is, perhaps, the best the world has yet seen; but we also know that we shall have fallen in defense of a principle which has for its object the making of all men free and equal before the law. Had not such thoughts as these been in my mind, I could never have persuaded him to leave his home and young wife, to enlist into the <rs>Federal</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>If we come out of the war safe, we feel that we will have an interest in the future, but that if we do not come out safe, that our sacrifice will not have been for nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>We know that the cause for which we are striving does not tend to establish am aristocracy or privileged class, which <pb id="p.58" n="58"/> shall in various ways be favored by the laws of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>Though we may not live to enjoy the blessings we hope will come when the storms of war shall have passed away, there is at least a satisfaction in believing that there are those who are dear to us who will enjoy these hoped &mdash; for blessings. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>But let us not dwell too long upon such thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The expedition is all ready to start.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>At <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time> it is rather chilly, for the temperature is a little below the freezing point, as the puddles in the road are covered with thin sheets of ice. The <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4inches" type="distance">four inches</measure> of snow that fell a few days ago, have not quite disappeared, and as all the little depressions in the road are filled with water or slush, the outlook for the infantry and artillery is not very cheerful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>But a few hours marching brought us daylight and into a region where the snow and ice had entirely disappeared, and where the roads were firmer and inclined to be somewhat rocky.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>By <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> we had struck the head of <placeName key="possibilities=83" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Cove Creek</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>It winds through the mountains in a southerly direction, and as it is fed by mountain streams, now regular torrents, it of course increased in size and volume as we descended it, The rapid melting of the snow in the mountains, and the heavy rain-fall the day before we set out, swelled it to overflowing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>We had crossed it when we bivouacked at <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time>,that night, according to my count, <num value="33">thirty-three</num> times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>We were on the march the next morning at <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> and crossed it <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> times before daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>We had heard that we should be obliged to cross it <num value="39">thirty-nine</num> <pb id="p.59" n="59"/> times; and I think we did. This would be crossing it somewhat more than once every mile on an average.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>The infantry, when they <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> came to it, could cross it dry shod, by stepping from stone to stone, as its swift current ran splashing and foaming along.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>When they crossed it the next time they got their feet wet, but kept their pantaloons dry by turning them up. The <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> and <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> times they waded it with their shoes on and their trousers rolled up. After this they fenced against the waters no further, except to see to it that their cartridge boxes were kept dry inside, and they themselves should not be washed down the swiftly running current, for when we bivouacked that night at the most favorable crossings that could be found the water was well nigh to the armpits of the men. It was almost ice-cold, for it came mostly from melted snow that had just run down in the mountain brooks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>The men, however, stood this extraordinary day and night's march without a murmur, and in fact from conversations with several infantry-men just before we bivouacked, appear to have suffered less discomfort than I supposed they would.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Though their clothing to, their waists was wet all the afternoon and evening, the physical exercise of marching kept them from getting chilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>Immediately after we halted that night on the bank of <placeName key="possibilities=83" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Cove Creek</placeName>, a <num value="1000">thousand</num> blazing fires were kindled, and the infantry-men dried their clothing; and food and a refreshing sleep prepared them for the next day's march, which would determine the object and success or failure of the expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>A few <pb id="p.60" n="60"/> moments after the bugle sounded the halt, I rode back towards the rear of the column, and listened to the conversations of the men, and talked to some of them myself, so that I might form some idea of the feelings of those whose march had been so disagreeable and fatiguing, for we had marched since we left <placeName reg="Rhea's Mills, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,2615994">Rhea's Mills</placeName>, upwards of <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure>. I found the infantrymen quite cheerful, and the artillery men thought that their ammunition had not been perceptibly damaged by the water splashing against the caissons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>Late in the evening the caissons of our howitzers were detached and put into an ambulance to keep the ammunition dry. The ambulances had been obliged to take up also a few men during the day, but the number was much smaller than I supposed it would be. After the men had dried their clothing and taken such food as their appetites demanded, they spread their blankets on the ground, and threw themselves upon them, and soon sweet sleep closed their eyes, and they were wandering through the realms of dream land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>If during their waking moments the cares and fatigues of the day had prevented their thoughts from often turning homewards, no doubt but that in their calm sleep many dreamed of pleasant conversations with their families and dear relatives and friends at home, And perhaps pleasant smiles played upon the faces of some who, in dreamland, thought that they were watching the pranks of their rollicking children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Such were the thoughts that came into my mind concerning my comrades, until gentle sleep came to me, bringing that which nature demanded I should accept, rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/><pb id="p.61" n="61"/> </p> 
<p>Within a space of less than <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>, in a narrow gorge in the mountains, near the margin of the noisy, foaming and gurgling stream, thus slept <num value="3000">three thousand</num> men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>At <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> next morning the bugles sounded,, and in a few moments our entire force was in readiness to resume the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>About <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure>, however, were given us to feed our horses and take such food ourselves as would satisfy the pinch of hunger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>A few hours of refreshing sleep is beyond doubt very beneficial to an army, after constant marching all day. The sky had become partly overcast during the night, so that it was pitch dark when we resumed the: march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>I could not distinguish the color of my gray horse sitting on him. The proximity of the steep sides of the mountains would have made it quite dark even had it been a clear moonlight night, unless the moon had-been high in the heavens near: the zenith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Several companies of the <orgName type="regiment" key="2KACav">Second Kansas cavalry</orgName>, under command of <persName n="Cloud,Colonel,W.,F.,," id="n0009.0003.00061.00094" reg="expanded:Cloud,William,F.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Cloud</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the most dashing cavalry officers of our division, was given the advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>As already mentioned, we crossed the provoking stream <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> times before daylight and left it, having passed the mountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>They probably wished it was not necessary to <pb id="p.62" n="62"/> take a cold water plunge so soon after awakening from profound sleep. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>We continued to --march along leisurely, occasionally halting a few moments to allow the infantry and artillery to close up, until towards <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time>, when a report came along the column that our advance guard had come upon the enemy's pickets who, on discovering us, fled towards their camp in the direction of <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Our advance pursued them closely, so that they should not reach their camp in time to give the rebel troops many moments warning of our approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Our movements gradually quickened, and shortly our cavalry was in full gallop, which was kept up for <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> and until we came in sight of the enemy's camp at <placeName key="possibilities=33" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Dripping Springs</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>In the meantime <persName n="Blunt,General,,,," id="n0009.0003.00062.00096" reg="nearbymention:Blunt,James,G.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Blunt</surname></persName>, who had kept up with us, sent back an order for the artillery and infantry to move forward with a quick ,step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>The enemy, under command of <persName n="Crump,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0003.00062.00097" reg="mostcommon:Crump,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Crump</surname></persName>, of a Texas cavalry regiment, were encamped along the north side of a hill, and immediately north of their camp were several fields with intermediate spaces covered with undergrowths of woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>But when we came to the fences inclosing the fields, there was scarcely a moment's delay, for they were instantly thrown down and we came into line of battle in a trot, and charged across the field in a full gallop, and when within <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> of the enemy's camp, delivered a volley into the ranks of those who had formed in line <pb id="p.63" n="63"/> and thought of making a stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="2KACav">Second Kansas cavalry</orgName> took the left of our line, and the <orgName type="regiment" key="6KACav">Sixth Kansas cavalry</orgName> and several companies of the <orgName type="regiment" key="3WICav">Third Wisconsin cavalry</orgName> the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>After firing a few rounds from our carbines, <persName n="Blunt,General,,,," id="n0009.0003.00063.00098" reg="nearbymention:Blunt,James,G.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Blunt</surname></persName> ordered the bugles to sound the charge, and with gleaming sabres we dashed forward like a whirlwind, throwing up a perfect cloud of dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>The enemy did not wait to feel the edges of our sabres, but fled in the direction of <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName>, and in their flight left their tents, camp, and supplies of every kind in our possession. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>After charging through their camp we could not preserve our line of battle in perfect order, on account of the broken condition of the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>Nor was it necessary as the enemy had broken up completely, and thought only of saving themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>We were cautious, however, as we did not know but that they had formed another line back some distance, with the determination of contesting our advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="6KACav">Sixth Kansas cavalry</orgName> and <orgName type="regiment" key="3WICav">Third Wisconsin cavalry</orgName>, therefore, moved right straight forward over the steep hill south of their camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>But when we were passing down the southern slope of the hill, we saw from the clouds of dust hanging over the high road leading to <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName>, that they had no intention of making a stand short of that place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>We also learned from several rebel soldiers and teamsters, whom we had captured, that they were completely surprised, and that their retreat had become a stampede.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>We now changed from line of battle to columns of fours, and struck the gallop again, preserving such order <pb id="p.64" n="64"/> as was possible, and chased the flying enemy to <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName>, and when they passed through the city we were right at their heels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>If the city had any <orgName n="Home Guard" type="militia">Home Guards</orgName> or military organization to defend it, the men disappeared on our approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>We therefore followed the enemy right through the city, making the dust fly in the streets so that they had no time to form in line, or to take the steamboats lying at the wharves to cross the river, but continued their flight on the road along the north bank of the <placeName key="tgn,7019842" n="1.000 46" reg="arkansas river, united states, north and central america">Arkansas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>A squad of rebels, however, attempted to escape over the river on a horse-power ferry, but they had scarcely reached the middle of the stream when they were discovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>The <num value="2">two</num> mountain howitzers of the <orgName type="regiment" key="6KACav">Sixth Kansas cavalry</orgName>, which had kept up with us during the entire chase, were immediately brought down to the wharf, and after firing several fuse shells at the boat, struck the horse at the wheel and killed him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/><num value="4">Four</num> steamboats with cargoes of supplies for the rebel army, on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> signal of our approach, got up steam and made an effort to escape down the liver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/><num value="2">Two</num> of them had proceeded a mile or so down the river, but as the channel now changed to near the north bank, and as our cavalry and <num value="1">one</num> of our howitzers were waiting for them, a single shot from the <pb id="p.65" n="65"/> howitzer convinced the officers that it was useless to make further efforts to escape, and hastened to display a white flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>The boats were boarded by several of our officers and <num value="2">two</num> squads of soldiers, and then directed to steam back up the river to <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>The other <num value="2">two</num> boats did not get more than <measure n="0.5mile" type="distance">a half mile</measure> below the city, as they were detained some time in endeavoring to find a landing on the opposite shore for a party of rebel officers and citizens they had taken aboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>They got near enough to shore, however, to allow nearly all the rebels to escape in small boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>It was the intention to also leave the steamboats at a landing near the opposite shore, but, as the engineers and officers had not left them, they were compelled, when the <num value="2">two</num> lower boats came up with the armed Federal soldiers on board, to get up steam and take their boats back to the city. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>The pursuit of the flying enemy having been given up, our cavalry having returned to the city, and the boats having been made fast to their moorings, we dismounted on vacant lots and squares, and soon found abundance of forage for our tired and hungry horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Nor had we any difficulty in replenishing our haversacks from the rebel commissary supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Such of the noncombatant population as showed themselves seemed perfectly amazed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>A few hours before their city was as peaceful as the mist we had lately seen resting on the mountain side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>No <num value="1">one</num> dreamed that the <quote>Yankee</quote> foe was rapidly approaching; and being a bright <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> many of the good people had been to <pb id="p.66" n="66"/> church, and were just returning home when the alarm was given that we were near at hand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Immediately after the boats had been made fast, several more of our officers went aboard them to examine their cargoes and to obtain such information as they could get from those who had remained in charge of them, in regard to the strength, movements and intentions of the rebel army in the vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>As we seemed to be in quiet possession of the city, a good many of our officers and soldiers left their horses where they had dismounted to feed them, a few blocks back from the river, and also came down to the river front to look at the captured boats.

After an interval of a few seconds there came another, and still another, and we looked in the direction from whence they came and saw a rebel battery near the opposite shore and the smoke rising from it. We retired to our horses to await orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>But in the meantime our infantry and artillery were coming up and soon arrived on the heights overlooking the city, the river and the country far off to the south.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>It was <pb id="p.67" n="67"/> now perhaps after <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time>, and the artillery duel over the river immediately commenced and lasted until dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>The distance, however, which separated the combatants was so great that no loss was sustained by our troops, and probably not much by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>The shot and shell from the enemy's guns fell short of our position on the heights of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>But the percussion shells from our rifled guns I could see flew over the river and struck very near where the enemy's batteries were posted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>I could not see whether they inflicted any damage to the enemy, as they were covered by the timber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Whenever <num value="1">one</num> of our percussion shells struck a tree or solid object, I could see by the smoke that arose that it exploded with terrific violence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>It was not necessary for our cavalry to make any material change in position after the cannonade opened, as it was covered by blocks of brick buildings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>Some of the officers and soldiers, however, desired to occupy positions where they could get a good view of the rebel batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Late in the afternoon the echo of the thundering artillery seemed to roll down the river to a great distance, gradually growing fainter until it had died away. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>While we were not much disturbed by their cannonade, the people of <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName> were greatly agitated; and well they might be, for it was their friends who were firing shot and shell into their city, and endangering their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>We felt somewhat surprised that <persName n="Hindman,General,,,," id="n0009.0003.00067.00102" reg="mostcommon:Hindman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hindman</surname></persName> should have permitted the shelling of the city without any warning to the inhabitants, inasmuch <pb id="p.68" n="68"/> as they were nearly all his own people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Even we, as enemies, would not have committed such an act without giving the women and children and old men an opportunity of leaving the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>I heard that several persons, women and children, were killed and injured by exploding shells from the enemy's guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>I was unable, however, to collect .exact information of the casualties in the city, as we were under <hi rend="italics">strict</hi> orders to observe great vigilance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>It was not known but that <persName n="Hindman,General,,,," id="n0009.0003.00068.00103" reg="mostcommon:Hindman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hindman</surname></persName> would show fight, as we understood that he had an army of <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12000">twelve thousand</num> men in the neighborhood of <placeName key="tgn,7013924" n="1.000 80" reg="fort smith, sebastian, arkansas">Fort Smith</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Night came on, and we could see from the heights of the city to the heights on the south side of the river, that the enemy were displaying great activity from some cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>But whether they were retreating or concentrating their forces at some point in the vicinity, we were unable to decide. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>After dark, the enemy withdrew his batteries and the thundering of the artillery ceased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>And now the disposition of the contraband property awaited the orders of <persName n="Blunt,General,,,," id="n0009.0003.00068.00104" reg="nearbymention:Blunt,James,G.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Blunt</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>The steamboats, after taking from them such supplies as he wished to take back with us, he ordered burned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>Before setting fire to them a number of officers and men were permitted to take from them something of insignificant value, to serve as a memento of the expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>I got a blank book from the <quote><hi rend="italics"><term type="ship">Steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Rose Douglas</rs></hi></quote> to keep my Chronicles of our operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>The burning of the boats made a tremendous fire, and lighted <pb id="p.69" n="69"/> up the country for miles around.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>When the flames, which were soon climbing high in the sky, were <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> noticed by the people, they thought we were going to burn the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>But their fears were soon dispelled when they were assured that only the destruction of contraband property was intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/><rs type="role2">Private</rs> property was respected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Though the population of the city is perhaps upwards of <num value="2000">two thousand</num>, yet I did not hear of a single complaint of trespassing upon private premises; or of any rude conduct of our officers or soldiers towards the ladies of <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>I speak of this with some pride, for I found that the non-combatants were strongly impressed with the notion that our <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> troops were a kind of Vandals or barbarians, lawless, and utterly disregarded the methods and usages of civilized warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>As our division is composed of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> troops, with the exceptions already noted, I think we may justly feel proud of their conduct upon every field, and of the results of the campaign up to this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Since we attacked the enemy in the last engagement at <placeName key="tgn,2059878" n="1.000 22" reg="newtonia, newton, missouri">Newtonia</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="-10-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, we have driven him, step by step, before us; so that now there is not a rebel organized force north of the <placeName key="tgn,7019842" n="1.000 46" reg="arkansas river, united states, north and central america">Arkansas River</placeName>, excepting guerrilla bands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>But notwithstanding the series of splendid achievements, we hear that <persName n="Blunt,General,,,," id="n0009.0003.00069.00105" reg="nearbymention:Blunt,James,G.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Blunt</surname></persName> has made this expedition in the face of orders to fall back from <placeName reg="Rhea's Mills, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,2615994">Rhea's Mills</placeName> to the southern line of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>If this be true, it is to be deeply regretted, for our toils in this campaign will count for almost nothing; <pb id="p.70" n="70"/> and we surrender back to the enemy all that we have gained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>I do not believe that, if the <rs>Department Commander</rs> thoroughly understood the situation here, he would permit this army to abandon this section after we have gained it at the cost of so many bloody contests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>Though we have reliable information that the enemy are greatly demoralized; yet if we fall back from our present position, it will be almost equivalent to a defeat on the field, and he will doubtless feel encouraged to quickly organize his shattered forces and follow us up. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>At <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time> we received orders to be in readiness to march the next morning (<num value="29">29</num>), at <time value="7oclock">seven o'clock</time>, on our return to <placeName reg="Rhea's Mills, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,2615994">Rhea's Mills</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>But before we commence our return march, let us take a glance at <placeName key="possibilities=33" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Dripping Springs</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>When we passed through the rebel camp there, it was about <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time>, and the rebel soldiers had apparently just finished their breakfasts, for their mess pans, camp kettles, etc., indicated that their cooks had not yet <quote>washed their dishes.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Their tents were standing just as they had occupied them; and broken gunstocks lay scattered over the camp, showing that they had given a moment to the destruction of such property as they could not take with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>A number of teams were harnessed and ready for some service when we came upon them, for on the road to <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName> I saw not less than <num value="20">twenty</num> wagons partially upset and in attitudes showing that they had been suddenly abandoned by having the mules or horses cut loose from them to enable the <pb id="p.71" n="71"/> driver and parties in them to escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Articles of camp and garrison equipage, and even ammunition, lay scattered upon the road all the way to <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>When we reached the city, the enemy's Military Telegraph was in perfect working order, but I did not hear whether <persName n="Blunt,General,,,," id="n0009.0003.00071.00106" reg="nearbymention:Blunt,James,G.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Blunt</surname></persName> sent his compliments to <persName n="Hindman,General,,,," id="n0009.0003.00071.00107" reg="mostcommon:Hindman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hindman</surname></persName> or not. He could have done it had not more important matters occupied his attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>The circuit, however, was soon broken on the <rs type="place">Little Rock</rs> as well as on the <rs>Fort Smith</rs> end of the line. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>On the morning of the <num value="29" type="ordinal">29th</num> we set out on our return march to <placeName reg="Rhea's Mills, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,2615994">Rhea's Mills</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Many of the soldiers had their haversacks crammed with sugar and the best things the enemy's commissariat afforded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The troops and animals had a bountiful supper and breakfast, and a good night's rest, and seemed as fresh as if they had been in camp a month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Guards were posted during the night at every necessary point, so that we would not be subject to surprise by the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>The expedition accomplished all that could be reasonably expected of it. We did not capture many prisoners, but we destroyed a large amount of rebel public property, and property pressed into rebel service by the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities; besides bringing away with us considerable quantities of such of the captured supplies as we can use. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>While the ladies of <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName> did not, as far as I know, take pleasure in expressing their hatred of <quote><placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName></quote> as they call us in that section, or show by their actions that they hated us at all, yet I think that <pb id="p.72" n="72"/> they are nearly all strong adherents of the <rs>Southern</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>If there were any Union families in the city at the beginning of the war, they probably managed to move north long before we arrived. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>We bid good-bye to <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName>, but not without thoughts of returning again to stay until this contest shall have been decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Our return march was conducted leisurely; the weather was pleasant and warm, and <placeName key="possibilities=83" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Cove Creek</placeName>, the winding mountain stream, had fallen almost to its ordinary dimensions and volume, so that the infantry were much less inconvenienced in crossing and re-crossing it than when we came out on the <dateStruct value="--27"><day reg="2">27th</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/><hi rend="italics">Hail, Happy New Year</hi>! I welcome you; though I know not what you have in store for us. We have no seer or prophet to unfold to us in doubtful and mysterious language the most important events which you will disclose to us in due time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>But we have reason to hope that, with honesty of purpose and persistence in the right, on the part of our leaders and of each of us, we shall have made substantial progress in accomplishing the objects for which we are striving, when you shall have expired. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>The New Year was ushered in by a national salute <pb id="p.75" n="75"/> fired from the batteries of <orgName n="Division"><persName n="Herron,General,,,," id="n0009.0004.00075.00117" reg="nearbymention:Herron,F.,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Herron</surname></persName>'s Division</orgName> still encamped on the battle-field of <placeName reg="Prairie Grove, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009301">Prairie Grove</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>But to the soldier in the field, in camp and on the march, it has no more significance than any other day. It is impossible for him to observe the forms of polite society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>His feelings of happiness find expression in a sterner manner than that of flying around in full dress suit, <rs n="kid gloves" type="product">kid gloves</rs> and swallow tail coat, and in indulging in pretty conceits with charming maidens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>He takes more pleasure in relating to his comrades around the camp fire some adventure in which he took a part, or some hair-breadth escape; how, for instance, he grasped the guidon or standard from the hand of a fallen comrade, while the enemy's bullets were flying around his head as thick as hail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>With all the hardships and dangers which war entails on the soldier in the field, his disposition is generally not only not gloomy, but on the contrary, cheerful and happy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>No doubt sad thoughts flit through his mind in regard to loved ones at home, but as fresh excitements are coining up every day, and as old battle scenes and incidents have to be gone over occasionally, his mind is never allowed to dwell long on those ideal pictures which have a natural tendency to produce gloominess. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>The rumor that, on the return of our division from <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName>, the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Army of the Frontier" type="army">Army of the Frontier</orgName></hi> would move north-ward, turned out to be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>On the morning of <dateStruct value="1863-01-02"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg="2">2d</day>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, the <orgName type="division" n="Division 1">First Division</orgName> struck tents, left <placeName reg="Rhea's Mills, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,2615994">Rhea's Mills</placeName>, and took up a line of march for <placeName reg="Elm Springs, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,2008180">Elm Springs</placeName>, about <measure n="22miles" type="distance">twenty-two miles</measure> north.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>The General <pb id="p.76" n="76"/> Hospitals were established at <placeName reg="Fayetteville, Cumberland, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014292">Fayetteville</placeName> several days ago, and most of the sick and wounded have been removed there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>It is the chief town in <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172"><rs type="direction">northwestern</rs> Arkansas</placeName>, and is capable of affording much better facilities for properly caring for sick and wounded soldiers than could easily be provided at <placeName reg="Rhea's Mills, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,2615994">Rhea's Mills</placeName> or <placeName reg="Prairie Grove, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009301">Prairie Grove</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>When it is possible, I think our surgeons prefer substantial buildings for hospitals to the <rs type="place">Field Hospital</rs> tent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>If we were in railroad communication with the rest of the country, a good many of our wounded could be sent to their homes, where they would have loving wives, mothers, daughters and friends to look after them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>Those who are conscious that they will never recover from their wounds or sickness, often give vent to the expression, that they would be perfectly content to die if they could only be permitted to die at home, surrounded by their families and friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>If a young man gets severely wounded, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing he thinks of is his mother or his sweetheart; if a married man, his wife and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>But a grateful government will not neglect to provide justly for the widow and orphaned children, or mother of the soldier who dies in defense of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>All this intense longing for the affectionate regard of those at home we know is not unappreciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>The letters we receive from time to time from our relatives and friends, are teeming with love and affection, and are convincing enough that there are lacerated hearts at home as well as in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>It is the consciousness that there exists these loves and affections that touches <pb id="p.77" n="77"/> so deeply the heart of the soldier; and I believe it is these strong affections that make the effective soldier, for he feels that he is fighting for the protection and happiness of those he loves, and whose lives are as dear to him as his own life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>If he thought that by going to war it would ultimately subject his family to greater peril, and bring upon it greater unhappiness, he would not go. We regard a man as having lost his manhood if he shows no concern for the happiness and well-being of his family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>And in social organization the family is the social or political unit, and whatever weakens family ties and interests must in time weaken the social fabric. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>On the evening of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">2nd</num> we camped on <placeName key="possibilities=14" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Wild Cat Creek</placeName>, having marched a distance of about <placeName><distance reg="16miles">sixteen miles</distance> from <placeName key="tgn,2615994" n="1.000 10" reg="Rhea, Washington, Arkansas">Rheas Mills</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>A heavy rain last night put the roads in bad condition for our trains and artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>But as there is no necessity for rapid movement, and as our backs are turned towards the enemy's heels, we can afford to march leisurely, so as not to injure or break down our animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>Officers and men who have served in a campaign like that we have just closed, soon learn how important it is to take every possible care of their cavalry, artillery and draught animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>We arrived at <placeName reg="Elm Springs, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,2008180">Elm Springs</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="--3"><day reg="2">3rd</day></dateStruct>, and there seems to be a prospect of our remaining here several days, as we hear that there is going to be shortly a reorganization of the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Army of the Frontier" type="army">Army of the Frontier</orgName></hi>. <persName n="Blunt,General,,,," id="n0009.0004.00077.00118" reg="nearbymention:Blunt,James,G.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Blunt</surname></persName> has been relieved, and bade his troops farewell to-day, and, with his staff and escort, started to <placeName key="tgn,2036378" n="1.000 33" reg="fort scott, bourbon, kansas">Forts Scott</placeName> and <placeName reg=", , " key="tgn,701391">Leavenworth</placeName>. <pb id="p.78" n="78"/> On account of his personal bravery and the brilliant achievements of his campaign, he has greatly endeared himself to his troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>I speak from personal knowledge of his bravery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>He was to the front all day during the battle of <placeName key="tgn,2007888" n="1.000 28" reg="canehill, washington, arkansas">Cane Hill</placeName>, and was only a few yards from <persName n="Jewell,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0004.00078.00119" reg="mostcommon:Jewell,Lewis,R.,,:2"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Jewell</surname></persName> when he fell mortally wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>At <placeName reg="Prairie Grove, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009301">Prairie Grove</placeName> too, he was on the field all the afternoon in dangerous positions, directing the movements of his troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>And at <placeName key="possibilities=33" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Dripping Springs</placeName> he was at the front with us when we charged the enemy's camp, and rode with the advance squadrons when we dashed into <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>How well he would succeed in a campaign which required of the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs> that every movement of his troops should be made with a distinct but involved end in view, I, of course, have no means of knowing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>He is probably able to meet any movement his opponents are able to make on the military chess board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>My own impression, however, is, that if a campaign in this section were conducted according to the military science taught at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, and embodied in <persName n="Schofield,General,,,," id="n0009.0004.00078.00120" reg="nearbymention:Schofield,John,M.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Schofield</surname></persName>, the enemy could soon put us on the defensive, and we should never accomplish anything except our destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>If military science is a common sense view of contending with your foe, of warding off his blows and of striking him most effectively, I believe in it. But if it be a mysterious method of directing the movements of troops, which no <num value="1">one</num> can understand unless he be a graduate of <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, then I have little confidence in it. A special education for a special purpose is always <pb id="p.79" n="79"/> desirable, and a military education no doubt qualifies men for organizing and skillfully handling large bodies of troops in time of war; but there seems to be such a tendency among the graduates of <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> to want to do something incomprehensible to the common mind, as to make many of them utter failures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>Perhaps only a small percentage of each graduating class display any special aptitude for military science, or for any particular arm of the military service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>It amounts to this, a blockhead sent to <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> is as apt to come out a blockhead as if he had been sent to any other school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>If a boy who has a natural military genius goes to the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName> and graduates, and afterwards has an opportunity to develop his military genius, I think the chances are that he will make a great military commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>Such special aptitudes may be inherited through a line of ancestors, or they may be due to powerful antenatal influences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/><placeName reg="Beulah Island Landing, Desha, Arkansas" key="tgn,2165488">Napoleon</placeName>'s military genius is said to have been due to the latter cause. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>I understand that he has virtually been in command of it since our return from <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>Had he arrived here a few days sooner, it is probable that the expedition to <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName> would never have been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>He is a graduate of the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName>, and I suppose that military operations will now be conducted according to the military science taught at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>We shall see. In the first place it seems that we are already <pb id="p.80" n="80"/> under orders to continue our march further northward, though there is not an officer or soldier in our division who does not.feel sure in his own mind that there is not an organized force &mdash; of the enemy in <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172"><rs type="direction">western</rs> Arkansas</placeName>, north of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>If this be true, and the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs> should know whether it is or not, then why continue to fall back and give up the country we have gained at the cost of so many lives and of so much toil and suffering?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>Is it because the present <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs> did not direct the movements of our army in gaining the splendid victories that we have won?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>After we had gone through a few evolutions upon the field, we then formed in line, and in a short time <persName n="Schofield,General,,,," id="n0009.0004.00082.00135" reg="nearbymention:Schofield,John,M.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Schofield</surname></persName> and staff, and several mounted messengers, galloped along our front and took up a position near our extreme right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>Some of the soldiers within my hearing remarked, looking at their gay uniforms as they passed along, <quote>Too much fuss and feathers for a fighting general.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>The whole command then formed in columns of companies, and marched by the place where <persName n="Scofield,General,,,," id="n0009.0004.00082.00136" reg="mostcommon:Scofield,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scofield</surname></persName> and staff had posted themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>The brass bands, marching at the head of brigades and playing soul-stirring airs, give additional interest to the fine display made by the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>Thus ended the <rs>Grand Review</rs>, after which we marched to our respective camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>This is probably the last time the <orgName type="division" n="Division 1">first Division</orgName> will ever all be together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>It seems to be the intention to break it up into brigades and detachments, and to scatter these along the southern border counties of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> and <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172"><rs type="direction">northern</rs> Arkansas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>If we are not going to make any effort to hold a more advanced position, or even our present position, or if we are no longer to assume the offensive, perhaps to scatter the troops in this manner is the best policy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>It is therefore thought that his presence here is only temporary, and that after he shall have made such disposition of his troops as in his judgment seems best, that he will return to <placeName key="tgn,7014532" n="1.000 6" reg="springfield, greene, missouri">Springfield</placeName> or <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>As we shall march away from here in <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, I obtained permission to go to <placeName reg="Fayetteville, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,7014258">Fayetteville</placeName> to-day to see my brother who is in the general hospital there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>He was in right good spirits when I came to him, though he complained that the wound which he received in the shoulder at the battle of <placeName reg="Carytown, Jasper, Missouri" key="tgn,2058279">Coon Creek</placeName> last <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, caused him intense suffering at times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>He also informed me that the old wound which he received through the thigh a little over a year ago, had broken out again, and gave him much pain when he made certain movements, and his weight came on that leg. He still clings to the ball that passed straight through his thigh, touching the femoral artery and lodging on the opposite side just under the skin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>When it was cut from the wound the conical end of the elongated ball was found to be considerably flattened, having struck the femur or thigh bone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>But he says that he cannot bear to have the surgeons probe any more for the ball which he still carries in his shoulder, as it has either broken through the encysting and poisoning his blood or touching some very sensitive part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>He expressed a strong desire to be at home, but thought that he had not strength enough to be transported in an ambulance so far, even if he could get permission to go. I encouraged him to be cheerful, and said that I hoped he <pb id="p.84" n="84"/> would come out of this all right, and be able to report to his company for duty in a few weeks, or in a few months at the farthest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>I then bid him adieu, but not without emotion, for I have serious doubts of his recovery; the lines of his expression were not natural, and his life is ebbing away through the wound in his shoulder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>But.<num value="1">1</num> will not mourn my brother dead who is yet living. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>The order for the reduction of our transportation goes into effect to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>This seems a wise measure adopted by the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, for during an active campaign troops should be encumbered as little as possible with large trains and useless baggage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/><num value="500">Five hundred</num> wagons and teams in motion, stretch over a distance of several miles, and in an enemy's country always require a large force of cavalry to protect them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>They also offer inducements to the enemy to fit out expeditions for their capture or destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>Though officers and soldiers will have to dispense with certain conveniences which they have heretofore enjoyed, yet I think that they will soon see that by doing so, there will be entailed upon them no great hardships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>Our object is to beat the enemy at every point with as little sacrifice of life and public property as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>If large trains embarrass our movements, and if we can get along with smaller ones without decreasing our effectiveness, we should do it without a murmur.

<p>It was reported a few days ago· that authority had been obtained from the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> for raising <num value="2">two</num> regiments of Federal troops in this State, <num value="1">one</num> cavalry and <num value="1">one</num> infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>This report I find is true, and the recruiting is to commence at once, and the regiments will probably be organized and in the field by spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>For the present, <persName n="Ferguson,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0004.00085.00140" reg="mostcommon:Ferguson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Ferguson</surname></persName> is to have charge of the matter, with headquarters at <placeName reg="Fayetteville, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,7014258">Fayetteville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>Once organized and equipped, these regiments will be a valuable acquisition to our army in holding this section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>Our troops have shown that they have no hatred or ill will towards the people with whom we are contending; that we only want them to lay down their arms and renew their allegiance to the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>The consequence is, I think, that we have made friends of many of those who had been misinformed and had a rather bad opinion of us before we came into this State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>At the beginning of the war there was a strong Union sentiment in nearly all the counties of <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172"><rs type="direction">northwestern</rs> Arkansas</placeName>; and also in other sections of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>And now that there is an opportunity for those whose sympathies have all along been with the <rs>Government</rs>, to assist it by organizing for the defense of their lives and homes, we may reasonably expect that these <num value="2">two</num> regiments will soon have their maximum of men. If they see that there is a probability of our permanently holding this part of the <rs>State</rs>, many of those who are refugees to <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, will doubtless return and enter the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>There is an abundant supply of fine spring water at <placeName reg="Neosho, Newton, Missouri" key="tgn,2059847">Neosho</placeName>, and as it is in a wooded region plenty of fuel can be easily furnished them at a small cost during the winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>Yesterday morning (<num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num>) a violent snow storm set in and continued all day. We are therefore beginning to experience considerable difficulty in getting sufficient forage for our animals, for when the <orgName type="division" n="division 1">First division</orgName> was encamped in this vicinity last fall, we consumed nearly all the forage that could be found for miles around.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>A large force of the enemy under <persName n="Cooper,General,,,," id="n0009.0005.00092.00158" reg="mostcommon:Cooper,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Cooper</surname></persName>, had also been foraging off this section before our arrival.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>And as this is not much of an agricultural region, it will be seen that there is just cause for the complaint of scarcity of forage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>But <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0005.00092.00159" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,W.,A.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> is watchful of the wants of his troops and public animals, and will no doubt do all that can be done to prevent them from suffering for want of necessary supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>He sends out daily foraging parties and trains, and they generally go from <num value="10">ten</num> to <measure n="15miles" type="distance">fifteen miles</measure> from camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>This gives us a circuit of about <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure>, a considerable area of country to forage from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>When we shall have exhausted all the forage within <placeName><distance reg="15miles">fifteen miles</distance> of our camp</placeName>, we will probably establish another camp outside of this radius.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>If this plan is carried out, as I have no doubt it will be, I think that we can get our animals through the winter <pb id="p.93" n="93"/> in fair condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>Although we have been constantly scouting and marching and skirmishing since we came into this State last fall, we have lost comparatively few animals from having been broken down in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>Our main losses have of course been cavalry horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>But the safety and comfort of his command, while conducting military operations in this section, are not the sole object of solicitude to <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0005.00093.00160" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,W.,A.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>Nor is his function that of a military commander alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>He is placed in a position where he must act as governor of several different nations, all in a state of chaos.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>Since the war commenced, the <name>Indians</name> of the <rs>Cherokee</rs>, Creek, and <rs type="ship2">Seminole</rs> nations, have been almost equally divided on the questions which have arrayed the <num value="2">two</num> sections of the country against each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>But as the rebel authorities sent troops to occupy the country of these Indians immediately after hostilities commenced, and held undisputed possession of it until our expedition of last summer, the loyalists were obliged to leave their homes or contend with unequal odds, with the chances of being continually beaten and finally driven out. Hence when we withdrew from the <placeName reg="Oklahoma" key="tgn,7007707">Indian Territory</placeName> last <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, and brought out the <rs>Chief</rs>, <persName n="Ross,,John,,," id="n0009.0005.00093.00161" reg="default:Ross,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Ross</surname></persName>, and some of the national archives and treasury, <num value="1000">thousands</num> of loyal <name>Indian</name> families, Cherokees, Creeks, and Seminoles, accompanied us as far as. <placeName reg="Baxter Springs, Cherokee, Kansas" key="tgn,7017585">Baxter Springs</placeName>, on the southern line of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>While at <placeName reg="Baxter Springs, Cherokee, Kansas" key="tgn,7017585">Baxter Springs</placeName>, and indeed since they have been exiles from their homes, the <rs>Government</rs> has issued them rations, and looked after them to mollify their hardships <pb id="p.94" n="94"/> as much as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>And though the greater proportion of these <name>Indian</name> families have remained in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523"><rs type="direction">Southwest</rs> Missouri</placeName>, since the opening of the campaign last <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> ; and though some have returned to their homes in the nation since we drove the enemy out; yet there seems to be a fair prospect that the <quote>Refugee camp</quote> will continue to increase in size during the rest of the winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>The wants and necessities of these people will constantly demand the attention of <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0005.00094.00162" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,W.,A.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> in various ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>How ably and satisfactorily he shall conduct the affairs which devolve upon him, remains to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>It will thus also be seen that his position requires of him to be, if he manages matters successfully, not only a judicious military commander, but-also to possess, in a fair measure, the knowledge of civil affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>A man who possesses both of these qualifications in a marked degree, is rarely found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>We have reason to believe that we have such a man in the person of <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0005.00094.00163" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,W.,A.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, for every <num value="1">one</num> has some pride that those with whom he acts in any given venture shall act creditably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>That is, no man who possesses a sense of patriotic devotion, likes to have his name associated with inglorious defeat, or any public action upon which rests a stigma or even unfavorable comment. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>The skirmishes between our scouting parties and small detachments of guerrillas which infest this section are becoming so frequent, that hereafter I shall not attempt to give the details and result of each day separate, but will endeavor to give some account of the <pb id="p.95" n="95"/> most important contests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>There would be a good deal of repetition should I detail the movements and skirmishes of every scouting or foraging party sent out. When any casualties occur they are noted on the muster rolls of the company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>That is, if a soldier is killed, wounded, or taken prisoner, or has his horse killed or captured, the fact is duly noted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>I may add that since we left <placeName reg="Elm Springs, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,2008180">Elm Springs</placeName>, our troops have killed, according to my daily memoranda, <num value="9">nine</num> bushwhackers, and sustained a loss of <num value="3">three</num> men killed and <measure n="2" type="wounded">two wounded</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>A woman from the country came into camp yesterday evening (<num value="17" type="ordinal">17th</num>) and reported that she knew of <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> bushwhackers, who were living in a cave, some <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles distant</measure> from the command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>A detachment of cavalry was sent to the locality of the cave; but returned without being able to find the enemy or any indications that they had recently occupied the cave as an abiding place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>Our men, however, did not venture into the cave, as it would have required too great a sacrifice of life to dislodge them from such a fortress, if they were really there and well armed, unless we should close the mouth of the cave and compel them to feel the pinch of hunger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>What a novel place for men to take up their abode!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>But when we are enjoying freedom and security, and the rewards of honest toil, it is perhaps difficult for us to imagine what modes of life we might be inclined to adopt under the pressure of circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>It is well known that caves do not undergo very radical changes of temperature during the seasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>I have visited a <pb id="p.96" n="96"/> cave on my father's estate a good many times, and I remember that it was always almost uncomfortably cool on a warm summer day, and pleasantly warm on a winterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>Considerable attention has recently been given to cavern researches in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>And in several instances the bones of men and some domestic implements and rudely-made weapons have been found, which show beyond a reasonable doubt that the human race has existed on this earth for a period much longer than that which we have been taught.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>While we were encamped at <placeName reg="Camp Moonlight">Camp Moonlight</placeName>, about <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure> south of here, the early part of last <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>, I was permitted to accompany a party of officers and soldiers on a visit to a cave much larger than the <num value="1">one</num> near our present camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>We did not go very far into it from the entrance, but we went far enough to see some beautiful stalactites hanging from the roof like icicles which hang from the eaves of a house after the snow has commenced to melt and run down its sloping roof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>Were everything favorable, I should like to visit the cave near us, but of course not with the view of making careful investigations, for that would take time and a large expenditure of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>But when peace shall bless our country again, and the spirit of inquiry increases, perhaps interesting researches will be made into the history of these caves, which will throw some light on the various forms of life that once inhabited them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>Curious thoughts are apt to come into <num value="1">one</num>'s mind after visiting <num value="1">one</num> of these natural wonders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>What <pb id="p.97" n="97"/> caused it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>How long since it was formed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>These are exceedingly interesting questions to those whose minds seek a rational explanation of every natural phenomenon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>But when we come to understand something about how a cave has been formed, we are not likely to press the question, <quote>How long since?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>It is a notable fact that all the caves in this country are in limestone formations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>Now it is well known to every <num value="1">one</num> who has given any attention to chemistry,that a solution of water and carbonic acid will dissolve pieces of limestone, when put into it. <persName n="Rainwater,,,,," id="n0009.0005.00097.00164" reg="mostcommon:Rainwater,nomatch:0"><surname>Rainwater</surname></persName> is known to contain carbonic acid, the proportion, perhaps, depending upon the season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>It is easy to imagine, then, that the rain falling on these hills must have always run down through the soil until the water came to the limestone; and that when it penetrated it, it dissolved a portion of it, the extent of dissolution, however, depending upon the amount of carbonic acid the rain water contained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>Everyone who has been in a cave can probably call to mind the sound of dropping water from the roof of the cave, which he heard here and there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>Well, every drop of water that falls from the roof to the floor, is supposed to hold in solution a very small quantity of the limestone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>But when the water comes to separate from the dissolved limestone it leaves a thin film of solid material, different in character from the original limestone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>When the water drops from the roof of the cave, it leaves a thin film attached to the roof, which gradually assumes the form and <pb id="p.98" n="98"/> appearance of an icicle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>This is called a stalactite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>The film that forms on the floor after the water has left it, is called the stalacmite. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>It will thus be seen that the formation of a cave is a perfectly natural, though an extremely slow process.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>It is like removing the sands from the sea shore by taking a grain at a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>How long it has taken to form a stalactite as long as <num value="1">one</num>'s arm, we have no means of knowing as far as the caves in this section are concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>Nor have I ever heard that the thickness of the stalacmite formations of the caves of this region have ever been measured or any efforts made to find out the nature of the deposits under them, or contemporaneous with their growth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>Reflecting on stalacmitic formations and the evidences of ancient life they may contain, this thought has come into my mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>Suppose that <num value="1">one</num> of our soldiers or <num value="1">one</num> of the enemies, on account of the stress of weather or imminent danger, should take to a cave and die in it with his arms and accoutrements beside him.-After a while, perhaps, the drops of water from the roof of the cave falling on his bones and arms, would leave thereon a formation of stalacmitic matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>And should the men of some future age decide to investigate the history of these caves and find the bones and arms cemented together with stalacmitic matter, they might be able to determine the age to which they belonged, and nearly the exact time it had taken to produce a formation of stalacmitic matter of a given thickness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>Our pistols and carbines and sabers have <pb id="p.99" n="99"/> the name of the manufacturer or patentee, and the year they were made, stamped upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>Though there are many chances that in time these would become obliterated by rust, yet under certain conditions they might not. At any rate the subject is <num value="1">one</num> upon which the mind delights to dwell for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>And in this connection there arises the further thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>Is it possible, that in a few years, not a vestige of the storms of war which have recently swept back and forth over this section, will be left to the future inhabitants of these pleasant valleys and prairies?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>Is it possible that in a few years and on these grounds a comfortable mansion may arise, whose dwellers will be all unconscious that we were ever here for warlike purposes, and our arms stained with the blood of men who were recently our friends and brothers?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>Probably in a few years from now there will be many peaceful dwellings by the road-side in this section, whose occupants may never dream that the tramping of marching squadrons, the rattling of artillery carriages, and the clanging of sabers, might have recently been heard upon the public highways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>How evanescent are the actions of men!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>Even the pyramids of <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> must in time crumble to dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>We do not know but that if the light of the past could be thrown upon these grounds and over these regions, we should see hostile armies of even greater magnitude than ours or that of the enemy, operating against each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>It is now considered by those who ought to be competent authority, that this western country was once occupied by <pb id="p.100" n="100"/> a race of people quite different, in some respects, to our present <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0009.0005.00100.00165" reg="mostcommon:Indians,Chickasaw,,,:1"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>At various places in the <rs type="place">Mississippi valley</rs> mounds are found which are known to have been thrown up by human hands; and in some instances there have also been found human skeletons, pieces of pottery and implements indicative of their domestic life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>These mounds are believed to be of high antiquity and not to have been made by any of the existing races of <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>If a numerous people inhabited the <rs type="place">Mississippi valley</rs> at some distant age of the past, they also probably spread over this region, for its ever-living streams, lovely valleys, and occasional prairies, must always have been very inviting to peoples following a nomadic or pastoral life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>Though our camp is on the edge of a prairie, the country a few miles to the east of us is rugged and hilly, and less adapted to agricultural purposes than the country to the west of us, in the <rs type="place">Grand River valley</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>But as the <placeName reg="Bedford, Livingston, Missouri" key="tgn,7016221">Grand River</placeName> country belongs to the <name>Cherokees</name>, no <num value="1">one</num> can say when its agricultural resources will be developed, even should the war close immediately. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>The number of negro refugees, who have gained their freedom since we came into this State, are getting to be a good deal of a burden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>Their almost destitute condition, causes many of them to commit acts that are not sanctioned by our ideas of strict morality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>We find employment for some of them as teamsters and servants, but still there are many more who are unemployed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>We send a good many to <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> every time that our supply trains return to <placeName key="tgn,2036378" n="1.000 33" reg="fort scott, bourbon, kansas">Fort Scott</placeName>. <pb id="p.101" n="101"/> Many of them are quite shiftless, and it will probably be some time before they appreciate to a very great extent the value of their freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>But we should be charitable towards them, and not magnify their shortcomings, nor oppress them, so that they will feel obliged to commit unlawful acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>I think that there is a tendency on our part to overlook their many disadvantages, when considering their moral actions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>With their past life of slavery and degradation, and with the pinch of hunger and cold affecting them at present, we ought not to expect all their actions to be perfectly free of censure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>Those who have tasted of only a small proportion of the fruits of their own toil, are not likely to try before their consciences with much deliberation, the offense of chicken stealing, when they are suffering from hunger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>As these people have not been property owners, it will probably be some time before they have very definite ideas of proprietary rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>We should not therefore be surprised to hear of a larger proportion of them during the next generation, guilty of unlawfully appropriating the property of others, than among the white population. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>It seems to me that we might be relieved of a good deal of our present embarrassment by organizing a corps of colored troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>The amount of money the <rs>Government</rs> paid the men for their services would be almost sufficient to take care of their families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>There is, however, considerable prejudice yet among our officers and soldiers in regard to organizing them into regiments, but as their freedom throughout the <pb id="p.102" n="102"/> country is sure to come at an early day, I can see no good reason why they should not be taken into the military service at once, indeed just as fast as they see fit to enlist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>Having always been accustomed to obey orders, and being naturally of docile dispositions, I am inclined to believe that, if properly organized and officered, they will make excellent soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>While I think that intelligent soldiers may be more effective in the field than those of lower intelligence, I do not believe that either are likely to accomplish great deeds under incompetent and inefficient officers. </p>

Our route was through a thickly wooded region all the way. It continued cloudy and was intensely dark, and there was a drizzling rain nearly all night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>We had to trust to our horses keeping on the path, as they see better in the darkness than men.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>When we came in sight of the place, I could hardly bring my mind, I regret to say, into a condition to greet it with much warmth of feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>It is easy to imagine an instance in which, when <num value="1">one</num> person purposely or carelessly offends another, and afterwards without having made any apology or explanation, offers his hand, and of the offended party hesitating whether to take it or not. Such were my feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>I could hardly make up my mind to give the place the right hand of fellowship, even if the place had welcomed my return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>Since the <rs>Kansas</rs> troubles a large majority of the people of this place have displayed such a spirit of intolerance and want of respect towards those who differed with them in regard to political issues, that the sight of the town fails to arouse <pb id="p.109" n="109"/> the slightest thrill of affection and reverence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>There were a few abolitionists who resided here before the war, and they were frequently engaged in warm discussions in regard to the slavery question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>They could talk with some pro-slavery men with moderation, but others to whom they talked, became passionate and even violent, declaring that no abolitionist should be permitted to live in this section and inculcate his pernicious doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>I have always noticed that those who cling tenaciously to principles which they cannot defend, get out of patience if you press them too hard with their illogicalities or inconsistencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>But though the abolitionists were frequently insulted and threatened, they persisted in expressing their convictions to those who desired to know them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>Though less than a dozen in the county, they did not deny or make any efforts to conceal the fact that they were abolitionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>There were quite a number of men who were about half in sympathy with them, that is, whose political convictions were gradually undergoing a change, and they were not very decided in their expressions either way. Some people had such peculiar notions about abolitionists that the word was used in a good many families to frighten children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>And there were also people quite grown up who regarded an abolitionist as a kind of monster in human form, so <num value="1">one</num>-sided had their education been respecting the views of abolitionists. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>I saw to-day several of the men who, in the early part of the war, had so little patience with Union men that they wanted them all killed and their property <pb id="p.110" n="110"/> confiscated for the benefit of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>They were in favor of hanging those who went to <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> and joined the <rs>Kansas Jayhawkers</rs>, as the <rs>Kansas</rs> soldiers were called.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>The name Jayhawker was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> given to an organization of Free State men in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254"><rs type="direction">Southern</rs> Kansas</placeName> who, under the <name>Territorial</name> <hi rend="italics">regime </hi>made retaliatory incursions into <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>The name is growing into a nickname for all <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> people in the same sense as <quote>Hoosier</quote> is applied to Indianians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>But several of the men I saw, who were recently thirsting for the blood of the <rs>Kansas Jayhawkers</rs>, when they looked and knew me, cast their eyes towards the ground, and their countenances changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>They were captured a few weeks ago, having been connected with a band of guerrillas whose operations extended over this county.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>But they have taken the oath of allegiance to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and given bonds for the faithful performance of their promises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>Now that they have escaped the edges of our swords and <hi rend="italics">seem </hi>to show a disposition to submit to the authority of the <rs>Government</rs>, I presume no <num value="1">one</num> feels inclined to disturb them, or to cast them into any deeper humiliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>The war is teaching the intolerant some grand lessons in toleration, and those of <num value="1">one</num>-sided views to study the nature of their opponents' arguments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>Men who recently could scarcely tolerate the existence of a neighbor who held opinions on certain <pb id="p.111" n="111"/> subjects different from their own, are now at the mercy of this neighbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>And it is certainly commendable of those who were recently in the minority here, that they do not display a spirit of revenge. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>The event was celebrated by the booming of artillery; and great speeches were made to the enthusiastic multitude by the principal leaders. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>Their prospects were brighter then than now, and they doubtless thought that <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> would form <num value="1">one</num> of the stars in the <rs>Constellation</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>The town contained about <num value="1000">one thousand</num> inhabitants before the war; but the population now is much less, probably not more than half that number independent of the <rs>Indian</rs> refugees temporarily stopping here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>When this section was occupied by the rebel troops, nearly all the loyal families removed to <placeName key="tgn,7014532" n="1.000 6" reg="springfield, greene, missouri">Springfield</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, or to some point within our lines; and since we drove the enemy out, and established posts at nearly all the towns, many of the rebel families have moved south. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>A small garrison here could make no sort of defense against an enemy playing upon it with artillery, for there are heights all around the town, except narrow openings to the south<name>east</name> and <name>north</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>My father thinks that his farm of <measure n="260acres" type="area">two hundred and sixty acres</measure>, which lies <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> north of this place on <placeName reg="Shoal Creek, Missouri, United States" key="tgn,1134586">Shoal Creek</placeName>, has not its equal in the alluvial plain of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> <pb id="p.114" n="114"/> valley in point of productiveness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>But since the war commenced, the fences have nearly all been destroyed by the rebel armies camping upon it, and only a small portion of it was cultivated last year by a tenant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year of the war the <rs>Rebels</rs> drove away all our live stock, and some of our neighbors who sided with the enemy, even had a discussion among themselves as to what our farm and timbered lands would bring when sold as confiscated property for the benefit of the <rs>Confederate</rs> treasury, as they were determined to have them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>In regard to the destruction of fences, I may say that as far as my own observation goes, few of those enclosing farms on the public highways have escaped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>When we encamped <measure n="15miles" type="distance">fifteen miles</measure> north-east of here last autumn, just before the battle of <placeName key="tgn,2059878" n="1.000 22" reg="newtonia, newton, missouri">Newtonia</placeName> in this county, we burned <num value="1000">thousands</num> of rails for fuel, and if we bivouacked on the field at night, we made numerous fires along the roadside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>It is almost impossible for a large army to pass through the country in which it is operating without causing more or less injury to the property of friend as well as foe. I have noted, with feelings of deep regret, that the loyal people of this State frequently sustain losses at the hands of our troops because they happen to be in bad company; that is, because they live in communities where the rebel sentiment predominates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>Though there were few men in this section at the beginning of the war who were willing to acknowledge that they were abolitionists, yet when it came to choosing between the <pb id="p.115" n="115"/> Union and rebellion, nearly half of the people chose the <rs>Union</rs>, and elected to cast their fortunes with it. A good many of the wealthiest and most prominent men in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523"><rs type="direction">south-west</rs> Missouri</placeName> were strong and pronounced <persName n="Unionists,,,,," id="n0009.0006.00115.00190" reg="mostcommon:Unionists,nomatch:0"><surname>Unionists</surname></persName> from the very beginning, and worked tooth and nail for our success, though they knew that they took their lives in their hands to do it. <persName n="Ritchie,Colonel,Harvey,,," id="n0009.0006.00115.00191" reg="default:Ritchie,Harvey,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Harvey</foreName> <surname>Ritchie</surname></persName>, of <placeName key="tgn,2059878" n="1.000 22" reg="newtonia, newton, missouri">Newtonia</placeName>, who was State senator at the breaking out of the war, issued a public address to the people of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523"><rs type="direction">south-west</rs> Missouri</placeName>, urging them, in the most eloquent language, to stand firm by the <rs>Union</rs> and not be led into any secession movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>This address went into the hands of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of citizens, and no doubt had great influence in keeping many steadfast for the <rs>Union</rs>, and in opening the eyes of others to the follies and rashness of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>It is therefore painful to hear officers and soldiers who know very little about the politics of this State, characterizing all the people alike as rebels, and as entitled to the same sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>These thoughtless officers and men sometimes ask, if anyone ventures to speak a word on behalf of the loyal men of this section, where are the men?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>But if they would look around intelligently, they would easily see that of all the deserted homes, and homes in which there is no <num value="1">one</num> left but women and children, that the men are not in every case in the rebel army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>Those who were with us last fall when we were encamped on <placeName reg="Pea Ridge, Benton, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009193">Pea Ridge</placeName> battle field, must have seen from the headboards placed over the graves of the <rs>Federal</rs> soldiers <pb id="p.116" n="116"/> that fell on that field, that <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> troops suffered as severe losses as the troops from <placeName reg="Iowa" key="tgn,7007253">Iowa</placeName>, <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> and <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>Probably some of those who are so careless in their remarks in regard to <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the people of this State being rebels, would not like to acknowledge that <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, after furnishing all the men she has for the rebel army, has also furnished more men for the <rs>Union</rs> army than either of the great States, <placeName reg="Iowa" key="tgn,7007253">Iowa</placeName> or <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>If this is not the exact truth, it is very near it. If we include the troops called out for active service in this State, there is not a reasonable doubt of it. This State has sins enough to answer for without having to answer for any for which she is not justly chargeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>And I deeply sympathize with those families whose desolated homes lie before them, and whose male members lie on some distant field, or are even now, this very moment, at the front, nobly performing their duties in defense of the old flag and the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>I have a right to feel touched in this <pb id="p.117" n="117"/> matter, for all the male members of our family, except the <num value="2">two</num> little boys, have been away from home nearly a year and <num value="0.5">a half</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>And until our troops came into this section, mother had to endure many hardships in providing food and clothing for the children, for rebel marauders repeatedly robbed us of the best articles of clothing, bed-clothing, etc. I have seen men from the loyal States, whose families were doubtless resting in perfect security, and enjoying the property and good things with which honest labor has rewarded them, who yet appeared blind to the fact that a double sacrifice is put upon the <rs>Union</rs> soldiers of this State. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>The soldier in the field from this State is constantly tortured with the thought that his wife, mother, daughter or sister, is being robbed, insulted or burned out of her home, with no <num value="1">one</num> to look to for protection, and assistance and advice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>No doubt, on the tented field, or wherever sweet sleep sits upon his eyelids, he is often awakened by horrible dreams of seeing his house in flames climbing to the sky, and his wife and little children gathered around her near it, with sad expressions, wondering what they shall do for food and shelter and clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>The picture is not overdrawn and wholly imaginary, as some may suppose who are not familiar with what they would perhaps call unimportant incidents of the war in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>; but is an actuality of no unusual occurrence, whether many of the soldiers from this State have such dreams or not. In fact it would be difficult to overdraw a picture <pb id="p.118" n="118"/> representing the hardships and privation that many of the loyal families of this State have had to endure since the war commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>But under all these extraordinary trials and difficulties, of desolation and ruin, they have remained firm in their devotion and loyalty to the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>Their ears, therefore, should never hear unpleasant and reproachful words in wholly unjustifiable connections from those who should be their friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>As far as I am personally concerned, I do not wish to make even rebel families feel uncomfortable on account of the position they have taken in regard to the war. But when they become, as we sometimes hear, unnecessarily insolent and troublesome, I think it might be well to send them south of our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>They should always, however, have fair warning before we resort to such severe measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>The greatest trouble we have with rebel families is in the country, where they harbor bushwhackers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>This guerrilla warfare is so detestable to all honorable minded men, that those engaged in it cannot justly complain if we adopt extreme measures to suppress it. Our losses in this State by this mode of warfare, during the past year, would probably foot up, if we could get correct figures, several <num value="100">hundred</num> soldiers killed, besides perhaps nearly as many Union citizens. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>Since we drove the enemy out of <placeName key="tgn,2059878" n="1.000 22" reg="newtonia, newton, missouri">Newtonia</placeName> last <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, the place has been occupied by the <rs>State Militia</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>They are throwing up fortifications and preparing to build a block house there, which when completed, ought to enable them to hold the place against <pb id="p.119" n="119"/> a large force of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>A number of rebel citizens who have recently taken the oath of allegiance, have been compelled to furnish teams and labor towards constructing these fortifications, of which they bitterly complain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>But if they desire the protection of the <rs>Government</rs>, they should do something.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>As the <rs>Militia</rs> are well mounted and furnished with arms and equipments by the general Government, they should be able to keep this section free of guerrillas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>Expressions from some of the rebel families in town show that they regard it scornfully, and would, if they dared, trail it in the dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>But as we are just beginning to develop our strength, while the enemy is unquestionably beginning to show signs <pb id="p.120" n="120"/> of weakness, we will hardly withdraw our troops from this section again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>Those who do not like the sight of our National Flag, should therefore move south, and join their friends who carry the <rs>Confederate Flag</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>It was probably <num value="1">one</num> of the richest lead mines in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>The mining operations continued there until about a year ago, and of course were of immense importance to the enemy in the way of furnishing balls for their small arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>But the eyes of the furnaces have been blown out, and some of the buildings destroyed, so that no <num value="1">one</num> has ventured to invest money in the business again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>Last night (<num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>) a detachment of <num value="10">ten</num> men, with the mail and despatches, arrived here from the <hi rend="italics"><orgName type="division" n="Division 1">First Division</orgName>, <orgName n="Army of the Frontier" type="army">Army of the Frontier</orgName></hi>, now encamped in the vicinity of <placeName key="tgn,7014532" n="1.000 6" reg="springfield, greene, missouri">Springfield</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>Several of the men belonged to that part of my regiment which left us at <placeName reg="Elm Springs, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,2008180">Elm Springs</placeName>, and they informed me that they had just heard from <placeName reg="Fayetteville, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,7014258">Fayetteville, Arkansas</placeName>, before leaving camp, that my <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>James</foreName></persName> died in hospital there on the <dateStruct value="-01-26"><day reg="26">26th</day></dateStruct> or <dateStruct value="-01-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>As the information came through reliable parties, men whom I have known since the regiment was organized, I at once conveyed the sad intelligence to his wife and to father and mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>We were all greatly distressed, and that which increased the burden of our grief was the thought that he should have died from home in hospital, with none of us near him; nor perhaps even of any of the comrades of his own regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>Father and mother, just before I came here on this few days' leave, had it under consideration to go after him to bring him home, but were told that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to get permission to remove him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>Yet when we enlisted into the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> I knew that we should have to take the risk of being stricken down by the enemy's bullets the same as other soldiers in time of war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>Offering our services to the <rs>Government</rs> in a land of strangers, easy, honorable and lucrative positions, or positions comparatively free from dangers and hardships of the war, did not seek us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>I am perfectly conscious that if these few simple words referred to the sufferings and death of some general officer instead of a private soldier, they would be read by many with greater eagerness, and touch deeper their sympathetic emotions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>The movement of the division to this place is not regarded as retrograde or falling back, bat, simply for the purpose <pb id="p.126" n="126"/> of more easily supplying our animals with forage and provisioning the refugee families with us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>Scarcely a day passes that a squad of rebels do not come in and take the oath of allegiance and ask the protection of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>Those who come in generally express the opinion that many more would come if they knew that they would be protected and allowed to live at home instead of being sent north at prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>They are mostly regarded with mistrust, for it has sometimes turned out that those whom we received and treated kindly, soon became dissatisfied with the situation, and went south again and joined the guerrillas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>Until we came here, bushwhackers were as plenty as wild game up and down this river, but during the last <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure>, quite a number have been killed by our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>An <name>Indian</name> seems to me to almost scent a secret foe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>It is well known to every <num value="1">one</num> in the least familiar with this section during antebellum times, that the game in this region, such as deer and wild turkeys, have increased in great numbers the past <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>When the houses have been burned and the fences around the farms destroyed, as we find here and there, animals like hogs, that live without constant attention from man, soon run wild.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>Whenever our troops come upon him with equal, or perhaps; somewhat superior numbers, he never stands, but soon scatters his men in small squads, permitting them sometimes to return to their homes for a few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>This large space of unoccupied country gives a wide field of operations for such an organization as <persName n="Livingston,,,,," id="n0009.0007.00128.00211" reg="mostcommon:Livingston,Tom,,,:1"><surname>Livingston</surname></persName>'s. And until we can establish <pb id="p.129" n="129"/> more numerous stations along the western border tier of counties in this State, it will probably be difficult, if not impossible, to entirely break up such guerilla bands and also bushwhacking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>To accomplish this object, there are some who favor applying the torch indiscriminately, to the houses of Union people and rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>I can never conscientiously favor such a scheme; nor do I believe that the evil requires such heroic treatment at our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>I have seen the standing chimneys and smoking ruins of desolated homes of Union people as well as rebels too often to wish to see such scenes renewed in a wholesale manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>Nor do I believe that such acts on our part would remedy the evil which we wish to extirpate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>It seems to me that the enemy could occupy the desolate country all the same, and make his incursions into <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> and into the counties of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> still further to the east.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>Though my age and position would not, to the minds of many, justify my presuming to criticise the actions of those whose maturer years have given them more varied experiences, and in many things a sounder judgment, yet I venture to think that our officers have too often permitted the indiscriminate destruction of private property, which should not have been destroyed, thus causing a needless amount of suffering among those whom we should endeavor to protect in the possession of their lives and property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>I am perfectly willing, however, to do such officers the justice to believe that they seldom or never permit such acts, after thinking over the <pb id="p.130" n="130"/> consequences, with such deliberation as I may be able to do when setting down to write on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>An officer marching through the country at the head of his squadron or regiment, without the thought of an enemy being near, is suddenly fired upon at a certain place by a party of guerrillas, and gets <num value="1">one</num> or more of his men killed or wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thought is likely to be, that the family living on the place have been giving the enemy aid and comfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>This may be true or may not. But the chances are that the house will be burned, without making a thorough investigation to ascertain whether those .occupying it were in sympathy with, or knew anything about the presence of, the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>Then there are people whose sympathies are divided concerning the issues involved in the war; I mean by this that, taking a large number of citizens such as we have to deal with, their loyalty would perhaps range from slight to complete without qualification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>Some again, though they sympathize with the <rs>Government</rs>, and really wish its success, yet having relatives and friends in the rebel army who are very dear to them, have not the courage to utter their convictions in a strong and positive manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>The question arises, should the slightly loyal receive the punishment or be treated the same as the disloyal who are tooth and .nail against us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>It will thus be seen that an apparently very simple question, becomes quite involved, when looked at closely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>It is therefore useless to suppose that the sturdy soldier will enter into all these <pb id="p.131" n="131"/> hair splitting niceties before giving his orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>He looks at things just as they present themselves to him, and if injustice is done, it may be, that after reflection, no <num value="1">one</num> would regret it more keenly than himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>Taking this view of the matter, relieves in a measure our officers of the charge of permitting unnecessary destruction of private property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>In all those extraordinary cases where private property has been destroyed by our troops, that clearly should not have been destroyed, the <rs>Government</rs> should, and probably will, in time, pay for, provided of course, that the parties to whom it belongs are loyal to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>I would not destroy even the property of rebel citizens except in cases of military necessity; and then it is not supposable that any demand will ever be made upon the <rs>Government</rs> for payment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>But let us pass from this question which, in a few years, will doubtless engage the attention of legislators. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>Parties coming from <placeName reg="Neosho River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7021017">Neosho</placeName> report that there is a great deal of sickness among the <rs>Indian</rs> soldiers and their families at that place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>Taking into account the number of <name>Indians</name> there, and the number sick, the mortality amongst them is considered very high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>The prevailing type of disease which is now taking off so many of them, I understand is typhoid fever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>The hardships incident to leaving their homes in the <name>Nation</name>, and innutritious food and insufficient quantities of food, together with the poorly clad condition of many, are probably among the causes of this high mortality in some of the families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>But of course the <pb id="p.132" n="132"/> remark in regard to food and clothing cannot apply to the <rs>Indian</rs> soldiers, for they are as well fed and clothed as we are, that is, they have had their regular allowances during the winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>But the families and each member thereof have not perhaps had full rations during the winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>Though great care and interest have been manifested by <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0007.00132.00212" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,Maxwell,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> in looking after them, yet it has been impossible to make them as comfortable as at their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>The want of proper sheltering has also probably in many cases contributed to their discomforts and sickness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>Home sickness, from being exiles, also doubtless has a depressing influence amongst some of them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>Such of the sick and wounded at <placeName reg="Fayetteville, Cumberland, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014292">Fayetteville</placeName> and in the field hospitals of this division as will bear removing, are being taken to <placeName key="tgn,2036378" n="1.000 33" reg="fort scott, bourbon, kansas">Fort Scott</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>The <rs type="place">General Hospital</rs> at that place is better provided with everything essential to their proper care and treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>The great difficulty is to get them there without increasing too much their suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>But men convalescing from the effects of wounds, and placed in ambulances, and the ambulances driven carefully, should be taken the distance from <placeName reg="Fayetteville, Cumberland, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014292">Fayetteville</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,2036378" n="1.000 33" reg="fort scott, bourbon, kansas">Fort Scott</placeName>, say <measure n="150miles" type="distance">one hundred and fifty miles</measure>, without great inconvenience, except while <hi rend="italics">en route</hi> they should be struck with a change of extremely cold weather, or a storm of sleet or snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/><hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num></hi>, the bushwhackers, who are unorganized and generally found singly, but, as sometimes happens, in squads of <num value="2">two</num> to half a dozen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>They are generally men who stay around in the vicinity of their homes, and fire upon our troops from bluffs or other inaccessible points, or when they see <num value="1">one</num> of our soldiers alone on dispatch or courier duty shoot him off his horse with their rifles, and despoil him of his arms, clothing, money and equipments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>Since we came into this region last autumn, we have had quite a number of men who were either with the advance or <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName>, or on escort duty to trains, killed and wounded by bushwhackers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>Though of course bushwhackers are all rebels, yet I think that most of them are men of bad blood, men whose natural inclinations and evil tendencies lead them to follow a robber life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>They only take advantage of the existing chaotic state of things to show their true characters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>Should the war immediately cease, probably only a small percentage of such desperate characters would return to or adopt <pb id="p.134" n="134"/> an honest mode of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>But putting themselves outside the pale of civilized warfare, they will likely nearly all be killed off in a few years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>I may be judging them too harshly, but in the light of such facts as have come under my notice, I don't think so. <hi rend="italics"><num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num></hi>, guerrilla bands, men having some sort of military organization, and whose movements are directed by a leader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>Most of the leaders of the guerrillas with whom we have to contend, I have frequently heard, hold commissions from the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName>, or the fugitive Governor of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/><persName n="Livingston,,,,," id="n0009.0007.00134.00214" reg="mostcommon:Livingston,Tom,,,:1"><surname>Livingston</surname></persName> whom I have already referred to, may be cited as an instance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>The function of guerrillas is similar to that of privateers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>While the privateer is commissioned by the rebel authorities to prey upon our marine commerce, the guerrillas are commissioned to prey upon our inland commerce, destroy public property, such as trains, &amp;c., and to impede our movements in every possible manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>Though as I have mentioned, <persName n="Livingston,,,,," id="n0009.0007.00134.00215" reg="mostcommon:Livingston,Tom,,,:1"><surname>Livingston</surname></persName> is not accused of murdering his prisoners in cold blood, yet our soldiers feel, and I think justly so, that their lives would be very insecure in the hands of most guerrilla leaders, like <persName n="Quantrill,,,,," id="n0009.0007.00134.00216" reg="mostcommon:Quantrill,nomatch:0"><surname>Quantrill</surname></persName> for example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>We have to be always on the lookout for guerrillas, and our trains are obliged to be always well guarded, for if the enemy capture a courier with dispatches, or a soldier from a scouting party, they may get information that will enable them to concentrate at a given point and attack our escort and trains from an ambush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>This mode of warfare often enables a small force to <pb id="p.135" n="135"/> defeat a superior force encumbered with trains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>In fact the concealed enemy has a great advantage when he attacks about an equal number of our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>An enemy of a <num value="100">hundred</num> men concealed in a favorable position, might kill and wound half a company of soldiers the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>The rest, if not thrown into confusion by such a sudden burst of destruction, would in such case be unable to cope with the enemy flushed by his success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>To guard against such disasters a military commander must be always wide awake and on the alert, and he must know the strength of the enemy in his rear as well as in his front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>We now believe that the enemy, in whatever manner he may choose to operate against us, will have to be exceedingly industrious and wide awake to gain a point on <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0007.00135.00217" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,Maxwell,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>His movements on the military chessboard show that he is not likely to be checkmated or broken up by an opponent handling an equal number of men. <hi rend="italics"><num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num></hi>, rebels returning to their homes in that section of the <rs>State</rs> from which they entered the rebel army; or rebels leaving the vicinity of their homes in detachments to join the rebel army, or to remain south during the progress of the war. Whether leaving the <rs>State</rs> in detachments, or returning to it in detachments, they rarely show an inclination to assume the offensive, seeming to prefer to pass through the country unobserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>But those leaving the <rs>State</rs>, when they find that there is a fair prospect of capturing property that can be taken along without impeding their movements, <pb id="p.136" n="136"/> are not so careful to avoid contact with our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>Even if their attacks be unsuccessful, and they completely fail in any given design, they can continue their march southward without increasing the danger of being intercepted and captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>Only a few weeks ago, at <placeName reg="Neosho River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7021017">Neosho</placeName>, our pickets were fired into <num value="1">one</num> night, as was supposed, by quite a force of the enemy going south, but as they found that we were not to be surprised, decided to make no further demonstration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>It may be, however, that in the light of just and intelligent criticism, his merit would shine with a brighter lustre than it does with us. In some other field, if he goes to the front, it may not be difficult to inspire his troops with confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>The Cherokee Council, which has been in session several weeks, adjourned on the <dateStruct value="--22"><day reg="2">22nd</day></dateStruct>, <hi rend="italics">sine die</hi>. Most of the prominent men of the <name>Nation</name> were present, and, made speeches in regard to the passage of certain laws touching the interests of the <rs>Cherokee</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most important measures which they have had under discussion, has for its object the abolition of slavery in the <placeName reg="Oklahoma" key="tgn,7007707">Cherokee Nation</placeName> at an early day. While slavery has for some generations existed in the <placeName reg="Oklahoma" key="tgn,7007707">Cherokee Nation</placeName>, it has never existed in that form which characterized the institution in the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>The <rs>Indians</rs> have been with us now upwards of <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, and, from what we have seen, it is doubtless true that slavery of the negroes amongst <pb id="p.142" n="142"/> them has been only in name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/>They never act towards the <name>Indians</name> with that reserve and sign of respect noticeable when they come into our presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>I am satisfied that the hardships of slavery amongst the <name>Indians</name> were never comparable to the hardships of slavery in the cotton-raising States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>It would perhaps be difficult to impress any negro with the idea that there is as great a distance between him and an Indian as there is between him and a white man. In some respects I think myself that there is very little difference, particularly in matters involving social status.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>The possibilities of a negro here are probably very nearly, if not quite, equal to the possibilities of the <rs>Indian</rs>, as far as intellectual force is concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>And from my own observations I believe that they are, as a race, more able to stand contact with what we call high civilization, than the <name>Indians</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>When I traveled over several of the cotton-raising States, a year before the war commenced, from a good many inquiries which I made, I became convinced that the degrading, and in many instances even hard life of slavery, had not perceptibly diminished the reproductive powers of the negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>Careful inquiries might, however, show, in certain sections, where both sexes have been worked very hard on the plantations, that their reproductive powers have perceptibly diminished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>Though it has been but a few centuries since they were brought to this Continent, yet when we contrast their peculiar traits of character with those of the <rs>Indian</rs>, we are ,sure to be led to the conclusion that they will exist as <pb id="p.143" n="143"/> a distinct race among us, after the <rs>Indian</rs> shall have disappeared, and shall only be referred to in history as an extinct race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>It will probably not be many generations before we shall be contriving means, not how to kill off the <name>Indians</name>, but how to preserve the few which are left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>Even should the <num value="15000">fifteen</num> to <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> Cherokees amalgamate with the whites, it is not likely that, in the course of a dozen generations, there would be more than a slight trace of <name>Indian</name> blood in their descendants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>Amalgamation has already taken place rather extensively, as our Indians here plainly show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>Indeed, the half-breeds and quarter-bloods form a considerable part of the population of the <name>Nation</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>But they are, I have been informed, mostly the offspring of polygamous marriages and unions, such as would not be sanctioned amongst us. We know very well that since this country was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> settled by Europeans, traders and adventurers have lived amongst the <name>Indians</name>, and it seems that, by forming temporary unions, and sometimes lasting ones, with the native women, they gain certain rights and privileges that are not accorded to those who will not enter into such alliances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>Many of the <rs>Cherokee</rs> women have very good features, and white men who desire to get wived may perhaps, often be congratulated upon their choice, We therefore frequently see amongst these <quote>half-breeds,</quote> <quote>quarter-bloods,</quote> &amp;c., men of much intelligence and force of character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>It is not unusual, however, for them to display the adventurous spirit of their white fathers, and the fierceness <pb id="p.144" n="144"/> of their native mothers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>But these people are capable of making great advances in civilization, before their veins shall have been drained of the last drop of <name>Indian</name> blood. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>It differs from our <placeName key="tgn,7007254" n="1.000 89" reg="kansas">Kansas</placeName> rivers in this respect, that it discharges a large volume of water the year round, while they almost dry up during the summer months of dry seasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>With some attention given to its improvement for navigation, light draft steamers might run on it between this point and <placeName reg="Bedford, Livingston, Missouri" key="tgn,7016221">Grand River</placeName> several months of the year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>It flows over a gravelly bottom, and is as clear as a crystal, being fed by perpetual springs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>Water-power mills have been constructed upon it wherever required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>In this vicinity, and for <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="15miles" type="distance">fifteen miles</measure> above here, a number of saw mills were in operation before the war, making lumber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>This is the only county in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523"><rs type="direction">southwest</rs> Missouri</placeName> in which there are any pine forests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>Hence, therefore, all the pine lumber used for building and other purposes, in the counties <name>north</name> and <name>east</name> of this, for a distance of <num value="60">sixty</num> to <measure n="75miles" type="distance">seventy-five miles</measure>, was furnished by this section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>It is known as <rs n="yellow pine" type="product">yellow pine</rs>, and is very heavy, containing large <pb id="p.147" n="147"/> quantities of resin or pitch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>A piece of it lighted will burn like a torch, to such an extent is it saturated with the oil of turpentine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>Before the war there was also manufactured in this region considerable tar or pitch, obtained from this <rs n="yellow pine" type="product">yellow pine</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>The people of this section do not use for lubricating purposes, oil, tallow or axle grease, as we do on our wagons, Perhaps tar would not be as suitable for iron axles, such as are used in the army wagon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>From all that I have seen of this county, I think it is too poor to ever attract to it a very large number of immigrants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>It is possible, however, but not probable, that these rocky hills contain hidden treasures of immense value, of which we know nothing at present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>I can see how it is possible to utilize the hilly and poor upland regions to some extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>They are mostly covered with fine timber, and in the <rs type="season">spring</rs>, <rs type="season">summer</rs> and <rs type="season">autumn</rs> months, with a fine growth of wild grass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>When all the land which is fit to cultivate along the streams is taken up, large flocks of sheep and goats and herds of cattle can be pastured during half the year, at little expense, on the bills and uplands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>But before people can be induced to come here and adopt such rigid economy, the fertile plains of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> and the richer portions of this State, will be densely populated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>In some sections of the country now, the destruction <pb id="p.148" n="148"/> of forests, in getting timber for various economical purposes, is more rapid than their growth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>Their destruction must become even more marked, as the population of the country increases and its resources are steadily developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>The time is therefore coming when the forests on these hills will be quite an item of commerce to this section, and a source of profit to the owners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>Out of the great number of fine springs in this section, whose clear cold water is a luxury, particularly during the summer months, it is possible that some of them may possess medicinal properties, which will make.them places of public resort, and temporary abodes for invalids from all parts of the world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>As no large body of our troops have been in this vicinity since last autumn, and as we have no troops stationed in this county at all, a good many rebels have returned from the southern army and from <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> and <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172"><rs type="direction">southern</rs> Arkansas</placeName>, and have been living at their homes nearly all winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>Since we came here, some of them have come into our lines and taken the oath of allegiance to the <rs>Government</rs>, and others have either gone South, or remain in the country endeavoring to avoid capture by our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>Only a few weeks ago a party of a dozen or so rebels in this vicinity, sent a message to the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> at <placeName reg="Neosho, Newton, Missouri" key="tgn,2059847">Neosho</placeName> that they were willing to come in and surrender and take the oath, but when a detachment of our troops came down here to receive them, they were not found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>It is reported that they had some fears of our <name>Indian</name> soldiers, <pb id="p.149" n="149"/> and went to <placeName reg="Mount Vernon, Lawrence, Missouri" key="tgn,2059815">Mount Vernon</placeName> to give themselves up to the proper authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>From all that I can hear, I have no doubt but that <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0008.00149.00243" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,Maxwell,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>' firmness, tempered with moderation, has had much to do in inducing those who have recently been in arms against the <rs>Government</rs>, yet who have realized their mistake and feel somewhat friendly inclined towards us, to come in and renew their allegiance to the old flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>Though he has had a mixed command of <name>Indians</name> and white men, which probably few officers would be able to manage creditably, yet he has kept his soldiers under perfect control, so perfect, indeed, that we nowhere hear of houses burned, or the useless destruction of property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>This is almost remarkable considering the great number of refugees and camp-followers of every condition and color and phase of moral character he has to keep his eyes upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>While we were encamped at <placeName reg="Maysville, De Kalb, Missouri" key="tgn,2059691">Maysville</placeName> some colored male refugees who were caught committing some unauthorized depredations in the country, were punished by each being compelled to carry a log of wood, weighing perhaps <num value="30">thirty</num> to <measure n="40l." type="pounds"><num value="40">forty</num> pounds</measure>, several hours each day for <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>. The punishment of those men has had a wholesome effect in preventing the reckless and indiscriminate plundering that would surely have followed, had not our commander been thus prompt in setting his seal of condemnation upon it. No <num value="1">one</num> can tell to what length a mass of unorganized and ignorant men would go, were not some restraint put upon their actions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>It is safe to say, however, that the lives and property of <pb id="p.150" n="150"/> no class in the vicinity would be safe, and for myself I should not be surprised to hear of them cutting their own throats, were they permitted to follow their own unbridled passions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>When he sends out his forage trains, he sends them under officers who act under specific instructions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>Should the officer in charge of a train go outside of his instructions, and take any property or permit it to be taken by the men under him, with the view of applying it to private use, and complaint be made to headquarters, <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0008.00150.00245" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,Maxwell,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> would have him immediately Court-martialed, and if found guilty of the charges preferred against him, he would be dismissed the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>But while he is prompt in repressing acts that would tend to reflect upon our arms, he is not accused of acting, in any case, ghastly and without sufficient cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>I am sure that it cannot be said years hence, when the war is over, that <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0008.00150.00246" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,Maxwell,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, with perfect indifference, permitted the <rs>Federal</rs> troops under him to rob the women of this section of their jewelry and other trinkets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>But should the spirit of justice and moderation that have guided his action, since he assumed command of this division, continue to guide his future movements, and should he be spared a full measure of years, and return to this section, the people will doubtless welcome him with grateful hearts, and point to him as a Federal <pb id="p.151" n="151"/> commander whose military and private life reflected luster upon the cause which he represented. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>We hear from <placeName reg="Neosho, Newton, Missouri" key="tgn,2059847">Neosho</placeName> and other sections of the <rs>State</rs>, that returned rebels and many democrats regard these new measures of the <rs>Government</rs> with a good deal of bitterness, and predict that they will weaken our cause throughout the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>They pretend to think that it would be a great disgrace to the <rs>Government</rs> to permit negro soldiers to go into the field and fight by the side of white soldiers of the <rs>Union</rs> armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>But these guardians of propriety and advisers of the <rs>Government</rs>, see no objection to the negroes of the <rs>South</rs> raising supplies for the rebel armies, building their fortifications, acting as servants for officers, and in contributing in various ways, directly and indirectly, to strengthening the backbone of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>They wish to see the <rs>Government</rs> compel the negroes to continue forging the chains intended to keep them bound in slavery for ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>Even some of our officers and soldiers seem to think that nothing but evil can come out of these measures, and denounce <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0009.0008.00151.00248" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> for inaugurating them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>They understand very little about how difficult it is to resist the progressive spirit of our time, and would ignore the fact that the war has forced the <rs>Government</rs> to adopt certain <pb id="p.152" n="152"/> measures which it was not desirous of adopting at the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>They like to repeat with some emphasis that they did not enter the service of the <rs>Government</rs> for the purpose of abolishing slavery, but for the purpose of saving the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>And this general statement now being made by many in the army, I think represents their true sentiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>Had they known that the war would have so soon brought about the abolition of slavery, a great many men now in the service would probably never have enlisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>But I think that those who take this view of the matter, occupy a very inconsistent position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>We might ask, would they keep a portion of our army busy returning runaway slaves to their rebel masters?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>Or would they have large pastures or mess houses to keep all the slaves in that run away from their masters and come into our lines?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>Or would they carefully investigate each case to ascertain to whom the man, woman or child belonged, and then put a tag around the individual's neck so that he could be returned to the proper owner when the war is over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>To my mind any other position than that taken by the <rs>Government</rs> would not only be absurd, but impractible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>The rebels brought on the war, and that their leaders were too short sighted to foresee the results is now plain to every <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>They must make the best of their own mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>They gloried in being blind to the probable future destiny of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>While the war was not at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ostensibly carried on by the <rs>Government</rs> for the purpose of abolishing slavery, matters have now taken such a turn <pb id="p.153" n="153"/> that the freedom of the slaves has become a public necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>Though perhaps most of our people will temporarily deplore the necessity, there are others, a large minority too, who will hail this opportunity which the <rs>Government</rs> has, of wiping out a national crime, with delight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>It is a great victory for the latter class,--a victory that many never dreamed of realizing during their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>This class shall no longer be considered a contemptible minority of fanatics and disturbers of the peace, because we have advocated that all men should have equal rights, to life, liberty and the pursuit to happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>In the future history of the <rs>Republic</rs> those noble men of this generation, who have stood firm against great odds in advocating the abolition of slavery, will be regarded as among the saviors of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>The taunts, and insults, and sacrifices which they have endured, have not counted for nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>The judicial murder of <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0009.0008.00153.00249" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> will make him a martyr to freedom to the future generations of this country; and his name is already woven into a war song, which is sung throughout all our armies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>And now the slaves are going to help pay the price of their freedom by supporting the strong arms of their deliverers, instead of being a burden to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>How much better this is than if they do nothing, for their descendants can then say with conscious pride, <quote>our fathers, by their manhood and valor, and by their blood and sacrifices, contributed to our freedom.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>It would be unnatural for the late slaves to remain idle <pb id="p.154" n="154"/> in this great conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>Now is their time to strike, and they will not fail to do it. We have already heard that a colored regiment is being organized in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> from the negro refugees from <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> and <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1148"/>We are thus reminded that we should not only guard against attacks from the visible foe whom we seek, but that we should also guard against attacks from the invisible foe whom we do not seek, and which may be lurking in the very air we breathe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1149"/>An invisible portion of the small-pox virus introduced into the blood of a person who has never been vaccinated, nor had the smallpox, sets up a kind of fermentation, which goes on until it has entirely changed the molecular constitution of the blood, and in some way or other affects all the tissues of the body; or invisible germs, floating in the air and inhaled into the lungs, produce similar changes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1150"/>But that we are able by vaccination to ward off, in a great measure, the dangers from this loathsome disease, is surely a great blessing.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1152"/>There are some who have a dread of vaccination, and I have no doubt that there is often just cause for such dread, for there have been many instances in which bad results have come from using virus obtained from unhealthy persons or animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1153"/>The very greatest caution should therefore be exercised in regard to obtaining the virus from only perfectly healthy persons or animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1154"/>Speaking not as a medical practitioner, <pb id="p.178" n="178"/> but as I think from a common-sense point of view, I should say that the virus intended for use, ought not be obtained from anyone whose blood has been poisoned by immoral practices, or anyone having a consumptive or scrofulous diathesis, or anyone either of whose parents or grandparents died of consumption or were scrofulous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1155"/>Anyone who would ignorantly or willfully trifle with the lives and future health of his fellows, is a criminal and justly deserves our execrations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1156"/>It is possible, however, even after <num value="1">one</num> has used his most deliberate judgment, to be sometimes mistaken or deceived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1157"/>From such information as we have on the subject, I think it is generally regarded as safest to use the virus obtained from the cow. If animals were raised for this special purpose, kept isolated and in good condition, and properly inspected, then there should be only an infinitesimal danger in using the virus obtained from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1158"/>If individual enterprise cannot find it renumerative enough to go to this trouble, I think that, in time of war, the <rs>Government</rs> would not go outside of its legitimate functions to stock a farm or farms with animals, for the purpose of furnishing virus for its soldiers and sailors and citizen employes. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1213"/>If the <rs>Washington</rs> authorities really desired to organize <num value="1">one</num> or more <name>Indian</name> regiments, it would have been very little trouble to have sent out here for a report showing the number of Indians that could probably be enlisted into the service within a specified time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1215"/>If there had been vacancies to fill in the <rs>Indian</rs> regiments, it would, in my opinion, be much more just on the part of the <rs>Government</rs> to have filled them by appointments <pb id="p.186" n="186"/> from lists of non-commissioned officers of regiments that have seen service on the border.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1216"/>It is not very pleasant to those who have been in active service since early in the war, to have their services unrecognized, and to see green and untried men given important appointments by their sides and over them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1219"/>Out of these lists should be selected the best qualified and most deserving, who should be recommended to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, or appointing power, for promotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1220"/>Such a plan, however, is not likely to be adopted at present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1274"/>Mothers and daughters who, before the war, never dreamed of having to work in the fields, and who knew nothing of the hardships entailed upon many families by the war, will have to raise their own sustenance in this section this year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1701"/>Slavery is unquestionably getting to be an expensive and troublesome luxury, when the masters are obliged to take their slaves around with them through the woods and over the hills, as they move from place to place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1702"/>When it comes to this any man of sound mind ought to know that slavery is dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1703"/>There are not many grown up negroes in this section, who are not half idiots or old and infirm, who will not likely soon relieve their masters of the trouble of pulling them around from <pb id="p.245" n="245"/> place to place, by running away and joining their friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1705"/>Since we came into <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> I have noticed that a good many farms are being cultivated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1706"/>Of course there are very few families that will be able to till all the land which they once had under cultivation, for they cannot keep the animals and get the hands necessary to do it. They have, in many instances, used the rails not destroyed by the armies to inclose such tracts as they will be able to put under cultivation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1707"/>We saw a number of fields the other day where the corn was coming up and was an inch or so high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1708"/>There will be very little wheat raised in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523"><rs type="direction">southwest</rs> Missouri</placeName> this season, for during the season of sowing last autumn, the country was too much overrun by the armies to permit the people to work in the fields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1709"/>On most of the farms the people have not finished planting their corn yet. In nearly every case where we saw them at work, the daughters or mothers were dropping the corn, as they call it, and the boys too young for the war, were plowing it in or covering it with hoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1710"/>It the season is good, a surplus of corn will be raised, particularly in the neighborhoods of posts garrisoned by our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1711"/>As no family is permitted to keep much stock, very little of their corn will be fed to their own animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1712"/>But all they have to spare will <pb id="p.246" n="246"/> doubtless bring a fair price if sold to our troops, provided it is not taken before being sold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1713"/>Fruits are quite an item in the foodstuffs consumed by the people of this country; and there is good prospect of an abundant yield of apples, peaches, pears, &amp;c., this season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1715"/>The women of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523"><rs type="direction">southwest</rs> Missouri</placeName> surely deserve mention for their noble conduct in sticking to their homesteads and maintaining themselves and their children in the absence of their husbands and fathers and brothers in the war. If I were gifted with elegant expression, nothing could afford me greater pleasure than to pay them the highest possible tribute for their truly womanly characters under the most trying circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1716"/>With their youthful sons and daughters they raise their own foodstuffs, and in many instances spin and weave and manufacture most of their own clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1717"/>A good many raise small patches of cotton, from which they spin and weave their cotton goods, and keep a few sheep, the wool from which they &mdash; make their woolen clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1721"/>It is often remarked that they are so shy of strangers that they will not ask our officers for pay or receipts for forage, horses, or commissary supplies taken from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1722"/>They generally have pleasant, honest expressions, but often bearing a tinge of sadness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1723"/>Though surrounded by adversities of every kind, they endeavor to preserve their complexions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1724"/>Probably no section containing the same number of women, would show a larger proportion who possess as good figures and features and complexions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1725"/>I have observed them closely, for often on scouting expeditions and on the march, I have, in company with others, rode up to the well or spring to fill our canteens with water, or to the gate to make enquiries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1733"/>Every soldier has perhaps noticed how a good cup of coffee, after a night's marching, tones up his nervous system and makes him feel a livelier interest in everything around.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1734"/>We sometimes fill our canteens with coffee before starting out on a reconnaissance of several days; but it is not satisfactory to drink it in this way. We miss that fine flavor or bouquet which we get when it is taken fresh from the camp kettles. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1739"/>We continued our march, kept our eyes open, but did not exert our horses, as we were desirous of preserving their strength in case of an emergency, as a long journey yet lay before us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1781"/>From the roof of <num value="1">one</num> of the buildings inside our fortification, with a field glass, we can see very near the enemy's camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1782"/>The clouds of dust that we saw this afternoon, at several points on the opposite heights, clearly indicates that he is making some important movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1783"/>A large cavalry force was in motion, but we could not determine the direction they were marching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1784"/>The river is now quite low, and there are several points, both above and below us, where they can ford it. It is, I suppose, difficult for <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0014.00255.00492" reg="mostcommon:Phillips,William,A.,,:7"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> to determine the nature of their present activity; whether it means to attack us here, or to go up the country west of us, and attack our train due in a few days from <placeName key="tgn,2036378" n="1.000 33" reg="fort scott, bourbon, kansas">Fort Scott</placeName>. <pb id="p.256" n="256"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1785"/>To-day, the <dateStruct value="--20"><day reg="20">20th</day></dateStruct>, I have been out nearly all day with our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1786"/>This morning, just before <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time>, several of our men came in as fast as their horses could carry them, and reported that the enemy were firing upon our pickets, and had killed several of them, together with a number of herders, and were driving away <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> herds of horses and mules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1787"/>The bugles were instantly sounded, and in a few moments <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0014.00256.00493" reg="mostcommon:Phillips,William,A.,,:7"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> had nearly all his force, consisting of cavalry, dismounted men, and <num value="2">two</num> guns of <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Hopkins,Captain,,,," id="n0009.0014.00256.00494" reg="mostcommon:Hopkins,Henry,,,:2"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Hopkins</surname></persName>' battery</orgName> out on the plain, about a mile east of the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1788"/>He immediately formed his line and sent out a detachment of cavalry to the northeast of his position as skirmishers, and soon discovered that the enemy, in considerable force, had formed under cover of a rather dense woods, about <measure n="0.5mile" type="distance">a half-mile</measure> almost directly east of us. The section of artillery brought out from the fort was directed to open fire upon the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1789"/>After <num value="6">a half dozen</num> rounds of shells had been thrown into the woods where we <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> saw them, and our cavalry had opened on the left, I could see from our position, near the section of artillery, that, from the clouds of dust raised in the timber, that the enemy were in rapid movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1790"/>We moved forward with the <num value="2">two</num> guns and dismounted men, and our cavalry pressed them on the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1791"/>In the meantime all the horses and mules not captured had been driven into camp, and our cavalry was being rapidly reinforced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1792"/>When our cavalry was sufficiently strengthened by the arrival of troopers from the fort, mounted <pb id="p.257" n="257"/> on horses just brought in, the line on the left was formed, and the bugles sounded the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1793"/>At the same time the artillery, which was supported by the dismounted men, had moved up nearer the timber, and opened with shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1794"/>The enemy had no sooner drawn our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volley at a short range than they fled in the direction they came from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1795"/>We heard that a shell from <num value="1">one</num> of our guns burst in the midst of a body of rebel <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0009.0014.00257.00495" reg="mostcommon:Indians,Chickasaw,,,:1"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, killing and wounding quite a number, and throwing the others into a panic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1796"/>It is often remarked that <name>Indians</name> have a greater dread of artillery than white troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1797"/>Our cavalry followed them beyond <placeName reg="Greenleaf Prairie">Greenleaf Prairie</placeName>, <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> southeast of the fort, and recaptured a good many of our horses and mules which they had captured in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/>Their rear was exposed to the fire of our cavalry during the entire afternoon, and they must have suffered considerable loss in killed and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1799"/>They left on the field only <num value="8">eight</num> men, but we have understood that they took a number along with them who were mortally wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1800"/>We lost <num value="14">fourteen</num> men killed, and had about as many wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1801"/>The engagement lasted about an hour and <num value="0.5">a half</num>, but some time was consumed on the skirmish line before we ascertained the exact position of the enemy in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1802"/>They had taken up a position near the road leading to <placeName reg="Greenleaf Prairie">Greenleaf Prairie</placeName>, and probably intended to draw our troops into an ambuscade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1803"/>But <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0014.00257.00496" reg="mostcommon:Phillips,William,A.,,:7"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> was not to be deceived, by rushing headlong after a pretended flying party of the enemy, to be fired upon by a massed force in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1804"/>It was entirely <pb id="p.258" n="258"/> due to his coolness and skill in handling his troops that enabled us so quickly to put the enemy to flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1805"/>It is a time now that our movements should be conducted with great caution, as the enemy have not only a larger force than ours, but it is composed mainly of white troops. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/>That he should have succeeded in coming so near us unexpectedly is due to the fact that they killed most ,of our pickets along the road they came in on. They killed, captured, or cut off all our men on the <num value="2">two</num> outside picket stations, but when they came to the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> not more than <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> from camp, our <orgName n="Picket Guard" type="guard">picket guard</orgName> hurried to the fort and reported the approach of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1807"/>It is supposed that they crossed the river near <placeName reg="Webbers Falls, Muskogee, Oklahoma" key="tgn,2084239">Webber's Falls</placeName> and made a night's march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1808"/>With <orgName n="division"><persName n="Cabell,General,,,," id="n0009.0014.00258.00497" reg="mostcommon:Cabell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Cabell</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> operating along the <placeName reg="Arkansas, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> line, and <persName n="Cooper,General,,,," id="n0009.0014.00258.00498" reg="mostcommon:Cooper,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Cooper</surname></persName>'s force directly in our front within <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> of us, it is impossible for <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0014.00258.00499" reg="mostcommon:Phillips,William,A.,,:7"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, with the force at his disposal, to guard all the approaches to this post, except within a radius of a few miles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1809"/>This raid of the enemy has cost us heavily in animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1810"/>Our loss will not fall much short of <num value="300">three hundred</num> horses and mules, and perhaps even more, including the losses of the <rs>Indian</rs> soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1811"/>The <num value="4">four</num> companies of the battalion of the <orgName type="regiment" key="6KACav">Sixth Kansas cavalry</orgName> lost probably nearly half of their horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>As the men of these companies owned their horses as private property, and have been paid for their risk and use by the <rs>Government</rs>, the loss to each individual owner will be quite a hardship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1813"/>Though they <pb id="p.259" n="259"/> may soon be in funds, as the paymaster is expected to come down with the supply train to pay off the troops of this division, it will be difficult for them to find in this section suitable animals for remounts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1814"/><name>Indian</name> ponies could perhaps be had, but in my opinion they are only suitable for <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0009.0014.00259.00500" reg="mostcommon:Indians,Chickasaw,,,:1"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, and would answer only as temporary remounts for the white soldiers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1815"/><num value="1">One</num> of our <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0009.0014.00259.00501" reg="mostcommon:Indians,Chickasaw,,,:1"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, a herder or picket, who was killed by the enemy, had his clothing set on fire and his body burned to a crisp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1816"/>He was brought in this afternoon with the other killed and wounded, and he presented a ghastly sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1817"/>It was a barbarous act on the part of the enemy, and we had supposed that the rebel troops operating against us were commanded by officers who had too high a sense of honor to permit such an outrage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1818"/>I am unable to see what object they had in view in perpetrating such fiendish treatment on the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1819"/>If they think that such acts will make our men regard them with greater terror, they are mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>It was probably done by the rebel <rs>Indians</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1821"/>Our pickets at the <rs>Rapid Ford</rs> <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> below the fort, reported to-day (<num value="22" type="ordinal">22d</num>) that the enemy fired wooden balls at them from the opposite side of the river nearly all day. This would indicate that they want to keep up a noise to occupy our attention, and that they have more powder than lead to waste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/>We can see very clearly that they desire to draw our attention to points on the river below here as much as possible, while their most important movements, are directed to another quarter, to the west side of <placeName reg="Bedford, Livingston, Missouri" key="tgn,7016221">Grand river</placeName>, for the purpose of capturing our commissary train <pb id="p.260" n="260"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>On the <dateStruct value="--22"><day reg="2">22d</day></dateStruct> our scouts brought in information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/>that a large force of the enemy crossed the <rs>Arkansas</rs> above the mouths of the <placeName reg="Bedford, Livingston, Missouri" key="tgn,7016221">Grand</placeName> and the <placeName reg="North Branch Verdigris River, Kansas, United States" key="tgn,2544405">Verdigris rivers</placeName>, and are believed to be moving northward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/>Whether it is their intention to continue their march northward until they meet our supply train, or whether they intend to take up a strong position above here and await its arrival, to make the attack, is not definitely known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1827"/>He has to-night sent out nearly all of his available cavalry to meet the train which is due here <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, the <num value="24" type="ordinal">24th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1828"/>The enemy seem to be almost as well-informed of its movements as we are, from the preparations they are making to effect its capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1829"/>The clouds of dust we saw again to-day west of their camp shows that they are displaying great activity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1830"/>There is not now a reasonable doubt but that we shall have to fight to get our train in. But as our troops have not yet been defeated, we will not give it up without a hard contest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1831"/>A number of our sick and convalescent <name>Indian</name> soldiers who have been at <placeName key="tgn,2084078" n="1.000 2" reg="tahlequah, cherokee, oklahoma">Tahlequah</placeName> for some time, came in to-day, fearing an attack from the enemy at that place, since it is known that rebel scouts were recently seen in that vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1832"/>It is provoking that we have not a larger cavalry force in this section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1833"/>The enemy, however, would not likely attack a hospital, but they might go there and take away with them the <pb id="p.261" n="261"/> convalescent patients, unless those in charge of the hospital should spread the report that a number of smallpox patients are still there, which I am under the impression is a fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1834"/>I don't know that we have had any troops stationed there since we came here; and there must be some good reason why the enemy has not shown himself in sight of that place, as it is about <measure n="25miles" type="distance">twenty-five miles</measure> from this post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1835"/>But he would just about as likely wish to capture a herd of horses with glanders as a hospital filled with small-pox patients. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1836"/><dateStruct value="-05-24"><day type="name">Sunday</day>, <month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="24">24th</day></dateStruct>, was a day of considerable excitement and activity with us.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1838"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> (<num value="23" type="ordinal">23rd</num>) our pickets along the banks of the river, having <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ascertain the range of our carbines and carefully estimated the distance across the river, fired upon and <measure n="3" type="killed">killed three</measure> of the enemy's patrol guards on the opposite bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/>Our soldiers managed to fix up some cartridges which contained a little more than the usual quantity of powder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1840"/>At any rate the charges were sufficient to send the balls flying over the river and right into objects at which the carbines were aimed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1841"/>There is not a better cavalry arm in the service than <persName n="Sharp,,,,," id="n0009.0014.00261.00504" reg="mostcommon:Sharp,nomatch:0"><surname>Sharp</surname></persName>'s carbine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1842"/>We have some adventurous spirits in the battalion of the <orgName type="regiment" key="6KACav">Sixth Kansas cavalry</orgName>, and I believe that if it were possible they would <pb id="p.262" n="262"/> contrive some means to send a ball <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>, if nothing but a river separated us from the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1843"/>There was an alarm in camp <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, caused by a detachment of the enemy making an attempt to capture our pickets at <num value="1">one</num> of the outside stations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1844"/>In view of the situation and to guard against a possible surprise, <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0014.00262.00505" reg="mostcommon:Phillips,William,A.,,:7"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> ordered all the troops encamped on the southern and eastern slopes of the hill, inside of the fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/>We took our tents down and packed everything up, and in less than <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> were inside the fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>Some few of the soldiers thought it useless, while most of them were perfectly satisfied to trust to the judgment of our commanding officer, as he was in a position to know very nearly the exact situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>The thought of being somewhat crowded, it is true, was not a pleasant feature; but nearly every <num value="1">one</num> was willing to forego a little freedom of movement for the sake of greater safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>So this morning when the sun had climbed the mountains, which, from our more elevated position, looked lovely fringed with green, the parapets were bristling with the guns of <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Hopkins,Captain,,,," id="n0009.0014.00262.00506" reg="mostcommon:Hopkins,Henry,,,:2"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Hopkins</surname></persName>' battery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1849"/>Various rumors were afloat all the morning concerning the movements of the enemy, but nothing was definitely known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1850"/>As he is known to have received considerable reinforcements recently, some thought that he might feel strong enough to divide his force into <num value="2">two</num> divisions, <num value="1">one</num> to attack our train, and the other our troops here in the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1851"/><persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0014.00262.00507" reg="mostcommon:Phillips,William,A.,,:7"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, who no doubt comprehends the situation, at <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> this afternoon <pb id="p.263" n="263"/> took about <num value="500">five hundred</num> men, infantry, cavalry and <num value="1">one</num> section of <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Hopkins,,,,," id="n0009.0014.00263.00508" reg="mostcommon:Hopkins,Henry,,,:2"><surname>Hopkins</surname></persName>' battery</orgName>, and marched down to the <rs>Rapid Ford</rs>, <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> below here, with the view of making a demonstration against the enemy's camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1852"/>I desired to witness the action, and also went along.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1853"/>We marched leisurely, and reached the ford about <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time>. There had been no firing between the pickets during the day, though it is not likely that they had kept quiet on account of religious scruples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1854"/>We saw the enemy on the opposite bank in considerable force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/>They did not seem alarmed at our presence, and were quite willing to show themselves some distance back in an open space.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>As the river bank on the north side, as well as on the south side, was thickly clothed with brush and woods, they did not see the section of the battery when we commenced forming in line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/>While they were surveying the situation, <persName n="Hopkins,Captain,,,," id="n0009.0014.00263.00509" reg="mostcommon:Hopkins,Henry,,,:2"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Hopkins</surname></persName> estimated the range, and in a moment more, bang went a shell from <num value="1">one</num> gun, and then from the other, right into a small group of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1858"/>The place became too hot for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/>We could plainly see the shells burst near the party, and their instant scattering; but we could not see whether any of them were struck or not by pieces of bursting shells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>A number of men were seen near a small house, on the road, several <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> beyond the opposite ford.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1861"/><num value="2">Two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> shells were thrown near them, and they immediately disappeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1862"/>Presently, for a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> or so above and below the ford, they opened fire from behind fallen trees and the thick woods, but the <pb id="p.264" n="264"/> balls from their small arms fell spent near us or dropped into the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1863"/>We returned several volleys, aiming at the places where we saw the smoke rising from their discharged muskets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1864"/>I fired a dozen rounds from my <persName n="Sharp,,,,," id="n0009.0014.00264.00510" reg="mostcommon:Sharp,nomatch:0"><surname>Sharp</surname></persName>'s carbine, waiting every time for the smoke to rise, from some point on the opposite bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/>The river bed on the north side was perfectly dry, the channel running near the opposite bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>We continued to move forward until we reached the middle of the stream, when the enemy opened a volley upon us, wounding <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> men. We returned the fire, but with not much advantage, as we had to guide our horses in the strong current which was now flowing up to their flanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1870"/>The heavy volleys of musketry made a good many horses unmanageable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>The infantry, however, who were still on the sand bar, returned the fire vigorously, and with better effect, so that the enemy kept back a few yards from shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1879"/>After returning from the <rs>Rapid Ford</rs> yesterday evening, and getting our suppers, and resting a few hours, we started out again to meet our train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1880"/>While marching along during the night on the old military road upon which the train was coming, we saw several fresh trails, the prairie grass having been tramped down flat by horses' feet, showing that the enemy were moving in several divisions, doubtless with the intention of attacking simultaneously from several quarters, the front and flanks, or front and rear of the escort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1881"/><pb id="p.267" n="267"/> Several of us got off our horses and carefully inspected <num value="1">one</num> trail, and easily distinguished the directions they had marched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1882"/>Some <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="12miles" type="distance">twelve miles</measure> out our detachment formed a junction with the troops guarding the train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1883"/>The train probably had about <num value="200">two hundred</num> wagons in all, and moving in the closest order possible, stretched out a distance of more than a mile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1884"/>From the time we joined it the road ran over a broad prairie, until we should get within <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> of the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1885"/>We marched with a detachment of about <num value="100">one hundred</num> cavalrymen, say <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile in advance of the escort just in front of the train, with detachments of cavalry at convenient distances from each other on both flanks, and with a strong <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1886"/>Skirmishers were also kept out <measure n="0.5mile" type="distance">a half mile</measure> on each side of the road, with instructions to keep up with the advance guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1887"/>We were moving along quietly, and approaching the timber on <placeName key="tgn,7016221;tgn,2058388;tgn,2043394;tgn,2042901;tgn,1124289" n="0.039 000000.2727	placename;tgn,7016221;Bedford, Livingston, Missouri,Livingston,Missouri,United States,North and Central America;0.039 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2058388;Clinton, Henry, Missouri,Henry,Missouri,United States,North and Central America;0.039 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2043394;Mansura, Avoyelles, Louisiana,Avoyelles,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America;0.039 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2042901;Grand River, Iberville, Louisiana,Iberville,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America;0.039 000000.2727	placename;tgn,1124289;grand,ontario,canada,north and central america,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America" reg="Bedford, Livingston, Missouri,Livingston,Missouri,United States,North and Central America;Clinton, Henry, Missouri,Henry,Missouri,United States,North and Central America;Mansura, Avoyelles, Louisiana,Avoyelles,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America;Grand River, Iberville, Louisiana,Iberville,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America;grand,ontario,canada,north and central america,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America">Grand River</placeName> about <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> northwest of the fort, and, perhaps, nearly an hour before day-break, when we heard the report of a musket, and then <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> more shots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1888"/>We saw the flash from the musket before we saw the enemy or heard the report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1889"/>It was then silent for a moment, but the next moment we saw our skirmishers and advance guard falling back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1890"/>Closely following them we saw, by the dim light of the stars, the long lines of the enemy filing over a ridge in the prairie a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> off. Orders were immediately given for the teams to change to <num value="2">two</num> abreast, as this would shorten the line of wagons we were required to defend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1891"/>Instructions <pb id="p.268" n="268"/> were also given to teamsters not to leave their teams under any circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/>The enemy continued to advance, and when some <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> off, seemed to occupy nearly all the visible horizon upon the prairie, <name>south</name>, <name>east</name> and <name>west</name> of us. <num value="1000">One thousand</num> cavalry, when not marching in close order, cover a large field, particularly at night, and are likely to be overestimated in numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>Our lines were quickly formed, and when the enemy approached within a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> of us, we opened fire upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/>They promptly returned a volley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1895"/>We continued to pour into their ranks volley after volley, which soon threw them into considerable disorder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1896"/>They soon rallied, however, and made a few feeble efforts at charging us, but did not come nearer than <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> of the troops with whom I was acting, for our firing was conducted with great caution and deliberation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1897"/>Several other divisions which they sent to make attacks at other points, were equally unsuccessful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1898"/>It was a grand sight to see the flashes from the long lines of muskets and carbines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1900"/>The <num value="2">two</num> short sides of the square were made quite strong, and when the enemy made an effort to break either of the long and weak sides, we cross-fired him, and all his efforts were fruitless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1901"/>Nearly half of our troops fought dismounted, which enabled them to fire with greater precision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1902"/>We held the enemy in check in this manner for upwards of an hour, and until towards daylight, repulsing <pb id="p.269" n="269"/> him in every attack, when <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0015.00269.00520" reg="mostcommon:Phillips,William,A.,,:7"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> determined to take the offensive, and at the decisive moment ordered the bugle sounded and led his troops to the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1903"/>We moved forward with a shout, and in a few moments completely routed the enemy all along the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1904"/>The main body we pursued several miles in the direction of the <placeName reg="North Branch Verdigris River, Kansas, United States" key="tgn,2544405">Verdigris River</placeName>, firing into their rear every opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1905"/>Other detachments fled in other directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1906"/>They left <measure n="26" type="dead">twenty-six dead</measure> on the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1907"/>Our loss was <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> men killed, and perhaps <num value="25">twenty-five</num> or <measure n="30" type="wounded">thirty wounded</measure>. As soon as the enemy had been driven from the field, the train was set in motion, and arrived at <placeName key="tgn,7016221;tgn,2058388;tgn,2043394;tgn,2042901;tgn,1124289" n="0.049 000000.3409	placename;tgn,7016221;Bedford, Livingston, Missouri,Livingston,Missouri,United States,North and Central America;0.049 000000.3409	placename;tgn,2058388;Clinton, Henry, Missouri,Henry,Missouri,United States,North and Central America;0.049 000000.3409	placename;tgn,2043394;Mansura, Avoyelles, Louisiana,Avoyelles,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America;0.049 000000.3409	placename;tgn,2042901;Grand River, Iberville, Louisiana,Iberville,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America;0.029 000000.2046	placename;tgn,1124289;grand,ontario,canada,north and central america,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America" reg="Bedford, Livingston, Missouri,Livingston,Missouri,United States,North and Central America;Clinton, Henry, Missouri,Henry,Missouri,United States,North and Central America;Mansura, Avoyelles, Louisiana,Avoyelles,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America;Grand River, Iberville, Louisiana,Iberville,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America;grand,ontario,canada,north and central america,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America">Grand River</placeName> opposite to the fort just after sunrise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1908"/>During the day <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> wagon loads of the enemy's dead were brought in for burial near this post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1909"/>We heard through our pickets along the river, that the enemy boasted of their intention of getting their <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>'s breakfast out of our rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1910"/>If this really was their boast, and they brought no rations with them, they must have returned to their camp hungry and disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1911"/>They did, however, capture and plunder <num value="1">one</num> sutler's wagon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1912"/>The teamster for the sutler seems to have got frightened and left his team, which became separated from the train and wandered about on the prairie. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1913"/>We received information through our scouts, that the enemy had another strong force above us on <placeName key="tgn,7016221;tgn,2058388;tgn,2043394;tgn,2042901;tgn,1124289" n="0.049 000000.3409	placename;tgn,7016221;Bedford, Livingston, Missouri,Livingston,Missouri,United States,North and Central America;0.049 000000.3409	placename;tgn,2058388;Clinton, Henry, Missouri,Henry,Missouri,United States,North and Central America;0.049 000000.3409	placename;tgn,2043394;Mansura, Avoyelles, Louisiana,Avoyelles,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America;0.049 000000.3409	placename;tgn,2042901;Grand River, Iberville, Louisiana,Iberville,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America;0.029 000000.2046	placename;tgn,1124289;grand,ontario,canada,north and central america,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America" reg="Bedford, Livingston, Missouri,Livingston,Missouri,United States,North and Central America;Clinton, Henry, Missouri,Henry,Missouri,United States,North and Central America;Mansura, Avoyelles, Louisiana,Avoyelles,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America;Grand River, Iberville, Louisiana,Iberville,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America;grand,ontario,canada,north and central america,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America">Grand River</placeName>, which failed to co-operate with the force that engaged us in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1915"/>The force which fought us in the morning, either returned to defend and save their camp after starting out, or remained in camp longer than they had intended on account of our threatening attitude in that direction <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>, thus preventing them from carrying out the pre-arranged plan of forming a junction with the force north of us at a certain point and at a certain hour <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>. It does not seem reasonable, and we do not believe, that the enemy deliberately planned to attack our train within sight of our fortifications, where we might quickly reinforce it with nearly all the troops of this post.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1917"/>It would be difficult to point out a finer movement in military manoeuvers, as having actually occurred, than that which <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0015.00270.00523" reg="mostcommon:Phillips,William,A.,,:7"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> executed to save his trains; and were he in a section where military correspondents are swarming around headquarters like they are around the headquarters of our eastern armies, he would be lauded as a real hero.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1918"/>Less brilliant achievements and less distinguished bravery than he has shown on several occasions during the last week, have been considered sufficient in the cases of other officers <pb id="p.271" n="271"/> to earn them promotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1919"/>He has shown himself to be remarkably fertile in resources in an emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1920"/>At such times most men lose their heads. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1921"/>The enemy are reported to have had upwards of <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> men in the engagement, but I am inclined to think that they had at least <num value="2000">two thousand</num> white soldiers and <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0009.0015.00271.00524" reg="mostcommon:Indians,Chickasaw,,,:1"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, composed of Texans, Choctaws and Cherokees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1922"/>Though they seem to have been well-informed in regard to the movements of the trains, perhaps through <persName n="Livingston,,,,," id="n0009.0015.00271.00525" reg="mostcommon:Livingston,Tom,,,:1"><surname>Livingston</surname></persName>'s guerrillas, operating in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Baxter Springs, Cherokee, Kansas" key="tgn,7017585">Baxter Springs</placeName>, they were disappointed in the strength of the escort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1923"/>Had they succeeded in capturing or burning the train, we should have been obliged to abandon this post, as we could have issued full rations only for a day or so longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1924"/>Indeed, of some articles we have already been obliged to issue less than the full allowance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1925"/>This country could afford no subsistence, except fresh beef; and all our other supplies would be exhausted before we reached the <placeName key="tgn,7007254" n="1.000 89" reg="kansas">Kansas</placeName> line. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1926"/>The paymaster, who came down with the train, commenced on the <num value="27" type="ordinal">27th</num> paying off the troops at this post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1927"/>Many of the officers and soldiers here have not been paid for <measure n="8months" type="date">eight months</measure>, and, of course, payment at this time will be quite acceptable to everyone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1928"/>A good many of our white soldiers, who have families, generally find some means of sending nearly all their salaries home soon after pay day. Many others would,no doubt, send their money north were it not for the danger of losing it. If a soldier puts his money in <pb id="p.272" n="272"/> an envelope and seals it, and sends it by a friend to his family, his friend may get captured, or killed, or lose it, or be subjected to some great delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1929"/>And down here, where we are so much isolated from the rest of the world, the mail is not regarded as a fit and proper medium for the transmission of valuable packages, such as money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1930"/>A soldier can ill afford to lose <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> of his small earnings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1931"/>It would be a great convenience to the officers and soldiers of our armies if the <rs>Government</rs> should adopt some system by which those desiring to do so could send their money to their families by check.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1932"/>When men carry their money around in their pockets, and have the slightest disposition to gamble, they are liable to be drawn into this immoral habit again-particularly when they have little else to occupy their minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1933"/>Since quite a proportion of our white troops lost their horses by the recent raid of the enemy, and by being worn out in the service for want of forage, we have an unusually large number of men subject to continuous camp life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1934"/>And several times, while taking a stroll on the outskirts of the camp, I have noticed more than <num value="6">a half dozen</num> small groups of men, in pleasant, shady spots, engaged in playing <quote>Chuck Luck.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1935"/>They were all betting, generally in small sums of money A gum or rubber blanket is usually spread upon the ground, and <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> men sit down upon it, with dice and dice-box, and bet on the dice thrown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1936"/>This affords excitement and kills time, which is a burden to men, who, for months, have been actively employed in scouting and <pb id="p.273" n="273"/> marching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1937"/>Loaded dice are now and then heard of, and when discovered generally result in a row. Other parties bet on games of cards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1938"/>Some of those who are rather sharp gamblers, claim to have fleeced their comrades and some of the <name>Indians</name> out of more money than a soldier receives from the <rs>Government</rs> for <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> salary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1939"/>The gambling cannot be easily broken up, for parties caught in the act of playing may claim to be playing for amusement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1940"/>We have noticed again to-day, from the roof of the large stone building on the bluff, with a spy-glass, unusual activity in the enemy's camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1941"/>What it means we do not yet know; and at present we do not feel any great anxiety in regard to it. We are now in a condition our troops would rather like them to attack us; and unless they come with an overwhelming force we should fight them outside our fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1942"/>But they doubtless know that it would be useless to attack us here, since we were able to rout them the other morning in an &mdash; open field, when they had an opportunity of choosing the position and time of attack, and were free to maneuver as they pleased. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1982"/>They affect to think that our government is hard pressed for soldiers when it feels the necessity of accepting the military service of the recent slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/>But we may observe that the enemy will perhaps find out, before this contest is over, that the recent slaves will feel as much interest in fighting for their freedom as our white soldiers have in fighting to maintain the integrity of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1984"/>It may also be remarked that there are many of us who believe that there can be no permanent union without the permanent.freedom of the late slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1989"/>Before the summer is over, and we continue to be as near neighbors as at present, they will likely become abundantly satisfied on this point &mdash; that is, that we have a regiment of soldiers as black as ebony, and that they can go through the infantry manual as handsomely and with as much ease as perhaps any of their own troops, and that if they have an opportunity of seeing them, they may see them with bright blue uniforms, and if coming into line, with muskets and bayonets glistening beautifully but terribly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2021"/>But if they had it in view to make another raid for such a purpose, they must have given it up for some reason, for a detachment of our cavalry sent out to-day several miles beyond the picket station where the men were killed, returned without having <pb id="p.282" n="282"/> found any signs of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2027"/>If it should be a light advance guard of the enemy approaching, a well directed fire of the pickets will, perhaps, in most instances, stop their progress until the main force comes up.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2033"/>We can sometimes hear from this post the volleys of small arms at different points along the river, as if the <num value="2">two</num> forces were actually approaching each other in line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2034"/>If either party should attempt to cross the river, then it would of course be perfectly proper for the other party to fire upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2035"/>But I do not apprehend that the firing will entirely cease immediately, as it will be easy for those of restless dispositions on either side to find some pretext for firing an occasional shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2036"/>Picket duty is very monotonous, and the <hi rend="italics">young</hi> men like to do something occasionally for excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2037"/>Perhaps it is needless for me to specify and emphasize the <hi rend="italics">young</hi> men, for among our white troops I believe that over <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of the enlisted men are between the ages of <num value="20">twenty</num> and <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>. We have quite a number under the age of <num value="20">twenty</num>, counting myself among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2038"/>It will therefore be seen that we have a good deal of the spirit of youth among us; so much indeed that there is always some <num value="1">one</num> ready to undertake almost any adventure that it is possible to propose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2039"/>It is well enough to have a good deal of such <hi rend="italics">esprit de corps</hi> in an army, if it is properly guided by older and cooler heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2040"/>But there is a thought that comes into my mind in regard to the great number of young men who have enlisted into our armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2041"/>It is this: If the war continues a few years longer, and it is as destructive of young men and men under middle age as it has already been, will not this great loss of young men just growing into manhood, and men just commencing to assume <pb id="p.286" n="286"/> the duties of citizens, be seriously felt throughout the country for the next few generations?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2042"/>No <num value="1">one</num> I think can doubt but that most of the strong, healthy and vigorous young men who are full of patriotic pride and feel a deep interest in their country's welfare, if they have not already, are now enlisting into the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2043"/>What proportion of these young men will return to their homes sound and healthy as they left them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2044"/>Perhaps only a small proportion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2045"/>The blood that courses the veins of these men is the kind of blood that should flow through the veins of the children of the rising generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2046"/>The patriotic spirit which animates these young men, is the kind of patriotic spirit which should animate the children of the future of this great country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2047"/>The nation is surely making a great sacrifice, but the principle involved is a great <num value="1">one</num>, and when we take into account the benefits that must accrue to future generations if our arms are crowned with success, as they must be, I believe that it will be admitted that the prize is worth much of the best blood of the country But the noble sacrifice of the heroic dead or living should not be regarded lightly, nor soon forgotten by the rising generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2048"/>Many of us may wish that we could have been born a generation or so later; but as we are here we should not endeavor to escape the responsibility, if we are true to ourselves, of doing our best to leave a desirable form of government &mdash; an ideal form &mdash; to those who shall come after us. And moreover some of us may reasonably hope that we shall escape the enemy's arms and the <pb id="p.287" n="287"/> sickness of the camp, and enjoy for a time, at least, that desirable existence which the war is being waged to secure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2049"/>But each of us that attains to a ripe age, as the years pass by and his thoughts turn to the scenes of the war, will remember with sadness that his company left a comrade upon this field and another upon that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2050"/>And those of us whose heads are now filled with youthful thoughts will be crowned with hoary hairs, and instead of bounding over the plain as now, a staff will be used to assist locomotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2051"/>What a mystery is life! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2052"/>We come to the final remark, that our young soldiers who are cut off when life is sweetest, and going down to their graves by the <num value="1000">thousand</num> almost daily, have no <persName n="Alcestis,,,,," id="n0009.0016.00287.00558" reg="mostcommon:Alcestis,nomatch:0"><surname>Alcestis</surname></persName> to die for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2053"/>But they have proved themselves as generous as <persName n="Alcestis,,,,," id="n0009.0016.00287.00559" reg="mostcommon:Alcestis,nomatch:0"><surname>Alcestis</surname></persName>, for they have laid down their lives for the living and unborn <num value="1000000">millions</num> of their race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2054"/>If life on the average is desirable or worth living, what an immensely greater amount of happiness there might be if the aged, who have but a short term of years before them, could die for the young.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2055"/>But the gift of life scarcely anyone desires to part with, though he knows he can retain it only for a short period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2056"/>The old will never be sacrificed in war that the young may live the natural periods of their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2057"/>The strongest and best must always do the fighting. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2058"/>Information was received at this post on the <dateStruct value="--10"><day reg="2">10th</day></dateStruct>, that <orgName n="command"><persName n="Cooper,General,,,," id="n0009.0016.00287.00560" reg="mostcommon:Cooper,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Cooper</surname></persName>'s command</orgName> on the south side of the <placeName key="tgn,7019842" n="1.000 46" reg="arkansas river, united states, north and central america">Arkansas river</placeName> has moved back about <measure n="15miles" type="distance">fifteen miles</measure>. <num value="2">Two</num> women who brought this information <pb id="p.288" n="288"/> claim to have been detained in the camp of the rebels about a week ; but they do not complain of any discourteous treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2059"/>They think that the enemy were about to make some important movement, and that their detention was to prevent them from advising us anything concerning it. Even if the main body has left, it is probable that a force deemed sufficient to guard the fords of the river and to watch our movements, will remain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2060"/>As they have no particular point to hold, we can see no forcible reason why they should be content to stay in camp all summer within sight of us. But the movement they are reported to have just made, does not seem to be an aggressive <num value="1">one</num>, though it may turn out to be such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2061"/>It is possible that they have moved their camp to a place where they will have better grazing facilities for their animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2062"/>We need not suppose that their horses will stand hard service on grass ally better than ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2063"/>If their animals have any advantage over ours, it is probably due to the fact, that they were kept at places during the winter where plenty of hay and corn were put up for their use. Their horses may have had some slight advantage too, by having had good grazing several weeks earlier than ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2064"/>As the country in their rear towards <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, is not infested with union guerrillas, as the country in our rear is with rebel guerrillas; and as their supply trains, if they have any, are not annoyed by our troops, their cavalry horses have nothing like the current hard service to perform that ours have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2065"/>But we hope that this state of things will be <pb id="p.289" n="289"/> all changed in a few weeks, that we shall have troops enough down here to take the offensive, and put the enemy to looking out for the safety of their trains, etc. We believe that they will find that we can and will act as vigorously on the offensive as on the defensive, and that their lease on the south bank of the river is almost at an end. If <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0016.00289.00561" reg="mostcommon:Phillips,William,A.,,:7"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> should get reinforcements soon, he would no doubt cross the river and attack <persName n="Cooper,General,,,," id="n0009.0016.00289.00562" reg="mostcommon:Cooper,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Cooper</surname></persName> in his camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2066"/>If successful, this would be better than forcing him to detach a portion of his troops for the protection of his supply trains. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2070"/>They may have been making a kind of survey of the situation, with the view of seeing if their batteries could be used against us with much advantage from the west side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2071"/>It is the impression of our officers that they could not. The opposite heights, we believe, are too distant even for the best long range rifled guns to be very effective against our <pb id="p.290" n="290"/> works on the bluff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2072"/>And supposing that they should hammer away at our fortifications for several days, they would at the end of that time still have the river to cross, which we should warmly contest, whether they attempted to ford it, or should bring pontoons to throw across it. When the river is low enough for a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> above or below the fortifications, and the enemy should attempt to force either of these crossings, we could quickly throw up temporary breastworks to cover our battery, and with grape and canister inflict a heavy loss upon them before they got over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2121"/>The enemy's pickets and ours were in swimming together in the <rs>Arkansas</rs> on the <dateStruct value="--19"><day reg="19">19th instant</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2122"/>Though they agreed beforehand that they would not endeavor to take advantage of each other, yet they were cautious not to come nearer than a rod of each other, and the men of each party took care to keep nearest the water's edge of their own side of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2123"/>The next day they were less distrustful of each other, and an equal number of men from each side had a friendly conference in the middle of the <rs>Arkansas</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2124"/>The <num value="2">two</num> parties talked for sometime in a good-natured manner of the various contests in which each had participated, of some relative or friend who was taken prisoner in such an engagement; of the prospects of the war, and of <pb id="p.296" n="296"/> the operations of the armies in the east.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2125"/>By an agreement of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day's conference, the rebel soldiers were to-day to bring some tobacco, and our soldiers some coffee, for exchange with each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2126"/>Both parties kept their promises, and at the meeting on the <dateStruct value="--20"><day reg="2">20th</day></dateStruct>, exchanged their coffee and tobacco with each other in the middle of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2127"/>As I was acquainted with our river patrol, I had the curiosity to witness the meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2128"/>At this conference the rebel soldiers mentioned of having the <num value="5">five</num> white prisoners captured by their forces at Green Leaf, on the <dateStruct value="--16"><day reg="16">16th instant</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2129"/>They also in the course of the conversation said that there had recently been a good many desertions from their army, and that <num value="4">four</num> men who were tried not long since for desertion, have been found guilty and sentenced to be shot, and that the sentence is expected to be carried into effect in a few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2130"/>From what we have frequently heard, I believe that the rebels are more rigid in their punishment of deserters than the military authorities in our armies, although with us the penalty is death for desertion in time of war. With us there is not much trouble taken to find deserters, and bring them to trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2131"/>I have been with our army on the border and in this territory now nearly <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, and there has not yet been a deserter from the troops with which I have been serving, caught, tried, condemned and executed to my knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2132"/>We have had a small number of desertions during this period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2133"/>It is possible, however, that there have been some executions for desertion at <placeName key="tgn,2036378" n="1.000 33" reg="fort scott, bourbon, kansas">Forts Scott</placeName> and <placeName reg=", , " key="tgn,701391">Leavenworth</placeName>, <pb id="p.297" n="297"/> as the courts-martial for the trial of deserters have generally been convened at those posts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2134"/>There is such a sentiment against inflicting the death penalty, even in cases where the charge is murder, that I have no doubt but that there are officers who would prefer, if the discharge of their duties permitted, to be relieved from the disagreeable duty of approving the findings of the court in case of desertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2135"/>It is highly gratifying to note the spreading of this more humane sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2136"/>There is a tendency of our Government not to punish its soldiers so rigorously as formerly for certain offenses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2137"/>Flogging has been abolished in the army and navy since the war commenced, and no <num value="1">one</num> will contend that the <hi rend="italics">morale</hi> of our army has suffered in consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2138"/>It was a barbarous practice, and originated in a less enlightened age than this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2139"/>Indeed, I doubt whether there ever was an army that was composed of more true gentlemen than is our army at this moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2140"/>Supposing that the law had remained on the statutes permitting an upstart of an officer to have a soldier flogged for any petty offense, imaginary or real, and <num value="1000">thousands</num> of patriotic men-throughout the country would not have so readily come forward and offered their services to the <rs>Government</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2141"/>A government that recognizes the manly spirit of its citizen soldiery, will lose nothing by treating them as men in the end. There must of course be discipline; for there has not yet probably been a single regiment organized for the war, into which there has not enlisted several regular <hi rend="italics">dead beats</hi>. But men of this class who persist in violating <pb id="p.298" n="298"/> law and order, as soon as their true characters are known, should be drummed out of the service in disgrace, or if their offenses demand a greater punishments, confined in military prisons for definite periods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2142"/>But even these hard characters the lash and buck and gagging, are not likely to make better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2143"/>What their prison discipline should be I am not prepared to say, except that I believe it should be of such a nature as would have a tendency to reform them instead of hardening their perverse natures. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2379"/>The supply train started back to <placeName key="tgn,2036378" n="1.000 33" reg="fort scott, bourbon, kansas">Fort Scott</placeName> <dateStruct value="-07-7"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="7">7th</day></dateStruct>, and as the battalion of the <orgName type="regiment" key="6KACav">Sixth Kansas cavalry</orgName>, which has been with <orgName n="division"><persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0018.00330.00682" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,W.,A.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>' division</orgName> of this command since the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of last <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, was ordered to accompany the train as a part of its escort, my chronicles of the operations of the <rs>Federal</rs> troops in the <placeName reg="Oklahoma" key="tgn,7007707">Indian Territory</placeName> will not hereafter be so full as usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2380"/>As my duties may take me to some other field, or so far away that I will not be conscious of all that <pb id="p.331" n="331"/> is going on here, a little review of the past <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> may be of some interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2381"/>In looking back over this period, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thought that comes into my mind is, that <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0018.00331.00683" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,W.,A.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> has shown remarkable executive ability in the management of the troops of his division.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2382"/>And we feel quite sure that no graduate of <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> could have been found who would have displayed greater military sagacity than our commander, <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0018.00331.00684" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,W.,A.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, in the handling of troops, in seizing advantageous positions, and in meeting all the contingencies liable to arise in administering the affairs of a large district like his. From the time that this division left the <orgName n="Army of the Frontier" type="army">Army of the Frontier</orgName> at <placeName reg="Elm Springs, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,2008180">Elm Springs</placeName>, he has gained in popularity with his troops and the people within his military jurisdiction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2383"/>With every possible shade of humanity flocking to his camp, he maintained a tone of moral order that would be creditable to the best organized army unencumbered with such difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2384"/>His lines of march have nowhere been marked by the smoking ruins of destroyed towns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2385"/>I do not believe that half a dozen houses have been burned during the last <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> by his troops in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523"><rs type="direction">southwest</rs> Missouri</placeName>, <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172"><rs type="direction">northwest</rs> Arkansas</placeName>, and in the <rs>Indian</rs> nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2386"/>When his troops left <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172"><rs type="direction">northwest</rs> Arkansas</placeName> the latter part of winter, I will venture the belief that many rebel families even regretted it, for he respected their persons, and such property as they possessed, as was not needed for army use. I have already stated that they exchanged their chickens, eggs, milk, butter, &amp;c., with our soldiers for certain of <pb id="p.332" n="332"/> their surplus rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2387"/>By great care and diligence he prevented the small-pox from spreading among our troops early last <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2388"/>He has kindled among the <name>Indians</name> such a strong feeling of friendship for the <rs>Government</rs>, that their women ride <measure n="60miles" type="distance">sixty miles</measure> to inform him of the movements of rebel troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2389"/>And this <rs type="season">spring</rs> and <rs type="season">summer</rs> he has displayed conspicuous bravery at <placeName reg="Webbers Falls, Muskogee, Oklahoma" key="tgn,2084239">Webber's Falls</placeName>, the <rs>Rapid Ford</rs>, and in the engagement with the enemy on the morning of the <dateStruct value="-05-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, when they attacked our train <placeName><distance reg="4miles">four miles</distance> <offset>northwest</offset> of  <placeName reg="Fort Gibson, Muskogee, Oklahoma" key="tgn,7013786">Fort Gibson</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2390"/>His marching here and seizing this post in the face of a large force of the enemy, was a master movement which the military critic would be especially happy to dwell upon, had he been commanding troops in a section where military operations are conducted on a larger scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2391"/>And his holding this place against the forces of <num value="2">two</num> <rs type="role" reg="General">Generals</rs> of the enemy, during the most trying season of the year, would afford thought for further words of commendation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2392"/>If the <rs>Government</rs> intends that promotions shall be earned by meritorious services, his promotion should not now be long delayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2393"/>I doubt whether another officer of his rank can be found in the service who has been entrusted with a command of equal importance, and who has accomplished so much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2394"/>When we hear that the <rs>Generals</rs> around <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, without commands, are almost numerous enough to make a battalion, we feel the injustice of the <rs>Government</rs>, in neglecting to properly reward him for his meritorious services, more keenly than we might otherwise do. <pb id="p.333" n="333"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2395"/>It is a rather pleasant reflection that the troops with which I have acted for <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, less <num value="1">one</num> month, have never met with a single reverse, though we have repeatedly marched up and down the border from the <placeName reg="Missouri River, Kansas, United States" key="tgn,2518319">Missouri River</placeName> to the <placeName key="tgn,7019842" n="1.000 46" reg="arkansas river, united states, north and central america">Arkansas River</placeName>, and had numerous contests with the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2396"/>When we came into this country early in the spring, we did not feel sure that <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0018.00333.00685" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,W.,A.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> would be able to hold it with the force which he then had under him. And when <persName n="Harrison,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0018.00333.00686" reg="mostcommon:Harrison,M.,La Rue,,:2"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Harrison</surname></persName>, without sufficient cause, withdrew his troops from <placeName reg="Fayetteville, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,7014258">Fayetteville</placeName>, and retreated to <placeName reg="Cassville, Barry, Missouri" key="tgn,2058287">Cassville, Missouri</placeName>, we felt sure that the pressure of the enemy would be still greater to force us from this position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2397"/>We have not only held our position, but we have defeated the enemy in every engagement; even where he had the choosing of time and position in several instances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2398"/>In fact, the military operations in this Territory under <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0018.00333.00687" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,W.,A.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, since we came here in the spring, have been as brilliant and successful as our campaign under <persName n="Blunt,General,,,," id="n0009.0018.00333.00688" reg="mostcommon:Blunt,James,G.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Blunt</surname></persName>, in northwestern <placeName reg="Arkansas, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, last fall. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2400"/>I have not, however, drawn on him very often for information. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2401"/>It is likely now that active operations will be commenced against the enemy on the south side of the <rs>Arkansas</rs> shortly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2402"/>We have a sufficient number of <pb id="p.334" n="334"/> troops, and artillery enough to march out and attack them in their camp; and unless they stand firmer than they have done in all the recent contests in this section, we shall rout them completely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2403"/>I have talked with some of the colored soldiers, and they seen anxious to meet the enemy on an open field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2404"/>They said that the other day, at <placeName reg="Big Cabin Creek, Oklahoma" key="tgn,1132422">Cabin Creek</placeName>, they expected to have an opportunity of letting their bayonets drink a little rebel blood, but that the enemy were not inclined to grant them this privilege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2405"/>These colored soldiers say that they have heard that the enemy are furious for the blood of those negroes who have gone into the <quote>Yankee</quote> service, and that they have come down here to give the rebels an opportunity of satiating themselves with their blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2406"/>But they are convinced that there will be as much rebel as negro blood spilt, when the time comes for the enemy to slake his thirst for blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2407"/>With their slave clothes they have thrown off the slave caste of expression They are armed with <num value="1">one</num> of the most recently improved patterns of musket, and they have been drilled until they can handle them, in going through the manual, as gracefully and with as much ease as almost any of our white troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2408"/>Had there not been a prejudice against them going into the field with the white troops, they would probably have been to the front long ere this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2409"/>Though they had not acted with the white troops until they left <placeName reg="Baxter Springs, Cherokee, Kansas" key="tgn,7017585">Baxter Springs</placeName> <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> ago, they have, nevertheless, seen considerable service at different stations along the border.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2410"/>Most of <pb id="p.335" n="335"/> them were brought up in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> and are quite intelligent-far more intelligent than plantation hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2411"/>They are strong built, and in size are fully up to the average of our white soldiers, and in regard to endurance, particularly in a warm climate, I doubt whether our white soldiers, or even those of the enemy, can compete with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2412"/>Indeed it is their capacity for endurance that has contributed in keeping them in slavery so long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2413"/>Perhaps their masters never once thought that this capacity for endurance would be turned to advantage in gaining their freedom, as it is likely to be from now on until the close of the war. There are sections of the south where the climate will be very unfavorable for our northern troops during a summer campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2414"/>But colored troops who are acclimated, can occupy such regions without detriment to their health, and without increasing the percentage of mortality by sickness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2415"/>All this the rebel leaders failed to take into account when they made war on the <rs>Government</rs> and attempted to secede. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2416"/>In view of the prospective active operations soon to be commenced, it would be more agreeable to my feelings to remain with this command a while longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2417"/>As <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0018.00335.00690" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,W.,A.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> has shown his ability to hold all the country north of the <rs>Arkansas</rs>, except as to cavalry raids of the enemy, with his <num value="3">three</num> <name>Indian</name> regiments, and <num value="1">one</num> battery, and <num value="1">one</num> battalion of white troops, we do not doubt but that, with the additional troops now here, he will be able to carry our arms beyond the <placeName reg="Canadian River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7019930">Canadian River</placeName>, and sweep around and capture <pb id="p.336" n="336"/> <placeName key="tgn,7013924" n="1.000 80" reg="fort smith, sebastian, arkansas">Fort Smith</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2418"/>This would be the natural plan of operations, whether it is carried out or not. Whoever may command our troops in this section will hardly be satisfied to remain inactive north of the <rs>Arkansas</rs> during the balance of the <rs type="season">summer</rs> and <rs type="season">autumn</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2419"/>Unless some disposition has been made of the troops in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523"><rs type="direction">southwest</rs> Missouri</placeName>, of which we have not heard, a force almost equal to ours here, we believe might easily be concentrated at <placeName key="tgn,2058287" n="1.000 5" reg="cassville, barry, missouri">Cassville</placeName> in a short time, and marched down the western border counties of <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> to <placeName reg="Van Buren, Crawford, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009699">Van Buren</placeName>, and form a junction with the forces under <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0018.00336.00691" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,W.,A.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> at <placeName key="tgn,7013924" n="1.000 80" reg="fort smith, sebastian, arkansas">Fort Smith</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2420"/>The principal object of the battalion of the <orgName type="regiment" key="6KACav">Sixth Kansas cavalry</orgName> accompanying the train through to <placeName key="tgn,2036378" n="1.000 33" reg="fort scott, bourbon, kansas">Fort Scott</placeName>, is to have the dismounted men furnished with remounts at as early a day as practicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2421"/>A good many men of the <num value="4">four</num> companies of this battalion lost their horses on the <dateStruct value="-05-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, when the enemy made a raid on our herds near this post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2422"/>Others have lost their horses for want of forage, and by being worn out in the service by constant scouting and marching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2423"/>Detachments from this battalion have accompanied nearly all the reconnaissances sent out since we have; been with this division.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2424"/>We have not been able to act in a body, for the reason that we have been called upon to furnish detachments for reconnaissances going in this direction and in that, and for guards at the fords along the <rs>Arkansas</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2425"/>There are no horses in this country suitable for cavalry service; and we are really deficient in that arm of the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2426"/>The <pb id="p.337" n="337"/> <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> here will probably have large quantities of good prairie hay put up this fall at this post, so that there will be no necessity for our animals running down so much in flesh another season, even if the service shall be as arduous as it has been this season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2427"/>When the enemy shall have been driven south towards <placeName reg="Red River, Brown, Texas" key="tgn,2611953">Red River</placeName>, as they doubtless will be before autumn, unless part of our force is ordered to some other field, if the government would send down here, from <placeName key="tgn,2036378" n="1.000 33" reg="fort scott, bourbon, kansas">Fort Scott</placeName>, half a dozen mowing machines and hands to work them, all the hay required for animals at this post could be put up in a month or so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2428"/>With most of our troops south of the <rs>Arkansas</rs>, a very strong guard would not be required to protect the workmen; and government trains could be used to haul the hay in, to be put up in large ricks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2429"/>The corn and oat rations, however, will have to be transported here from the north.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2430"/>The <rs>Indians</rs> raised some wheat this season, but have in cultivation but very little corn; not more than enough for their own consumption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2431"/>The season has been favorable for corn crops, and the yield would have been heavy had a large acreage been planted and given proper attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2432"/>Though the <name>Indians</name> have a fine country, and were considered to be in good circumstances before the war, this wealth consisted mostly of stock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2433"/>lands and <pb id="p.338" n="338"/> money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2434"/>They have never raised a surplus of cereals, and some seasons not sufficient for their own use; for traders among them in <hi rend="italics">ante-bellum</hi> times brought large quantities of salt, as well as cattle, ponies and peltries, into <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> to exchange for corn, flour, etc. Their teams, also, frequently came without being loaded with commodities for exchange, but brought gold to make their purchases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2435"/>Whilst occupying this rich country our troops will be able to get built little out of it to contribute to their support, with the exception of hay and fresh beef.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2436"/>The salt works, however, might be re-opened at Grand <placeName reg="Saline River, Grant, Arkansas" key="tgn,2638211">Saline</placeName>, but the expense of working and protecting the workmen operating them would, perhaps, be more than the cost of transportation on salt from the east.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2437"/>Now in the <name>States</name> the white families, consisting of the old men, women and children, both union and rebel, have generally stuck to their homesteads, when they have not been burned, and endeavored to raise the same kinds of products that were raised on their farms in former times; but, of course, in smaller quantities and numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2438"/>From what I have seen, I believe that the nomadic and pastoral tendencies are almost entirely extinguished in the <rs>English</rs> race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2439"/>Wherever I have seen a family whose faces showed their <name>English</name> blood, I have seen this strong attachment for the homestead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2440"/>If the calamities of war have destroyed their dwellings, they have, in many instances, moved into the smoke-house, or barn with such effects as they were able to preserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2441"/>To those brought up with the usual <pb id="p.339" n="339"/> notions of country life, there are many hallowed associations that generally cling around the homestead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2442"/>Fathers and mothers, for instance, recall the earlier periods of their lives, when they struggled against adversity, and when their children, some of whom may be away in the army, played upon the green sward around them, or climbed the peach, apple and cherry trees to assist in gathering these fruits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2443"/>Or to take <num value="1">one</num> case out of many similar ones, it may be that the parents now getting advanced in years, have lost a child, a bright little fellow, whose memory is still cherished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2444"/>A child buried in a sacred spot upon the homestead or in the little cemetery near by, increases the attachment for the old home where they have passed the greater part of their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2445"/>With us the affections for our departed relatives and friends are not so transitory as among the <name>Indians</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2446"/>They display emotions of grief when a near relative is stricken down by death, the same as we do, but I am told that such grief is generally more evanescent than with us. I believe, therefore, that it is less difficult for an army to occupy a region inhabited by a people whose home attachments are very strong, than a country like this in which the people have less settled habits of life. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2447"/>No <num value="1">one</num> could have easily believed, if he had seen our <name>Indian</name> soldiers a year ago, that they could have been brought under such discipline, as to make them such efficient soldiers as they have recently shown themselves to be under <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0018.00339.00692" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,W.,A.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2505"/>We have broken the enemy's lines from <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName> <pb id="p.348" n="348"/> to <placeName reg="Big Cabin Creek, Oklahoma" key="tgn,1132422">Cabin Creek</placeName> this month, and unless some of our military commanders make a series of great blunders, the destruction of all the rebel armies cannot be delayed longer than a year or so. Those who have predicted that the war for the <rs>Union</rs> would be a failure, should now begin to see their mistake if they do not desire it to be a failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2506"/>There will no doubt be as hard fighting yet as we have already had; for since the enemy holds no strong position in the west, he can use all his forces in the field, and act on the offensive instead of on the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2507"/>He can send flying columns of his troops here and there, and cause a great deal of annoyance to such divisions of our armies as are occupying advanced positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2508"/>And he may also be able to make cavalry raids far into the rear of our armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2509"/>To keep our lines of communication open from the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio River</placeName> to the southern line of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522"><rs type="direction">central</rs> Mississippi</placeName>, is no small task for our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2511"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> of the war the negroes produced most of their supplies, and performed a good deal of the drudgery for their troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2512"/>This season, however, the negroes are not only not raising crops for the enemy and assisting him in various ways, but they are actually fighting their old masters with muskets in their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2513"/>With the exception of portions of the <name>Carolinas</name> <pb id="p.349" n="349"/> and <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, the male negroes have probably already mostly escaped from their masters, and are rapidly enlisting into the <rs>Union</rs> army, and singing songs of deliverance from their cruel bondage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2514"/>The rebel leaders have not probably calculated; the extent they would be weakened by the slaveholders losing their slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2515"/>Indeed, they do not seem to, have set up their men on the military chess-board at all before commencing hostilities, but have plunged blindly into the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2516"/>If they thought that the slaves would not strike for their freedom the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opportunity, they were surely very short-sighted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2517"/>The institution for which the <rs>Southern States</rs> have attempted to secede and keep alive, is now practically dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2518"/>But the death-throes of a monster may deceive those who only look at the surface of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2519"/>Very few people of the <rs>South</rs>, in their sober minds, care but little about independence without the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> is kept alive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2520"/>It is really painful to think that there are so many good people who are incompetent to examine introspectively what a great moral wrong slavery is. It can be accounted for by self-interest and education through generations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2521"/>We are fighting to wipe out this great moral wrong, and the <rs>South</rs> is fighting to perpetuate it. We gradually gain strength the more this question is discussed and talked about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2522"/>The South gradually loses by the same means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2523"/>A moral principle will bear discussion and a thorough examination; but an immoral <num value="1">one</num> will not. Evil doers wish to keep their evil actions in the dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2526"/>Scarcely a day passes that a contest does not take place between the belligerent parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2527"/>On the <dateStruct value="--13"><day reg="13">13th instant</day></dateStruct> a man was killed near <placeName reg="Granby, Newton, Missouri" key="tgn,2058926">Granby</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2528"/>It was at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> supposed that he was murdered by some of the <rs>Missouri</rs> militia stationed at <placeName key="tgn,2059878" n="1.000 22" reg="newtonia, newton, missouri">Newtonia</placeName> or <placeName reg="Neosho, Newton, Missouri" key="tgn,2059847">Neosho</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2529"/>He had been out harvesting, and shortly after returning home in the evening, <num value="2">two</num> men, supposed to have been bushwhackers, rode up, and claiming to belong to the <orgName type="regiment" key="7MOMilitia">Seventh Missouri militia</orgName>, called him out, shot him down, and then quickly left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2530"/>This is a fair sample of the manner in which the war is carried on in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2531"/>It sometimes leads to bloody retaliation, for we occasionally hear of a rebel civilian who has been mysteriously murdered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2532"/>All acts of private war should be discountenanced as much as possible, for if it were extensively carried on in those States where the people are nearly equally divided in their sentiments for and against the <rs>Union</rs>, the bitterness, hatred and feelings of revenge which it now engenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2533"/>would continue between families of different <pb id="p.351" n="351"/> neighborhoods, long after peace shall have been concluded between the <rs>Government</rs> and the rebellious sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2534"/>Where men have entered either army, and are willing that the cause which they have espoused shall be submitted to the arbitrament of battle, they have no personal feelings against individuals, or private grudges against their neighbors calling for revenge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2535"/>No high-minded soldier ever wounds the feelings of prisoners whom he has helped to capture in battle, by applying to them reproachful epithets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2536"/>But if we take <num value="2">two</num> neighbors, <num value="1">one</num> of whom enters the <rs>Union</rs> army and remains away from his home during the war, and the other a rebel, who stays around his home during the war and depredates upon the property of his Union neighbor, and they both return to their respective homes after the war, we cannot reasonably expect that very friendly relations will ever exist between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2537"/>The rebels have too often acted as if they expected to have everything their own way in the future; as if the <rs>Union</rs> people had no rights which they were bound to respect, and as if their property would be confiscated in a few years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2538"/>Now that the downfall of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> cannot be delayed to a very distant day, unless almost a miracle should intervene in its behalf, those rebels who were counting upon the confiscation of the property of Union prisoners with so much self-satisfaction, are perhaps beginning to regret their hasty actions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2539"/>They perhaps also regret that they have frequently been so forward in pointing out the property of Union citizens for seizure by the rebel armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2627"/>A small detachment of our soldiers who have just; come up from <placeName reg="Carthage, Jasper, Missouri" key="tgn,2058276">Carthage</placeName>, <measure n="60miles" type="distance">sixty miles</measure> southeast of this place, state that rebel bands are collecting in considerable force in <placeName reg="Jasper, Missouri, United States" key="tgn,2001209">Jasper County</placeName>, under <persName n="Craven,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0020.00363.00798" reg="mostcommon:Craven,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Craven</surname></persName>, who formerly lived in that section; and that there is; a fair prospect of a fight between them and the militia in a few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2628"/>They have recently burned the court house, and a fine brick academy at <placeName reg="Carthage, Jasper, Missouri" key="tgn,2058276">Carthage</placeName>, to keep our troops from using them as a means of defense, <pb id="p.364" n="364"/> as they used the brick building at <placeName reg="Stockton, Cedar, Missouri" key="tgn,2060603">Stockton</placeName> not long since, when the rebel Chieftain <persName n="Livingston,,,,," id="n0009.0020.00364.00799" reg="nearbymention:Livingston,Tom,,,"><surname>Livingston</surname></persName> was killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2629"/>The guerillas of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> know that court houses and strong buildings can be of very little benefit to them in the way of defenses, and that our troops are always delighted to get them in such places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2630"/>They would not likely make much of an effort to dislodge them with small arms, but would probably try to hold them, until a section of a battery could be brought from the nearest post to play upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2631"/>A few shells thrown into a building, should they take refuge in <num value="1">one</num>, would soon start them out. From what I have seen on several occasions, I think they would prefer to run the gauntlet of small arms, than to have shells bursting around their heads in a court house hall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2632"/>But burning such buildings in the towns, as would answer the purpose of quartering a company ,of troops, may be of some advantage to the enemy, while he is determined to keep up a guerilla warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2633"/>In the burning of county property, which has been done in a good many instances, the enemy have not often destroyed county records, for most of such records were carried away or concealed by the rebels --when <persName n="Price,General,,,," id="n0009.0020.00364.00800" reg="mostcommon:Price,Sterling,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Price</surname></persName>'s forces were driven out of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1862-02-"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2634"/>As a general thing, perhaps, both parties feel an interest in preventing the destruction of county records.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2635"/>Unless the county records can be restored after the war, a good deal of confusion is likely to arise in regard to the titles to property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2638"/>The enemy are getting quite bold in this vicinity of late.

If our troops become a little inactive along the border, the enemy soon finds it out and commences committing depredations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2641"/>The <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> at the post should have a sufficient cavalry force at his disposal to send out <num value="2">two</num> detachments every day, to the east, the southeast and the northeast of this place, say <num value="25">twenty-five</num> or <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure>. But even such a measure would not absolutely stop their depredations and raids into <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, for they generally stop during the day at some isolated and lonely spot where our troops are not likely to find them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2642"/>If they return to their retreats by separate paths and byways, they need not make a trail that could be easily followed by our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2643"/>Rebel families from <placeName reg="Vernon, Missouri, United States" key="tgn,2001253">Vernon county, Missouri</placeName>, come in here every day to trade with our merchants, and, no doubt, easily get such information in regard to our <pb id="p.366" n="366"/> movements as to keep the enemy well advised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2644"/>I made some inquiries for my own satisfaction in relation to this matter, and I found that almost every day there are women of questionable loyalty, coming in here from <placeName key="tgn,2001253" n="1.000 5" reg="vernon, missouri, united states">Vernon</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2001171" n="1.000 1" reg="barton county, missouri">Barton counties</placeName>, <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> sometimes, too, from a distance of <num value="25">twenty-five</num> or <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure>. They generally claimed to have passes, and I presume they did, having got some <num value="1">one</num> to vouch for them, so that they come and go undisturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2645"/>They may purchase not only articles for domestic use, but also ammunition for the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2646"/>My own idea is that we should be more vigilant in such things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2647"/>Loyal men, no doubt, often thoughtlessly vouch for parties whom they should not. It would not be pleasant to know that we have been furnishing the enemy with the means for our own destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2648"/>Yet there is reason to believe that we have sometimes done it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2649"/>A detachment of cavalry just up from <placeName reg="Fort Gibson, Muskogee, Oklahoma" key="tgn,7013786">Fort Gibson</placeName>, report that the cholera has broken out among the troops at that post, and that quite a number have already died from that dreadful disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2651"/>It can hardly be what is known as the <name>Asiatic</name> cholera, for that type of cholera generally appears in the east and travels westward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2652"/>When we were on short rations at <placeName reg="Fort Gibson, Muskogee, Oklahoma" key="tgn,7013786">Fort Gibson</placeName> last month, I suggested that there was some danger of constitutional disturbances following our radical change of food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2653"/>Of course, I had not the slightest idea what form the constitutional disturbance would likely take.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2654"/>By inquiry I ascertained that the men <pb id="p.367" n="367"/> did not relish their food; and I felt sure, too, that it was not making good healthy blood, without which no <num value="1">one</num> can display prolonged activity, nor long retain good health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2655"/>From the <dateStruct value="-06-22"><day reg="22">22d</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> to the <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, nearly all the white men belonging to the garrison force at <placeName reg="Fort Gibson, Muskogee, Oklahoma" key="tgn,7013786">Fort Gibson</placeName>, lost from <num value="1">one</num> to several pounds of flesh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2656"/>Nor is this all. At the end of our fast, nearly everyone had sustained a loss of energy and buoyancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2657"/>Even after we commenced to issue full rations, the loss of power was not immediately restored to the men. It may be that the digestive and assimilative organs became enfeebled with the rest of the system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2658"/>This, however, is a question which the medical profession should be most competent to decide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2659"/>After the system becomes deteriorated by poor food, it must, of necessity, take some time to build up good healthy tissues, even when nutritious food has been supplied to the stomach and alimentary system. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2660"/>The small-pox, also, when we recently left <placeName reg="Fort Gibson, Muskogee, Oklahoma" key="tgn,7013786">Fort Gibson</placeName>, was still afflicting our troops there-particularly the <name>Indians</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2661"/>Since I referred to this disease last <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, we have lost a good many <name>Indian</name> soldiers by it. But the greatest mortality caused by it has been among refugee <name>Indian</name> families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2662"/>Though my bump of curiosity has taken me around to notice everything I could think of, it never took me to the small-pox hospital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2663"/>Considering the heterogeneous mass of humanity we had together last winter, we are, perhaps, fortunate that we were no worse afflicted during the <rs type="season">spring</rs> and <rs type="season">summer</rs>, and no doubt <pb id="p.368" n="368"/> would have been, were it not for the vigilant eye of <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0020.00368.00804" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,W.,A.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2665"/>It seems that the soldier was drunk and making some demonstration which led Tough to believe that he was endeavoring to draw his pistol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2666"/>From what I can find out about the matter, however, I think it would have been much more creditable to <persName n="Tough,Captain,,,," id="n0009.0020.00368.00806" reg="nearbymention:Tough,W.,S.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Tough</surname></persName> to have turned his pistol against the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2667"/>Why a Captain of civilian scouts should be <measure n="150miles" type="distance">one hundred and fifty miles</measure> from the front is unaccountable to me anyway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2668"/>Nor have I heard of him being with us any time during the <rs type="season">spring</rs> or <rs type="season">summer</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2669"/>We have noticed more drunkenness among the soldiers since we came here <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> ago, than during the <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> in <orgName n="division"><persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0020.00368.00807" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,W.,A.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>' division</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2673"/>The evils likely to arise from the use of intoxicating liquors, should be pointed out in the moral teaching of the head of every family as clearly and forcibly as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2674"/>But there will be legislative tinkering on the subject of prohibition for generations yet. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2675"/>The enforcing of the draft is beginning to cause a good deal of excitement in the eastern cities, and has <pb id="p.369" n="369"/> already resulted in a great rot in <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York city</orgName>, where hundreds of men have been either killed, beaten or bruised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2676"/>To my mind, men who will risk their lives in resisting the draft rather than enlist in the service of the <rs>Government</rs> at this time, cannot be counted on much for their loyalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2677"/>That there should be so many traitors to the <rs>Government</rs> in the <rs>North</rs>, is really surprising.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2678"/>Every leader who advises resisting the draft, should be either hung or banished beyond our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2679"/>The Government must either act firmly or surrender to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2680"/>It cannot afford to trifle with the foe at home any more than at the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2681"/>Everybody now is either friend or foe of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2682"/>There is no half-way ground; and anyone pretending to be neutral is endeavoring to hide his disloyalty behind that term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2683"/>It would be much more honorable for them to come out and avow their disloyalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2684"/>These very men, too, who wish to be neutral, if they are assaulted or robbed, are as quick to appeal to the <rs>Government</rs> for protection or relief, as the staunchest supporter of the <rs>Union</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2685"/>But if they are really neutral what right have they to ask the <rs>Government</rs> for protection of life or property In the first place, the <rs>Government</rs> cannot recognize the right of any <num value="1">one</num> to remain neutral in a life or death struggle like the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2686"/>Those who believe that the <rs>Government</rs> is worth preserving, should willingly risk their lines in its defense; that is, if they are not too cowardly to shoulder the musket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2687"/>It would doubtless be safe to predict that many of those now <pb id="p.370" n="370"/> claiming to be neutral, and who have had, or may yet have supplies taken from them by our army, will ask the <rs>Government</rs> to pay for such supplies after the war. As there is not the remotest probability of the <rs>Government</rs> paying the enemy for supplies taken from them I don't see how it can pay the neutrals for supplies taken from them, since by their own choosing they have not classed themselves among its friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2688"/>These riotous demonstrations in the <rs>North</rs>, I have no doubt, give great encouragement to the enemy, and will have a tendency to prolong the war. Since the recent great victories of our armies from the <rs>East</rs> to the far <rs>West</rs>, the enemy, like a drowning man, are willing to catch at a straw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2689"/>Though the rioters may greatly assist the enemy by keeping many of our troops at home who should be at the front, yet the riots will prove a weak straw for the enemy to cling to. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2824"/>The ruffians, when they approached the city, threw a guard around it to prevent any of the men from escaping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2825"/>They then marched into the principal part of the city and commenced their work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2826"/>Everything in the way of money and jewelry was taken, the houses set on fire, and the men shot down in the presence of their families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2827"/>Many instances are reported, in which men were shot down while their wives, daughters and mothers were clinging to them, and begging that they might be spared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2828"/>But the entreaties of the women, that the lives of those so dear to them might be spared, had no effect on the hardened hearts of the monsters in human form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2829"/>If there were no women to remove the lifeless bodies of the men, they were left to be consumed by the devouring flames.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2830"/>The loss of life by this worse than fiendish act, cannot be accurately known until the ruins of the desolated city have been carefully examined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2833"/>All the best portion of it has been burned, and hundreds of families have not only lost all their male members but their houses and effects also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2834"/>For cruelty and heartlessness, I doubt whether this outrage has a parallel in modern warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2835"/>And were it not already committed, it would be difficult to believe that <num value="300">three hundred</num> fiends could be got together in this country for the purpose of committing it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3207"/>There is a larger number of refugee families in this vicinity than I had supposed; and in many cases their condition is distressing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3208"/>Many of them are living in rude tents made <pb id="p.435" n="435"/> of bed clothing, or material of a very unsubstantial nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3209"/>Others during the latter part of summer and early autumn, purchased condemned army tents, and are making the best of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3210"/>But there are not many supplied with tents, as there have been no large sales of this kind of condemned public property at this post during the autumn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3211"/>Last winter <num value="1">1</num> thought that I saw a good deal of suffering among the refugees around <persName n="Phillips,Colonel,,,," id="n0009.0024.00435.01114" reg="mostcommon:Phillips,William,A.,,:7"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>' camp, but it did not equal the suffering in our midst at the present time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3212"/>Insufficient fuel for heating purposes, and scanty clothing and covering are the principal causes of suffering among these people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3213"/>We were encamped last winter in a wooded region, and the refugees could build great log fires to keep themselves warm during intensely cold weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3214"/>I have frequently seen them standing around their blazing fires, with wood generously piled on, on cold nights, with expressions of real happiness playing over their countenances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3215"/>And I also saw rollicking children in some of those groups, who seemed wholly unconscious of the hardships to which they were exposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3216"/>But here the camp of the refugee is not protected from the chilling effects of the bleak northwest winds by heavy forests and bluffs, as it was in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254"><rs type="direction">northwestern</rs> Kansas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3217"/>Nor can the refugees here make great wood fires, like the fires farmers make in heavily wooded sections where they clear tracts of land for cultivation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3218"/>All the families that I have visited recently, burn coal in <rs n="cooking stoves" type="product">cooking stoves</rs>, even for heating purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3219"/>And as most of the stoves I saw <pb id="p.436" n="436"/> seem adapted to burning wood instead of coal, these people have much trouble in getting their coal to burn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3220"/>At any rate they get only a small quantity of the heat from it which it is capable of producing if burned to the best advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3221"/>Even those who have stoves in which it burns freely, do not use it generously on account of their straightened circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3222"/>It is a very cheerless sight, <num value="1">one</num> that I shall not soon forget, to see a mother and half a dozen children shivering around a stove in which the fuel half refuses to burn, or is used in stinted quantities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3223"/>The hardships and privations of our soldiers in the field are often very great, but the hardships and suffering of many of their families are also entitled to consideration, and should not be passed over lightly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3224"/>It will be surprising to me if there is not a great mortality during the winter among these people, who have recently exchanged plain comfortable homes for the cheerless tent, in a region where howling winds and chilly blasts increase their despondency. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3280"/>It is whispered that there is some crookedness in regard to the manner in which certain speculators came into possession of this cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3281"/>Speculators following the army and purchasing cotton of pretended loyal owners, or disloyal owners, may find their titles contested by Government agents, who are commissioned to look after such matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3282"/>Sharks following the army, like sharks following a ship, should be watched, and not permitted to appropriate our valuable trophies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3283"/>And in the present case, there should perhaps be an investigation to determine whether or not this cotton has been purchased in a legal manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3284"/>It would be more just that its proceeds should be distributed to the soldiers, who captured it, as prize money, than that it should go into the pockets of sharpers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3285"/>If rebel planters have left their plantations, and their cotton has fallen into our hands as contraband property, the <rs>Government</rs> should get the market price for it, and speculators not allowed to pick it up for merely nominal sums, as they are reported in some cases to have been doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3286"/>As our armies are now getting into the cotton-raising regions, the revenues of the <rs>Government</rs> during the year, from the sales of contraband cotton, should, if carefully, intelligently and honestly looked after, amount to several <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3287"/>It would be easy enough for our <pb id="p.445" n="445"/> supply trains, that come up empty every month, to bring up contraband cotton, for shipment to <placeName reg="Leavenworth, Leavenworth, Kansas" key="tgn,2036674">Leavenworth</placeName> and <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">Saint Louis</placeName>, where there would be a market for it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3289"/>The peaceful condition of things which has existed for several weeks past along the border has been slightly disturbed by the appearance of guerrilla bands in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523"><rs type="direction">Southwest</rs> Missouri</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="--3"><day reg="3">3d instant</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3291"/>At the different posts in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, the horses of the <rs>State</rs> troops are generally in good condition, as they are rarely or never short of forage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3292"/>I mentioned last spring, from my own observations, how the people manage to raise the necessaries of life, even in localities where the men are all absent, in either the <rs>Union</rs> or rebel army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3293"/>The people have clung to their homes with wonderful tenacity, and when the army has burned a portion of the rails around their farms, they have generally taken those left to inclose smaller tracts of their lands for cultivation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3294"/>And while the acreage of nearly every <pb id="p.446" n="446"/> family has thus been contracted, the means of cultivation have also been contracted in about the same ratio.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3295"/>Instead of each family having from <num value="1">one</num> to a dozen fine horses and mules to put into their fields, as in <hi rend="italics">antebellum</hi> times, it is a rare occurrence now to find a family with more than <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> horses or mules, which are generally either old or blind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3296"/>Families sometimes try to keep their horses concealed in the woods, but this is not very successful as a general thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3297"/>The great temptation to keep good, vigorous animals, it has been suggested, has in a number of instances, led to the putting out of the eyes of desirable horses or mules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3298"/>It is a cruel charge to insinuate were there no extenuating circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3299"/>But a mother with half a dozen children around her, and her husband away in either the <rs>Union</rs> or Rebel army, might, rather than take the chances of being reduced to the extremity of seeing them suffer, permit a young son, overflowing with a desire to do something heroic, to destroy the sight of <quote><persName><foreName>Charley</foreName></persName>,</quote> the good, reliable <rs n="family horse" type="product">family horse</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3300"/>Besides being needed to cultivate and gather the crop, a horse is quite indispensable to take the grain, wheat or corn, to the mill, and to fetch back the flour or meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3301"/>In view of what I have seen of the straits to which families in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> and <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> are reduced to get along, I cannot find it in my heart to condemn an act like the above, which, in peaceful times, would justly be regarded as cruel and barbarous. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3303"/>At this distance, it is hardly safe to form a very pronounced opinion as to the wisdom of the <rs>Government</rs> in adopting such a course, unless the rebel authorities are unwilling to exchange on equal terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3304"/>It is surely cause for deep regret and even indignation, to constantly hear of the great sufferings of our soldiers in rebel prisons, while rebel soldiers in our prisons are provided with full rations and all the comforts that our soldiers in the field have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3305"/>It is also announced that the rebel Government refuses to exchange colored soldiers held as prisoners of war for rebel prisoners that we hold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3306"/>It is, perhaps, an unlooked &mdash; for humiliation, that it has come to pass that the life of a rebel soldier is worth no more than the life of a plantation negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3307"/>But if they regard a rebel soldier that we hold as worth more to their cause than the colored prisoner they have captured from us, they should, to be consistent, be extremely anxious to exchange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3308"/>They would not hesitate to exchange an old and inferior musket for <num value="1">one</num> of our best new patterns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3309"/>If they can afford to weaken their own cause by pride, we surely need not regret it. They are too blind to see that they are fluttering around the lamp of their own destruction. </p>
