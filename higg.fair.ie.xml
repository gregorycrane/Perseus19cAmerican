<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>In our methodical American life, we still recognize some magic in summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Most persons at least resign themselves to being decently happy in <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>They accept <dateStruct><month>June</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>They compliment its weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>They complain of the earlier months as cold, and so spend them in the city; and they complain of the later months as hot, and so refrigerate themselves on some barren sea-coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> offers us yearly a necklace of <num value="12">twelve</num> pearls; most men choose the fairest, label it <dateStruct><month>June</month></dateStruct>, and cast the rest away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>It is time to chant a hymn of more liberal gratitude.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>There are no days in the whole round year more delicious than those which often come to us in the latter half of <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>On these days <num value="1">one</num> goes forth in the morning, and finds an Italian warmth brooding over all the hills, taking visible shape in a glistening mist of silvered azure, with which mingles the smoke from many bonfires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The sun trembles in his own soft rays, till <num value="1">one</num> understands the old <name>English</name> tradition, that he dances on <persName n="Easter,,,,," id="n0225.0001.00001.00001" reg="mostcommon:Easter,nomatch:0"><surname>Easter</surname></persName>-Day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Swimming in a sea of glory, the tops of the hills look nearer than their bases, and their glistening watercourses seem close to the eye, as is their liberated murmur to the car. All across this broad intervale the teams are ploughing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The grass in the meadow seems all to have grown green since yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The blackbirds jangle in the oak, the robin is perched upon the elm, the song-sparrow on the hazel, and the bluebird on the apple-tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>There rises a hawk and sails slowly, the stateliest of airy things, a floating dream of long and languid summer-hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>But, as yet, though there is warmth enough for a sense of luxury, there is coolness enough for exertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>No tropics can offer such a burst of joy; indeed, no zone much warmer than our Northern States can offer a genuine spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>There can be none where there <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> is no winter, and the monotone of the seasons is broken only by wearisome rains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Vegetation and birds being distributed over the year, there is no burst of verdure nor of song.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>But with us, as the buds are swelling, the birds are arriving; they are building their nests almost simultaneously; and in all the <rs>Southern</rs> year there is no such rapture of beauty and of melody as here marks every morning from the last of <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> onward.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>But days even earlier than these, in <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, have a charm,&mdash;even days that seem raw and rainy, when the sky is dull and a bequest of <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>-wind lingers, chasing the squirrel from the tree and the children from the meadows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>There is a fascination in walking through these bare early woods,&mdash;there is such a pause of preparation, winter's work is so cleanly and thoroughly done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Everything is taken down and put away; throughout the leafy arcades the branches show no remnant of last year, save a few twisted leaves of oak and beech, a few empty seed-vessels of the tardy witchhazel, and a few gnawed nutshells dropped coquettishly by the squirrels into the crevices of the bark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>All else is bare, but prophetic: buds everywhere, the whole splendor of the coming summer concentrated in those hard little knobs on every bough; and clinging here and there among them a brown, papery chrysalis, from which shall yet wave the superb wings of the <rs>Luna</rs> moth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>An occasional shower patters on the dry leaves, but it does not silence the robin on the outskirts of the wood: indeed, he sings louder than ever during rain, though the song-sparrow and the bluebird are silent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Then comes the sweetness of the nights in latter <dateStruct><month>April</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>There is as yet no evening-primrose to open suddenly, no cistus to drop its petals; but the <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>-flower knows the hour, and becomes more fragrant in the darkness, so that <num value="1">one</num> can then often find it in the woods without aid from the eye. The pleasant night-sounds are begun; the hylas are uttering their shrill <hi rend="italics">peep</hi> from the meadows, mingled soon with hoarser toads, who take to the water at this season to deposit their spawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The tree-toads soon join them; but <num value="1">one</num> listens in vain for bull-frogs, or katydids, or grasshoppers, or whippoorwills, or crickets: we must wait for most of these until the nights of <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The earliest familiar token of the coming season is the expansion of the stiff catkins of the alder into soft, drooping tresses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>These are so sensitive, that, if you pluck them at almost any time during the winter, a few days' sunshine will make them open in a vase of water, and thus they eagerly yield to every moment of <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> warmth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The blossom of the birch is more delicate, that of the willow more showy, but the alders come <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>They cluster and dance everywhere upon the bare boughs above the watercourses; the blackness of the buds is softened into rich brown and yellow; and as this graceful creature thus comes waving into the spring, it is pleasant to remember that the <rs>Norse Eddas</rs> fabled the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> woman to have been named Embla, because she was created from an alder-bough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/><pb id="p.9" n="9"/></p> 
<p>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> wild-flower of the spring is like land after sea. The <num value="2">two</num> which, throughout the <placeName reg="Atlantic Ocean" key="tgn,7014206"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Atlantic</placeName> States, divide this interest are the <hi rend="italics">Epigoea repens</hi> (May-flower, ground-laurel, or trailing-arbutus) and the <hi rend="italics">Hepatica triloba</hi> (liverleaf, liverwort, or blue anemone). Of these <num value="2">two</num>, the latter is perhaps more immediately exciting on <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> discovery, because it is an annual, not a perennial, and so does not, like the epigaea, exhibit its buds all winter, but opens its blue eyes almost as soon as it emerges from the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Without the rich and delicious odor of its compeer, it has an inexpressibly fresh and earthy scent, that seems to bring all the promise of the blessed season with it; indeed, that clod of fresh turf with the inhalation of which <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Bacon</foreName></persName> delighted to begin the day must undoubtedly have been full of the roots of our little hepatica.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Its healthy sweetness belongs to the opening year, like <persName n="Chaucer,,,,," id="n0225.0001.00009.00002" reg="mostcommon:Chaucer,nomatch:0"><surname>Chaucer</surname></persName>'s poetry; and <num value="1">one</num> thinks that anything more potent and voluptuous would be less enchanting&mdash;until <num value="1">one</num> turns to the <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>-flower.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Then comes a richer fascination for the senses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>To pick the <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>-flower is like following in the footsteps of some spendthrift army which has scattered the contents of its treasure-chest among beds of scented moss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The fingers sink in the soft, moist verdure, and make at each instant some superb discovery unawares; again and again, straying carelessly, they clutch some new treasure; and, indeed, the plants are linked together in bright necklaces by secret threads beneath the surface, and where you grasp at <num value="1">one</num>, you hold many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The hands go wandering over the moss as over the keys of a piano, and bring forth odors for melodies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The lovely creatures twine and nestle and lay their glowing faces to the very earth beneath withered leaves, and what seemed mere barrenness becomes fresh and fragrant beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>So great is the charm of the pursuit, that the epigaea is really the wild-flower for which our country-people have a hearty passion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Every village child knows its best haunts, and watches for it eagerly in the spring; boys wreathe their hats with it, girls twine it in their hair, and the cottage-windows are filled with its beauty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>In collecting these early flowers, <num value="1">one</num> finds or fancies singular natural affinities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>I flatter myself with being able always to discover hepatica, if there is any within reach, for I was brought up with it (<q direct="unspecified">Cockatoo he know me very well</q>); but other persons, who were brought up with May-flower, and remember searching for it with their childish fingers, can find that better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The most remarkable instance of these natural affinities was in the case of L. T. and his double anemones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>L. had always a gift for wild-flowers, and used often to bring to <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> the largest white anemones that were ever seen, from a certain special hill in <placeName reg="Watertown, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014591">Watertown</placeName>; they were not only magnificent in size and whiteness, but had that exquisite blue on the outside of the petals, as if the sky had bent down in ecstasy at last over its darlings, and left visible kisses there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>But even this success was not enough, and <num value="1">one</num> day he came with something yet choicer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>It <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> was a rue-leaved anemone (<hi rend="italics">A. thalictroides</hi>); and each <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="3">three</num> white flowers was double, not merely with that multiplicity of petals in the disk which is common with this species, but technically and horticulturally double, like the double-flowering almond or cherry,&mdash;with the most exquisitely delicate little petals, like fairy lace-work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>He had <num value="3">three</num> specimens, and gave <num value="1">one</num> to <persName n="Gray,Professor,Asa,,," id="n0225.0001.00010.00003" reg="default:Gray,Asa,,,"><roleName n="Professor">Prof.</roleName> <foreName>Asa</foreName> <surname>Gray</surname></persName>, of <orgName type="college" n="Harvard college">Harvard</orgName>, who said it was almost or quite unexampled, and another to me. As the man in the fable says of the chameleon,&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">I have it yet and can produce it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/></p> 
<p>Now comes the marvel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The next winter L. went to New York for a year, and wrote to me, as spring drew near, with solemn charge to visit his favorite haunt and find another specimen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Armed with this letter of introduction, I sought the spot, and tramped through and through its leafy corridors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Beautiful wood-anemones I found, to be sure, trembling on their fragile stems, deserving all their pretty names,&mdash;Wind-flower, Easter-flower, Pasque-flower, and homoeopathic Pulsatilla;&mdash;rue-leaved anemones I found also, rising taller and straighter and firmer in stem, with the whorl of leaves a little higher up on the stalk than <num value="1">one</num> fancies it ought to be, as if there were a supposed danger that the flowers would lose their balance, and as if the leaves must be all ready to catch them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>These I found, but the special wonder was not there for me. Then I wrote to him that he must evidently come himself and search; or that, perhaps, as <persName n="Browne,Sir,Thomas,,," id="n0225.0001.00010.00004" reg="default:Browne,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Browne</surname></persName> avers that <q direct="unspecified">smoke doth follow the fairest,</q> so his little treasures had followed him towards New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/><rs type="role" reg="Judge">Judge</rs> of my surprise, when, on opening his next letter, out dropped, from those folds of metropolitan paper, a veritable double anemone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>He had just been out to <placeName reg="Hoboken, Hudson, New Jersey" key="tgn,7013711">Hoboken</placeName>, or some such place, to spend an afternoon, and, of course, his pets were there to meet him; and from that day to this I have never heard of such an event as happening to any <num value="1">one</num> else.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/><dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct>-Day is never allowed to pass in this community without profuse lamentations over the tardiness of our spring as compared with that of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and the poets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Yet it is easy to exaggerate this difference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Even so good an observer as <persName n="Flagg,,Wilson,,," id="n0225.0001.00010.00005" reg="default:Flagg,Wilson,,,"><foreName>Wilson</foreName> <surname>Flagg</surname></persName> is betrayed into saying that the epigaea and hepatica <q direct="unspecified">seldom make their appearance until after the middle of <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct></q> in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, and that <q direct="unspecified">it is not unusual for the whole month of <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> to pass away without producing more than <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> species of wild-flowers.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>But I have formerly found the hepatica in bloom at <placeName reg="Mount Auburn, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2140130">Mount Auburn</placeName>, for <num value="3">three</num> successive years, on the <dateStruct value="-03-27"><day reg="27">twenty-seventh</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>; and it has since been found in <placeName reg="Worcester, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014647">Worcester</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="--17"><day reg="2">seventeenth</day></dateStruct>, and in <placeName key="tgn,2049648" n="1.000 32" reg="danvers, essex county, massachusetts">Danvers</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="--12"><day reg="2">twelfth</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>-flower is usually as early, though the more gradual expansion of the buds renders it less easy to give dates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>And there are nearly <num value="20">twenty</num> species which I have noted, for <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> together, as found always before <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>-Day, and therefore properly to be assigned to <dateStruct><month>April</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The list includes bloodroot, cowslip, houstonia, saxifrage, dandelion, chickweed, cinquefoil, strawberry, mouse-ear, bellwort, dog's-tooth violet, <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> <num value="5">five</num> species of violet proper, and <num value="2">two</num> of anemone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>These are all common flowers, and easily observed; but the catalogue might be increased by rare ones, as the white corydalis, the smaller yellow violet (<hi rend="italics">V. rotundifolia</hi>), and the claytonia or spring-beauty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>But in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> the crocus and the snowdrop-neither being probably an indigenous flower, since neither is mentioned by <persName n="Chaucer,,,,," id="n0225.0001.00011.00006" reg="mostcommon:Chaucer,nomatch:0"><surname>Chaucer</surname></persName>&mdash;usually open before the <dateStruct value="-03-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>; indeed, the snowdrop was formerly known by the yet more fanciful name of <q direct="unspecified">Fair Maid of <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/><persName n="Chaucer,,,,," id="n0225.0001.00011.00007" reg="mostcommon:Chaucer,nomatch:0"><surname>Chaucer</surname></persName>'s daisy comes equally early; and <dateStruct><month>March</month></dateStruct> brings daffodils, narcissi, violets, daisies, jonquils, hyacinths, and marsh-marigolds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>This is altogether in advance of our season, so far as the wild-flowers give evidence,&mdash;though snowdrops are sometimes found in <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> even here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>But, on the other hand, it would appear that, though a larger number of birds winter in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> than in <placeName key="tgn,7007517" n="1.000 10" reg="massachusetts">Massachusetts</placeName>, yet the return of those which migrate is actually earlier among us. From journals which were kept during <measure n="60years" type="date">sixty years</measure> in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and an abstract of which is printed in Hone's <q direct="unspecified">Every-<orgName n="Day Book" type="newspaper">Day Book</orgName>,</q> it appears that only <num value="2">two</num> birds of passage revisit <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> before the <dateStruct value="-04-15"><day reg="15">fifteenth</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, and only <num value="13">thirteen</num> more before the <dateStruct value="-05-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>; while with us the song-sparrow, the bluebird, and the red-winged blackbird appear about the <dateStruct value="-03-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, and a good many more by the middle of <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>This is a peculiarity of the <rs>English</rs> spring which I have never seen explained or even mentioned.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>After the epigaea and the hepatica have blossomed, there is a slight pause among the wild-flowers,&mdash;these <num value="2">two</num> forming a distinct prologue for their annual drama, as the brilliant witch-hazel in <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct> brings up its separate epilogue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The truth is, Nature attitudinizes a little, liking to make a neat finish with everything, and then to begin again with <hi rend="italics">&eacute;clat</hi>. Flowers seem spontaneous things enough, but there is evidently a secret marshalling among them, that all may be brought out with due effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>As the country-people say that so long as any snow is left on the ground more snow may be expected, for it must all vanish together at last,&mdash;so every seeker of spring-flowers has observed how accurately they seem to move in platoons, with little straggling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Each species seems to burst upon us with a united impulse; you may search for it day after day in vain, but the day when you find <num value="1">one</num> specimen the spell is broken and you find <num value="20">twenty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>By the end of <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> a??? the margins of the great poem of the woods are illuminated with these exquisite vignettes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Most of the early flowers either come before the full unfolding of their leaves, or else have inconspicuous ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Yet Nature always provides for her bouquets the due proportion of green.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>The verdant and graceful sprays of the wild raspberry are unfolded very early, long before its time of flowering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Over the meadows spread the regular Chinesepagodas <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> of the equisetum (horsetail or scouring-rush), and the rich, coarse vegetation of the veratrum, or <orgName type="university" n="American university">American</orgName> hellebore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>In moist copses the ferns and osmundas begin to uncurl in <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, opening their soft coils of spongy verdure, coated with woolly down, from which the humming-bird steals the lining of her nest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The early blossoms represent the aboriginal epoch of our history: the bloodroot and the <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>-flower are older than the white man, older perchance than the red man; they alone are the true Native <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0225.0001.00012.00008" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Of the later wild plants, many of the most common are foreign importations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>In our sycophancy we attach grandeur to the name <q direct="unspecified">exotic;</q> we call aristocratic garden-flowers by that epithet; yet they are no more exotic than the humbler companions they brought with them, which have become naturalized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The dandelion, the buttercup, chickweed, celandine, mullein, burdock, yarrow, whiteweed, nightshade, and most of the thistles,&mdash;these are importations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Miles Standish never crushed them with his heavy heel as he strode forth to give battle to the savages; they never kissed the daintier foot of <persName n="Priscilla,,,,," id="n0225.0001.00012.00009" reg="mostcommon:Priscilla,nomatch:0"><surname>Priscilla</surname></persName>, the <rs>Puritan</rs> maiden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>It is noticeable that these are all of rather coarser texture than our indigenous flowers; the children instinctively recognize this, and are apt to omit them when gathering the more delicate native blossoms of the woods.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>There is something touching in the gradual retirement before civilization of these fragile aborigines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>They do not wait for the actual brute contact of red bricks and curbstones, but they feel the danger miles away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>And for literary training, especially, the influence of natural beauty is simply priceless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>On this flowery bank, on this ripple-marked shore, are the true literary models.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>How many living authors have ever attained to writing a single page which could be for <num value="1">one</num> moment compared, for the simplicity and grace of its structure, with this green spray of wild woodbine or yonder white wreath of blossoming clematis?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>A finely organized sentence should throb and palpitate like the most delicate vibrations of the summer air. We talk of literature as if it were a mere matter of rule and measurement, a series of processes long since brought to mechanical perfection: but it would be less incorrect to say that it all lies in the future; tried by the out-door standard, there is as yet no literature, but only glimpses and guideboards; no writer has yet succeeded in sustaining, through more than some single occasional sentence, that fresh and perfect charm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>If by the training of a lifetime <num value="1">one</num> could succeed in producing <num value="1">one</num> continuous page of perfect cadence, it would be a life well spent, and such a literary artist would fall short of Nature's standard in quantity only, not in quality.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>It is <num value="1">one</num> sign of our weakness, also, that we commonly assume Nature to be a rather fragile and merely ornamental thing, and suited for a model of the graces only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>But her seductive softness is the last climax of magnificent strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>The same mathematical law winds the leaves around the stem and the planets around the sun. The same law of crystallization rules the slight-knit snow-flake and the hard foundations of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>The dew-drop holds within its transparent cell the same electric fire which charges the thunder-cloud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>In the softest tree or the airiest waterfall, the fundamental lines are as lithe and muscular as the crouching haunches of a leopard; and without a pencil vigorous enough to render these, no mere mass of foam or foliage, however exquisitely finished, can tell the story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>Lightness of touch is the crowning test of power.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Yet Nature does not work by single spasms only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>That chestnut spray is not an isolated and exhaustive effort of creative beauty: look upward and see its sisters rise with pile above pile of fresh and stately verdure, till tree meets sky in a dome of glorious blossom, the whole as perfect as the parts, the least part as perfect as the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Studying the details, it seems as if Nature were a series of costly fragments with no coherency,&mdash;as if she would never encourage us to do anything systematically,&mdash;would tolerate no method but her own, and yet had none of her own,&mdash;were as abrupt in her transitions from oak to maple as the heroine who went into the garden to cut a cabbage-leaf to make an apple-pie; while yet there is no conceivable human logic so close and inexorable as her connections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>How rigid, how flexible are, for instance, the laws of perspective!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>If <num value="1">one</num> could learn to make his statements as firm and unswerving as the horizon-line,&mdash;his continuity of thought as marked, yet as unbroken, as yonder soft gradations by which the eye is lured upward from lake to wood, from wood to hill, from hill to heavens,&mdash;what more bracing tonic could literary culture demand?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>As it is, Art misses the parts, yet does not grasp the whole.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Literature also learns from Nature the use of materials: either to select only the choicest and rarest, or to transmute coarse to fine by skill in using.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>How perfect is the delicacy with which the woods and fields are kept, throughout the year!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>All these <num value="1000000">millions</num> of living creatures born every season, and born to die; yet where are the dead bodies?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>We never see them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Buried beneath the earth by tiny nightly sextons, sunk beneath the waters, dissolved into the air, or distilled again and again as food for other organizations,&mdash;all have had their swift resurrection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Their existence blooms again in these violet-petals, glitters in the burnished beauty of these golden beetles, or enriches the veery's song.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>It is only out of doors that even death and decay become beautiful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>The model farm, the most luxurious house, have their regions of unsightliness; but the fine chemistry of Nature is constantly clearing away all its impurities before our eyes, and yet so delicately that we never suspect the process.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>The most exquisite work of literary art exhibits a certain crudeness and coarseness, when we turn to it from Nature,&mdash;as the smallest cambric needle appears rough and jagged when compared through the magnifier with the tapering fineness of the insect's sting.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Rising to look forth at intervals, during the peaceful hours,&mdash;for it is the worst feature of a night out-doors, that sleeping seems such a waste of time,&mdash;we watched the hilly and wooded shores of the lake sink into gloom and glimmer into dawn again, amid the low plash of waters and the noises of the night.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>The present decline in the manufacturing business is clear revenue to the water-lilies, and these ponds are higher than usual, because the idle mills do not draw them off.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>And the same natural fitness, without reference to mere quantity, extends to its flowery children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>Before us lie islands and continents of lilies, acres of charms, whole, vast, unbroken surfaces of stainless whiteness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>And yet, as we approach them, every island cup that floats in lonely dignity, apart from the multitude, appears perfect in itself, couched in white expanded perfection, its reflection taking a faint glory of pink that is scarcely perceptible in the flower.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>Or when a Humming-Bird, a winged drop of gorgeous sheen and gloss, a living gem, poising on his wings, thrust his dark, slender, honey-seeking bill into the white blossoms of a little bush beside my window, I should have thought it no such bad thing to be a bird; even if <num value="1">one</num> next became a bat, like the colony in our eaves, that dart and drop and skim and skurry, all the length of moonless nights, in such ecstasies of dusky joy.</q>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>I think, that, if required, on pain of death, to name instantly the most perfect thing in the universe, I should risk my fate on a bird's egg. There is, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, its exquisite fragility of material, strong only by the mathematical precision of that form so daintily moulded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>There is its absolute purity from external stain, since that thin barrier remains impassable until the whole is in ruins,&mdash;a purity recognized in the household proverb of <q direct="unspecified">An apple, an egg, and a nut.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>Then, its range of tints, so varied, so subdued, and so beautiful,&mdash;whether of pure white, like the <rs>Martin</rs>'s, or pure green, like the <rs>Robin</rs>'s, or dotted and mottled into the loveliest of browns, like the <rs>Red Thrush</rs>'s, or aqua-marine, with stains of moss-agate, like the <name>Chipping</name>-<persName n="Sparrow,,,,," id="n0225.0004.00054.00114" reg="mostcommon:Sparrow,nomatch:0"><surname>Sparrow</surname></persName>'s, or blotched with long, weird ink-marks on a pale ground, like the <rs>Oriole</rs>'s, as if it bore inscribed some magic clew to the bird's darting flight and pensile nest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>Above all, the associations and predictions of this little wonder,&mdash;that <num value="1">one</num> may bear home between his fingers all that winged splendor, all that celestial melody, coiled in mystery within these tiny walls!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>Even the chrysalis is less amazing, for its form always preserves some trace, however fantastic, of the perfect insect, and it is but moulting a skin; but this egg appears to the eye like a separate unit from some other kingdom of Nature, claiming more kindred with the very stones than with feathery existence; and it is as if a pearl opened and an angel sang.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>The nest which is to contain these fair things is a wonderful study also, from the coarse masonry of the <name>Robin</name> <pb id="p.55" n="55"/> to the soft structure of the <name>Humming</name>-<persName n="Bird,,,,," id="n0225.0004.00055.00115" reg="mostcommon:Bird,nomatch:0"><surname>Bird</surname></persName>, a baby-house among nests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>Among all created things, the birds come nearest to man in their domesticity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>Their unions are usually in pairs, and for life; and with them, unlike the practice of most quadrupeds, the male labors for the young.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>He chooses the locality of the nest, aids in its construction, and fights for it, if needful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>He sometimes assists in hatching the eggs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>He feeds the brood with exhausting labor, like yonder Robin, whose winged picturesque day is spent in putting worms into insatiable beaks, at the rate of <num value="1">one</num> morsel in every <measure n="3minutes" type="date">three minutes</measure>. He has to teach them to fly, as among the <name>Swallows</name>, or even to hunt, as among the <name>Hawks</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>His life is anchored to his home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>Yonder Oriole fills with light and melody the <num value="1000">thousand</num> branches of a neighborhood; and yet the centre for all this divergent splendor is always that <num value="1">one</num> drooping dome upon <num value="1">one</num> chosen tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>This he helped to build in <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, confiscating cotton as if he were an army provost-marshal, and singing many songs, with his mouth full of plunder; and there he watches over his household, all through the leafy <rs>June</rs>, perched often upon the airy cradleedge, and swaying with it in the summer wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>And from this deep nest, after the pretty eggs are hatched, will he and his mate extract every fragment of the shell, leaving it, like all other nests, save those of birds of prey, clean and pure, when the young are flown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>This they do chiefly from an instinct of delicacy; since wood-birds are not wont to use the same nest a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time, even if they rear several broods in a season.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>The subdued tints and notes which almost always mark the female sex, among birds,&mdash;unlike insects and human beings, where the female is often more showy than the male,&mdash;seem designed to secure their safety while sitting on the nest, while the brighter colors and louder song of the male enable his domestic circle to detect his whereabouts more easily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>It is commonly noticed, in the same way, that ground-birds have more neutral tints than those which build out of reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>With the aid of these advantages, it is astonishing how well these roving creatures keep their secrets, and what sharp eyes are needed to spy out their habitations,&mdash;while it always seems as if the empty last-year's nests were very plenty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>Some, indeed, are very elaborately concealed, as of the <rs>Golden-Crowned Thrush</rs>, called, for this reason, the <name>Oven</name>-<persName n="Bird,,,,," id="n0225.0004.00055.00116" reg="mostcommon:Bird,nomatch:0"><surname>Bird</surname></persName>,&mdash;the <rs>Meadow-Lark</rs>, with its burrowed gallery among the grass,&mdash;and the <rs>Kingfisher</rs>, which mines <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure> into the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>Many of the rarer nests would hardly be discovered, only that the maternal instinct seems sometimes so overloaded by Nature as to defeat itself, and the bird flies and chirps in agony, when she might pass unnoticed by keeping still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>The most marked exception I have noticed is that of the <rs>Red Thrush</rs>, which, in this respect, as in others, has the most high-bred manners among all our birds: both male and female sometimes flit in perfect silence through the bushes, and show solicitude only in a sob that is scarcely audible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/><pb id="p.56" n="56"/></p> 
<p>Passing along the shore-path by our lake, <num value="1">one</num> day in <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>, I heard a great sound of scuffling and yelping before me, as if dogs were hunting rabbits or woodchucks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>On approaching, I saw no sign of such disturbances, and presently a Partridge came running at me through the trees, with ruff and tail expanded, bill wide open, and hissing like a goose,&mdash; then turned suddenly, and with ruff and tail furled, but with no pretence of lameness, scudded off through the woods in a circle,&mdash;then at me again fiercely, approaching within <measure n="2yards" type="distance">two yards</measure>, and spreading all her furbelows, to intimidate, as before,&mdash;then, taking in sail, went off again, always at the same rate of speed, yelping like an angry squirrel, squealing like a pig, occasionally clucking like a hen, and, in general, so filling the woods with bustle and disturbance that there seemed no room for anything else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>Quite overawed by the display, I stood watching her for some time, then entered the underbrush, where the little, invisible brood had been unceasingly piping, in their baby way. So motionless were they, that, for all their noise, I stood with my feet among them, for some minutes, without finding it possible to detect them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>When found and taken from the ground, which they so closely resembled, they made no attempt to escape; but when replaced, they presently ran away fast, as if conscious that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> policy had failed, and that their mother had retreated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>Such is the summer life of these little things; but come again in the fall, when the wild autumnal winds go marching through the woods, and a dozen pairs of strong wings will thrill like thunder through the arches of the trees, as the full-grown brood whirrs away around you.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>Not only have we scarcely any species of birds which are thoroughly and unquestionably identical with <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> species, but there are certain general variations of habit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>For instance, in regard to migration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>This is, of course, a universal instinct, since even tropical birds migrate for short distances from the equator, so essential to their existence do these wanderings seem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>But in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, among birds as among men, the roving habit seems unusually strong, and abodes are shifted very rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>The whole number of species observed in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> is about the same as in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>,&mdash;some <num value="300">three hundred</num> in all. But of this number, in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, about a <num value="100">hundred</num> habitually winter on the island, and half that number even in the <name>Hebrides</name>, some birds actually breeding in <placeName key="tgn,7002444" n="1.000 148" reg="scotland">Scotland</placeName> during <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>, incredible as it may seem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>Their habits can, therefore, be observed through a long period of the year; while with us the bright army comes and encamps for a month or <num value="2">two</num> and then vanishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>You must attend their dress-parades while they last; for you will have but few opportunities, and their domestic life must commonly be studied during a few weeks of the season, or not at all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>Wonderful as the instinct of migration seems, it is not, perhaps, so altogether amazing in itself as in some of <pb id="p.57" n="57"/> its attendant details.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>To a great extent, birds follow the open foliage northward, and flee from its fading, south; they must keep near the food on which they live, and secure due shelter for their eggs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>Our earliest visitors shrink from trusting the bare trees with their nests; the <rs>Song-Sparrow</rs> seeks the ground; the <name>Bluebird</name> finds a box or a hole somewhere; the <rs>Red-Winged Blackbird</rs> haunts the marshy thickets, safer in spring than at any other season; and even the sociable Robin prefers a pine-tree to an apple-tree, if resolved to begin housekeeping prematurely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>The movements of birds are chiefly timed by the advance of vegetation; and the thing most thoroughly surprising about them is not the general fact of the change of latitude, but their accuracy in hitting the precise locality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>That the same Cat-bird should find its way back, every spring, to almost the same branch of yonder larch-tree,&mdash;that is the thing astonishing to me. In <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, a lame Redstart was observed in the same garden for <num value="16">sixteen</num> successive years; and the astonishing precision of course which enables some birds of small size to fly from <placeName reg="Australia, Oceania, " key="tgn,7000490">Australia</placeName> to <placeName reg="New Zealand" key="tgn,1000226">New Zealand</placeName> in a day-probably the longest single flight ever taken &mdash; is only a part of the same mysterious instinct of direction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>In comparing modes of flight, the most surprising, of course, is that of the <rs>Swallow</rs> tribe, remarkable not merely for its velocity, but for the amazing boldness and instantaneousness of the angles it makes; so that eminent <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> mechanicians have speculated in vain upon the methods used in its locomotion, and prizes have been offered, by mechanical exhibitions, to him who could best explain it. With impetuous dash they sweep through our perilous streets, these wild hunters of the air, <q direct="unspecified">so near, and yet so far;</q> they bathe flying, and flying they feed their young.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>I know no prettier sight than a bevy of these bright little creatures, met from a dozen different farm-houses to picnic at a wayside pool, splashing and fluttering, with their long wings expanding like butterflies, keeping poised by a constant hovering motion, just tilting upon their feet, which scarcely touch the moist ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>You will seldom see them actually perch on anything less airy than some telegraphic wire; but when they do alight, each will make chatter enough for a dozen, as if all the rushing hurry of the wings had passed into the tongue.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>Between the swiftness of the <rs>Swallow</rs> and the stateliness of the birds of prey, the whole range of bird-motion seems included.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>Standing beside a little grove, on a rocky hillside, <pb id="p.58" n="58"/> I heard Crows cawing near by, and then a sound like great flies buzzing, which I really attributed, for a moment, to some early insect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>Turning, I saw <num value="2">two</num> Crows flapping their heavy wings among the trees, and observed that they were teasing a Hawk about as large as themselves, which was also on the wing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>Presently all <num value="3">three</num> had risen above the branches, and were circling higher and higher in a slow spiral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>The Crows kept constantly swooping at their enemy, with the same angry buzz, <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="2">two</num> taking decidedly the lead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>They seldom struck at him with their beaks, but kept lumbering against him, and flapping him with their wings, as if in a fruitless effort to capsize him; while the <rs>Hawk</rs> kept carelessly eluding the assaults, now inclining on <num value="1">one</num> side, now on the other, with a stately grace, never retaliating, but seeming rather to enjoy the novel amusement, as if it were a skirmish in balloons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>During all this, indeed, he scarcely seemed once to wave his wings; yet he soared steadily aloft, till the <name>Crows</name> refused to follow, though already higher than I ever saw Crows before, dim against the fleecy sky; then the <rs>Hawk</rs> flew northward, but soon after he sailed over us once again, with loud, scornful <hi rend="italics">chirr</hi>, and they only cawed, and left him undisturbed.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>When we hear the tumult of music from these various artists of the air, it seems as if the symphony never could be analyzed into its different instruments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>But with time and patience it is not so difficult; nor can we really enjoy the performance so long as it is only a confused chorus to our ears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>It is not merely the highest form of animal language, but in strictness of etymology, the only form, if it be true, as is claimed, that no other animal employs its tongue, <hi rend="italics">lingua</hi>, in producing sound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>Then, seemingly by preconcerted signal, they joined in: Crows cawed anxiously afar; Jays screamed in the woods; a Partridge clucked to its brood, like the gurgle of water from a bottle; a Kingfisher wound his rattle, more briefly than in spring, as if we now knew all about it and the merest hint ought to suffice; a Fish-Hawk flapped into the water, with a great, rude splash, and then flew heavily away; a flock of Wild-Ducks went southward overhead, and a smaller party returned beneath them, flying low and anxiously, as if to pick up some lost baggage; and, at last, a Loon laughed loud from behind a distant island, and it was pleasant to people these woods and waters with that wild shouting, linking them with <placeName reg="Katahdin Lake, Penobscot, Maine" key="tgn,2431568">Katahdin Lake</placeName> and Amperzand.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>I have found it of old in <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, and then upon the pleasant shallows of the <rs>Artichoke</rs>, that loveliest tributary of the <rs>Merrimack</rs>, and I have never seen it where it occupied a patch more than a few yards square, while yet within that space the multitudinous spikes grow always tall and close, reminding <num value="1">one</num> of Hyacinths, when in perfection, but more delicate and beautiful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>The only locality I know for it in this vicinity lies <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure> away, where a little inlet from the lower, winding bays of <placeName reg="Lake Quinsigamond, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2604076">Lake Quinsigamond</placeName> goes stealing up <pb id="p.72" n="72"/> among a farmer's hay-fields, and there, close beside the public road and in full view of the farm-house, this rare creature fills the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>But to reach it we commonly row down the lake to a sheltered lagoon, separated from the main lake by a long island, which is gradually forming itself like the coral isles, growing each year denser with alder thickets where the king-birds build;--there we leave the boat among the lily-leaves, and take a lane which winds among the meadows and gives a fitting avenue for the pretty thing we seek.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>It is not safe to vary many days from the <dateStruct value="-05-20"><day reg="20">twentieth</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, for the plant is not long in perfection, and is past its prime when the lower blossoms begin to wither on the stem.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>But should we miss this delicate adjustment of time, it is easy to console ourselves with bright armfuls of Lupine, which bounteously flowers for <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure> along our lakeside, ranging from the <dateStruct value="-05-23"><day reg="23">twenty-third</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> to the <dateStruct value="-07-6"><day reg="6">sixth</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>On these banks of <placeName reg="Lake Quinsigamond, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2604076">Lake Quinsigamond</placeName> it grows in great families, and should be gathered in masses and placed in a vase by itself; for it needs no relief from other flowers, its own soft leaves afford background enough, and though the white variety rarely occurs, yet the varying tints of blue upon the same stalk are a perpetual gratification to the eye. I know not why shaded blues should be so beautiful in flowers, and yet avoided as distasteful in ladies' fancy-work; but it is a mystery like that which repudiates <rs type="color">blue</rs> and <rs type="color">green</rs> from all well-regulated costumes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>The meadows are gorgeous with Clover, Buttercups, and Wild Geranium; but Nature is a little chary for a week or <num value="2">two</num>, maturing a more abundant show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>Meanwhile <num value="1">one</num> may afford to take some pains to search for another rarity, almost disappearing from this region,&mdash;the lovely Pink Azalea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>It still grows plentifully in a few sequestered places, selecting woody swamps to hide itself; and certainly no shrub suggests, when found, more tropical associations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>Those great, nodding, airy, fragrant clusters, tossing far above <num value="1">one</num>'s head their slender cups of honey, seem scarcely to belong to our sober zone, any more than the scarlet tanager which sometimes builds its nest beside them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>They appear bright exotics, which have wandered into our woods, and are too happy to feel any wish for exit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>And just as they fade, their humble sister in white begins to bloom, and carries on through the summer the same intoxicating fragrance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>But when <dateStruct><month>June</month></dateStruct> is at its height, the sculptured chalices of the <rs type="place">Mountain</rs> Laurel begin to unfold, and thenceforward, for more than a month, extends the reign of this our woodland queen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>I know not why <num value="1">one</num> should sigh after the blossoming gorges of the <name>Himalaya</name>, when our forests are all so crowded with this glowing magnificence,&mdash;rounding the tangled swamps into smoothness, lighting up the underwoods, overtopping the pastures, lining the rural lanes, and rearing its great, pinkish masses till they meet overhead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>The color ranges from the purest white to a perfect rose-pink, and there is an inexhaustible vegetable vigor about the whole thing which puts to shame those tenderer shrubs that shrink before the progress of cultivation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>There is the <name>Rhododendron</name>, for instance, a plant of the same natural family with the <rs>Laurel</rs> and the <rs>Azalea</rs>, and looking more robust and woody than either; it once grew in many localities in this region, and still lingers in a few, without consenting either to die or to blossom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>There is only one remote place from which any <num value="1">one</num> now brings into our streets those large, luxuriant flowers, waving white above the dark green leaves, and bearing <q direct="unspecified">just a dream of sunset on their edges, and just a breath from the green sea in their hearts.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>The Laurel, on the other hand, maintains its ground, imperturbable and almost impassable, on every hillside, takes no hints, suspects no danger, and nothing but the most unmistakable onset from spade or axe can diminish its profusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>Gathering it on the most lavish scale seems only to serve as wholesale pruning; nor can I conceive that the <name>Indians</name>, who once ruled over this whole county from <placeName reg="Wigwam Hill, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2769794">Wigwam Hill</placeName>, could ever have found it more inconveniently abundant than now.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>But for the last half of <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> it monopolizes everything in the <name>Worcester</name> woods,&mdash;no <num value="1">one</num> picks anything else; and it fades so slowly that I have found a perfect blossom on the last day of <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>At the same time with this royalty of the woods, the queen of the water ascends her throne, for a reign as undisputed and far more prolonged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>It is not only the most fascinating of all flowers to gather, but more available for decorative purposes than almost any other, if it can only be kept fresh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>The best method for this purpose, I believe, is to cut the stalk very short before placing in the vase; then, at night, the lily will close and the stalk curl upward; refresh them by changing the water, and in the morning the stalk will be straight and the flower open.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>From this time forth Summer has it all her own way. After the <dateStruct value="-07-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> the yellow flowers begin, matching the yellow fire-flies: Hawkweeds, Loosestrifes, Primroses bloom, and the bushy Wild Indigo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>But, with this exception, there is nothing wanting here of the familiar flowers of early summer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>The more closely <num value="1">one</num> studies Nature, the finer her adaptations grow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>For instance, the change of seasons is analogous to a change of zones, and summer assimilates our vegetation to that of the tropics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>Nature has, in every zone, stamped on the landscape the peculiar type of beauty proper to the locality.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>But every midsummer reveals the same tendency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>In early spring, when all is bare, and small objects are easily made prominent, the wild-flowers are generally delicate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>Later, when all <pb id="p.75" n="75"/> verdure is profusely expanded, these miniature strokes would be lost, and Nature then practises landscape-gardening in large, lights up the copses with great masses of White Alder, makes the roadsides gay with <persName n="Aster,,,,," id="n0225.0005.00075.00180" reg="mostcommon:Aster,nomatch:0"><surname>Aster</surname></persName> and Golden-Rod, and tops the tall, coarse Meadow-Grass with nodding Lilies and tufted Spiraea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>The use of wild-flowers for decorative purposes merits a word in passing, for it is unquestionably a branch of high art in favored hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>It is true that we are bidden, on high authority, to love the wood-rose and leave it on its stalk; but against this may be set the saying of <persName n="Brentano,,Bettine,,," id="n0225.0005.00075.00181" reg="default:Brentano,Bettine,,,"><foreName>Bettine</foreName> <surname>Brentano</surname></persName>, that <q direct="unspecified">all flowers which are broken become immortal in the sacrifice;</q> and certainly the secret harmonies of these fair creatures are so marked and delicate that we do not understand them till we try to group floral decorations for ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>The most successful artists will not, for instance, consent to put those together which do not grow together; Nature understands her business, and distributes her masses and backgrounds unerringly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>Yonder soft and feathery Meadow-Sweet longs to be combined with Wild Roses: it yearns towards them in the field, and, after withering in the hand most readily, it revives in water as if to be with them in the vase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>In the same way the <rs>White Spiraea</rs> serves as natural background for the <rs type="place">Field</rs> Lilies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>These lilies, by the way, are the brightest adornment of our meadows during the short period of their perfection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>We have <num value="2">two</num> species: <num value="1">one</num> slender, erect, solitary, scarlet, looking up to heaven with all its blushes on; the other clustered, drooping, pale-yellow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>The granite ribs have there a thin covering of crisp moss, spangled with the white, starry blossoms of the <rs type="place">Mountain</rs> Cinquefoil ; and as I lay and watched the red lilies that waved their innumerable urns around me, it needed but little imagination to see a <num value="1000">thousand</num> altars, sending visible flames forever upward to the answering sun.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/><dateStruct><month>August</month></dateStruct> comes: the <name>Thistles</name> are in bloom, beloved of butterflies; deeper and deeper tints, more passionate intensities of color, prepare the way for the year's decline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>A wealth of gorgeous Golden-Rod waves over all the hills, and enriches every bouquet <num value="1">one</num> gathers ; its bright colors command the eye, and it is graceful as an elm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>But the <name>Cardinal</name>-Flower is best seen by itself, and, indeed, needs the surroundings of its native haunts to display its fullest beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>Its favorite abode is along the dank, mossy stones of some black and winding brook, shaded with <pb id="p.76" n="76"/> overarching bushes, and running <num value="1">one</num> long stream of scarlet with these superb occupants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>It seems amazing how anything so brilliant can mature in such a darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>When a ray of sunlight strays in upon it, the bright creature seems to hover on the stalk ready to take flight, like some lost tropic bird.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>Nothing cultivated is comparable to them ; and, with all the talent lately lavished on wild-flower painting, I have never seen the peculiar sheen of these petals in the least degree delineated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>It seems some new and separate tint, equally distinct from scarlet and from crimson, a splendor for which there is as yet no name, but only the reality.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>This flower, always unique and beautiful, opening its delicate eyelashes every morning to the sunlight, closing them again each night, has also a thoughtful charm about it as the last of the year's especial darlings.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>The season reluctantly yields its reign, and over the quiet autumnal landscape everywhere, even after the glory of the trees is past, there are tints and fascinations of minor beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>Last <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, for instance, in walking, I found myself on a little knoll, looking northward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>Overhead was a bower of climbing Waxwork, with its yellowish pods scarce disclosing their scarlet berries,&mdash; a wild Grape-vine, with its fruit withered by the frost into still purple raisins, &mdash;and yellow Beech-leaves, detaching themselves with an effort audible to the ear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>In the background were hazy hills, white Birches bare and snow-like, and a Maple half-way up a sheltered hillside, <num value="1">one</num> mass of canary-color, its fallen leaves making an apparent reflection on the earth at its foot,&mdash;and then a real reflection, fused into a glassy light intenser than itself, upon the smooth, dark stream below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>The beautiful disrobing suggested the persistent and unconquerable delicacy of Nature, who shrinks from nakedness and is always seeking to veil her graceful boughs,&mdash;if not with leaves, then with feathery hoar-frost, ermined snow, or transparent icy armor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>After all, the fascination of summer lies not in any details, however perfect, but in the sense of total wealth that summer gives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>Wholly to enjoy this, <num value="1">one</num> must give <num value="1">one</num>'s self passively to it, and not expect to reproduce it in words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>Perhaps the truant boy who simply bathes himself in the lake and then basks in the sunshine, dimly conscious of the exquisite loveliness around him, is wiser, because humbler, than is he who with presumptuous phrases tries to utter it. There are moments when the atmosphere is so surcharged with luxury that every pore of the body becomes an ample gate for sensation to flow in, and <num value="1">one</num> has simply to sit still and be filled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>In after years the memory of books seems barren or vanishing, compared with the immortal bequest of hours like these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>Other sources of illumination seem cisterns only; these are fountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>They may not increase the mere quantity of available thought, but they impart to it a quality which is priceless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>No man can measure what a single hour with Nature may have contributed to the moulding of his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>The influence is self-renewing, and if for a long time it baffles expression by reason of its fineness, so much the better in the end.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>The soul is like a musical instrument: it is not enough that it be framed for the most delicate vibration, but it must vibrate long and often before the fibres grow mellow to the finest waves of sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>I perceive that in the veery's carolling, the clover's scent, the glistening of the water, the waving wings of butterflies, the sunset tints, the floating clouds, there are attainable infinitely more subtile modulations of thought than I can yet reach the sensibility to discriminate, much less describe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>If in the simple process of writing <num value="1">one</num> could physically impart to this page the fragrance of this spray of Azalea beside me, what a wonder would it seem!-and yet <num value="1">one</num> ought to be able, by the mere use of language, to supply to every reader the total of that white, honeyed, trailing sweetness, which summer insects haunt and the <name>Spirit</name> of the <name>Universe</name> loves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>The baffled foe, retiring, has left far and near the high-heaped spoils behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>The glittering plains own the new victor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>Over all these level and wide-swept meadows, over all these drifted, spotless slopes, he is proclaimed undisputed monarch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>On the wooded hillsides the startled shadows are in motion; they flee like young fawns, bounding upward and downward over rock and dell, as through the long, gleaming arches the king comes marching to his throne.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>But shade yet lingers undisturbed in the valleys, mingled with timid smoke from household chimneys; blue as the smoke, a gauzy haze is twined around the brow of every distant hill; and the same soft azure confuses the outlines of the nearer trees, to whose branches snowy wreaths are clinging, far up among the boughs, like strange new flowers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>Everywhere the unstained surface glistens in the sunbeams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>In the curves and wreaths and turrets of the drifts a blue tinge nestles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>The fresh, pure sky answers to it; every cloud has vanished, save <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> which linger near the horizon, pardoned offenders, seeming far too innocent for mischief, although their dark and sullen brothers, banished ignominiously below the horizon's verge, may be plotting nameless treachery there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>The day is <num value="1">one</num> of moderate cold, but clear and bracing; the air sparkles like the snow; everything seems dry and resonant, like the wood of a violin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>All sounds are musical,&mdash;the voices of children, the cooing of doves, the crowing of cocks, the chopping of wood, the creaking of country sleds, the sweet jangle of sleigh-bells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>The snow has fallen under a cold temperature, and the flakes are perfectly crystallized; every shrub we pass bears wreaths which glitter as gorgeously as the nebula in the constellation <rs>Perseus</rs>; but in another hour of sunshine every <num value="1">one</num> of those fragile outlines will disappear, and the white surface glitter no longer with stars, but with star-dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>What a simple and stately hospitality is that of Nature in winter!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>The season which the residents of cities think an obstruction gives in the country an extension of intercourse: it opens every forest from here to <placeName reg="Labrador" key="tgn,7013071">Labrador</placeName>, free of entrance; the most tangled thicket, the most treacherous marsh, becomes passable; and the lumberer or moose-hunter, mounted on his snow-shoes, has the world before him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>The shadows thrown by the trees upon the snow are blue and soft, sharply defined, and so contrasted with the gleaming white as to appear narrower than the boughs which cast them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>There is something subtle and fantastic about these shadows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>Here is a leafless larch-sapling, <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure> high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>The image of the lower boughs is traced upon the <pb id="p.84" n="84"/> snow, distinct and firm as cordage, while the higher ones grow dimmer by fine gradations, until the slender topmost twig is blurred, and almost effaced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>But the denser upper spire of the young spruce by its side throws almost as distinct a shadow as its base, and the whole figure looks of a more solid texture, as if you could feel it with your hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>More beautiful than either is the fine image of this baby hemlock: each delicate leaf droops above as delicate a copy, and here and there the shadow and the substance kiss and frolic with each other in the downy snow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>The larger larches have a different plaything: on the bare branches, thickly studded with buds, cling airily the small, light cones of last year's growth, each crowned with a little ball of soft snow, <num value="4">four</num> times taller than itself,&mdash; save where some have drooped sideways, so that each carries, poor, weary <persName n="Atlas,,,,," id="n0225.0006.00084.00187" reg="mostcommon:Atlas,nomatch:0"><surname>Atlas</surname></persName>, a sphere upon its back.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>In winter each separate object interests us; in summer, the mass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>Natural beauty in winter is a poor man's luxury, infinitely enhanced in quality by the diminution in quantity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>Winter, with fewer and simpler methods, yet seems to give all her works a finish even more delicate than that of summer, working, as <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0225.0006.00084.00188" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,nomatch:0"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> says of <name>English</name> agriculture, with a pencil, instead of a plough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/></p> 
<p>Coming out upon a high hillside, more exposed to the direct fury of the sleet, we find Nature wearing a wilder look.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>Every white-birch-clump around us is bent divergingly to the ground, each white form prostrated in mute despair upon the whiter bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>The bare, writhing branches of yonder sombre oak-grove are steeped in snow, and in the misty air they look so remote and foreign that there is not a wild creature of the <name>Norse</name> mythology who might not stalk from beneath their haunted branches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>We descend a steep bank, little pellets of snow rolling hastily beside us, and leaving enamelled furrows behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>It is their last dying service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>We misplace our tenderness in winter, and look with pity upon the leafless trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>But there is no tragedy in the trees: each is not dead, but sleepeth; and each bears a future summer of buds safe nestled on its bosom, as a mother reposes with her baby at her breast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>The same security of life pervades every woody shrub: the alder and the birch have their catkins all ready for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of spring, and the sweet-fern has even now filled with fragrance its folded blossom.

The fragile flakes collapse and fall back around it, but retain their inexorable hold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>Thus delicate is the action of Nature,&mdash;a finger of air, and a grasp of iron.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>We pass the old red foundry, banked in with snow and its low eaves draped with icicles, and come to the brook which turns its resounding wheel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>The musical motion of the water seems almost unnatural amidst the general stillness: brooks, like men, must keep themselves warm by exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>The overhanging rushes and alder-sprays, weary of winter's sameness, have made for themselves playthings,&mdash;each dangling a crystal knob of ice, which sways gently in <pb id="p.86" n="86"/> the water and gleams ruddy in the sunlight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>As we approach the foaming cascade, the toys become larger and more glittering, movable stalactites, which the water tosses merrily upon their flexible stems.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>The torrent pours down beneath an enamelled mask of ice, wreathed and convoluted like a brain, and sparkling with gorgeous glow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>Tremulous motions and glimmerings go through the translucent veil, as if it throbbed with the throbbing wave beneath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>It holds in its mazes stray bits of color,&mdash;scarlet berries, evergreen sprigs, blue raspberry-stems, and sprays of yellow willow; glittering necklaces and wreaths and tiaras of brilliant ice-work cling and trail around its edges, and no regal palace shines with such carcanets of jewels as this winter ball-room of the dancing drops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>Above, the brook becomes a smooth, black canal between <num value="2">two</num> steep white banks; and the glassy water seems momentarily stiffening into the solid blackness of ice. Here and there thin films are already formed over it, and are being constantly broken apart by the treacherous current; a flake a foot square is jerked away and goes sliding beneath the slight, transparent surface till it reappears below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>The same thing, on a larger scale, helps to form the mighty ice-pack of the <rs>Northern</rs> seas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>The pond beneath our feet keeps its stores of life chiefly below its level platform, as the bright fishes in the basket of yon heavy-booted fisherman can tell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>Yet the scattered tracks of mink and muskrat beside the banks, of meadow-mice around the hay-stacks, of squirrels under the trees, of rabbits and partridges in the wood, show the warm life that is beating unseen, beneath fur or feathers, close beside us. The chickadees are chattering merrily in the upland grove, the blue-jays scream in the hemlock glade, the snow-bird mates the snow with its whiteness, and the robin contrasts with it his still ruddy breast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>The weird and impenetrable crows, most talkative of birds and most uncommunicative, their very food at this season a mystery, are almost as numerous now as in summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>They always seem like some race of banished goblins, doing penance for some primeval and inscrutable transgression, and if any bird have a history, it is they.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>The traces of the insect-world in winter are prophetic,&mdash;from the delicate cocoon of some infinitesimal feathery thing which hangs upon the dry, starry calyx of the aster, to the large brown-paper parcel which hides in peasant garb the costly beauty of some gorgeous moth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>But the hints of birds are retrospective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>In each tree of this pasture, the very pasture where last spring we looked for nests and found them not among the deceitful foliage, the fragile domiciles now stand revealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>But where are the birds that filled them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>Could the airy creatures nurtured in those nests have left permanently traced upon the air behind them their own bright summer flight, the whole atmosphere would be filled with interlacing lines and curves of gorgeous coloring, the centre of all being this forsaken bird's-nest filled with snow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>Among the many birds which winter here, and the many insects which are called forth by a few days of thaw, not a few must die of cold or of fatigue amid the storms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>Yet how few traces <num value="1">one</num> sees of this mortality!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>Yonder a dead wasp has fallen on the snow, and the warmth of its body, or its power of reflecting a few small rays of light, is melting its little grave beneath it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>Their own weight and lingering warmth take them through air or water, snow or ice, to the level of the earth, and then with spring comes an army of burying-insects, <hi rend="italics">Necrophagi</hi>, in a livery of <rs type="color">red</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs>, to dig a grave beneath every <num value="1">one</num>, and not a sparrow falleth to the ground without knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>But it is impossible to claim this weather as the only type of our winter climate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>There occasionally come days which, though perfectly still and serene, suggest more terror than any tempest,&mdash;terrible, clear, glaring days of pitiless cold,&mdash;when the sun seems powerless or only a brighter moon, when the windows remain ground-glass at high noontide; and when, on going out of doors, <num value="1">one</num> is dazzled by the brightness, and fancies for a moment that it cannot be so cold as has been reported, but presently discovers that the severity is only more deadly for being so still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>Stage-drivers and draymen are transformed to mere human buffaloes by their fur coats; the patient oxen are frost-covered; the horse that goes racing by waves a wreath of steam from his tossing head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>On such days life becomes a battle to all householders, the ordinary apparatus for defence is insufficient, and the price of caloric is continual vigilance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>After a day of this severe sunshine there comes commonly a darker day of cloud, still hard and forbidding, though milder in promise, with a sky of lead, deepening near the horizon into darker films of iron.
