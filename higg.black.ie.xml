<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>These pages record some of the adventures of the <orgName type="regiment" key="1SCVolunteer">First South Carolina Volunteers</orgName>,--the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> slave regiment mustered into the service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> during the late civil war. It was, indeed, the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Regiment">first colored regiment</orgName> of any kind so mustered, except a portion of the troops raised by <persName n="Butler,Major-General,,,," id="n0021.0001.00001.00001" reg="mostcommon:Butler,B.,F.,,:1"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> at New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>These scarcely belonged to the same class, however, being recruited from the free colored population of that city, a comparatively self-reliant and educated race.

<p>The <orgName type="regiment" key="SC1">First South Carolina</orgName>, on the other hand, contained scarcely a freeman, had not <num value="1">one</num> mulatto in <num value="10">ten</num>, and a far smaller proportion who could read or write when enlisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>My dear Sir,--I am organizing the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">First Regiment</orgName> of <orgName type="mil" key="SCVolunteer">South Carolina Volunteers</orgName>, with every prospect of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Your name has been spoken of, in connection with the command of this regiment, by some friends in whose judgment I have confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>I take great pleasure in offering you the position of <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> in it, and hope that you may be induced to accept.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>I shall not fill the place until I hear from you, or sufficient time shall have passed for me to receive your reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Should you accept, I enclose a pass for <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>, of which I trust you will feel disposed to avail yourself at once. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>I am, with sincere regard, yours truly,</p> 
<p>

<p>Had an invitation reached me to take command of a regiment of Kalmuck Tartars, it could hardly have been more unexpected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>I had always looked for the arming of the blacks, and had always felt a wish to be associated with them; had read the scanty accounts of <persName n="Hunter,General,,,," id="n0021.0001.00002.00008" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName>'s abortive regiment, and had heard rumors of <persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0021.0001.00002.00009" reg="nearbymention:Saxton,R.,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName>'s renewed efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>But the prevalent tone of public sentiment was still opposed to any such attempts; the government kept very shy of the experiment, and it did not seem possible that the time had come when it could be fairly tried. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>For myself, I was at the head of a fine company of my own raising, and in a regiment to which I was already much attached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It did not seem desirable to <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> exchange a certainty for an uncertainty; for who knew but <persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0021.0001.00003.00010" reg="nearbymention:Saxton,R.,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName> might yet be thwarted in his efforts by the pro-slavery influence that had still so much weight at Headquarters?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It would be intolerable to go out to <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, and find myself, after all, at the head of a mere plantation-guard or a day-school in uniform. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>I therefore obtained from the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, through <persName n="Andrew,Governor,,,," id="n0021.0001.00003.00011" reg="mostcommon:Andrew,John,A.,,:2"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName>, permission to go and report to <persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0021.0001.00003.00012" reg="nearbymention:Saxton,R.,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName>, without at once resigning my captaincy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Fortunately it took but a few days in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> to make it clear that all was right, and the return steamer took back a resignation of a <orgName n="Massachusetts Commission" type="commission">Massachusetts commission</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Thenceforth my lot was cast altogether with the black troops, except when regiments or detachments of white soldiers were also under my command, during the <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> following. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>These details would not be worth mentioning except as they show this fact: that I did not seek the command of colored troops, but it sought me. And this fact again is only important to my story for this reason, that under these circumstances I naturally viewed the new recruits rather as subjects for discipline than for philanthropy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>I had been expecting a war for <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure>, ever since the <rs>Kansas</rs> troubles, and my mind had dwelt on military matters more or less during all that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The best <placeName key="tgn,7007517" n="1.000 7" reg="massachusetts">Massachusetts</placeName> regiments already exhibited a high standard of drill and discipline, and unless these men could be brought tolerably near that standard, the fact of their extreme blackness would afford me, even as a philanthropist, no satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Fortunately, I felt perfect confidence that they could be so trained,--having happily known, by experience, the qualities of their race, and knowing also that they had home and household and <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> freedom to fight for, besides that abstraction of <quote>the <rs>Union</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Trouble might perhaps be expected from white officials, though this turned out far less than might have been feared; but there was no trouble to come from the men, I thought, and none ever came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>On the other hand, it was a vast experiment of indirect philanthropy, and <num value="1">one</num> on which the result of the war and the destiny of the negro race might rest ; and this was enough to tax all <num value="1">one</num>'s powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>I had been an abolitionist too long, and had known and loved <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0021.0001.00004.00013" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> too well, not to feel a thrill of joy at last on finding myself in the position where he only wished to be. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>In view of all this, it was clear that good discipline must come <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; after that, of course, the men must be helped and elevated in all ways as much as possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Of discipline there was great need,--that is, of order and regular instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Some of the men had already been under fire, but they were very ignorant of drill and camp duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The officers, being appointed from a dozen different States, and more than as many regiments,--infantry, cavalry, artillery, and engineers,--had all that diversity of methods which so confused our army in those early days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> need, therefore, was of an unbroken interval of training.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>During this period, which fortunately lasted nearly <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>, I rarely left the camp, and got occasional leisure moments for a fragmentary journal, to send home, recording the many odd or novel aspects of the new experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Camp-life was a wonderfully strange sensation to almost all volunteer officers, and mine lay among <num value="800">eight hundred</num> men suddenly transformed from slaves into soldiers, and representing a race affectionate, enthusiastic, grotesque, and dramatic beyond all others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Being such, they naturally <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> gave material for description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>There is nothing like a diary for freshness,--at least so I think,--and I shall keep to the diary through the days of camp-life, and throw the later experience into another form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Indeed, that matter takes care of itself; diaries and letter-writing stop when field-service begins. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>I am under pretty heavy bonds to tell the truth, and only the truth; for those who look back to the newspaper correspondence of that period will see that this particular regiment lived for months in a glare of publicity, such as tests any regiment severely, and certainly prevents all subsequent romancing in its historian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>As the scene of the only effort on the <rs type="place">Atlantic coast</rs> to arm the negro, our camp attracted a continuous stream of visitors, military and civil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>A battalion of black soldiers, a spectacle since so common, seemed then the most daring of innovations, and the whole demeanor of this particular regiment was watched with microscopic scrutiny by friends and foes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>I felt sometimes as if we were a plant trying to take root, but constantly pulled up to see if we were growing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The slightest camp incidents sometimes came back to us, magnified and distorted, in letters of anxious inquiry from remote parts of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It was no pleasant thing to live under such constant surveillance; but it guaranteed the honesty of any success, while fearfully multiplying the penalties had there been a failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>A single mutiny,--such as has happened in the infancy of a <num value="100">hundred</num> regiments,--a single miniature <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, a stampede of desertions, and it would have been all over with us; the party of distrust would have got the upper hand, and there might not have been, during the whole contest, another effort to arm the negro. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Yesterday afternoon we were steaming over a summer sea, the deck level as a parlor-floor, no land in sight, no sail, until at last appeared <num value="1">one</num> light-house, said to be <placeName reg="Cape Romaine">Cape Romaine</placeName>, and then a line of trees and <num value="2">two</num> distant vessels and nothing more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The sun set, a great illuminated bubble, submerged in <num value="1">one</num> vast bank of rosy suffusion; it grew dark; after tea all were on deck, the people sang hymns; then the moon set, a moon <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> old, a curved pencil of light, reclining backwards on a radiant couch which seemed to rise from the waves to receive it; it sank slowly, and the last tip wavered and went down like the mast of a vessel of the skies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Stars were still overhead, gulls wheeled and shrieked, and the broad river rippled duskily towards <placeName reg="Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013364">Beaufort</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The shores were low and wooded, like any <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> shore; there were a few gunboats, <num value="20">twenty</num> schooners, and some steamers, among them the famous <quote>Planter,</quote> <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> which Robert Small, the slave, presented to the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The river-banks were soft and graceful, though low, and as we steamed up to <placeName reg="Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013364">Beaufort</placeName> on the flood-tide this morning, it seemed almost as fair as the smooth and lovely canals which <persName n="Stedman,,,,," id="n0021.0002.00007.00014" reg="mostcommon:Stedman,nomatch:0"><surname>Stedman</surname></persName> traversed to meet his negro soldiers in <placeName key="tgn,7015386" n="1.000 2" reg="suriname,south america">Surinam</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The air was cool as at home, yet the foliage seemed green, glimpses of stiff tropical vegetation appeared along the banks, with great clumps of shrubs, whose pale seed-vessels looked like tardy blossoms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Then we saw on a picturesque point an old plantation, with stately magnolia avenue, decaying house, and tiny church amid the woods, reminding me of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>; behind it stood a neat encampment of white tents, <quote>and there,</quote> said my companion, <quote>is your future regiment.</quote>

<p><measure n="3miles" type="distance">Three miles</measure> farther brought us to the pretty town of <placeName reg="Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013364">Beaufort</placeName>, with its stately houses amid Southern foliage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>They were unarmed, and all looked as thoroughly black as the most faithful philanthropist could desire; there did not seem to be so much as a mulatto among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Their coloring suited me, all but the legs, which were clad in a lively scarlet, as intolerable to my eyes as if I had been a turkey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>I saw them mustered; <persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0021.0002.00007.00016" reg="nearbymention:Saxton,R.,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName> talked to them a little, in his direct, manly way; they gave close attention, though their faces looked impenetrable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Then I conversed with some of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to whom I spoke had been wounded in a small expedition after lumber, from which a party had just returned, and in which they had been under fire and had done very well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>It is a holiday wherever <persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0021.0002.00008.00018" reg="nearbymention:Saxton,R.,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName>'s proclamation reaches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The chilly sunshine and the pale blue river seem like <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, but those alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The air is full of noisy drumming, and of gunshots; for the prizeshooting is our great celebration of the day, and the drumming is chronic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>My young barbarians are all at play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>I look out from the broken windows of this forlorn plantation-house, through avenues of great live-oaks, with their hard, shining leaves, and their branches hung with a universal drapery of soft, long moss, like fringe-trees struck with grayness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Below, the sandy soil, scantly covered with coarse grass, bristles with sharp palmettoes and aloes; all the vegetation is stiff, shining, semi-tropical, with nothing soft or delicate in its texture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/><placeName reg="Numerous plantation">Numerous plantation</placeName>-buildings totter around, all slovenly and unattractive, while the interspaces are filled with all manner of wreck and refuse, pigs, fowls, dogs, and omnipresent Ethiopian infancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>All this is the <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> universal Southern panorama; but <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> walk beyond the hovels and the live-oaks will bring <num value="1">one</num> to something so un-Southern that the whole Southern coast at this moment trembles at the suggestion of such a thing,--the camp of a regiment of freed slaves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/><num value="1">One</num> adapts <num value="1">one</num>'s self so readily to new surroundings that already the full zest of the novelty seems passing away from my perceptions, and I write these lines in an eager effort to retain all I can. Already I am growing used to the experience, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> so novel, of living among <num value="500">five hundred</num> men, and scarce a white face to be seen,of seeing them go through all their daily processes, eating, frolicking, talking, just as if they were white.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Each day at dress-parade I stand with the customary folding of the arms before a regimental line of countenances so black that I can hardly tell whether the men stand steadily or not; black is every hand which moves in ready cadence as I vociferate, <quote>Battalion!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Shoulder arms</quote> nor is it till the line of white officers moves forward, as parade is dismissed, that I am reminded that my own face is not the color of coal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> few days on duty with a new regiment must be devoted almost wholly to tightening reins; in this process <num value="1">one</num> deals chiefly with the officers, and I have as yet had but little personal intercourse with the men. They concern me chiefly in bulk, as so many consumers of rations, wearers of uniforms, bearers of muskets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>But as the machine comes into shape, I am beginning to decipher the individual parts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, of course, they all looked just alike; the variety comes afterwards, and they are just as distinguishable, the officers say, as so many whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Most of them are wholly raw, but there are many who have already been for months in camp in <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> the abortive <quote><persName n="Hunter,,,,," id="n0021.0002.00010.00019" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><surname>Hunter</surname></persName> regiment,</quote> yet in that loose kind of way which, like average militia training, is a doubtful advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>I notice that some companies, too, look darker than others, though all are purer <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> than I expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>This is said to be partly a geographical difference between the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> men.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>It needs but a few days to show the absurdity of distrusting the military availability of these people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>They have quite as much average comprehension as whites of the need of the thing, as much courage (I doubt not), as much previous knowledge of the gun, and, above all, a readiness of ear and of imitation, which, for purposes of drill, counterbalances any defect of mental training.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>To learn the drill, <num value="1">one</num> does not want a set of college professors; <num value="1">one</num> wants a squad of eager, active, pliant school-boys; and the more childlike these pupils are the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>How absurd is the impression bequeathed by Slavery in regard to these Southern blacks, that they are sluggish and inefficient in labor!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Last night, after a hard day's work (our guns and the remainder of our tents being just issued), an order came from <persName n="Beaufort,,,,," id="n0021.0002.00014.00029" reg="mostcommon:Beaufort,nomatch:0"><surname>Beaufort</surname></persName> that we should be ready in the evening to unload a steamboat's cargo of boards, being some of those captured by them a few weeks since, and now assigned for their use. I wondered if the men would grumble at the night-work; but the steamboat arrived by <num value="7">seven</num>, and it was bright moonlight when they went at it. Never have I beheld such a jolly scene of labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Tugging these wet and heavy boards over a bridge of boats ashore, then across the slimy beach at low tide, then up a steep bank, and all in <num value="1">one</num> great uproar of merriment for <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>. Running most of the time, chattering all the time, snatching the boards from each other's backs as if they were some coveted treasure, getting up eager rivalries between different companies, pouring great choruses of ridicule on the heads of all shirkers, they made the whole scene so enlivening that I gladly stayed out in the moonlight for the whole time to watch it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>The steamboat captain declared that they unloaded the <measure n="10000feet" type="distance">ten thousand feet</measure> of boards quicker than any white gang could have done it; and they felt it so little, that, when, later in the night, I reproached <num value="1">one</num> whom I found sitting by a campfire, cooking a surreptitious opossum, telling him that he ought to be asleep after such a job of work, he answered, with the broadest grin,-- <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>I believe I have not yet enumerated the probable drawbacks to the success of this regiment, if any. We are exposed to no direct annoyance from the white regiments, being out of their way; and we have as yet no discomforts or privations which we do not share with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>I do not as yet see the slightest obstacle, in the nature of the blacks, to making them good soldiers, but rather the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>They take readily to drill, and do not object to discipline; they are not especially dull or inattentive; they seem fully to understand the importance of the contest, and of their share in it. They show no jealousy or suspicion towards their officers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>They do show these feelings, however, towards the <rs>Government</rs> itself; and no <num value="1">one</num> can wonder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>Here lies the drawback to rapid recruiting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>Were this a wholly new regiment, it would have been full to overflowing, I am satisfied, ere now. The trouble is in the legacy of bitter distrust bequeathed by the abortive regiment of <persName n="Hunter,General,,,," id="n0021.0002.00015.00032" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName>,--into which they were driven like cattle, kept for several months in camp, and then turned off without a shilling, by order of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>The formation of that regiment was, on the whole, a great <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> injury to this <num value="1">one</num>; and the men who came from it, though the best soldiers we have in other respects, are the least sanguine and cheerful; while those who now refuse to enlist have a great influence in deterring others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Our soldiers are constantly twitted by their families and friends with their prospect of risking their lives in the service, and being paid nothing; and it is in vain that we read them the instructions of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> to <persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0021.0002.00016.00033" reg="nearbymention:Saxton,R.,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName>, promising them the full pay of soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>They only half believe it.<note anchored="yes" id="n.16.1">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/> 
<p>With what utter humiliation were we, their officers, obliged to confess to them, <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure> afterwards, that it was their distrust which was wise, and our faith in the pledges of the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> which was foolishness</p></note> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Another drawback is that some of the white soldiers delight in frightening the women on the plantations with doleful tales of plans for putting us in the front rank in all battles, and such silly talk, the object being, perhaps, to prevent our being employed on active service at all. All these considerations they feel precisely as white men would,--no less, no more; and it is the comparative freedom from such unfavorable influences which makes the <rs>Florida</rs> men seem more bold and manly, as they undoubtedly do. To-day <persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0021.0002.00016.00034" reg="nearbymention:Saxton,R.,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName> has returned from <placeName key="tgn,2019279" n="1.000 62" reg="fernandina, nassau, florida">Fernandina</placeName> with <num value="76">seventy-six</num> recruits, and the eagerness of the captains to secure them was a sight to see.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>All over the camp the lights glimmer in the tents, and as I sit at my desk in the open doorway, there come mingled sounds of stir and glee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Boys laugh and shout,-- a feeble flute stirs somewhere in some tent, not an officer's,a drum throbs far away in another,--wild kildeer-plover flit and wail above us, like the haunting souls of dead slave-masters,--and from a neighboring cook-fire comes the monotonous sound of that strange festival, half powwow, half prayer-meeting, which they know only as a <quote>shout.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>These fires are usually enclosed in a little booth, made neatly of palm-leaves and covered in at top, a regular native <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> hut, in short, such as is pictured in books, and such as I once got up from dried palm-leaves for a fair at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>This hut is now crammed with men, singing at the top of their voices, in <num value="1">one</num> of their quaint, monotonous, endless, negro-Methodist chants, with obscure syllables recurring constantly, and slight variations interwoven, all accompanied with a regular drumming of the feet and clapping of the hands, like castanets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Then the excitement spreads: inside and outside the enclosure men begin to quiver and dance, others join, a circle forms, winding monotonously round some <num value="1">one</num> in the centre; some <quote>heel and toe</quote> tumultuously, others merely tremble and stagger on, others stoop and rise, others whirl, others caper sideways, all keep steadily circling like dervishes; spectators applaud special strokes of skill; my approach only enlivens the scene; the circle enlarges, louder grows the singing, rousing shouts of encouragement come in, half bacchanalian, half devout, <quote>Wake 'em, brudder!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/><quote>Stan&lsquo; up to 'em, brudder!</quote> --and still the ceaseless drumming and clapping, in perfect cadence, goes steadily <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> on.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>And this not rarely and occasionally, but night after night, while in other parts of the camp the soberest prayers and exhortations are proceeding sedately. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>Nor have these men of mine yet shown any worth mentioning; since I took command I have heard of no man intoxicated, and there has been but <num value="1">one</num> small quarrel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>I suppose that scarcely a white regiment in the army shows so little swearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Take the <quote>Progressive friends</quote> and put them in red trousers, and I verily believe they would fill a guard-house sooner than these men. If camp regulations are violated, it seems to be usually through heedlessness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>They love passionately <num value="3">three</num> things besides their spiritual incantations; namely, sugar, home, and tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>This last affection brings tears to their eyes, almost, when they speak of their urgent need of pay; they speak of their last-remembered quid as if it were some deceased relative, too early lost, and to be mourned forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>As for sugar, no white man can drink coffee after they have sweetened it to their liking. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>I see that the pride which military life creates may cause the plantation trickeries to diminish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>For instance, these men make the most admirable sentinels.

<p>That officer, with the utmost sincerity, reciprocated the sentiment. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>About <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> the people began to collect by land; and also by water,--in steamers sent by <persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0021.0002.00039.00076" reg="mostcommon:Saxton,Rufus,,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName> for the purpose; and from that time all the avenues of approach were thronged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>The multitude were chiefly colored women, with gay handkerchiefs on their heads, and a sprinkling of men, with that peculiarly respectable look which these people always have on <date value="--7">Sundays</date> and holidays.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>There were many white visitors also,--ladies on horseback and in carriages, superintendents and teachers, officers, and cavalry-men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>Our companies were marched to the neighborhood of the platform, and allowed <pb id="p.40" n="40"/> to sit or stand, as at the <name>Sunday</name> services; the platform was occupied by ladies and dignitaries, and by the band of the <orgName type="regiment" key="ME8">Eighth Maine</orgName>, which kindly volunteered for the occasion; the colored people filled up all the vacant openings in the beautiful grove around, and there was a cordon of mounted visitors beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>Above, the great live-oak branches and their trailing moss; beyond the people, a glimpse of the blue river. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>The services began at <time value="11:30oclock">half past 11 o'clock</time>, with prayer by our chaplain, <persName n="Fowler,Mister,,,," id="n0021.0002.00040.00077" reg="mostcommon:Fowler,James,H.,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Fowler</surname></persName>, who is always, on such occasions, simple, reverential, and impressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>Then the <rs>President</rs>'s Proclamation was read by <persName n="Brisbane,Doctor,W.,H.,," id="n0021.0002.00040.00078" reg="default:Brisbane,W.,H.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Brisbane</surname></persName>, a thing infinitely appropriate, a <orgName n="South Carolinian" type="newspaper">South Carolinian</orgName> addressing South Carolinians; for he was reared among these very islands, and here long since emancipated his own slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>Then the colors were presented to us by <persName n="French,Reverend,,,," id="n0021.0002.00040.00079" reg="mostcommon:French,J.,,,:1"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>All this was according to the programme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>Then followed an incident so simple, so touching, so utterly unexpected and startling, that I can scarcely believe it on recalling, though it gave the key-note to the whole day. The very moment the speaker had ceased, and just as I took and waved the flag, which now for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time meant anything to these poor people, there suddenly arose, close beside the platform, a strong male voice (but rather cracked and elderly), into which <num value="2">two</num> women's voices instantly blended, singing, as if by an impulse that could no more be repressed than the morning note of the song-sparrow.- <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/></p><l>My Country, &apos;t is of thee, </l><l>Sweet land of liberty, </l><l>Of thee I sing!</l></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>People looked at each other, and then at us on the <pb id="p.41" n="41"/> platform, to see whence came this interruption, not set down in the bills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>Firmly and irrepressibly the quavering voices sang on, verse after verse; others of the colored people joined in; some whites on the platform began, but I motioned them to silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>I never saw anything so electric; it made all other words cheap; it seemed the choked voice of a race at last unloosed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>Nothing could be more wonderfully unconscious; art could not have dreamed of a tribute to the day of jubilee that should be so affecting; history will not believe it; and when I came to speak of it, after it was ended, tears were everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>If you could have heard how quaint and innocent it was!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>Old Tiff and his children might have sung it; and close before me was a little slave-boy, almost white, who seemed to belong to the party, and even he must join in. Just think of it!--the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day they had ever had a country, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> flag they had ever seen which promised anything to their people, and here, while mere spectators stood in silence, waiting for my stupid words, these simple souls burst out in their lay, as if they were by their own hearths at home!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>When they stopped, there was nothing to do for it but to speak, and I went on; but the life of the whole day was in those unknown people's song. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>Receiving the flags, I gave them into the hands of <num value="2">two</num> fine-looking men, jet black, as <orgName n="Color Guard" type="guard">color-guard</orgName>, and they also spoke, and very effectively,--<persName n="Rivers,Sergeant,Prince,,," id="n0021.0002.00041.00080" reg="default:Rivers,Prince,,,"><roleName n="Sergeant">Sergeant</roleName> <foreName>Prince</foreName> <surname>Rivers</surname></persName> and <persName n="Sutton,Corporal,Robert,,," id="n0021.0002.00041.00081" reg="default:Sutton,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Corporal">Corporal</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName> <surname>Sutton</surname></persName>, The regiment sang <quote>Marching along,</quote> and then <persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0021.0002.00041.00082" reg="mostcommon:Saxton,Rufus,,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName> spoke, in his own simple, manly way, and <persName n="Gage,Mrs.,Francis,D.,," id="n0021.0002.00041.00083" reg="default:Gage,Francis,D.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>Francis</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Gage</surname></persName> spoke very sensibly to the women, and <persName n="Stickney,Judge,,,," id="n0021.0002.00041.00084" reg="mostcommon:Stickney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Stickney</surname></persName>, from <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, added something; then some gentlemen sang an ode, and the regiment the <rs>John Brown</rs> song, and then <pb id="p.42" n="42"/> they went to their beef and molasses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>Everything was very orderly, and they seemed to have a very gay time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>Most of the visitors had far to go, and so dispersed before dress-parade, though the band stayed to enliven it. In the evening we had letters from home, and <persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0021.0002.00042.00085" reg="mostcommon:Saxton,Rufus,,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName> had a reception at his house, from which I excused myself; and so ended <num value="1">one</num> of the most enthusiastic and happy gatherings I ever knew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>The day was perfect, and there was nothing but success. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>I forgot to say, that, in the midst of the services, it was announced that <persName n="Fremont,General,,,," id="n0021.0002.00042.00086" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,J.,C.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Fremont</surname></persName> was appointed <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs>,--an announcement which was received with immense cheering, as would have been almost anything else, I verily believe, at that moment of high tide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/><num value="1">One</num> of the very best things that have happened to us was the half-accidental shooting of a man who had escaped from the guard-house, and was wounded by a squad sent in pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>He has since died; and this very evening another man, who escaped with him, came and opened the door of my tent, after being <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure> in the woods, almost without food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>I-is clothes were in rags, and he was nearly starved, poor foolish fellow, so that we can almost dispense with further punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>Severe penalties would be wasted on these people, accustomed as they have been to the most violent passions on the part of white men; but a mild inexorableness tells on them, just as it does on any other children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>It is something utterly new to them, and it is thus far perfectly efficacious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>They have a great deal of pride <pb id="p.44" n="44"/> as soldiers, and a very little of severity goes a great way, if it be firm and consistent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>This is very encouraging. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>The single question which I asked of some of the plantation superintendents, on the voyage, was, <quote>Do these people appreciate <hi rend="italics">justice</hi>?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>If they did it was evident that all the rest would be easy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>When a race is degraded beyond that point it must be very hard to deal with them; they must mistake all kindness for indulgence, all strictness for cruelty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>With these freed slaves there is no such trouble, not a particle : let an officer be only just and firm, with a cordial, kindly nature, and he has no sort of difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>The plantation superintendents and teachers have the same experience, they say; but we have an immense advantage in the military organization, which helps in <num value="2">two</num> ways: it increases their self-respect, and it gives us an admirable machinery for discipline, thus improving both the fulcrum and the lever. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>Another soldier died of pneumonia on the same day, and we had the funerals in the evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>It was very impressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>A dense mist came up, with a moon behind it, and we had only the light of pine-splinters, as the procession wound along beneath the mighty, moss-hung branches of the ancient grove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>The groups around the grave, the dark faces, the red garments, the scattered lights, the misty boughs, were weird and strange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>We have now a good regimental hospital, admirably arranged in a deserted gin-house,--a fine well of our own digging, within the camp lines,--a full allowance of tents, all floored,--a wooden cook-house to every company, with sometimes a palmetto mess-house beside,--a substantial wooden guard-house, with a fireplace <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> <quote>in de clar,</quote> where the men off duty can dry themselves and sleep comfortably in bunks afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>We have also a great circular school-tent, made of condemned canvas, <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure> in diameter, and looking like some of the <rs>Indian</rs> lodges I saw in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>This morning I went to <placeName reg="Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013364">Beaufort</placeName> again, on necessary business, and by good luck happened upon a review and drill of the white regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>The thing that struck me most was that same absence of uniformity, in minor points, that I noticed at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in my own officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>The best regiments in the <name>Department</name> are represented among <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> my captains and lieutenants, and very well represented too; yet it has cost much labor to bring them to any uniformity in their drill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>There is no need of this; for the prescribed <quote>Tactics</quote> approach perfection; it is never left discretionary in what place an officer shall stand, or in what words he shall give his order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>All variation . would seem to imply negligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>Yet even <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> occasionally varies from the <quote>Tactics,</quote> --as, for instance, in requiring the line officers to face down the line, when each is giving the order to his company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>In our strictest <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> regiments this is not done. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>It needs an artist's eye to make a perfect drill-master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>Yet the small points are not merely a matter of punctilio; for, the more perfectly a battalion is drilled on the parade-ground, the more quietly it can be handled in action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>Moreover, the great need of uniformity is this: that, in the field, soldiers of different companies, and even of different regiments, are liable to be intermingled, and a diversity of orders may throw everything into confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>Confusion means <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>I wished my men at the review to-day; for, amidst all the rattling and noise of artillery and the galloping of cavalry, there was only <num value="1">one</num> infantry movement that we have not practised, and that was done by only <num value="1">one</num> regiment, and apparently considered quite a novelty, though it is easily taught,--forming square by <persName n="Casey,,,,," id="n0021.0002.00046.00092" reg="mostcommon:Casey,nomatch:0"><surname>Casey</surname></persName>'s method: forward on centre. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>It is really just as easy to drill a regiment as a company,--perhaps easier, because <num value="1">one</num> has more time to think; but it is just as essential to be sharp and decisive, perfectly clear-headed, and to put life into the men. A regiment seems small when <num value="1">one</num> has learned how to handle it, a mere handful of men; and I have no doubt <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> that a brigade or a division would soon appear equally small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>But to handle <hi rend="italics">either judiciously,--ah</hi>, that is another affair! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>So of governing; it is as easy to govern a regiment as a school or a factory, and needs like qualities,--system, promptness, patience, tact; moreover, in a regiment <num value="1">one</num> has the aid of the admirable machinery of the army, so that I see very ordinary men who succeed very tolerably. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>Reports of a <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> armistice are rife here, and the thought is deplored by all. I cannot believe it yet sometimes <num value="1">one</num> feels very anxious about the ultimate fate of these poor people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>After the experience of <placeName key="tgn,7006278" n="1.000 27" reg="magyarorszag">Hungary</placeName>, <num value="1">one</num> sees that revolutions may go backward; and the habit of injustice seems so deeply impressed upon the whites, that it is hard to believe in the possibility of anything better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>I dare not yet hope that the promise of the <rs>President</rs>'s Proclamation will be kept.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>For myself I can be indifferent, for the experience here has been its own daily and hourly reward; and the adaptedness of the freed slaves for drill and discipline is now thoroughly demonstrated, and must soon be universally acknowledged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>But it would be terrible to see this regiment disbanded or defrauded.</p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>Many things glide by without time to narrate them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>On Saturday we had a mail with the <rs>President</rs>'s <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num> Message of Emancipation, and the next day it was read to the men. The words themselves did not stir them very much, because they have been often told that they were free, especially on <dateStruct value="-01-01"><occasion>New Year's Day</occasion></dateStruct>, and, being unversed in politics, they do not understand, as well as we do, the importance of each additional guaranty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>But the chaplain spoke to them afterwards very effectively, <pb id="p.48" n="48"/> as usual; and then I proposed to them to hold up their hands and pledge themselves to be faithful to those still in bondage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>They entered heartily into this, and the scene was quite impressive, beneath the great oak branches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>I heard afterwards that only <num value="1">one</num> man refused to raise his hand, saying bluntly that his wife was out of slavery with him, and he did not care to fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>The other soldiers of his company were very indignant, and shoved him about among them while marching back to their quarters, calling him <quote><persName n="Coward,,,,," id="n0021.0002.00048.00093" reg="mostcommon:Coward,nomatch:0"><surname>Coward</surname></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>I was glad of their exhibition of feeling, though it is very possible that the <num value="1">one</num> who had thus the moral courage to stand alone among his comrades might be more reliable, on a pinch, than some who yielded a more ready assent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>But the whole response, on their part, was very hearty, and will be a good thing to which to hold them hereafter, at any time of discouragement or demoralization,--which was my chief reason for proposing it. With their simple natures it is a great thing to tie them to some definite committal; they never forget a marked occurrence, and never seem disposed to evade a pledge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>It is this capacity of honor and fidelity which gives me such entire faith in them as soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>Without it all their religious demonstration would be mere sentimentality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>For instance, every <num value="1">one</num> who visits the camp is struck with their bearing as sentinels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>They exhibit, in this capacity, not an upstart conceit, but a steady, conscientious devotion to duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>They would stop their idolized <persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0021.0002.00048.00094" reg="mostcommon:Saxton,Rufus,,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName>, if he attempted to cross their beat contrary to orders: I have seen them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>No feeble or incompetent race could do this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>The officers tell many amusing instances of this fidelity, but I think mine the best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/><pb id="p.49" n="49"/> </p> 
<p>It was very dark the other night,--an unusual thing here,--and the rain fell in torrents; so I put on my India-rubber suit, and went the rounds of the sentinels, incognito, to test them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>I can only say that I shall never try such an experiment again, and have cautioned my officers against it. &lsquo;T is a wonder I escaped with life and limb,--such a charging of bayonets and clicking of gun-locks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>Sometimes I tempted them by refusing to give any countersign, but offering them a piece of tobacco, which they could not accept without allowing me nearer than the prescribed bayonet's distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>Tobacco is more than gold to them, and it was touching to watch the struggle in their minds; but they always did their duty at last, and I never could persuade them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>It seemed wrong thus to tamper with their fidelity; yet it was a vital matter to me to know how far it could be trusted, out of my sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>It was easy to distinguish those who did make the discovery; they were always conscious and simpering when their turn came; while the others were stout and irreverent till I revealed myself, and then rather cowed and anxious, fearing to have offended. </p>

<p>There flashed into my mind, with more enjoyment in the retrospect than I had experienced at the time, an adventure on a lecturing tour in other years, when I had spent an hour in trying to scramble into a country tavern, after bed-time, on the coldest night of winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>In many ways the childish nature of this people shows itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>I have just had to make a change of officers in a company which has constantly complained, and with good reason, of neglect and improper treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/><num value="2">Two</num> excellent officers have been assigned to them; and yet they sent a deputation to me in the evening, in a state of utter wretchedness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/><quote>We's bery grieved dis evening, <persName n="Cunnel,,,,," id="n0021.0002.00052.00097" reg="mostcommon:Cunnel,nomatch:0"><surname>Cunnel</surname></persName>; &lsquo;pears like we could n't bear it, to lose de Cap'n and <persName n="Lieutenant,,de,,," id="n0021.0002.00052.00098" reg="mostcommon:Lieutenant,de,,,:1"><foreName>de</foreName> <surname>Lieutenant</surname></persName>, all <num value="2">two</num> togeder.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>Argument was useless; and I could only fall back on the general theory, that I knew what was best for them, which had much more effect; and I also could cite the instance of another company, which had been much improved by a new captain, as they readily admitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>So with the promise that the new officers should not be <quote>savage to we,</quote> which was the <num value="1">one</num> thing they deprecated, I assuaged their woes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/><measure n="24hours" type="date">Twenty-four hours</measure> have passed, and I hear them singing most merrily all down that company street. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>I often notice how their griefs may be dispelled, like those of children, merely by permission to utter them: if they can tell their sorrows, they go away happy, even without asking to have anything done about them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>I observe also a peculiar dislike of all <hi rend="italics">intermediate</hi> control: they always wish to pass by the company officer, and deal with me personally for everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/><persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0021.0002.00052.00099" reg="mostcommon:Saxton,Rufus,,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName> notices the same thing with the people on the plantations as regards himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>I suppose this proceeds partly from the old habit of appealing to the master against the overseer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>Kind words would cost the master nothing, and he could easily put off any non-fulfilment upon the overseer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>Moreover, the negroes have acquired such constitutional distrust of white people, that it is perhaps as <pb id="p.53" n="53"/> much as they can do to trust more than <num value="1">one</num> person at a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>Meanwhile this constant personal intercourse is out of the question in a well-ordered regiment; and the remedy for it is to introduce by degrees more and more of system, so that their immediate officers will become all-sufficient for the daily routine. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>It is perfectly true (as I find everybody takes for granted) that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> essential for an officer of colored troops is to gain their confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>But it is equally true, though many persons do not appreciate it, that the admirable methods and proprieties of the regular army are equally available for all troops, and that the sublimest philanthropist, if he does not appreciate this, is unfit to command them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>Another childlike attribute in these men, which is less agreeable, is a sort of blunt insensibility to giving physical pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>If they are cruel to animals, for instance, it always reminds me of children pulling off flies' legs, in a sort of pitiless, untaught, experimental way. Yet I should not fear any wanton outrage from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>After all their wrongs, they are not really revengeful; and I would far rather enter a captured city with them than with white troops, for they would be more subordinate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>But for mere physical suffering they would have no fine sympathies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>The cruel things they have seen and undergone have helped to blunt them; and if I ordered them to put to death a dozen prisoners, I think they would do it without remonstrance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>Yet their religious spirit grows more beautiful to me in living longer with them; it is certainly far more so than at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, when it seemed rather a matter of phrase and habit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>It influences them both on the negative and the positive side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>That is, it cultivates the feminine virtues <pb id="p.54" n="54"/> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>,--makes them patient, meek, resigned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>This is very evident in the hospital; there is nothing of the restless, defiant habit of white invalids.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>Perhaps, if they had more of this, they would resist disease better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>Imbued from childhood with the habit of submission, drinking in through every pore that other-world trust which is the <num value="1">one</num> spirit of their songs, they can endure everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>This I expected; but I am relieved to find that their religion strengthens them on the positive side also,--gives zeal, energy, daring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>They could easily be made fanatics, if I chose; but I do not choose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>Their whole mood is essentially Mohammedan, perhaps, in its strength and its weakness; and I feel the same degree of sympathy that I should if I had a Turkish command,--that is, a sort of sympathetic admiration, not tending towards agreement, but towards co-operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>Their philosophizing is often the highest form of mysticism.; and our dear surgeon declares that they are all natural transcendentalists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>The white camps seem rough and secular, after this; and I hear our men talk about <quote>a religious army,</quote> <quote>a Gospel army,</quote> in their prayer-meetings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>They are certainly evangelizing the chaplain, who was rather a heretic at the beginning; at least, this is his own admission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>We have recruits on their way from <placeName key="tgn,7014435" n="1.000 5" reg="saint augustine, saint johns, florida">St. Augustine</placeName>, where the negroes are chiefly Roman Catholics; and it will be interesting to see how their type of character combines with that elder creed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>It is time for rest; and I have just looked out into the night, where the eternal stars shut down, in concave protection, over the yet glimmering camp, and <persName n="Orion,,,,," id="n0021.0002.00054.00100" reg="mostcommon:Orion,nomatch:0"><surname>Orion</surname></persName> hangs above my tent-door, giving to me the sense of strength .and assurance which these simple children obtain from their <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n0021.0002.00054.00101" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName> and the <name>Prophets</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>In speaking of the military qualities of the blacks, I should add, that the only point where I am disappointed is <num value="1">one</num> I have never seen raised by the most incredulous newspaper critics,--namely, their physical condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>To be sure they often look magnificently to my gymnasium-trained eye; and I always like to observe them when bathing,--such splendid muscular development, set off by that smooth coating of adipose tissue which makes them, like the <rs>South-Sea Islanders</rs>, appear even more muscular than they are. Their skins are also of finer grain than those of whites, the surgeons say, and certainly are smoother and far more free from hair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>But their weakness is pulmonary; pneumonia and pleurisy are their besetting ailments; they are easily made ill, and easily cured, if promptly treated: childish organizations again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>Guard-duty injures them more than whites, apparently; and double-quick movements, in choking dust, set them coughing badly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>But then it is to be remembered <pb id="p.56" n="56"/> that this is their sickly season, from <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> to <dateStruct><month>March</month></dateStruct>, and that their healthy season will come in summer, when the whites break down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>Still my conviction of the physical superiority of more highly civilized races is strengthened on the whole, not weakened, by observing them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>As to availability for military drill and duty in other respects, the only question I ever hear debated among the officers is, whether they are equal or superior to whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>I have never heard it suggested that they were inferior, although I expected frequently to hear such complaints from hasty or unsuccessful officers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>Of <num value="1">one</num> thing I am sure, that their best qualities will be wasted by merely keeping them for garrison duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>They seem peculiarly fitted for offensive operations, and especially for partisan warfare; they have so much dash and such abundant resources, combined with such an Indian-like knowledge of the country and its ways. . These traits have been often illustrated in expeditions sent after deserters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>For instance, I despatched <num value="1">one</num> of my best lieutenants and my best sergeant with a squad of men to search a certain plantation, where there were <num value="2">two</num> separate negro villages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>They went by night, and the force was divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>The lieutenant took <num value="1">one</num> set of huts, the sergeant the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>Before the lieutenant had reached his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> house, every man in the village was in the woods, innocent and guilty alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>But the, sergeant's mode of operation was thus described by a corporal from a white regiment who happened to be in <num value="1">one</num> of the negro houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>I-e said that not a sound was heard until suddenly a red leg appeared in the open doorway, and a voice outside said, <quote>Rally.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>Going to the door, he observed a similar pair of red legs before every hut, and not a person was allowed to go out, until the quarters had been thoroughly <pb id="p.57" n="57"/> searched, and the <num value="3">three</num> deserters found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>This was managed by <persName n="Rivers,Sergeant,Prince,,," id="n0021.0002.00057.00102" reg="default:Rivers,Prince,,,"><roleName n="Sergeant">Sergeant</roleName> <foreName>Prince</foreName> <surname>Rivers</surname></persName>, our color-sergeant, who is provost-sergeant also, and has entire charge of the prisoners and of the daily policing of the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>He was a sergeant in the old <quote><persName n="Hunter,,,,," id="n0021.0002.00057.00104" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><surname>Hunter</surname></persName> regiment,</quote> and was taken by <persName n="Hunter,General,,,," id="n0021.0002.00057.00105" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName> to New York last spring, where the <term>chevrons</term> on his arm brought a mob upon him in <placeName key="tgn,2110813" n="1.000 2" reg="broadway, rockingham, virginia">Broadway</placeName>, whom he kept off till the police interfered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>There is not a white officer in this regiment who has more administrative ability, or more absolute authority over the men; they do not love him, but his mere presence has controlling power over them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>It was our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> review, and I dare say we did tolerably; but of course it seemed to me that the men never appeared so ill before,--just as <num value="1">one</num> always thinks a party at <num value="1">one</num>'s own house a failure, even if the guests seem to enjoy it, because <num value="1">one</num> is so keenly sensitive to <pb id="p.61" n="61"/> every little thing that goes wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>Not yet grounded even in the spelling book, his modes of thought were nevertheless strong, lucid, and accurate; and he yearned and pined for intellectual companionship beyond all ignorant men whom I have ever met.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>His comprehension of the whole problem of Slavery was more thorough and far-reaching than that of any Abolitionist, so far as its social and military aspects went; in that direction I could teach him nothing, and he taught me much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>But it was his methods of thought which always impressed me chiefly: superficial brilliancy he left to others, and grasped at the solid truth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>Of course his interest in the war and in the regiment was unbounded; he did not take to drill with especial readiness, but he was insatiable of it, and grudged every moment of relaxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>Indeed, he never had any such moments; his mind was at work all the time, even when <pb id="p.63" n="63"/> he was singing hymns, of which he had endless store. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>He was not, however, <num value="1">one</num> of our leading religionists, but his moral code was solid and reliable, like his mental processes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>Ignorant as he was, the <quote>years that bring the philosophic mind</quote> had yet been his, and most of my young officers seemed boys beside him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>Such were the quaint complaints, which I heard with joy. Looking over my note-books of that period, I find them filled with topographical memoranda, jotted down by a flickering candle, from the evening talk of the men,--notes of vulnerable points along the coast, charts of rivers, locations of pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>I prized these conversations not more for what I thus learned of the country than for what I learned of the men. <num value="1">One</num> could thus measure their various degrees of accuracy and their average military instinct; and I must say that in every respect, save the accurate estimate of distances, they stood the test well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>The best peg on which to hang an expedition in the <orgName>Department of the South</orgName>, in those days, was the promise of lumber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>There was reported to be plenty in the enemy's country, but somehow the colored soldiers were the only ones who had been lucky enough to obtain any, thus far, and the supply brought in by our men, after flooring the tents of the white regiments and our own, was running low.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>This made the crowning charm of his suggestion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>But there is never any danger of erring on the side of secrecy, in a military department; and I resolved to avoid all undue publicity for our plans, by not finally deciding on any until we should get outside the bar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>From boyhood I have had a fancy for boats, and have seldom been without a share, usually more or less fractional, in a rather indeterminate number of punts and wherries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>The thing really desirable appeared to be to get them under fire as soon as possible, and to teach them, by a few small successes, the application of what they had learned in camp. </p>

The plan was to go by night, surround the house and negro cabins at the landing (to prevent an alarm from being given), then to take the side path, and if all went well, to surprise the camp; but if they got notice of our approach, through their pickets, we should, at worst, have a fight, in which the best man must win. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>The moon was bright, and the river swift, but easy of navigation thus far. Just below Township I landed a small advance force, to surround the houses silently. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>While he hunted up this valuable auxiliary, I mustered my detachment, winnowing out the men who had coughs (not a few), and sending them ignominiously on board again: a process I had regularly to perform, during this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> season of catarrh, on all occasions where quiet was needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>The only exception tolerated at this time was in the case of <num value="1">one</num> man who offered a solemn pledge, that, if unable to restrain his cough, he would lie down on the ground, scrape a little hole, and cough into it unheard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>It was after <time value="12am">midnight</time> when we set off upon our excursion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>I had about a <num value="100">hundred</num> men, marching by the flank, with a small advanced guard, and also a few flankers, where the ground permitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>We marched on through the woods, with no sound but the peeping of the frogs in a neighboring marsh, and the occasional yelping of a dog, as we passed the hut of some <quote>cracker.</quote>

<p>We had halted once or twice to close up the ranks, and had marched some <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>, seeing and hearing nothing more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>I had got all I could out of our new guide, and was striding on, rapt in pleasing contemplation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>All had gone so smoothly that I had merely to fancy the rest as being equally smooth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>Already I fancied our little detachment bursting out of the woods, in swift surprise, upon the <rs>Rebel</rs> quarters,--already the opposing commander, after hastily firing a charge or <num value="2">two</num> from his revolver (of course above my head), had yielded at discretion, and was gracefully tendering, in a stage attitude, his unavailing sword,--when suddenly There was a trampling of feet among the advanced guard as they came confusedly to a halt, and almost at the same instant a more ominous sound, as of galloping horses in the path before us. The moonlight outside the woods gave that dimness of atmosphere within which is more bewildering than darkness, because the eyes cannot adapt themselves to it so well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>Yet I fancied, and others aver, that they saw the leader of an approaching party mounted on a white horse and reining up in the pathway; others, again, declare that he drew a pistol from the holster and took aim; others beard the words, <quote>Charge in upon them!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>Surround them!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>But all this was confused by the opening rifle-shots of our advanced guard, and, as clear observation was impossible, I made the men fix their bayonets and kneel in the cover on each side the pathway, and I saw with delight the brave fellows, with <persName n="Mcintyre,Sergeant,,,," id="n0021.0003.00072.00146" reg="mostcommon:Mcintyre,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Sergeant">Sergeant</roleName> <surname>Mcintyre</surname></persName> at their head, settling down in the grass as coolly and warily as if wild turkeys were the only game.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>Perhaps at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot a man fell at my elbow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>I felt it no more than if a tree had fallen,--I was so busy watching my own men and the enemy, and <pb id="p.73" n="73"/> planning what to do next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>Some of our soldiers, misunderstanding the order, <quote>Fix bayonets,</quote> were actually <hi rend="italics">charging</hi> with them, dashing off into the dim woods, with nothing to charge at but the vanishing tail of an imaginary horse,--for we could really see nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>This zeal I noted with pleasure, and also with anxiety, as our greatest danger was from confusion and scattering; and for infantry to pursue cavalry would be a novel enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/><persName n="Metcalf,Captain,,,," id="n0021.0003.00073.00147" reg="mostcommon:Metcalf,L.,W.,,:2"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Metcalf</surname></persName> stood by me well in keeping the men steady, as did <persName n="Minor,Assistant-Surgeon,,,," id="n0021.0003.00073.00148" reg="mostcommon:Minor,Thomas,T.,,:2"><roleName n="Assistant-Surgeon">Assistant Surgeon</roleName> <surname>Minor</surname></persName>, and <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs>, now <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0021.0003.00073.00149" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,A.,W.,,:3"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>How the men in the rear were behaving I could not tell,--not so coolly, I afterwards found, because they were more entirely bewildered, supposing, until the shots came, that the column had simply halted for a moment's rest, as had been done once or twice before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>They did not know who or where their assailants might be, and the fall of the man beside me created a hasty rumor that I was killed, so that it was on the whole an alarming experience for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>They kept together very tolerably, however, while our assailants, dividing, rode along on each side through the open pinebarren, firing into our ranks, but mostly over the heads of the men. My soldiers in turn fired rapidly,--too rapidly, being yet beginners,--and it was evident that, dim as it was, both sides had opportunity to do some execution. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>I could hardly tell whether the fight had lasted <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> or an hour, when, as the enemy's fire had evidently ceased or slackened, I gave the order to cease firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>But it was very difficult at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to make them desist: the taste of gunpowder was too intoxicating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>Every incidental occurrence seemed somehow to engrave itself upon my perceptions, without interrupting the main course of thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>Thus I know, that, in <num value="1">one</num> of the pauses of the affair, there came wailing through the woods a cracked female voice, as if calling back some stray husband who had run out to join in the affray, <quote><persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>, <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>, are you going to leave me, <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>Are you going to let me and the children be killed, <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>I suppose the poor thing's fears of gunpowder were very genuine; but it was such a wailing squeak, and so infinitely ludicrous, and <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> was probably ensconced so very safely in some hollow tree, that I could see some of the men showing all their white teeth in the very midst of the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>But soon this sound, with all others, had ceased, and left us in peaceful possession of the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>I have made the more of this little affair because it was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stand &mdash; up fight in which my men had been engaged, though they had been under fire, in an irregular way, in their small early expeditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>To me personally the event was of the greatest value: it had given us all an opportunity to test each other, and our abstract surmises were changed into positive knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>Hereafter it was of small importance what nonsense might be talked or written about colored troops; so long as mine did not flinch, it made no difference to me. My brave young officers, themselves mostly new to danger, viewed the matter much as I did; and yet we were under bonds of life and death to form a correct opinion, which was more than could be said of the <rs>Northern</rs> editors, and our verdict was proportionately of greater value. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>I was convinced from appearances that we had been victorious, so far, though I could not suppose that this <pb id="p.75" n="75"/> would be the last of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>All my impulses said the same thing; but then I had the most explicit injunctions from <persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0021.0003.00075.00151" reg="nearbymention:Saxton,R.,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName> to risk as little as possible in this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> enterprise, because of the fatal effect on public sentiment of even an honorable defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>We had now an honorable victory, so far as it went; the officers and men around me were in good spirits, but the rest of the column might be nervous; and it seemed so important to make the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fight an entire success, that I thought it wiser to let well alone; nor have I ever changed this opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>For <num value="1">one</num>'s self, <placeName reg="Montrose, Susquehanna, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2090898">Montrose</placeName>'s verse may be well applied, <quote>To win or lose it all.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>If my raw infantry force had stood unflinchingly a night-surprise from <quote>de hoss cavalry,</quote> as they reverentially termed them, I felt that a good beginning had been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>All hope of surprising the enemy's camp was now at an end; I was willing and ready to fight the cavalry over again, but it seemed wiser that we, not they, should select the ground. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>This not occurring, I was more than ever satisfied that we had won <pb id="p.76" n="76"/> a victory; for it was obvious that a mounted force would not allow a detachment of infantry to march <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> through open woods by night without renewing the fight, unless they themselves had suffered a good deal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>On arrival at the landing, seeing that there was to be no immediate affray, I sent most of the men on board, and called for volunteers to remain on shore with me and hold the plantation-house till morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>Yet another soldier did not report himself at all, but remained all night on guard, and possibly I should not have known of his having had a buck-shot in his shoulder, if some duty requiring a sound shoulder had not been required of him to-day.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>This last, it may be added, had persuaded a comrade to dig out the buckshot, for fear of being ordered on the sick-list.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>The anxious night having passed away without an attack, another problem opened with the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, my officers and men found themselves in possession of an enemy's abode; and though there was but little temptation to plunder, I knew that I must here begin to draw the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>I had long since resolved to prohibit absolutely all indiscriminate pilfering and wanton outrage, and to allow nothing to be taken or destroyed but by proper authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>The men, to my great satisfaction, entered into this view at once, and so did (perhaps a shade less readily, in some cases) the officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>The <pb id="p.78" n="78"/> greatest trouble was with the steamboat hands, and I resolved to let them go ashore as little as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>Most articles of furniture were already, however, before our visit, gone from the plantation-house, which was now used only as a picket-station.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>The only valuable article was a piano-forte, for which a regular packing-box lay invitingly ready outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>I had made up my mind, in accordance with the orders given to naval commanders in that department,<note anchored="yes" id="n.78.1">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>This I mention because it was the only article of property I ever took, or knowingly suffered to be taken, in the enemy's country, save for legitimate military uses, from <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to last; nor would I have taken this, but for the thought of the school, and, as aforesaid, the temptation of the box.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>I think the zest with which the men finally set fire to the house at my order was enhanced by this previous abstemiousness; but there is a fearful fascination in the <pb id="p.79" n="79"/> use of fire, which every child knows in the abstract, and which I found to hold true in the practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>On our way down river we had opportunity to test this again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>The ruined town of <placeName reg="Saint Mary's, Ontario" key="tgn,1015083">St. Mary's</placeName> had at that time a bad reputation, among both naval and military men. Lying but a short distance above <placeName key="tgn,2019279" n="1.000 62" reg="fernandina, nassau, florida">Fernandina</placeName>, on the <rs>Georgia</rs> side, it was occasionally visited by our gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>I was informed that the only residents of the town were <num value="3">three</num> old women, who were apparently kept there as spies,that, on our approach, the aged crones would come out and wave white handkerchiefs,--that they would receive us hospitably, profess to be profoundly loyal, and exhibit a portrait of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0021.0003.00079.00161" reg="mostcommon:Washington,William,,,:2"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>,--that they would solemnly assure us that no Rebel pickets had been there for many weeks,--but that in the adjoining yard we should find fresh horse-tracks, and that we should be fired upon by guerillas the moment we left the wharf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>My officers had been much excited by these tales; and I had assured them that, if this programme were literally carried out, we would straightway return and burn the town, or what was left of it, for our share.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>It was essential to show my officers and men that, while rigid against irregular outrage, we could still be inexorable against the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>We had previously planned to stop at this town, on our way down river, for some valuable lumber which we had espied on a wharf; and gliding down the swift current, shelling a few bluffs as we passed, we soon reached it. Punctual as the figures in a panorama appeared the old ladies with their white handkerchiefs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>Taking possession of the town, much of which had previously been destroyed by the gunboats, and stationing the <orgName n="Color Guard" type="guard">color-guard</orgName>, to their infinite delight, in the cupola of the most conspicuous house, I deployed skirmishers along the exposed <pb id="p.80" n="80"/> suburb, and set a detail of men at work on the lumber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>After a stately and decorous interview with the queens of society of St. Mary's,--is it <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n0021.0003.00080.00162" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><surname>Scott</surname></persName> who says that nothing improves the manners like piracy?-I peacefully withdrew the men when the work was done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>There were faces of disappointment among the officers,--for all felt a spirit of mischief after the last night's adventure,--when, just as we had fairly swung out into the stream and were under way, there came, like the sudden burst of a tropical tornado, a regular little hail-storm of bullets into the open end of the boat, driving every gunner in an instant from his post, and surprising even those who were looking to be surprised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>The shock was but for a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>; and though the bullets had pattered precisely like the sound of hail upon the iron cannon, yet nobody was hurt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>With very respectable promptness, order was restored, our own shells were flying into the woods from which the attack proceeded, and we were steaming up to the wharf again, according to promise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>Who shall describe the theatrical attitudes assumed by the old ladies as they reappeared at the front-door,being luckily out of direct range,--and set the handkerchiefs in wilder motion than ever?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>They brandished them, they twirled them after the manner of the domestic mop, they clasped their hands, handkerchiefs included.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>Meanwhile their friends in the wood popped away steadily at us, with small effect; and occasionally an invisible field-piece thundered feebly from another quarter, with equally invisible results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>Reaching the wharf, <num value="1">one</num> company, under <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs> (now <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>) <persName n="Danilson,,,,," id="n0021.0003.00080.00163" reg="mostcommon:Danilson,William,H.,,:3"><surname>Danilson</surname></persName>, was promptly deployed in search of our assailants, who soon grew silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>Not so the old ladies, when I announced to them my purpose, and added, with extreme regret, that, <pb id="p.81" n="81"/> as the wind was high, I should burn only that half of the town which lay to leeward of their house, which did not, after all, amount to much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>Between gratitude for this degree of mercy, and imploring appeals for greater, the treacherous old ladies manoeuvred with clasped hands and demonstrative handkerchiefs around me, impairing the effect of their eloquence by constantly addressing me as <quote><persName n="Captain,Mister,,,," id="n0021.0003.00081.00164" reg="mostcommon:Captain,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Captain</surname></persName></quote> ; for I have observed, that, while the sternest officer is greatly propitiated by attributing to him a rank a little higher than his own, yet no <num value="1">one</num> is ever mollified by an error in the opposite direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>I tried, however, to disregard such low considerations, and to strike the correct mean between the sublime patriot and the unsanctified incendiary, while I could find no refuge from weak contrition save in greater and greater depths of courtesy; and so melodramatic became our interview that some of the soldiers still maintain that <quote>dem dar ole Secesh women been a-gwine for kiss de Cunnel,</quote> before we ended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>But of this monstrous accusation I wish to register an explicit denial, once for all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>Dropping down to <placeName key="tgn,2019279" n="1.000 62" reg="fernandina, nassau, florida">Fernandina</placeName> unmolested after this affair, we were kindly received by the military and naval commanders,--<persName n="Hawley,Colonel,,,," id="n0021.0003.00081.00165" reg="mostcommon:Hawley,J.,R.,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Hawley</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="CT7">Seventh Connecticut</orgName> (now <persName n="Hawley,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n0021.0003.00081.00166" reg="mostcommon:Hawley,J.,R.,,:1"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Hawley</surname></persName>), and <persName n="Hughes,Lieutenant-Commander,,,," id="n0021.0003.00081.00167" reg="mostcommon:Hughes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Commander">Lieutenant- Commander</roleName> <surname>Hughes</surname></persName>, of the <term type="ship">gunboat</term> <rs type="ship">Mohawk</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>It turned out very opportunely that both of these officers had special errands to suggest still farther up the <rs>St. Mary</rs>'s, and precisely in the region where I wished to go. <persName n="Hawley,Colonel,,,," id="n0021.0003.00081.00168" reg="mostcommon:Hawley,J.,R.,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Hawley</surname></persName> showed me a letter from the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, requesting him to ascertain the possibility of obtaining a supply of brick for <placeName key="tgn,1006261" n="1.000 4" reg="amelia island, nassau, florida">Fort Clinch</placeName> from the brickyard which had furnished the original materials, but which had not been visited since the perilous river-trip of the <rs>Ottawa</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>I jumped at the opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>Berosa and brickyard,--both were near <placeName reg="Woodstock, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,2115141">Woodstock</placeName>, the former home of <persName n="Sutton,Corporal,,,," id="n0021.0003.00082.00170" reg="nearbymention:Sutton,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Corporal">Corporal</roleName> <surname>Sutton</surname></persName>; he was ready and eager to pilot us up the river; the moon would be just right that evening, setting at 3h. 19m. A. M.; and our boat was precisely the <num value="1">one</num> to undertake the expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>Its double-headed shape was just what was needed in that swift and crooked stream; the exposed pilot-houses had been tolerably barricaded with the thick planks from <placeName key="tgn,1035531" n="1.000 10" reg="Saint Simon,Aisne,Picardie,France,Europe">St. Simon</placeName>'s; and we further obtained some sand-bags from <placeName key="tgn,1006261" n="1.000 4" reg="amelia island, nassau, florida">Fort Clinch</placeName>, through the aid of <persName n="Sears,Captain,,,," id="n0021.0003.00082.00171" reg="mostcommon:Sears,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Sears</surname></persName>, the officer in charge, who had originally suggested the expedition after brick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>In return for this aid, the <rs>Planter</rs> was sent back to the wharf at St. Mary's, to bring away a considerable supply of the same precious article, which we had observed near the wharf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>Meanwhile the <rs>John Adams</rs> was coaling from naval supplies, through the kindness of <persName n="Hughes,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0021.0003.00082.00172" reg="mostcommon:Hughes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Hughes</surname></persName>; and the <rs>Ben De Ford</rs> was taking in the <name>Jumber</name> which we had yesterday brought down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>It was a great disappointment to be unable to take the latter vessel up the river; but I was unwillingly convinced that, though the depth of water might be sufficient, yet her length would be unmanageable in the swift current and sharp turns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>The Planter must also be sent on a separate cruise, as her weak and disabled machinery made her useless for my purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/><num value="200">Two hundred</num> men were therefore transferred, as before, to the narrow hold of the <rs>John Adams</rs>, in addition to the company permanently stationed on board to work the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/><pb id="p.83" n="83"/> </p> 
<p>Never shall I forget the mystery and excitement of that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>I know nothing in life more fascinating than the nocturnal ascent of an unknown river, leading far into an enemy's country, where <num value="1">one</num> glides in the dim moonlight between dark hills and meadows, each turn of the channel making it seem like an inland lake, and cutting you off as by a barrier from all behind,--with no sign of human life, but an occasional picket-fire left glimmering beneath the bank, or the yelp of a dog from some low-lying plantation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>On such occasions every nerve is strained to its utmost tension; all dreams of romance appear to promise immediate fulfilment; all lights on board the vessel are obscured, loud voices are hushed; you fancy a <num value="1000">thousand</num> men on shore, and yet see nothing; the lonely river, unaccustomed to furrowing keels, lapses by the vessel with a treacherous sound; and all the senses are merged in a sort of anxious trance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/><num value="3">Three</num> times I have had in full perfection this fascinating experience; but that night was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and its zest was the keenest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>It will come back to me in dreams, if I live a <measure n="1000years" type="date">thousand years</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>I feared no attack during our ascent,--that danger was for our return; but I feared the intricate navigation of the river, though I did not fully know, till the actual experience, how dangerous it was. We passed without trouble far above the scene of our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fight,--the <name>Battle</name> of the <rs type="place">Hundred Pines</rs>, as my officers had baptized it; and ever, as we ascended, the banks grew steeper, the current swifter, the channel more tortuous and more encumbered with projecting branches and drifting wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>No piloting less skilful than that of <persName n="Sutton,Corporal,,,," id="n0021.0003.00083.00173" reg="nearbymention:Sutton,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Corporal">Corporal</roleName> <surname>Sutton</surname></persName> and his mate, <persName n="Bezzard,,James,,," id="n0021.0003.00083.00174" reg="default:Bezzard,James,,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <surname>Bezzard</surname></persName>, could have carried us through, I thought; and no side-wheel steamer less strong than a <pb id="p.84" n="84"/> ferry-boat could have borne the crash and force with which we struck the wooded banks of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>But the powerful paddles, built to break the <rs>Northern</rs> ice, could crush the <rs>Southern</rs> pine as well; and we came safely out of entanglements that at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> seemed formidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>We had the tide with us, which makes steering far more difficult; and, in the sharp angles of the river, there was often no resource but to run the bow boldly on shore, let the stern swing round, and then reverse the motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>As the reversing machinery was generally out of order, the engineer stupid or frightened, and the captain excited, this involved moments of tolerably concentrated anxiety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/><num value="8">Eight</num> times we grounded in the upper waters, and once lay aground for half an hour; but at last we dropped anchor before the little town of <placeName reg="Woodstock, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,2115141">Woodstock</placeName>, after moonset and an hour before daybreak, just as I had planned, and so quietly that scarcely a dog barked, and not a soul in the town, as we afterwards found, knew of our arrival. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>As silently as possible, the great flat-boat which we had brought from <placeName key="tgn,1035531" n="1.000 10" reg="Saint Simon,Aisne,Picardie,France,Europe">St. Simon</placeName>'s was filled with men. <persName n="Strong,Major,,,," id="n0021.0003.00084.00175" reg="mostcommon:Strong,John,D.,,:3"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Strong</surname></persName> was sent on shore with <num value="2">two</num> companies,--those of <persName n="James,Captain,,,," id="n0021.0003.00084.00176" reg="mostcommon:James,William,,,:2"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>James</surname></persName> and <persName n="Metcalf,Captain,,,," id="n0021.0003.00084.00177" reg="mostcommon:Metcalf,L.,W.,,:2"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Metcalf</surname></persName>,--with instructions to surround the town quietly, allow no <num value="1">one</num> to leave it, molest no <num value="1">one</num>, and hold as temporary prisoners every man whom he found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>I watched them push off into the darkness, got the remaining force ready to land, and then paced the deck for an hour in silent watchfulness, waiting for rifle-shots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>Not a sound came from the shore, save the barking of dogs and the morning crow of cocks; the time seemed interminable; but when daylight came, I landed, and found a pair of scarlet trousers pacing on their beat before every house in the village, and a small squad of prisoners, stunted and forlorn as <persName n="Falstaff,,,,," id="n0021.0003.00084.00178" reg="mostcommon:Falstaff,nomatch:0"><surname>Falstaff</surname></persName>'s ragged <pb id="p.85" n="85"/> regiment, already in hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>I observed with delight the good demeanor of my men towards these forlorn Anglo-Saxons, and towards the more tumultuous women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>Even <num value="1">one</num> soldier, who threatened to throw an old termagant into the river, took care to append the courteous epithet <quote><rs type="role2">Madam</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/></p> 
<p>I took a survey of the premises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>The chief house, a pretty <num value="1">one</num> with picturesque out-buildings, was that of <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> A., who owned the mills and lumber-wharves adjoining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>The wealth of these wharves had not been exaggerated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>There was lumber enough to freight half a dozen steamers, and I half regretted that I had agreed to take down a freight of bricks instead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>Further researches made me grateful that I had already explained to my men the difference between public foraging and private plunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>Along the river-bank I found building after building crowded with costly furniture, all neatly packed, just as it was sent up from St. Mary's when that town was abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>Pianos were a drug; china, <rs n="glass ware" type="product">glass-ware</rs>, mahogany, pictures, all were here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>And here were my men, who knew that their own labor had earned for their masters these luxuries, or such as these; their own wives and children were still sleeping on the floor, perhaps, at <placeName reg="Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013364">Beaufort</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,2019279" n="1.000 62" reg="fernandina, nassau, florida">Fernandina</placeName>; and yet they submitted, almost without a murmur, to the enforced abstinence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>Bed and bedding for our hospitals they might take from those store-rooms,--such as the surgeon selected,--also an old flag which we found in a corner, and an old field-piece (which the regiment still possesses),--but after this the doors were closed and left unmolested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>It cost a struggle to some of the men, whose wives were destitute, I know; but their pride was very easily touched, and when this abstinence was once recognized as a rule, <pb id="p.86" n="86"/> they claimed it as an honor, in this and all succeeding expeditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>I flatter myself that, if they had once been set upon wholesale plundering, they would have done it as thoroughly as their betters; but I have always been infinitely grateful, both for the credit and for the discipline of the regiment,--as well as for the men's subsequent lives,--that the opposite method was adopted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>When the morning was a little advanced, I called on <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> A., who received me in quite a stately way at her own door with <quote>To what am I indebted for the honor of this visit, Sir?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>The foreign name of the family, and the tropical look of the buildings, made it seem (as, indeed, did all the rest of the adventure) like a chapter out of <quote><persName n="Leigh,,Amyas,,," id="n0021.0003.00086.00179" reg="default:Leigh,Amyas,,,"><foreName>Amyas</foreName> <surname>Leigh</surname></persName></quote> ; but as I had happened to hear that the lady herself was a Philadelphian, and her deceased husband a <orgName n="New Yorker" type="newspaper">New-Yorker</orgName>, I could not feel even that modicum of reverence due to sincere Southerners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>However, I wished to present my credentials; so, calling up my companion, I said that I believed she had been previously acquainted with <persName n="Sutton,Corporal,Robert,,," id="n0021.0003.00086.00180" reg="default:Sutton,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Corporal">Corporal</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName> <surname>Sutton</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>I never saw a finer bit of unutterable indignation than came over the face of my hostess, as she slowly recognized him. She drew herself up, and dropped out the monosyllables of her answer as if they were so many drops of nitric acid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/><quote>Ah,</quote> quoth my lady, <quote><hi rend="italics">we</hi> called him <persName><foreName>Bob</foreName></persName>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/></p> 
<p>It was a group for a painter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>The whole drama of the war seemed to reverse itself in an instant, and my tall, well-dressed, imposing, philosophic Corporal dropped down the immeasurable depth into a mere plantation <quote><persName><foreName>Bob</foreName></persName></quote> again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>So at least in my imagination; not to that person himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>Too essentially dignified in his nature to be moved by words where substantial realities were in question, he simply turned from the lady, touched <pb id="p.87" n="87"/> his hat to me, and asked if I would wish to see the slave-jail, as he had the keys in his possession. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>If he fancied that I was in danger of being overcome by blandishments, and needed to be recalled to realities, it was a master-stroke. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>I must say that, when the door of that villanous edifice was thrown open before me, I felt glad that my main interview with its lady proprietor had passed before I saw it. It was a small building, like a Northern corn-barn, and seemed to have as prominent and as legitimate a place among the outbuildings of the establishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>In the middle of the door was a large staple with a rusty chain, like an ox-chain, for fastening a victim down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>When the door had been opened after the death of the late proprietor, my informant said, a man was found padlocked in that chain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>We found also <num value="3">three</num> pairs of stocks of various construction, <num value="2">two</num> of which had smaller as well as larger holes, evidently for the feet of women or children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>In a building near by we found something far more complicated, which was perfectly unintelligible till the men explained all its parts: a machine so contrived that a person once imprisoned in it could neither sit, stand, nor lie, but must support the body half raised, in a position scarcely endurable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>I have since bitterly reproached myself for leaving this piece of ingenuity behind; but it would have cost much labor to remove it, and to bring away the other trophies seemed then enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>I remember the unutterable loathing with which I leaned against the door of that prison-house; I had thought myself seasoned to any conceivable horrors of Slavery, but it seemed as if the visible presence of that den of sin would choke me. Of course it would have been burned to the ground by us, but that this would have involved the sacrifice of <pb id="p.88" n="88"/> every other building and all the piles of lumber, and for the moment it seemed as if the sacrifice would be righteous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>But I forbore, and only took as trophies the instruments of torture and the keys of the jail. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>We found but few colored people in this vicinity; some we brought away with us, and an old man and woman preferred to remain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>All the white males whom we found I took as hostages, in order to shield us, if possible, from attack on our way down river, explaining to them that they would be put on shore when the dangerous points were passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>I knew that their wives could easily send notice of this fact to the <rs>Rebel</rs> forces along the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>My hostages were a forlorn-looking set of <quote>crackers,</quote> far inferior to our soldiers in <hi rend="italics">physique</hi>, and yet quite equal, the latter declared, to the average material of the <rs>Southern</rs> armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>None were in uniform, but this proved nothing as to their being soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/><num value="1">One</num> of them, a mere boy, was captured at his own door, with gun in hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>It was a fowling-piece, which he used only, as his mother plaintively assured me, <quote>to shoot little birds with.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>As the guileless youth had for this purpose loaded the gun with <num value="18">eighteen</num> buck-shot, we thought it justifiable to confiscate both the weapon and the owner, in mercy to the birds. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>We took from this place, for the use of the army, a flock of some <num value="30">thirty</num> sheep, <num value="40">forty</num> bushels of rice, some other provisions, tools, oars, and a little lumber, leaving all possible space for the bricks which we expected to obtain just below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>I should have gone farther up the river, but for a dangerous boom which kept back a great number of logs in a large brook that here fell into the <rs>St. Mary</rs>'s; the stream ran with force, and if the <rs>Rebels</rs> had wit enough to do it, they might in <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> so <pb id="p.89" n="89"/> choke the river with drift-wood as infinitely to enhance our troubles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>So we dropped down stream a mile or <num value="2">two</num>, found the very brickyard from which <placeName key="tgn,1006261" n="1.000 4" reg="amelia island, nassau, florida">Fort Clinch</placeName> had been constructed,--still stored with bricks, and seemingly unprotected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>Here <persName n="Rivers,Sergeant,,,," id="n0021.0003.00089.00181" reg="mostcommon:Rivers,Prince,,,:3"><roleName n="Sergeant">Sergeant</roleName> <surname>Rivers</surname></persName> again planted his standard, and the men toiled eagerly, for several hours, in loading our boat to the utmost with the bricks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>Meanwhile we questioned <rs type="color">black</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs> witnesses, and learned for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time that the <rs>Rebels</rs> admitted a repulse at <placeName reg="Township Landing">Township Landing</placeName>, and that <persName n="Jones,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0021.0003.00089.00182" reg="mostcommon:Jones,Paul,,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName> and <num value="10">ten</num> of their number were killed,though this I fancy to have been an exaggeration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>They also declared that the mysterious <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Berosa</rs> was lying at the head of the river, but was a broken-down and worthless affair, and would never get to sea. The result has since proved this; for the vessel subsequently ran the blockade and foundered near shore, the crew barely escaping with their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>I had the pleasure, as it happened, of being the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> person to forward this information to <persName n="Dupont,Admiral,,,," id="n0021.0003.00089.00183" reg="nearbymention:Dupont,S.,F.,,"><roleName n="Admiral">Admiral</roleName> <surname>Dupont</surname></persName>, when it came through the pickets, many months after,--thus concluding my report on the <rs>Berosa</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>Before the work at the yard was over the pickets reported mounted men in the woods near by, as had previously been the report at <placeName reg="Woodstock, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,2115141">Woodstock</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>This admonished us to lose no time; and as we left the wharf, immediate arrangements were made to have the gun-crews all in readiness, and to keep the rest of the men below, since their musketry would be of little use now, and I did not propose to risk a life unnecessarily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>The chief obstacle to this was their own eagerness; penned down on <num value="1">one</num> side, they popped up on the other; their officers, too, were eager to see what was going on, and were almost <pb id="p.90" n="90"/> as hard to cork down as the men. Add to this, that the vessel was now very crowded, and that I had to be chiefly on the hurricane-deck with the pilots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/><persName n="Clifton,Captain,,,," id="n0021.0003.00090.00184" reg="mostcommon:Clifton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Clifton</surname></persName>, master of the vessel, was brave to excess, and as much excited as the men; he could no more be kept in the little pilot-house than they below; and when we had passed <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> bluffs, with no sign of an enemy, he grew more and more irrepressible, and exposed himself conspicuously on the upper deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>Perhaps we all were a little lulled by apparent safety; for myself, I lay down for a moment on a settee in a <rs n="state room" type="product">state-room</rs>, having been on my feet, almost without cessation, for <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>Suddenly there swept down from a bluff above us, on the <rs>Georgia</rs> side, a mingling of shout and roar and rattle as of a tornado let loose; and as a storm of bullets came pelting against the sides of the vessel, and through a window, there went up a shrill answering shout from our own men. It took but an instant for me to reach the gun-deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>After all my efforts the men had swarmed once more from below, and already, crowding at both ends of the boat, were loading and firing with inconceivable rapidity, shouting to each other, <quote>Nebber gib it up!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>and of course having no steady aim, as the vessel glided and whirled in the swift current.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>Meanwhile the officers in charge of the large guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>had their crews in order, and our shells began to fly over the bluffs, which, as we now saw, should have been shelled in advance, only that we had to economize ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>The other soldiers I drove below, almost by main force, with the aid of their officers, who behaved exceedingly well, giving the men leave to fire from the open port-holes which lined the lower deck, almost at the water's level.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>In the very midst of the <foreign lang="fr">melee</foreign> <persName n="Strong,Major,,,," id="n0021.0003.00090.00185" reg="mostcommon:Strong,John,D.,,:3"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Strong</surname></persName> came from the <pb id="p.91" n="91"/> upper deck, with a face of horror, and whispered to me, <quote><persName n="Clifton,Captain,,,," id="n0021.0003.00091.00186" reg="mostcommon:Clifton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Clifton</surname></persName> was killed at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot by my side.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/></p> 
<p>If he had said that the vessel was on fire the shock would hardly have been greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>Of course, the <rs type="role" reg="military-Commander">military commander</rs> on board a steamer is almost as helpless as an unarmed man, so far as the risks of water go. A seaman must command there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>In the hazardous voyage of last night, I had learned, though unjustly, to distrust every official on board the steamboat except this excitable, brave, warm-hearted sailor; and now, among these added dangers, to lose him!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>The responsibility for his life also thrilled me; he was not among my soldiers, and yet he was killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>I thought of his wife and children, of whom he had spoken; but <num value="1">one</num> learns to think rapidly in war, and, cautioning the <rs>Major</rs> to silence, I went up to the hurricane-deck and drew in the helpless body, that it should be safe from further desecration, and then looked to see where we were. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>We were now gliding past a safe reach of marsh, while our assailants were riding by cross-paths to attack us at the next bluff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>It was <placeName reg="Reed's Bluff">Reed's Bluff</placeName> where we were <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attacked, and <placeName reg="Scrubby Bluff">Scrubby Bluff</placeName>, I think, was next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>They were shelled in advance, but swarmed manfully to the banks again as we swept round <num value="1">one</num> of the sharp angles of the stream beneath their fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>My men were now pretty well imprisoned below in the hot and crowded hold, and actually fought each other, the officers afterwards said, for places at the open port-holes, from which to aim. Others implored to be landed, exclaiming that they <quote>supposed de Cunnel knew best,</quote> but it was <quote>mighty mean</quote> to be shut up down below, when they might be <quote>fightin&lsquo; de Secesh <hi rend="italics">in de clar field</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>This clear field, and no favor, was what they thenceforward <pb id="p.92" n="92"/> sighed for. But in such difficult navigation it would have been madness to think of landing, although <num value="1">one</num> daring Rebel actually sprang upon the large boat which we towed astern, where he was shot down by <num value="1">one</num> of our sergeants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>This boat was soon after swamped and abandoned, then taken and repaired by the <rs>Rebels</rs> at a later date, and finally, by a piece of dramatic completeness, was seized by a party of fugitive slaves, who escaped in it to our lines, and some of whom enlisted in my own regiment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>It has always been rather a mystery to me why the <rs>Rebels</rs> did not fell a few trees across the stream at some of the many sharp angles where we might so easily have been thus imprisoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>This, however, they did not attempt, and with the skilful pilotage of our trusty Corporal, --philosophic as <persName n="Socrates,,,,," id="n0021.0003.00092.00187" reg="mostcommon:Socrates,nomatch:0"><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> through all the din, and occasionally relieving his mind by taking a shot with his rifle through the high port-holes of the pilot-house,--we glided safely on. The steamer did not ground once on the descent, and the mate in command, <persName n="Smith,Mister,,,," id="n0021.0003.00092.00188" reg="mostcommon:Smith,Sydney,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, did his duty very well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>The plank sheathing of the pilot-house was penetrated by few bullets, though struck by so many outside that it was visited as a curiosity after our return; and even among the gun-crews, though they had no protection, not a man was hurt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>As we approached some wooded bluff, usually on the <rs>Georgia</rs> side; we could see galloping along the hillside what seemed a regiment of mounted riflemen, and could see our shell scatter them ere we approached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>Shelling did not, however, prevent a rather fierce fusilade from our old friends of <orgName n="company"><persName n="Clark,Captain,,,," id="n0021.0003.00092.00189" reg="mostcommon:Clark,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Clark</surname></persName>'s company</orgName> at <placeName reg="Waaterman's Bluff">Waaterman's Bluff</placeName>, near <placeName reg="Township Landing">Township Landing</placeName>; but even this did no serious damage, and this was the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/><pb id="p.93" n="93"/> </p> 
<p>It was of course impossible, while thus running the gauntlet, to put our hostages ashore, and I could only explain to them that they must thank their own friends for their inevitable detention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>I was by no means proud of their forlorn appearance, and besought <persName n="Hawley,Colonel,,,," id="n0021.0003.00093.00190" reg="mostcommon:Hawley,J.,R.,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Hawley</surname></persName> to take them off my hands; but he was sending no flags of truce at that time, and liked their looks no better than I did. So I took them to <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>, where they were afterwards sent safely across the lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>Our men were pleased at taking them back with us, as they had already said, regretfully, <quote>S'pose we leave dem Secesh at <placeName key="tgn,2019279" n="1.000 62" reg="fernandina, nassau, florida">Fernandina</placeName>, <persName n="Saxby,General,,,," id="n0021.0003.00093.00191" reg="mostcommon:Saxby,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxby</surname></persName> won't see 'em,</quote> --as if they were some new natural curiosity, which indeed they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>But this was rather an ebullition of fancy than a sober proposition. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>The long, low, white buildings, with piazzas and verandas on the waterside; the general impression of heat and lassitude, existence appearing to pulsate only with the sea-breeze; the sandy, almost impassable streets; and the firm, level beach, on which everybody walked who could get there: all these suggested <placeName reg="Jamaica, Queens, New York" key="tgn,7015863">Jamaica</placeName> or the <placeName reg="East Indies" key="tgn,6001831">East Indies</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>The present proposition was to take and hold it with a brigade of less than a <num value="1000">thousand</num> men, carrying, however, arms and uniforms for twice that number, and a month's rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>The claim was, that there were fewer rebel troops in the <name>Department</name> than formerly, and that the <rs>St. Mary</rs>'s expedition had shown the advantage possessed by colored troops, in local knowledge, and in the confidence of the loyal blacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>It was also urged, that it was worth while to risk something, in the effort to hold <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, and perhaps bring it back into the <rs>Union</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>We were now to leave, as we supposed forever, the camp which had thus far been our home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>Our vast amount of surplus baggage made a heavy job in the loading, inasmuch as we had no wharf, and everything had to be put on board by means of flat-boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>Like all officers on blockade duty, they were impatient of their enforced inaction, and gladly seized the opportunity for a different service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>It was some time since they had ascended as high as <placeName reg="Jacksonville, Duval, Florida" key="tgn,7013804">Jacksonville</placeName>, for their orders were strict, <num value="1">one</num> vessel's coal was low, the other was in infirm condition, and there were rumors of cotton-clads and torpedoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>But they gladly agreed to escort us up the river, so soon as our own armed gunboat, the <rs>John Adams</rs>, should arrive,--she being unaccountably delayed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>We waited <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> for her, at the sultry mouth of that glassy river, watching the great pelicans <pb id="p.101" n="101"/> which floated lazily on its tide, or sometimes shooting <num value="1">one</num>, to admire the great pouch, into which <num value="1">one</num> of the soldiers could insert his foot, as into a boot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/><quote>He hold <num value="1">one</num> quart,</quote> said the admiring experimentalist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/><quote>Hi! Boy,</quote> retorted another quickly, <quote>neber you bring dat quart measure in <hi rend="italics">my</hi> peck oa corn.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>The protest came very promptly, and was certainly fair; for the strange receptacle would have held nearly a gallon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>We went on shore, too, and were shown a rather pathetic little garden, which the naval officers had laid out, indulging a dream of vegetables.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>They lingered over the little microscopic sprouts, pointing them out tenderly, as if they were cradled babies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>I have often noticed this touching weakness, in gentlemen of that profession, on lonely stations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>We wandered among the bluffs, too, in the little deserted hamlet once called <quote><placeName reg="Pilottown, Plaquemines, Louisiana" key="tgn,2043739">Pilot town</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>The ever-shifting sand had in some cases almost buried the small houses, and had swept around others a circular drift, at a few yards' distance, over-topping their eaves, and leaving each the untouched citadel of this natural redoubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>There was also a dismantled lighthouse, an object which always seems the most dreary symbol of the barbarism of war, when <num value="1">one</num> considers the national beneficence which reared and kindled it. Despite the service rendered by this once brilliant light, there were many wrecks which had been strown upon the beach, victims of the most formidable of the <rs>Southern</rs> river-bars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>As I stood with my foot on the half-buried ribs of <num value="1">one</num> of these vessels,--so distinctly traced that <num value="1">one</num> might almost fancy them human, --the old pilot, my companion, told me the story of the wreck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>The vessel had formerly been in the <rs>Cuba</rs> trade; and her owner, an American merchant residing in <placeName reg="Montour Falls, Schuyler, New York" key="tgn,2070618">Havana</placeName>, <pb id="p.102" n="102"/> had christened her for his young daughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>I asked the name, and was startled to recognize that of a favorite young cousin of mine, beside the bones of whose representative I was thus strangely standing, upon this lonely shore. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>It was well to have something to relieve the anxiety naturally felt at the delay of the <rs>John Adams</rs>,--anxiety both for her safety and for the success of our enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>The Rebels had repeatedly threatened to burn the whole of <placeName reg="Jacksonville, Duval, Florida" key="tgn,7013804">Jacksonville</placeName>, in case of another attack, as they had previously burned its mills and its great hotel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>It seemed as if the news of our arrival must surely have travelled <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure> by this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>All day we watched every smoke that rose among the wooded hills, and consulted the compass and the map, to see if that sign announced the doom of our expected home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>At the very last moment of the tide, just in time to cross the bar that day, the missing vessel arrived; all anxieties vanished; I transferred my quarters on board, and at <num value="2">two</num> the next morning we steamed up the river. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>Again there was the dreamy delight of ascending an unknown stream, beneath a sinking moon, into a region where peril made fascination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>Since the time of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> explorers, I suppose that those Southern waters have known no sensations so dreamy and so bewitching as those which this war has brought forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>I recall, in this case, the faintest sensations of our voyage, as <persName n="Leon,,Ponce,,,de" id="n0021.0004.00102.00223" reg="expanded:Leon,Ponce,,,"><foreName>Ponce</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Leon</surname></persName> may have recalled those of his wandering search, in the same soft zone, for the secret of the mystic fountain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>I remember how, during that night, I looked for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time through a powerful night-glass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>It had always seemed a thing wholly inconceivable, that a mere lens could change darkness into light; and as I turned <pb id="p.103" n="103"/> the instrument on the preceding gunboat, and actually discerned the man at the wheel and the officers standing about him,--all relapsing into vague gloom again at the withdrawal of the glass,--it gave a feeling of childish delight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>Yet it seemed only in keeping with the whole enchantment of the scene; and had I been some Aladdin, convoyed by genii or giants, I could hardly have felt more wholly a denizen of some world of romance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>But the river was of difficult navigation; and we began to feel sometimes, beneath the keel, that ominous, sliding, grating, treacherous arrest of motion which makes the heart shudder, as the vessel does.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>There was some solicitude about torpedoes, also,--a peril which became a formidable thing, <num value="1">one</num> year later, in the very channel where we found none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>Soon <num value="1">one</num> of our consorts grounded, then another, every vessel taking its turn, I believe, and then in turn getting off, until the <rs>Norwich</rs> lay hopelessly stranded, for that tide at least, a few miles below <placeName reg="Jacksonville, Duval, Florida" key="tgn,7013804">Jacksonville</placeName>, and out of sight of the city, so that she could not even add to our dignity by her visible presence from afar. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>This was rather a serious matter, as the <rs>Norwich</rs> was our main naval reliance, the <rs>Uncas</rs> being a small steamer of less than <num value="200">two hundred</num> tons, and in such poor condition that <persName n="Duncan,Commander,,,," id="n0021.0004.00103.00224" reg="mostcommon:Duncan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commander">Commander</roleName> <surname>Duncan</surname></persName>, on finding himself aground, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> quite declined to trust his consort any farther alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>But, having got thus far, it was plainly my duty to risk the remainder with or without naval assistance; and this being so, the courageous officer did not long object, but allowed his dashing subordinate to steam up with us to the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>This left us <num value="1">one</num> naval and <num value="1">one</num> army gunboat; and, fortunately, the <rs>Burnside</rs>, being a black propeller, always passed for an armed vessel among the <rs>Rebels</rs>, and we rather encouraged that pleasing illusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/><pb id="p.104" n="104"/> </p> 
<p>We had aimed to reach <placeName reg="Jacksonville, Duval, Florida" key="tgn,7013804">Jacksonville</placeName> at daybreak; but these mishaps delayed us, and we had several hours of fresh, early sunshine, lighting up the green shores of that lovely river, wooded to the water's edge, with sometimes an emerald meadow, opening a vista to some picturesque house,--all utterly unlike anything we had yet seen in the <rs>South</rs>, and suggesting rather the <rs>Penobscot</rs> or <rs>Kennebec</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>Here and there we glided by the ruins of some saw-mill burned by the <rs>Rebels</rs> on <persName n="Wright,General,,,," id="n0021.0004.00104.00225" reg="mostcommon:Wright,Fanny,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Wright</surname></persName>'s approach; but nothing else spoke of war, except, perhaps, the silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>It was a delicious day, and a scene of fascination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>Our <placeName key="tgn,7007240" n="1.000 33" reg="florida">Florida</placeName> men were wild with delight; and when we rounded the point below the city, and saw from afar its long streets, its brick warehouses, its white cottages, and its overshadowing trees,--all peaceful and undisturbed by flames,--it seemed, in the men's favorite phrase, <quote>too much good,</quote> and all discipline was merged, for the moment, in a buzz of ecstasy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>The city was still there for us, at any rate; though none knew what perils might be concealed behind those quiet buildings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>Yet there were children playing on the wharves; careless men, here and there, lounged down to look at us, hands in pockets; a few women came to their doors, and gazed listlessly upon us, shading their eyes with their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>We drew momently nearer, in silence and with breathless attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>The gunners were at their posts, and the men in line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>It was <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time>. We were now directly opposite the town: yet no sign of danger was seen; not a rifle-shot was heard; not a shell rose hissing in the air. The <rs>Uncas</rs> rounded to, and dropped anchor in the stream; by previous agreement, I steamed to an upper pier of the town, <persName n="Montgomery,Colonel,,,," id="n0021.0004.00104.00226" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,James,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Montgomery</surname></persName> to a lower <num value="1">one</num>; the little boat-howitzers were run out upon <pb id="p.105" n="105"/> the wharves, and presently to the angles of the chief streets; and the pretty town was our own without a shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>In spite of our detention, the surprise had been complete, and not a soul in <placeName reg="Jacksonville, Duval, Florida" key="tgn,7013804">Jacksonville</placeName> had dreamed of our coming. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>The day passed quickly, in eager preparations for defence; the people could or would give us no definite information about the <rs>Rebel</rs> camp, which was, however, known to be near, and our force did not permit our going out to surprise it. The night following was the most anxious I ever spent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>We were all tired out; the companies were under arms, in various parts of the town, to be ready for an attack at any moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/>My temporary quarters were beneath the loveliest grove of linden-trees, and as I reclined, half-dozing, the mocking-birds sang all night like nightingales,--their notes seeming to trickle down through the sweet air from amid the blossoming boughs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>Day brought relief and the sense of due possession, and we could see what we had won. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/><placeName reg="Jacksonville, Duval, Florida" key="tgn,7013804">Jacksonville</placeName> was now a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> post again: the only post on the main-land in the <orgName>Department of the South</orgName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>The town rose gradually from the river, and was bounded on the rear by a long, sluggish creek, beyond which lay a stretch of woods, affording an excellent covert for the enemy, but without great facilities for attack, as there were but <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> fords and bridges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>This brook could easily be held against a small force, but could at any time and at almost any point be readily crossed by a large <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>For so small a force as ours, however, this clearing must be extended nearer to the town; otherwise our lines would be too long for our numbers. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1036"/>To hold it permanently with <num value="900">nine hundred</num> men was not, perhaps, impossible, with the aid of a gunboat (I had left many of my own regiment sick and on duty in <placeName reg="Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013364">Beaufort</placeName>, and <persName n="Montgomery,Colonel,,,," id="n0021.0004.00107.00229" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,James,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Montgomery</surname></persName> had as yet less than <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num>); but to hold it, and also to make forays up the river, certainly required a larger number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/>We came in part to recruit, but had found scarcely an able-bodied negro in the city; all had been removed farther up, and we must certainly contrive to follow them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1055"/>On the other hand, the most intelligent and ladylike woman I saw, the wife of a Rebel captain, rather surprised me by saying that it seemed pleasanter to have these men stationed there, whom they had known all their lives, and who had generally borne a good character, than to be in the power of entire strangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1056"/>Certainly the men deserved the confidence, for there was scarcely an exception to their good behavior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/>I think they thoroughly felt that their honor and dignity were concerned in the matter, and took too much pride in their character as soldiers,--to say nothing of higher motives,--to tarnish it by any misdeeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1079"/>There was a fight on the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day, when our men killed, as before hinted, a Rebel surgeon, which was oddly metamorphosed in the <rs>Southern</rs> newspapers into their killing <num value="1">one</num> of ours, which certainly never happened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/>Every day, after this, they appeared in small mounted squads in the neighborhood, and exchanged shots with our pickets, to which the gunboats would contribute their louder share, their aim being rather embarrassed by the woods and hills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1139"/>[N. B. I advised them not to go, and the majority declined doing so.] It was designed, no doubt, to intimidate; and in our ignorance of the force actually outside, we have had to recognize the possibility of danger, and work hard at our defences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1140"/>At any time, by going into the outskirts, we can have a skirmish, which is nothing but fun; but when night closes in over a small and weary garrison, there sometimes steals into my mind, like a chill, that most sickening of all sensations, the anxiety of a commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1141"/>This was the night generally set for an attack, if any, though I am pretty well satisfied that they have not strength to dare it, and the worst they could probably do is to burn the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1167"/>I recall <num value="1">one</num> of these enterprises, out of which we extracted a good deal of amusement; it was baptized the <name>Battle</name> of the <name>Clothes</name>-Lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1169"/>We marched through the open pine woods, on a delightful afternoon, and met the returning party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1170"/>Poor fellows!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1171"/>I never shall forget the longing eyes they cast on us, as we marched forth to the field of glory, from which they were debarred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1172"/>We went <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> out, sometimes halting to send forward a scout, while I made all the men lie down in the long, thin grass and beside the fallen trees, till <num value="1">one</num> could not imagine that there was a person there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1174"/>At a certain point forces were divided, and a detachment was sent round the head of the creek, to flank the unsuspecting enemy; while we of the main body, stealing with caution nearer and nearer, through ever denser woods, <pb id="p.121" n="121"/> swooped down at last in triumph upon a solitary farmhouse, where the family-washing had been hung out to dry!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1176"/>It is due to <persName n="Greene,Sergeant,,,," id="n0021.0004.00121.00255" reg="mostcommon:Greene,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Sergeant">Sergeant</roleName> <surname>Greene</surname></persName>, my invaluable guide, to say that he had from the beginning discouraged any high hopes of a crossing of bayonets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1177"/>He had early explained that it was not he who claimed to have seen the tents and the <rs>Rebel</rs> soldiers, but <num value="1">one</num> of the officers,--and had pointed out that our undisturbed approach was hardly reconcilable with the existence of a hostile camp so near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1178"/>This impression had also pressed more and more upon my own mind, but it was our business to put the thing beyond a doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1179"/>Probably the place may have been occasionally used for a picket-station, and we found fresh horse-tracks in the vicinity, and there was a quantity of iron bridle-bits in the house, of which no clear explanation could be given; so that the armed men may not have been wholly imaginary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1180"/>But camp there was none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1181"/>After enjoying to the utmost the fun of the thing, therefore, we borrowed the only horse on the premises, hung all the bits over his neck, and as I rode him back to camp, they clanked like broken chains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1182"/>We were joined on the way by our dear and devoted surgeon, whom I had left behind as an invalid, but who had mounted his horse and ridden out alone to attend to our wounded, his green sash looking quite in harmony with the early spring verdure of those lovely woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1189"/>I was forbidden going any farther from camp, or attacking the <rs>Rebel</rs> camp, as my force comprised half our garrison, and should the town meanwhile be attacked from some other direction, it would be in great danger. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1190"/>I never shall forget the delight of that march through the open pine barren, with occasional patches of uncertain swamp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1196"/>Especially I watched with pleasure the fresh delight of the <rs>Maine</rs> men, who had not, like the rest, been previously in action, and who strode rapidly on with their long legs, irresistibly recalling, as their gaunt, athletic frames and sunburnt faces appeared here and there among the pines, the lumber regions of their native State, with which I was not unfamiliar. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1197"/>We passed through a former camp of the <rs>Rebels</rs>, from which everything had been lately removed; but when the utmost permitted limits of our reconnoissance were reached, there were still no signs of any other camp, and the <rs>Rebel</rs> cavalry still kept provokingly before us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1198"/>With a good deal of reluctance, however, I caused the recall to be sounded, and, after a slight halt, we began to retrace our steps. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1199"/>Straining our eyes to look along the reach of level railway which stretched away through the pine barren we began to see certain ominous puffs of smoke, which might indeed proceed from some fire in the woods, but were at once set down by the men as coming from the mysterious locomotive battery which the <rs>Rebels</rs> were said to have constructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1200"/>Gradually the smoke grew denser, and appeared to be moving up along the track, keeping pace with our motion, and about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles distant</measure>. <pb id="p.124" n="124"/> I watched it steadily through a field-glass from our own slowly moving battery: it seemed to move when we moved and to halt when we halted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1201"/>Sometimes in the dim smoke I caught a glimpse of something blacker, raised high in the air like the threatening head of some great gliding serpent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1202"/>Suddenly there came a sharp puff of lighter smoke that seemed like a forked tongue, and then a hollow report, and we could see a great black projectile hurled into the air, and falling <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile away from us, in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1211"/>Fortunately there were deep trenches on each side the railway, with many stout, projecting roots, forming very tolerable bomb-proofs for those who happened to be near them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1212"/>The <pb id="p.125" n="125"/> enemy's gun was a <num value="64">sixty-four</num>-pound <placeName key="tgn,2179274" n="1.000 27" reg="blakeley, baldwin, alabama">Blakely</placeName>, as we afterward found, whose enormous projectiles moved very slowly and gave ample time to cover,--insomuch, that, while the fragments of shell fell all around and amongst us, not a man was hurt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1213"/>This soon gave the men the most buoyant confidence, and they shouted with childish delight over every explosion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1214"/>The moment a shell had burst or fallen unburst, our little gun was invariably fired in return, and that with some precision, so far as we could judge, its range also being nearly as great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1215"/>For some reason they showed no disposition to overtake us, in which attempt their locomotive would have given them an immense advantage over our heavy hand-car, and their cavalry force over our infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1216"/>Nevertheless, I rather hoped that they would attempt it, for then an effort might have been made to cut them off in the rear by taking up some rails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1217"/>As it was, this was out of the question, though they moved slowly, as we moved, keeping always about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1218"/>When they finally ceased firing we took up the rails beyond us before withdrawing, and thus kept the enemy from approaching so near the city again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1219"/>But I shall never forget that Dantean monster, rearing its black head amid the distant smoke, nor the solicitude with which I watched for the puff which meant danger, and looked round to see if my chickens were all under cover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1220"/>The greatest peril, after all, was from the possible dismounting of our gun, in which case we should have been very apt to lose it, if the enemy had showed any dash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1221"/>There may be other such tilts of railway artillery on record during the war; but if so, I have not happened to read of them, and so have dwelt the longer on this.

<p>This was doubtless the same locomotive battery which had previously fired more than once upon the town,running up within <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> and then withdrawing, while it was deemed inexpedient to destroy the railroad, on our part, lest it might be needed by ourselves in turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1224"/>They had the range well, and every shot fell near the post headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1225"/>It was exciting to see the great <placeName reg="Blakeley, Baldwin, Alabama" key="tgn,2179274">Blakely</placeName> shell, showing a light as it rose, and moving slowly towards us like a comet, then exploding and scattering its formidable fragments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1226"/>Yet, strange to say, no serious harm was done to life or limb, and the most formidable casualty was that of a citizen who complained that a shell had passed through the wall of his bedroom, and carried off his mosquito curtain in its transit. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1233"/>Most of the people themselves took the same view, and eagerly begged to accompany us on our departure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1234"/>They were allowed to bring their clothing and furniture also, and at once developed that insane mania for aged and valueless trumpery which always seizes upon the human race, I believe, in moments of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1244"/>The excitement of the departure was intense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1245"/>The embarkation was so laborious that it seemed as if the flames must be upon us before we could get on board, and it was also generally expected that the <rs>Rebel</rs> skirmishers would be down among the houses, wherever practicable, to annoy us to the utmost, as had been the case at the previous evacuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1246"/>They were, indeed, there, as we afterwards heard, but did not venture to molest us.

<p>With heavy hearts their officers floated down the lovely river, which we had ascended with hopes so buoyant; and from that day to this, the reasons for our recall have never been made public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1261"/>And as even the march from the camp to the picket lines was something that could not possibly have been the same for any white regiment in the service, it is worth while to begin at the beginning and describe it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1262"/>A regiment ordered on picket was expected to have reveille at daybreak, and to be in line for departure by sunrise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1263"/>This delighted our men, who always took a childlike pleasure in being out of bed at any unreasonable hour; and by the time I had emerged, the tents were nearly all struck, and the great wagons were lumbering into camp to receive them, with whatever else was to be transported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1266"/>There was a swaying of flags and multitudinous weapons that might have been camels' necks for all <num value="1">one</num> could see, and the whole thing might <pb id="p.132" n="132"/> have been a caravan upon the desert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1298"/>It was level, but otherwise broken and bewildering to the last degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1299"/>No road traversed it, properly speaking, but the <rs type="place">Shell Road</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1300"/>All the rest was a wild medley of cypress swamp, pine barren, muddy creek, and cultivated plantation, intersected by interminable lanes and bridle-paths, through which we must ride day and night, and which our horses soon knew better than ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1301"/>The regiment was distributed at different stations, the main force being under my immediate command, at a plantation close by the <rs type="place">Shell Road</rs>, <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> from the ferry, and <placeName><distance reg="7miles">seven miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013364">Beaufort</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1302"/>Our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> picket duty was just at the time of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attack on <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, under <persName n="Dupont,,,,," id="n0021.0005.00135.00279" reg="mostcommon:Dupont,S.,F.,,:2"><surname>Dupont</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hunter,,,,," id="n0021.0005.00135.00280" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><surname>Hunter</surname></persName>; and it was generally supposed that the <rs>Confederates</rs> would make an effort to recapture the <rs type="place">Sea</rs> Islands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1303"/>My orders were to watch the enemy closely, keep informed as to his position and movements, attempt no advance, and, in case any were attempted from the other side, to delay it as long as possible, sending instant notice to Headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1304"/>As to the delay, that could be easily <pb id="p.136" n="136"/> guaranteed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1305"/>There were causeways on the <rs type="place">Shell Road</rs> which a single battery could hold against a large force; and the plantations were everywhere so intersected by hedges and dikes that they seemed expressly planned for defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1306"/>Although creeks wound in and out everywhere, yet these were only navigable at high tide, and at all other times were impassable marshes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1307"/>There were but few posts where the enemy were within rifle range, and their occasional attacks at those points were soon stopped by our enforcement of a pithy order from <persName n="Hunter,General,,,," id="n0021.0005.00136.00281" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName>, <quote>Give them as good as they send.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1308"/>So that, with every opportunity for being kept on the alert, there was small prospect of serious danger; and all promised an easy life, with only enough of care to make it pleasant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1309"/>The picket station was therefore always a coveted post among the regiments, combining some undeniable importance with a kind of relaxation; and as we were there <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> on our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> tour of duty, and returned there several times afterwards, we got well acquainted with it. The whole region always reminded me of the descriptions of La Vendee, and I always expected to meet <persName n="Larochejaquelein,,Henri,,," id="n0021.0005.00136.00282" reg="default:Larochejaquelein,Henri,,,"><foreName>Henri</foreName> <surname>Larochejaquelein</surname></persName> riding in the woods. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1310"/>How can I ever describe the charm and picturesqueness of that summer life?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1311"/>Our house possessed <num value="4">four</num> spacious rooms and a piazza; around it were grouped sheds and tents; the camp was a little way off on <num value="1">one</num> side, the negro-quarters of the plantation on the other; and all was immersed in a dense mass of waving and murmuring locust-blossoms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1312"/>The spring days were always lovely, while the evenings were always conveniently damp; so that we never shut the windows by day, nor omitted our cheerful fire by night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1313"/>Indoors, the main Headquarters seemed like the camp of <pb id="p.137" n="137"/> some party of young engineers in time of peace, only with a little female society added, and a good many martial associations thrown in. A large, low, dilapidated room, with an immense fireplace, and with window-panes chiefly broken, so that the sashes were still open even when closed,--such was our home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1314"/>The walls were scrawled with capital charcoal sketches by R. of the <orgName type="regiment" key="NH4">Fourth New Hampshire</orgName>, and with a good map of the island and its wood-paths by C. of the <orgName type="regiment" key="1MACav">First Massachusetts Cavalry</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1315"/>The room had the picturesqueness which comes everywhere from the natural grouping of articles of daily use,--swords, belts, pistols, rifles, field-glasses, spurs, canteens, gauntlets,--while wreaths of gray moss above the windows, and a pelican's wing <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> long over the high mantel-piece, indicated more deliberate decoration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1316"/>This, and the whole atmosphere of the place, spoke of the refining presence of agreeable women; and it was pleasant when they held their little court in the evening, and pleasant all day, with the different visitors who were always streaming in and out,officers and soldiers on various business; turbaned women from the plantations, coming with complaints or questionings; fugitives from the main-land to be interrogated; visitors riding up on horseback, their hands full of jasmine and wild roses; and the sweet sunny air all perfumed with magnolias and the <rs>Southern</rs> pine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1317"/>From the neighboring camp there was a perpetual low hum. Louder voices and laughter re-echoed, amid the sharp sounds of the axe, from the pine woods; and sometimes, when the relieved pickets were discharging their pieces, there came the hollow sound of dropping rifle-shots, as in skirmishing,--perhaps the most unmistakable and fascinating association that war bequeaths to the memory of the ear. <pb id="p.138" n="138"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1318"/>Our domestic arrangements were of the oddest description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1319"/>From the time when we began housekeeping by taking down the front-door to complete therewith a little office for the surgeon on the piazza, everything seemed upside down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1320"/>I slept on a shelf in the corner of the parlor, bequeathed me by <rs type="role2">Major</rs> F., my jovial predecessor, and, if I waked at any time, could put my head through the. broken window, arouse my orderly, and ride <hi rend="italics">off</hi> to see if I could catch a picket asleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1321"/>We used to spell the word <hi rend="italics">picquet</hi>, because that was understood to be the correct thing, in that Department at least; and they used to say at post Headquarters that as soon as the officer in command of the outposts grew negligent, and was guilty of a k, he was ordered in immediately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1322"/>Then the arrangements for ablution were peculiar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1323"/>We fitted up a bathing-place in a brook, which somehow got appropriated at once by the company laundresses; but I had my revenge, for I took to bathing in the family washtub.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1324"/>After all, however, the kitchen department had the advantage, for they used my solitary napkin to wipe the mess-table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1325"/>As for food, we found it impossible to get chickens, save in the immature shape of eggs; fresh pork was prohibited by the surgeon, and other fresh meat came rarely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1326"/>We could, indeed, hunt for wild turkeys, and even deer, but such hunting was found only to increase the appetite, without corresponding supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1327"/>Still we had our luxuries,--large, delicious drum-fish, and alligator steaks,--like a more substantial fried halibut,which might have afforded the theme for <persName n="Lamb,,Charles,,," id="n0021.0005.00138.00283" reg="default:Lamb,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Lamb</surname></persName>'s dissertation on Roast Pig, and by whose aid <quote>for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in our lives we tasted <hi rend="italics">crackling</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1328"/>The post bakery yielded admirable bread; and for vegetables and fruit we had very poor sweet potatoes, and (in their season) <pb id="p.139" n="139"/> an unlimited supply of the largest blackberries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1329"/>For beverage, we had the vapid milk of that region, in which, if you let it stand, the water sinks instead of the cream's rising; and the delicious sugar-cane syrup, which we had brought from <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, and which we drank at all hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1330"/>Old Floridians say that no <num value="1">one</num> is justified in drinking whiskey, while he can get cane-juice; it is sweet and spirited, without cloying, foams like ale, and there were little spots on the ceiling of the dining-room where our lively beverage had popped out its cork.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1331"/>We kept it in a whiskey-bottle; and as whiskey itself was absolutely prohibited among us, it was amusing to see the surprise of our military visitors when this innocent substitute was brought in. They usually liked it in the end, but, like the old <rs>Frenchwoman</rs> over her glass of water, wished that it were a sin to give it a relish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1332"/>As the foaming beakers of molasses and water were handed round, the guests would make with them the courteous little gestures of polite imbibing, and would then quaff the beverage, some with gusto, others with a slight after-look of dismay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1333"/>But it was a delicious and cooling drink while it lasted; and at all events was the best and the worst we had. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1334"/>We used to have reveille at <num value="6">six</num>, and breakfast about <num value="7">seven</num>; then the mounted couriers began to arrive from half a dozen different directions, with written reports of what had happened during the night,--a boat seen, a picket fired upon, a battery erecting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1335"/>These must be consolidated and forwarded to Headquarters, with the daily report of the command,--so many sick, so many on detached service, and all the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1336"/>This was our morning newspaper, our <persName n="Herald,,,,," id="n0021.0005.00139.00284" reg="mostcommon:Herald,nomatch:0"><surname>Herald</surname></persName> and Tribune; I never got tired of it. Then the couriers must be furnished <pb id="p.140" n="140"/> with countersign and instructions, and sent off again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1337"/>Then we scattered to our various rides, all disguised as duty; <num value="1">one</num> to inspect pickets, <num value="1">one</num> to visit a sick soldier, <num value="1">one</num> to build a bridge or clear a road, and still another to Headquarters for ammunition or commissary stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1338"/>Galloping through green lanes, miles of triumphal arches of wild roses,--roses pale and large and fragrant, mingled with great boughs of the white cornel, fantastic masses, snowy surprises,--such were our rides, ranging from <num value="8">eight</num> to <num value="15">fifteen</num> and even <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure>. Back to a late dinner with our various experiences, and perhaps specimens to match,--a thunder-snake, <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure> long; a live opossum, with the young clinging to the natural pouch; an armful of great white, scentless pond-lilies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1339"/>After dinner, to the tangled garden for rosebuds or early magnolias, whose cloying fragrance will always bring back to me the full zest of those summer days; then dress-parade and a little drill as the day grew cool.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1340"/>In the evening, tea; and then the piazza or the fireside, as the case might be,--chess, cards,--perhaps a little music by aid of the <rs type="role" reg="assistant-Surgeon">assistant surgeon</rs>'s melodeon, a few pages of <persName n="Paul,,Jean,,," id="n0021.0005.00140.00285" reg="default:Paul,Jean,,,"><foreName>Jean</foreName> <surname>Paul</surname></persName>'s <quote><persName n="Titan,,,,," id="n0021.0005.00140.00286" reg="mostcommon:Titan,nomatch:0"><surname>Titan</surname></persName>,</quote> almost my only book, and carefully husbanded,--perhaps a mail, with its infinite felicities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1341"/>Such was our day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1342"/>Night brought its own fascinations, more solitary and profound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1343"/>The darker they were, the more clearly it was our duty to visit the pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1344"/>The paths that had grown so familiar by day seemed a wholly new labyrinth by night; and every added shade of darkness seemed to shift and complicate them all anew, till at last man's skill grew utterly baffled, and the clew must be left to the instinct of the horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1345"/>Riding beneath the solemn starlight, or soft, gray mist, or densest blackness, the frogs croaking, <pb id="p.141" n="141"/> the strange <quote>chuckwill's-widow</quote> droning his ominous note above my head, the mocking-bird dreaming in music, the great Southern fireflies rising to the tree-tops, or hovering close to the ground like glow-worms, till the horse raised his hoops to avoid them; through pine woods and cypress swamps, or past sullen brooks, or white tents, or the dimly seen huts of sleeping negroes; down to the glimmering shore, where black statues leaned against trees or stood alert in the pathways;--never, in all the :days of my life, shall I forget the magic of those haunted nights. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1346"/>We had nocturnal boat service, too, for it was a part of our instructions to obtain all possible information about the enemy's position; and we accordingly, as usual in such cases, incurred a great many risks that harmed nobody, and picked up much information which did nobody any good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1347"/>The centre of these nightly reconnoissances, for a long time, was the wreck of the <rs>George Washington</rs>, the story of whose disaster is perhaps worth telling. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1348"/>Till about the time when we went on picket, it had been the occasional habit of the smaller gunboats to make the circuit of <placeName reg="Port Royal Island, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2593932">Port Royal Island</placeName>,--a practice which was deemed very essential to the safety of our position, but which the <rs>Rebels</rs> effectually stopped, a few days after our arrival, by destroying the army <term type="ship">gunboat</term> <rs type="ship">George Washington</rs> with a single shot from a-<orgName n="Light Battery" type="battery">light battery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1349"/>I was roused soon after daybreak by the firing, and a courier soon came dashing in with the particulars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1350"/>Forwarding these hastily to <placeName reg="Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013364">Beaufort</placeName> (for we had then no telegraph), I was soon at the scene of action, <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1351"/>Approaching, I met on the picket paths man after man who had escaped from the wreck across <measure n="0.5mile" type="distance">a half-mile</measure> of almost <pb id="p.142" n="142"/> impassable marsh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1352"/>Never did I see such objects,--some stripped to their shirts, some fully clothed, but all having every garment literally pasted to their bodies with mud. Across the river, the <rs>Rebels</rs> were retiring, having done their work, but were still shelling, from greater and greater distances, the wood through which I rode.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1353"/>Arrived at the spot nearest the wreck (a point opposite to what we called the <rs type="place">Brickyard Station</rs>), I saw the burning vessel aground beyond a long stretch of marsh, out of which the forlorn creatures were still floundering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1354"/>Here and there in the mud and reeds we could see the laboring heads, slowly advancing, and could hear excruciating cries from wounded men in the more distant depths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1355"/>It was the strangest mixture of war and <persName n="Dante,,,,," id="n0021.0005.00142.00287" reg="mostcommon:Dante,nomatch:0"><surname>Dante</surname></persName> and <persName n="Crusoe,,Robinson,,," id="n0021.0005.00142.00288" reg="default:Crusoe,Robinson,,,"><foreName>Robinson</foreName> <surname>Crusoe</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1356"/>Our energetic chaplain coming up, I sent him with <num value="4">four</num> men, under a flag of truce, to the place whence the worst cries proceeded, while r went to another part of the marsh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1357"/>During that morning we got them all out, our last achievement being the rescue of the pilot, an immense negro with a wooden leg,--an article so particularly unavailable for mud travelling, that it would have almost seemed better, as <num value="1">one</num> of the men suggested, to cut the traces, and leave it behind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1358"/>A naval gunboat, too, which had originally accompanied this vessel, and should never have left it, now came back and took off the survivors, though there had been several deaths from scalding and shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1359"/>It proved that the wreck was not aground after all, but at anchor, having foolishly lingered till after daybreak, and having thus given time for the enemy to bring down their guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1360"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot had struck the boiler, and set the vessel on fire; after which the officer in command had raised a white flag, and then escaped with his men to our shore; <pb id="p.143" n="143"/> and it was for this flight in the wrong direction that they were shelled in the marshes by the <rs>Rebels</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1361"/>The case furnished in this respect some parallel to that of the <rs>Kearsage</rs> and <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, and it was afterwards cited, I believe, officially or unofficially, to show that the <rs>Rebels</rs> had claimed the right to punish, in this case, the course of action which they approved in <persName n="Semmes,,,,," id="n0021.0005.00143.00289" reg="mostcommon:Semmes,nomatch:0"><surname>Semmes</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1362"/>I know that they always asserted thenceforward that the detachment on board the <rs type="ship">George Washington</rs> had become rightful prisoners of war, and were justly fired upon when they tried to escape. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1363"/>This was at the time of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attack on <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, and the noise of this cannonading spread rapidly thither, and brought <num value="4">four</num> regiments to reinforce <placeName reg="Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013364">Beaufort</placeName> in a hurry, under the impression that the town was already taken, and that they must save what remnants they could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1365"/>Indeed, our affair came to about as much,--nearly nothing,and lasted decidedly longer; for both sides nibbled away at tile guns, by night, for weeks afterward, though I believe the mud finally got them,--at least, we did not. We tried in vain to get the use of a steamboat or floating derrick of any kind; for it needed more mechanical ingenuity than we possessed to transfer anything so heavy to our small boats by night, while by day we did not go near the wreck in anything larger than a <quote>dug-out.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1366"/><pb id="p.144" n="144"/> </p> 
<p><num value="1">One</num> of these nocturnal visits to the wreck I recall with peculiar gusto, because it brought back that contest with catarrh and coughing among my own warriors which had so ludicrously beset me in <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1367"/>It was always fascinating to be on those forbidden waters by night, stealing out with muffled oars through the creeks and reeds, our eyes always strained for other voyagers, our ears listening breathlessly to all the marsh sounds,--blackfish splashing, and little wakened reed-birds that fled wailing away over the dim river, equally safe on either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1368"/>But it always appeared to the watchful senses that we were making noise enough to be heard at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>; and somehow the victims of catarrh seemed always the most eager for any enterprise requiring peculiar caution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1369"/>In this case I thought I had sifted them beforehand; but as soon as we were afloat, <num value="1">one</num> poor boy near me began to wheeze, and I turned upon him in exasperation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1370"/>He saw his danger, and meekly said, <quote>I won't cough, <persName n="Cunnel,,,,," id="n0021.0005.00144.00291" reg="mostcommon:Cunnel,nomatch:0"><surname>Cunnel</surname></persName>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1372"/>For <num value="2">two</num> mortal hours he sat grasping his gun, with never a chirrup, But <num value="2">two</num> unfortunates in the bow of the boat developed symptoms which I could not suppress; so, putting in at a picket station, with some risk I dumped them in mud knee-deep, and embarked a substitute, who after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> absolutely coughed louder than both the others united.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1373"/>Handkerchiefs, blankets, over-coats, suffocation in its direst forms, were all tried in vain, but apparently the <rs>Rebel</rs> pickets slept through it all, and we explored the wreck in safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1374"/>I think they were asleep, for certainly across the level marshes there came a nasal sound, as of the <quote>Conthieveracy</quote> in its slumbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1375"/>It may have been a bull-frog, but it sounded like a human snore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/><pb id="p.145" n="145"/> Picket life was of course the place to feel the charm of natural beauty on the <rs type="place">Sea</rs> Islands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1377"/>We had a world of profuse and tangled vegetation around us, such as would have been a dream of delight to me, but for the constant sense of responsibility and care which came between.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1378"/>Amid this preoccupation, Nature seemed but a mirage, and not the close and intimate associate I had before known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1379"/>I pressed no flowers, collected no insects or birds' eggs, made no notes on natural objects, reversing in these respects all previous habits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1380"/>Yet now, in the retrospect, there seems to have been infused into me through every pore the voluptuous charm of the season and the place; and the slightest corresponding sound or odor now calls back the memory of those delicious days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1381"/>Being afterwards on picket at almost every season, I tasted the sensations of all; and though I hardly then thought of such a result, the associations of beauty will remain forever. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1382"/>In <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>, for instance,--though this was during a later period of picket service,--the woods were usually draped with that <quote>net of shining haze</quote> which marks our Northern <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct>; and the house was embowered in wild plum-blossoms, small, white, profuse, and tenanted by murmuring bees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1383"/>There were peach-blossoms, too, and the yellow jasmine was opening its multitudinous buds, climbing over tall trees, and waving from bough to bough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1384"/>There were fresh young ferns and white bloodroot in the edges of woods, matched by snowdrops in the garden, beneath budded myrtle and <term>Petisporum</term>. In this wilderness the birds were busy; the <num value="2">two</num> main songsters being the mocking-bird and the cardinal-grosbeak, which monopolized all the parts of our more varied Northern orchestra save the tender and liquid notes, which in <pb id="p.146" n="146"/> <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> seemed unattempted except by some stray blue-bird.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1385"/>Jays were as loud and busy as at the <rs>North</rs> in autumn; there were sparrows and wrens; and sometimes I noticed the shy and whimsical chewink. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1386"/>From this early spring-time onward, there seemed no great difference in atmospheric sensations, and only a succession of bloom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1387"/>After <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> <num value="1">one</num>'s notions of the season grew bewildered, just as very early rising bewilders the day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1388"/>So when we had lived in summer so long as hardly to remember winter, it suddenly occurred to us that it was not yet <dateStruct><month>June</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1389"/><num value="1">One</num> escapes at the <rs>South</rs> that mixture of hunger and avarice which is felt in the <rs>Northern</rs> summer, counting each hour's joy with the sad consciousness that an hour is gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1391"/>It seemed to me also that the woods had not those pure, clean, <hi rend="italics">innocent</hi> odors which so abound in the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> forest in early spring; but there was something luscious, voluptuous, almost oppressively fragrant about the magnolias, as if they belonged not to <persName n="Hebe,,,,," id="n0021.0005.00146.00292" reg="mostcommon:Hebe,nomatch:0"><surname>Hebe</surname></persName>, but to <persName><foreName>Magdalen</foreName></persName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1392"/>Such immense and lustrous butterflies I had never seen but in dreams; and not even dreams had prepared me for sand-flies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/>Almost too small to be seen, they inflicted a bite which appeared larger than themselves,--a <pb id="p.147" n="147"/> positive wound, more torturing than that of a mosquito, and leaving more annoyance behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1394"/>These tormentors elevated dress-parade into the dignity of a military engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1395"/>I had to stand motionless, with my head a mere nebula of winged atoms, while tears rolled profusely down my face, from mere muscular irritation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1396"/>Had I stirred a finger, the whole battalion would have been slapping its cheeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1397"/>Such enemies were, however, a valuable aid to discipline, on the whole, as they abounded in the guard-house, and made that institution an object of unusual abhorrence among the men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1398"/>The presence of ladies and the homelike air of everything, made the picket station a very popular resort while we were there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1399"/>It was the <num value="1">one</num> agreeable ride from <placeName reg="Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013364">Beaufort</placeName>, and we often had a dozen people unexpectedly to dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1400"/>On such occasions there was sometimes mounting in hot haste, and an eager search among the outlying plantations for additional chickens and eggs, or through the company kitchens for some of those villanous tin cans which everywhere marked the progress of our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1401"/>In those cans, so far as my observation went, all fruits relapsed into a common acidulation, and all meats into a similarity of tastelessness; while the <quote>condensed milk</quote> was best described by the men, who often unconsciously stumbled on a better joke than they knew, and always spoke of it as <hi rend="italics">condemned</hi> milk. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1402"/>We had our own excursions too,--to the <rs type="place">Barnwell plantations</rs>, with their beautiful avenues and great live oaks, the perfection of Southern beauty,--to <placeName reg="Halls Island, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2373121">Hall's Island</placeName>, debatable ground, close under the enemy's fire, where half-wild cattle were to be shot, under military precautions, like Scottish moss-trooping,--or to the ferry, where it was fascinating to the female mind to scan the <rs>Rebel</rs> <pb id="p.148" n="148"/> pickets through a field-glass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1403"/>Our horses liked the byways far better than the level hardness of the <rs type="place">Shell Road</rs>, especially those we had brought from <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, which enjoyed the wilderness as if they had belonged to <placeName reg="Marion, Marion, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096201">Marion</placeName>'s men. They delighted to feel the long sedge brush their flanks, or to gallop down the narrow woodpaths, leaping the fallen trees, and scaring the bright little lizards which shot across our track like live rays broken from the sunbeams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1404"/>We had an abundance of horses, mostly captured and left in our hands by some convenient delay of the post quartermaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1405"/>We had also <num value="2">two</num> side-saddles, which, not being munitions of war, could not properly (as we explained) be transferred like other captured articles to the general stock; otherwise the P. Q. M. (a married man) would have showed no unnecessary delay in their case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1406"/>For miscellaneous accommodation was there not an ambulance,--that most inestimable of army conveniences, equally ready to carry the merry to a feast or the wounded from a fray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1407"/><quote>Ambulance</quote> was <num value="1">one</num> of those words, rather numerous, which Ethiopian lips were not framed by Nature to articulate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1408"/>Only the highest stages of colored culture could compass it; on the tongue of the many it was transformed mystically as <quote>amulet,</quote> or ambitiously as <quote>epaulet,</quote> or in culinary fashion as <quote>omelet.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1409"/>But it was our experience that an ambulance under any name jolted equally hard. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1410"/>Besides these divertisements, we had more laborious vocations,--a good deal of fatigue, and genuine though small alarms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1411"/>The men went on duty every <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> day at furthest, and the officers nearly as often,--most of the tours of duty lasting <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>, though the stream was considered to watch itself tolerably well by <pb id="p.149" n="149"/> daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1412"/>This kind of responsibility suited the men; and we had already found, as the whole army afterwards acknowledged, that the constitutional watchfulness and distrustfulness of the colored race made them admirable sentinels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1413"/>Soon after we went on picket, the commanding general sent an aid, with a cavalry escort, to visit all the stations, without my knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1414"/>They spent the whole night, and the officer reported that he could not get within <measure n="30yards" type="distance">thirty yards</measure> of any post without a challenge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1415"/>This was a pleasant assurance for me; since our position seemed so secure, compared with <placeName reg="Jacksonville, Duval, Florida" key="tgn,7013804">Jacksonville</placeName>, that I had feared some relaxation of vigilance, while yet the safety of all depended on our thorough discharge of duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1416"/><placeName reg="Jacksonville, Duval, Florida" key="tgn,7013804">Jacksonville</placeName> had also seasoned the men so well that they were no longer nervous, and did not waste much powder on false alarms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1417"/>The Rebels made no formal attacks, and rarely attempted to capture pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1418"/>Sometimes they came stealing through the creeks in <quote>dugouts,</quote> as we did on their side of the water, and occasionally an officer of ours was fired upon while making his rounds by night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1419"/>Often some boat or scow would go adrift, and sometimes a mere dark mass of river-weed would be floated by the tide past the successive stations, eliciting a challenge and perhaps a shot from each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1420"/>I remember the vivid way in which <num value="1">one</num> of the men stated to his officer the manner in which a faithful picket should do his duty, after challenging, in case a boat came in sight.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1426"/>In time, however, they learned quieter methods, and would wade far out in the water, there standing motionless at last, hoping to surround and capture these floating boats, though, to their great disappointment, the prize usually proved empty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1427"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion they tried a still profounder strategy; for an officer visiting the pickets after <time value="12am">midnight</time>, and hearing in the stillness a portentous snore from the end of the causeway (our most important station), straightway hurried to the point of danger, with wrath in his soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1428"/>But the sergeant of the squad came out to meet him, imploring silence, and explaining that they had seen or suspected a boat hovering near, and were feigning sleep in order to lure and capture those who would entrap them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1429"/>The <num value="1">one</num> military performance at the picket station of which my men were utterly intolerant was an occasional flag of truce, for which this was the appointed locality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1430"/>These farces, for which it was our duty to furnish the stock actors, always struck them as being utterly despicable, and unworthy the serious business of war. They felt, I suppose, what <persName n="Pickwick,Mister,,,," id="n0021.0005.00150.00294" reg="mostcommon:Pickwick,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pickwick</surname></persName> felt, when he heard his counsel remark to the counsel for the plaintiff, that it was a very fine morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1431"/>It goaded their souls to see the young officers from the <num value="2">two</num> opposing armies salute each other courteously, and interchange cigars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1432"/>They despised the object of such negotiations, which was usually to send over to the enemy some family of Rebel women who had made themselves quite intolerable on our side, but were not above collecting a subscription among the <rs>Union</rs> officers, before departure, to replenish <pb id="p.151" n="151"/> their wardrobes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1433"/>The men never showed disrespect to these women by word or deed, but they hated them from the bottom of their souls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1434"/>Besides, there was a grievance behind all this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1435"/>The Rebel order remained unrevoked which consigned the new colored troops and their officers to a felon's death, if captured; and we all felt that we fought with ropes round our necks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1436"/><quote>Dere's no flags ob truce for us,</quote> the men would contemptuously say. <quote>When de Secesh fight de <hi rend="italics">Fus' Souf</hi></quote> (<orgName type="regiment" key="SC1">First South Carolina</orgName>), <quote>he fight in earnest.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1437"/>Indeed, I myself took it as rather a compliment when the commander on the other side &mdash; though an old acquaintance of mine in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> and in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> refused to negotiate through me or my officers,--a refusal which was kept up, greatly to the enemy's inconvenience, until our men finally captured some of the opposing pickets, and their friends had to waive all scruples in order to send them supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1438"/>After this there was no trouble, and I think that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Rebel officer in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> who officially met any officer of colored troops under a flag of truce was <persName n="Calhoun,Captain,John,C.,," id="n0021.0005.00151.00295" reg="default:Calhoun,John,C.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1439"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7007240" n="1.000 33" reg="florida">Florida</placeName> we had been so recognized long before; but that was when they wished to frighten us out of <placeName reg="Jacksonville, Duval, Florida" key="tgn,7013804">Jacksonville</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1440"/>Such was our life on picket at <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>,--a thing whose memory is now fast melting into such stuff as dreams are made of.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1441"/>Yes, that was a pleasant life on picket, in the delicious early summer of the <rs>South</rs>, and among the endless flowery forests of that blossoming isle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1442"/>In the retrospect I seem to see myself adrift upon a horse's back amid a sea of roses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1443"/>The various outposts were within a <measure n="6mile" type="distance">six-mile</measure> radius, and it was <num value="1">one</num> long, delightful gallop, day and night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1444"/>I have a faint impression that the moon shone steadily every night for <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>; and yet I remember certain periods of such dense darkness that in riding through the wood-paths it was really unsafe to go beyond a walk, for fear of branches above and roots below; and <num value="1">one</num> of my officers was once shot at by a Rebel scout who stood unperceived at his horse's bridle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1445"/>To those doing outpost-duty on an island, however large, the main-land has all the fascination of forbidden fruit, and on a scale bounded only by the horizon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1446"/><persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0021.0006.00152.00298" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,nomatch:0"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> says that every house looks ideal until we enter it,--and it is certainly so, if it be just the other side of the hostile lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1447"/>Every grove in that blue distance appears enchanted ground, and yonder loitering gray-back leading his horse to water in the farthest distance, makes <num value="1">one</num> thrill with a desire to hail him, to shoot at him, to capture him, to do anything to bridge this inexorable dumb space that lies between.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1448"/>A boyish feeling, no doubt, and <num value="1">one</num> that time diminishes, without effacing; yet it is a feeling which lies at the bottom of many rash actions in war, and of some brilliant ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1449"/><pb id="p.153" n="153"/> For <num value="1">one</num>, I could never quite outgrow it, though restricted by duty from doing many foolish things in consequence, and also restrained by reverence for certain confidential advisers whom I had always at hand, and who considered it their mission to keep me always on short rations of personal adventure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1450"/>Indeed, most of that sort of entertainment in the army devolves upon scouts detailed for the purpose, volunteer aides-de-camp and newspaper-reporters,--other officers being expected to be about business more prosaic. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1451"/>All the excitements of war are quadrupled by darkness; and as I rode along our outer lines at night, and watched the glimmering flames which at regular intervals starred the opposite river-shore, the longing was irresistible to cross the barrier of dusk, and see whether it were men or ghosts who hovered round those dying embers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1452"/>I had yielded to these impulses in boat-adventures by night,--for it was a part of my instructions to obtain all possible information about the <rs>Rebel</rs> outposts,and fascinating indeed it was to glide along, noiselessly paddling, with a dusky guide, through the endless intricacies of those Southern marshes, scaring the reed-birds, which wailed and fled away into the darkness, and penetrating several miles into the interior, between hostile fires, where discovery might be death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1453"/>Yet there were drawbacks as to these enterprises, since it is not easy for a boat to cross still water, even on the darkest night, without being seen by watchful eyes; and, moreover, the extremes of high and low tide transform so completely the whole condition of those rivers that it needs very nice calculation to do <num value="1">one</num>'s work at precisely the right time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1454"/>To vary the experiment, I had often thought of trying a personal reconnoissance by swimming, at a <pb id="p.154" n="154"/> certain point, whenever circumstances should make it an object. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1455"/>The opportunity at last arrived, and I shall never forget the glee with which, after several postponements, I finally rode forth, a little before <time value="12am">midnight</time>, on a night which seemed made for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1456"/>I had, of course, kept my own secret, and was entirely alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1457"/>The great Southern fireflies were out, not haunting the low ground merely, like ours, but rising to the loftiest tree-tops with weird illumination, and anon hovering so low that my horse often stepped the higher to avoid them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1458"/>The dewy <placeName reg="Cherokee, Colbert, Alabama" key="tgn,2003069">Cherokee</placeName> roses brushed my face, the solemn <quote>Chuckwill's-widow</quote> croaked her incantation, and the rabbits raced phantom-like across the shadowy road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1459"/>Slowly in the darkness I followed the well-known path to the spot where our most advanced outposts were stationed, holding a causeway which thrust itself far out across the separating river,--thus fronting a similar causeway on the other side, while a channel of perhaps <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure>, once traversed by a ferry-boat, rolled between.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1460"/>At low tide this channel was the whole river, with broad, oozy marshes on each side; at high tide the marshes were submerged, and the stream was a mile wide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1461"/>This was the point which I had selected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1462"/>To ascertain the numbers and position of the picket on the opposite causeway was my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> object, as it was a matter on which no <num value="2">two</num> of our officers agreed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1463"/>To this point, therefore, I rode, and dismounting, after being duly challenged by the sentinel at the causeway-head, walked down the long and lonely path.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1464"/>The tide was well up, though still on the flood, as I desired; and each visible tuft of marsh-grass might, but for its motionlessness, have been a prowling boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1465"/>Dark as the night <pb id="p.155" n="155"/> had appeared, the water was pale, smooth, and phosphorescent, and I remember that the phrase <quote>wan water,</quote> so familiar in the <name>Scottish</name> ballads, struck me just then as peculiarly appropriate, though its real meaning is quite different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1466"/>A gentle breeze, from which I had hoped for a ripple, had utterly died away, and it was a warm, breathless Southern night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1467"/>There was no sound but the faint swash of the coming tide, the noises of the reedbirds in the marshes, and the occasional leap of a fish; and it seemed to my overstrained ear as if every footstep of my own must be heard for miles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1468"/>However, I could have no more postponements, and the thing must be tried now or never. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1469"/>Reaching the farther end of the causeway, I found my men couched, like black statues, behind the slight earthwork there constructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1470"/>I expected that my proposed immersion would rather bewilder them, but knew that they would say nothing, as usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1471"/>As for the lieutenant on that post, he was a steady, matter-of-fact, perfectly disciplined Englishman, who wore a Crimean medal, and never asked a superfluous question in his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1472"/>If I had casually remarked to him, <quote><persName n="Hooper,Mister,,,," id="n0021.0006.00155.00299" reg="mostcommon:Hooper,Charles,W.,,:4"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hooper</surname></persName>, the <rs>General</rs> has ordered me on a brief personal reconnoissance to the <rs>Planet Jupiter</rs>, and I wish you to take care of my watch, lest it should be damaged by the <name>Precession</name> of the <name>Equinoxes</name>,</quote> he would have responded with a brief <quote>All right, Sir,</quote> and a quick military gesture, and have put the thing in his pocket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1473"/>As it was, I simply gave him the watch, and remarked that I was going to take a swim. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1474"/>I do not remember ever to have experienced a greater sense of exhilaration than when I slipped noiselessly into the placid water, and struck out into the smooth, eddying current for the opposite shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1475"/>The night was so still <pb id="p.156" n="156"/> and lovely, my black statues looked so dream-like at their posts behind the low earthwork, the opposite arm of the causeway stretched so invitingly from the <rs>Rebel</rs> main, the horizon glimmered so low around me,--for it always appears lower to a swimmer than even to an oarsman,that I seemed floating in some concave globe, some magic crystal, of which I was the enchanted centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1476"/>With each little ripple of my steady progress all things hovered and changed; the stars danced and nodded above; where the stars ended the great Southern fireflies began; and closer than the fireflies, there clung round me a halo of phosphorescent sparkles from the soft salt water. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1477"/>Had I told any <num value="1">one</num> of my purpose, I should have had warnings and remonstrances enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1478"/>The few negroes who did not believe in alligators believed in sharks; the sceptics as to sharks were orthodox in respect to alligators; while those who rejected both had private prejudices as to snapping-turtles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1479"/>The surgeon would have threatened intermittent fever, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> assistant rheumatism, and the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> assistant congestive chills; non-swimmers would have predicted exhaustion, and swimmers cramp; and all this before coming within bullet-range of any hospitalities on the other shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1480"/>But I knew the folly of most alarms about reptiles and fishes; man's imagination peoples the water with many things which do not belong there, or prefer to keep out of his way, if they do; fevers and congestions were the surgeon's business, and I always kept people to their own department; cramp and exhaustion were dangers I could measure, as I had often done; bullets were a more substantial danger, and I must take the chance,--if a loon could dive at the flash, why not I?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1481"/>If I were once ashore, I should have to cope with the <rs>Rebels</rs> on their own ground, which they knew better than <pb id="p.157" n="157"/> I; but the water was my ground, where I, too, had been at home from boyhood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1482"/>I swam as swiftly and softly as I could, although it seemed as if water never had been so still before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1483"/>It appeared impossible that anything uncanny should hide beneath that lovely mirror; and yet when some floating wisp of reeds suddenly coiled itself around my neck, or some unknown thing, drifting deeper, coldly touched my foot, it caused that undefinable shudder which every swimmer knows, and which especially comes over <num value="1">one</num> by night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1484"/>Sometimes a slight sip of brackish water would enter my lips,--for I naturally tried to swim as low as possible,--and then would follow a slight gasping and contest against choking, that seemed to me a perfect convulsion; for I suppose the tendency to choke and sneeze is always enhanced by the circumstance that <num value="1">one</num>'s life may depend on keeping still, just as yawning becomes irresistible where to yawn would be social ruin, and just as <num value="1">one</num> is sure to sleep in church, if <num value="1">one</num> sits in a conspicuous pew. At other times, some unguarded motion would create a splashing which seemed, in the tension of my senses, to be loud enough to be heard at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, although it really mattered not, since there are fishes in those rivers which make as much noise on special occasions as if they were misguided young whales. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1485"/>As I drew near the opposite shore, the dark causeway projected more and more distinctly, to my fancy at least, and I swam more softly still, utterly uncertain as to how far, in the stillness of air and water, my phosphorescent course could be traced by eye or ear. A slight ripple would have saved me from observation, I was more than ever sure, and I would have whistled for a fair wind as eagerly as any sailor, but that my breath was worth to <pb id="p.158" n="158"/> me more than anything it was likely to bring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1486"/>The water became smoother and smoother, and nothing broke the dim surface except a few clumps of rushes and my unfortunate head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1487"/>The outside of this member gradually assumed to its inside a gigantic magnitude; it had always annoyed me at the hatter's from a merely animal bigness, with no commensurate contents to show for it, and now I detested it more than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1488"/>A physical feeling of turgescence and congestion in that region, such as swimmers often feel, probably increased the impression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1489"/>I thought with envy of the <rs>Aztec</rs> children, of the headless horseman of <placeName key="possibilities=46" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Sleepy Hollow</placeName>, of <placeName reg="Saint Somebody">Saint Somebody</placeName> with his head tucked under his arm. <persName n="Plotinus,,,,," id="n0021.0006.00158.00300" reg="mostcommon:Plotinus,nomatch:0"><surname>Plotinus</surname></persName> was less ashamed of his whole body than I of this inconsiderate and stupid appendage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1490"/>To be sure, I might swim for a certain distance under water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1491"/>But that accomplishment I had reserved for a retreat, for I knew that the longer I stayed down the more surely I should have to snort like a walrus when I came up again, and to approach an enemy with such a demonstration was not to be thought of. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1492"/>Suddenly a dog barked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1493"/>We had certain information that a pack of hounds was kept at a Rebel station a few miles off, on purpose to hunt runaways, and I had heard from the negroes almost fabulous accounts of the instinct of these animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1494"/>I knew that, although water baffled their scent, they yet could recognize in some manner the approach of any person across water as readily as by land; and of the vigilance of all dogs by night every traveller among Southern plantations has ample demonstration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1495"/>I was now so near that I could dimly see the figures of men moving to and fro upon the end of the causeway, and could hear the dull knock, when <num value="1">one</num> struck his foot against a piece of timber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1496"/><pb id="p.159" n="159"/> </p> 
<p>As my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> object was to ascertain whether there were sentinels at that time at that precise point, I saw that I was approaching the end of my experiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1497"/>Could I have once reached the causeway unnoticed, I could have lurked in the water beneath its projecting timbers, and perhaps made my way along the main shore, as I had known fugitive slaves to do, while coming from that side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1498"/>Or had there been any ripple on the water, to confuse the aroused and watchful eyes, I could have made a circuit and approached the causeway at another point, though I had already satisfied myself that there was only a narrow channel on each side of it, even at high tide, and not, as on our side, a broad expanse of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1499"/>Indeed, this knowledge alone was worth all the trouble I had taken, and to attempt much more than this, in the face of a curiosity already roused, would have been a waste of future opportunities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1500"/>I could try again, with the benefit of this new knowledge, on a point where the statements of the negroes had always been contradictory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1501"/>Resolving, however, to continue the observation a very little longer, since the water felt much warmer than I had expected, and there was no sense of chill or fatigue, I grasped at some wisps of straw or rushes that floated near, gathering them round my face a little, and then drifting nearer the wharf in what seemed a sort of eddy was able, without creating further alarm, to make some additional observations on points which it is not best now to particularize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1502"/>Then, turning my back upon the mysterious shore which had thus far lured me, I sank softly below the surface, and swam as far as I could under water. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1503"/>During this unseen retreat, I heard, of course, all manner of gurglings and hollow reverberations, and could <pb id="p.160" n="160"/> fancy as many rifle-shots as I pleased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1504"/>But on rising to the surface all seemed quiet, and even I did not create as much noise as I should have expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1505"/>I was now at a safe distance, since the enemy were always chary of showing their boats, and always tried to convince us they had none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1506"/>What with absorbed attention <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and this submersion afterwards, I had lost all my bearings but the stars, having been long out of sight of my original point of departure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1507"/>However, the difficulties of the return were nothing; making a slight allowance for the flood-tide, which could not yet have turned, I should soon regain the place I had left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1508"/>So I struck out freshly against the smooth water, feeling just a little stiffened by the exertion, and with an occasional chill running up the back of the neck, but with no nips from sharks, no nudges from alligators, and not a symptom of fever-and-ague. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1509"/>Time I could not, of course, measure,--<num value="1">one</num> never can in a novel position; but, after a reasonable amount of swimming, I began to look, with a natural interest, for the pier which I had quitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1510"/>I noticed, with some solicitude, that the woods along the friendly shore made <num value="1">one</num> continuous shadow, and that the line of low bushes on the long causeway could scarcely be relieved against them, yet I knew where they ought to be, and the more doubtful I felt about it, the more I put down my doubts, as if they were unreasonable children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1511"/><num value="1">One</num> can scarcely conceive of the alteration made in familiar objects by bringing the eye as low as the horizon, especially by night; to distinguish foreshortening is impossible, and every low near object is equivalent to <num value="1">one</num> higher and more remote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1512"/>Still I had the stars; and soon my eye, more practised, was enabled to select <num value="1">one</num> precise line of bushes as that which marked the causeway, and for which I must direct my course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1513"/><pb id="p.161" n="161"/> </p> 
<p>As I swam steadily, but with some sense of fatigue, towards this phantom-line, I found it difficult to keep my faith steady and my progress true; everything appeared to shift and waver, in the uncertain light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1514"/>The distant trees seemed not trees, but bushes, and the bushes seemed not exactly bushes, but might, after all, be distant trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1515"/>Could I be so confident that, out of all that low stretch of shore, I could select the <num value="1">one</num> precise point where the friendly causeway stretched its long arm to receive me from the water?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1516"/>How easily (some tempter whispered at my ear) might <num value="1">one</num> swerve a little, on either side, and be compelled to flounder over half a mile of oozy marsh on an ebbing tide, before reaching our own shore and that hospitable volley of bullets with which it would probably greet me!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1517"/>Had I not already (thus the tempter continued) been swimming rather unaccountably far, supposing me on a straight track for that inviting spot where my sentinels and my drapery were awaiting my return? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1518"/>Suddenly I felt a sensation as of fine ribbons drawn softly across my person, and I found myself among some rushes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1519"/>But what business had rushes there, or I among them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1520"/>I knew that there was not a solitary spot of shoal in the deep channel where I supposed myself swimming, and it was plain in an instant that I had somehow missed my course, and must be getting among, the marshes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1521"/>I felt confident, to be sure, that I could not have widely erred, but was guiding my course for the proper side of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1522"/>But whether I had drifted above or below the causeway I had not the slightest clew to tell. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1523"/>I pushed steadily forward, with some increasing sense of lassitude, passing <num value="1">one</num> marshy islet after another, all <pb id="p.162" n="162"/> seeming strangely out of place, and sometimes just reaching with my foot a soft tremulous shoal which gave scarce the shadow of a support, though even that shadow rested my feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1524"/>At <num value="1">one</num> of these moments of stillness it suddenly occurred to my perception (what nothing but this slight contact could have assured me, in the darkness) that I was in a powerful current, and that this current set <hi rend="italics">the wrong way</hi>. Instantly a flood of new intelligence came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1525"/>Either I had unconsciously turned and was rapidly nearing the <rs>Rebel</rs> shore,--a suspicion which a glance at the stars corrected,--or else it was the tide itself which had turned, and which was sweeping me down the river with all its force, and was also sucking away at every moment the narrowing water from that treacherous expanse of mud out of whose horrible miry embrace I had lately helped to rescue a shipwrecked crew. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1526"/>Either alternative was rather formidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1527"/>I can distinctly remember that for about <num value="0.5">one half</num>-minute the whole vast universe appeared to swim in the same watery uncertainty in which I floated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1528"/>I began to doubt everything, to distrust the stars, the line of low bushes for which I was wearily striving, the very land on which they grew, if such visionary things could be rooted anywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/>Doubts trembled in my mind like the weltering water, and that awful sensation of having <num value="1">one</num>'s feet unsupported, which benumbs the spent swimmer's heart, seemed to clutch at mine, though not yet to enter it. I was more absorbed in that singular sensation of nightmare, such as <num value="1">one</num> may feel equally when lost by land or by water, as if <num value="1">one</num>'s own position were all right, but the place looked for had somehow been preternaturally abolished out of the universe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1530"/>At best, might not a man in <pb id="p.163" n="163"/> the water lose all his power of direction, and so move in an endless circle until he sank exhausted?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1531"/>It required a deliberate and conscious effort to keep my brain quite cool.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1532"/>I have not the reputation of being of an excitable temperament, but the contrary; yet I could at that moment see my way to a condition in which <num value="1">one</num> might become insane in an instant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1533"/>It was as if a fissure opened somewhere, and I saw my way into a mad-house; then it closed, and everything went on as before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/>Once in my life I had obtained a slight glimpse of the same sensation, and then, too, strangely enough, while swimming, in the mightiest ocean-surge into which I had ever dared plunge my mortal body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/><persName n="Keats,,,,," id="n0021.0006.00163.00301" reg="mostcommon:Keats,nomatch:0"><surname>Keats</surname></persName> hints at the same sudden emotion, in a wild poem written among the <rs type="place">Scottish mountains</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/>It was not the distinctive sensation which drowning men are said to have, that spasmodic passing in review of <num value="1">one</num>'s whole personal history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/>I had no well-defined anxiety, felt no fear, was moved to no prayer, did not give a thought to home or friends; only it swept over me, as with a sudden tempest, that, if I meant to get back to my own camp, I must keep my wits about me. I must not dwell on any other alternative, any more than a boy who climbs a precipice must look down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>Imagination had no business here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>That way madness lay. There was a shore somewhere before me, and I must get to it, by the ordinary means, before the ebb laid bare the flats, or swept me below the lower bends of the stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>That was all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1541"/>Suddenly a light gleamed for an instant before me, as if from a house in a grove of great trees upon a bank; and I knew that it came from the window of a ruined plantation-building, where our most advanced outposts had their Headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1542"/>The flash revealed to me <pb id="p.164" n="164"/> every point of the situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/>I saw at once where I was, and how I got there: that the tide had turned while I was swimming, and with a much briefer interval of slack-water than I had been led to suppose,--that I had been swept a good way down stream, and was far beyond all possibility of regaining the point I had left. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1544"/>Could I, however, retain my strength to swim <num value="1">one</num> or <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> farther, of which I had no doubt,--and if the water did not ebb too rapidly, of which I had more fear,--then I was quite safe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1545"/>Every stroke took me more and more out of the power of the current, and there might even be an eddy to aid me. I could not afford to be carried down much farther, for there the channel made a sweep toward the wrong side of the river; but there was now no reason why I should not reach land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1546"/>I could dismiss all fear, indeed, except that of being fired upon by our own sentinels, many of whom were then new recruits, and with the usual disposition to shoot <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and investigate afterwards. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1547"/>I found myself swimming in shallow and shallower water, and the flats seemed almost bare when I neared the shore, where the great gnarled branches of the live oaks hung far over the muddy bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1548"/>Floating on my back for noiselessness, I paddled rapidly in with my hands, expecting momentarily to hear the challenge of the picket, and the ominous click so likely to follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1549"/>I knew that some <num value="1">one</num> should be pacing to and fro, along that beat, but could not tell at what point he might be at that precise moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1550"/>Besides, there was a faint possibility that some chatty corporal might have carried the news of my bath thus far along the line, and they might be partially prepared for this unexpected visitor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1551"/>Suddenly, like another flash, came the quick, quaint challenge,--<pb id="p.165" n="165"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1552"/><quote>Halt! Who's go dar?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1553"/></p> 
<p><quote> F-f-friend with the c-c-countersign,</quote> retorted I, with chilly, but conciliatory energy, rising at full length out of the shallow water, to show myself a man and a brother. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1554"/><quote>Ac-vance, friend, and give de countersign,</quote> responded the literal soldier, who at such a time would have accosted a spirit of light or goblin damned with no other formula. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1555"/>I advanced and gave it, he recognizing my voice at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1556"/>And then and there, as I stood, a dripping ghost, beneath the trees before him, the unconscionable fellow, wishing to exhaust upon me the utmost resources of military hospitality, deliberately presented arms! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1557"/>Now a soldier on picket, or at night, usually presents arms to nobody; but a sentinel on camp-guard by day is expected to perform that ceremony to anything in human shape that has <num value="2">two</num> rows of buttons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1558"/>Here was a human shape, but so utterly buttonless that it exhibited not even a rag to which a button could by any earthly possibility be appended, buttonless even potentially; and my blameless Ethiopian presented arms to even this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1559"/>Where, then, are the theories of <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0021.0006.00165.00302" reg="mostcommon:Carlyle,nomatch:0"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>, the axioms of <quote>Sartor Resartus,</quote> the inability of humanity to conceive <quote>a naked <rs type="role">Duke</rs> of Windlestraw addressing a naked <orgName n="House of Lords" type="government">House of Lords</orgName></quote> ? Cautioning my adherent, however, as to the proprieties suitable for such occasions thenceforward, I left him watching the river with renewed vigilance, and awaiting the next merman who should report himself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1560"/>Finding my way to the building, I hunted up a sergeant and a blanket, got a fire kindled in the dismantled chimney, and sat before it in my single garment, like a moist but undismayed <persName n="Choctaw,,,,," id="n0021.0006.00165.00303" reg="mostcommon:Choctaw,nomatch:0"><surname>Choctaw</surname></persName>, until horse and clothing could be brought round from the causeway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1561"/>It seemed <pb id="p.166" n="166"/> strange that the morning had not yet dawned, after the uncounted periods that must have elapsed; but when the wardrobe arrived I looked at my watch and found that my night in the water had lasted precisely <num value="1">one</num> hour. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1562"/>Galloping home, I turned in with alacrity, and without a drop of whiskey, and waked a few hours after in excellent condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1563"/>The rapid changes of which that Department has seen so many &mdash; and, perhaps, to so little purpose &mdash; soon transferred us to a different scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1564"/>I have been on other scouts since then, and by various processes, but never with a zest so novel as was afforded by that night's experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1565"/>The thing soon got wind in the regiment, and led to only <num value="1">one</num> ill consequence, so far as I know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1566"/>It rather suppressed a way I had of lecturing the officers on the importance of reducing their personal baggage to a minimum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1567"/>They got a trick of congratulating me, very respectfully, on the thoroughness with which I had once conformed my practice to my precepts. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1568"/>In reading military history, <num value="1">one</num> finds the main interest to lie, undoubtedly, in the great campaigns, where a man, a regiment, a brigade, is but a pawn in the game.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1569"/>But there is a charm also in the more free and adventurous life of partisan warfare, where, if the total sphere be humbler, yet the individual has more relative importance, and the sense of action is more personal and keen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1570"/>This is the reason given by the eccentric Revolutionary biographer, <persName n="Weems,,,,," id="n0021.0007.00167.00304" reg="mostcommon:Weems,nomatch:0"><surname>Weems</surname></persName>, for writing the <name>Life</name> of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and then that of <persName n="Marion,,,,," id="n0021.0007.00167.00305" reg="mostcommon:Marion,nomatch:0"><surname>Marion</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1571"/>And there were, certainly, in the early adventures of the colored troops in the <orgName>Department of the South</orgName>, some of the same elements of picturesqueness that belonged to <placeName reg="Marion, Marion, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096201">Marion</placeName>'s band, on the same soil, with the added feature that the blacks were fighting for their personal liberties, of which <persName n="Marion,,,,," id="n0021.0007.00167.00306" reg="mostcommon:Marion,nomatch:0"><surname>Marion</surname></persName> had helped to deprive them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1572"/>It is stated by <persName n="Gillmore,Major-General,,,," id="n0021.0007.00167.00307" reg="mostcommon:Gillmore,Q.,A.,,:1"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Gillmore</surname></persName>, in his <quote>Siege of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>,</quote> as <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="3">three</num> points in his preliminary strategy, that an expedition was sent up the <placeName key="tgn,1123652" n="1.000 14" reg="edisto, south carolina, united states">Edisto River</placeName> to destroy a bridge on the <orgName n="Charleston and Savannah Railroad" type="railroad">Charleston and Savannah Railway</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1573"/>As <num value="1">one</num> of the early raids of the colored troops, this expedition may deserve narration, though it was, in a strategic point of view, a disappointment.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1575"/>The project dated back earlier than <persName n="Gillmore,General,,,," id="n0021.0007.00167.00309" reg="mostcommon:Gillmore,Q.,A.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gillmore</surname></persName>'s <pb id="p.168" n="168"/> siege, and had originally no connection with that movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1576"/>It had been formed by <persName n="Trowbridge,Captain,,,," id="n0021.0007.00168.00310" reg="mostcommon:Trowbridge,Charles,T.,,:6"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Trowbridge</surname></persName> and myself in camp, and was based on facts learned from the men. <persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0021.0007.00168.00311" reg="mostcommon:Saxton,Rufus,,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName> and <persName n="Davis,Colonel,W.,W.,H.," id="n0021.0007.00168.00312" reg="default:Davis,W.,W.,H.,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, the successive post-commanders, had both favored it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1577"/>But as my main object was to obtain permission to go, I tried to make the most of all results which might follow, while it was very clear that the raid would harass and confuse the enemy, and be the means of bringing away many of the slaves.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1579"/>It must be remembered that, after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> capture of <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>, the outlying plantations along the whole Southern coast were abandoned, and the slaves withdrawn into the interior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1580"/>It was necessary to ascend some river for <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure> in order to reach the black population at all. This ascent could only be made by night, as it was a slow process, and the smoke of a steamboat could be seen for a great distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1581"/>The streams were usually shallow, winding, and muddy, and the difficulties of navigation were such as to require a full moon and a flood tide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1582"/>It was really no easy matter to bring everything to bear, especially as every projected raid must be kept a secret so far as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1583"/>However, we were now somewhat familiar with such undertakings, <pb id="p.169" n="169"/> half military, half naval, and the thing to be done on the <rs>Edisto</rs> was precisely what we had proved to be practicable on the <rs>St. Mary</rs>'s and the <rs>St. John</rs>'s,--to drop anchor before the enemy's door some morning at daybreak, without his having dreamed of our approach. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1584"/>Since a raid made by <persName n="Montgomery,Colonel,,,," id="n0021.0007.00169.00316" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,James,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Montgomery</surname></persName> up the <rs>Combahee</rs>, <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> before, the vigilance of the <rs>Rebels</rs> had increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1585"/>But we had information that upon the <rs>South Edisto</rs>, or <placeName reg="South Edisto River, South Carolina, United States" key="tgn,2677842">Pon-Pon River</placeName>, the rice plantations were still being actively worked by a large number of negroes, in reliance on obstructions placed at the mouth of that narrow stream, where it joins the main river, some <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure> from the coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1586"/>This point was known to be further protected by a battery of unknown strength, at <placeName reg="Wiltown Bluff">Wiltown Bluff</placeName>, a commanding and defensible situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1587"/>The obstructions consisted of a row of strong wooden piles across the river; but we convinced ourselves that these must now be much decayed, and that <persName n="Trowbridge,Captain,,,," id="n0021.0007.00169.00317" reg="mostcommon:Trowbridge,Charles,T.,,:6"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Trowbridge</surname></persName>, an excellent engineer officer, could remove them by the proper apparatus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1588"/>Our proposition was to man the <rs>John Adams</rs>, an armed ferry-boat, which had before done us much service,--and which has now reverted to the pursuits of peace, it is said, on the <placeName key="tgn,7015009" n="1.000 4" reg="east boston, boston, suffolk">East Boston</placeName> line,--to ascend in this to <placeName reg="Wiltown Bluff">Wiltown Bluff</placeName>, silence the battery, and clear a passage through the obstructions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1589"/>Leaving the <rs>John Adams</rs> to protect this point, we could then ascend the smaller stream with <num value="2">two</num> light-draft boats, and perhaps burn the bridge, which was <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> higher, before the enemy could bring sufficient force to make our position at <placeName reg="Wiltown Bluff">Wiltown Bluff</placeName> untenable. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1595"/>In former narrations I have sufficiently described the charm of a moonlight ascent into a hostile country, upon an unknown stream, the dark and silent banks, the rippling water, the wail of the reed-birds, the anxious watch, the breathless listening, the veiled lights, the whispered orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1596"/>To this was now to be added the vexation of an insufficient pilotage, for our negro guide knew only the upper river, and, as it finally proved, not even that, while, to take us over the bar which obstructed the main stream, we must borrow a pilot from <persName n="Dutch,,Captain,,," id="n0021.0007.00170.00321" reg="default:Dutch,Captain,,,"><foreName>Captain</foreName> <surname>Dutch</surname></persName>, whose gunboat blockaded that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1597"/>This active naval officer, however, whose boat expeditions had penetrated all the lower branches of those rivers, could supply our want, and we borrowed from him not only a pilot, but a surgeon, to replace our own, who had been prevented by an accident from coming with us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1600"/>The only course was to land, under cover of the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1601"/>As the firing ceased and the smoke cleared away, I looked across the rice-fields which lay beneath the bluff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/>Such emotions as these, no doubt, were inspired by our arrival, but we could only hear their hasty utterance in passing; our duty being, with the small force already landed, to take possession of the bluff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>Ascending, with proper precautions, the wooded hill, we soon found ourselves in the deserted camp of a <orgName n="Light Battery" type="battery">light battery</orgName>, amid scattered equipments and suggestions of a very unattractive breakfast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/>As soon as possible, skirmishers were thrown out through the woods to the farther edge of the bluff, while a party searched the houses, finding the usual large supply of furniture and pictures,--brought up for safety from below,--but no soldiers.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1663"/>Again I had the exciting sensation of being within the <pb id="p.175" n="175"/> hostile lines,--the eager explorations, the doubts, the watchfulness, the listening for every sound of coming hoofs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1664"/>Presently a horse's tread was heard in earnest, but it was a squad of our own men bringing in <measure n="2" type="captured">two captured</measure> cavalry soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1665"/><num value="1">One</num> of these, a sturdy fellow, submitted quietly to his lot, only begging that, whenever we should evacuate the bluff, a note should be left behind stating that he was a prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1666"/>The other, a very young man, and a member of the <quote>Rebel Troop,</quote> a sort of <orgName n="Cadet Corps" type="corps">Cadet corps</orgName> among the <rs>Charleston</rs> youths, came to me in great wrath, complaining that the corporal of our squad had kicked him after he had surrendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>His air of offended pride was very rueful, and it did indeed seem a pathetic reversal of fortunes for the <num value="2">two</num> races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>To be sure, the youth was a scion of <num value="1">one</num> of the foremost families of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, and when I considered the wrongs which the black race had encountered from those of his blood, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and last, it seemed as if the most scrupulous Recording Angel might tolerate <num value="1">one</num> final kick to square the account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1669"/>But I reproved the corporal, who respectfully disclaimed the charge, and said the kick was an incident of the scuffle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1670"/>It certainly was not their habit to show such poor malice; they thought too well of themselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1671"/>His demeanor seemed less lofty, but rather piteous, when he implored me not to put him on board any vessel which was to ascend the upper stream, and hinted, by awful implications, the danger of such ascent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>This meant torpedoes, a peril which we treated, in those days, with rather mistaken contempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1673"/>But we found none on the <rs>Edisto</rs>, and it may be that it was only a foolish attempt to alarm us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1674"/>Meanwhile, <persName n="Trowbridge,,,,," id="n0021.0007.00175.00333" reg="mostcommon:Trowbridge,Charles,T.,,:6"><surname>Trowbridge</surname></persName> was toiling away at the row <pb id="p.176" n="176"/> of piles, which proved easier to draw out than to saw asunder, either work being hard enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/>It took far longer than we had hoped, and we saw noon approach and the tide rapidly fall, taking with it, inch by inch, our hopes of effecting a surprise at the bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1676"/>During this time, and indeed all day, the detachments on shore, under <persName n="Whitney,Captain,,,," id="n0021.0007.00176.00334" reg="mostcommon:Whitney,H.,A.,,:3"><roleName n="Captain">Captains</roleName> <surname>Whitney</surname></persName> and <persName n="Sampson,Captain,,,," id="n0021.0007.00176.00335" reg="mostcommon:Sampson,William,W.,,:4"><roleName n="Captain"></roleName><surname>Sampson</surname></persName>, were having occasional skirmishes with the enemy, while the colored people were swarming to the shore, or running to and fro like ants, with the poor treasures of their houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1677"/>Our busy Quartermaster, <persName n="Bingham,Mister,,,," id="n0021.0007.00176.00336" reg="mostcommon:Bingham,J.,M.,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bingham</surname></persName>--who died afterwards from the overwork of that sultry day &mdash; was transporting the refugees on board the steamer, or hunting up bales of cotton, or directing the burning of rice-houses, in accordance with our orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1678"/>No dwelling-houses were destroyed or plundered by our men,--<persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0021.0007.00176.00337" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:1"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s <quote>bummers</quote> not having yet arrived,--though I asked no questions as to what the plantation negroes might bring in their great bundles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1680"/>That I have retained, not without some satisfaction, to this day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1681"/>A passage having been cleared at last, and the tide having turned by noon, we lost no time in attempting the ascent, leaving the bluff to be held by the <rs>John Adams</rs>, and by the small force on shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1682"/>We were scarcely above the obstructions, however, when the little tug went aground, and the <rs>Enoch Dean</rs>, ascending a mile farther, had an encounter with a battery on the right,--perhaps our old enemy,-- and drove it back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1683"/>Soon after, she also ran aground, a misfortune of which our opponent <pb id="p.177" n="177"/> strangely took no advantage; and, on getting off, I thought it best to drop down to the bluff again, as the tide was still hopelessly low. None can tell, save those who have tried them, the vexations of those muddy Southern streams, navigable only during a few hours of flood-tide. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1684"/>After waiting an hour, the <num value="2">two</num> small vessels again tried the ascent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1685"/>The enemy on the right had disappeared; but we could now see, far off on our left, another <orgName n="Light Battery" type="battery">light battery</orgName> moving parallel with the river, apparently to meet us at some upper bend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1686"/>But for the present we were safe, with the low rice-fields on each side of us; and the scene was so peaceful, it seemed as if all danger were done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1687"/>For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, we saw in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> blossoming river-banks and low emerald meadows, that seemed like <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1688"/>Everywhere there were the same rectangular fields, smooth canals, and bushy dikes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1689"/>A few negroes stole out to us in dugouts, and breathlessly told us how others had been hurried away by the overseers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1690"/>We glided safely on, mile after mile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1691"/>The day was unutterably hot, but all else seemed propitious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1692"/>The men had their combustibles all ready to fire the bridge, and our hopes were unbounded, But by degrees the channel grew more tortuous and difficult, and while the little <rs>Milton</rs> glided smoothly over everything, the <rs>Enoch Dean</rs>, my own boat, repeatedly grounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1693"/>On every occasion of especial need, too, something went wrong in her machinery,--her engine being constructed on some wholly new patent, of which, I should hope, this trial would prove entirely sufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1694"/>The black pilot, who was not a soldier, grew more and more bewildered, and declared that it was the channel, not his brain, which had gone wrong; the captain, a little <pb id="p.178" n="178"/> elderly man, sat wringing his hands in the pilot-box; and the engineer appeared to be mingling his groans with those of the diseased engine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1695"/>Meanwhile I, in equal ignorance of machinery and channel, had to give orders only justified by minute acquaintance with both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1696"/>So I navigated on general principles, until they grounded us on a mud-bank, just below a wooded point, and some <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> from the bridge of our destination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1697"/>It was with a pang that I waved to <persName n="Strong,Major,,,," id="n0021.0007.00178.00339" reg="mostcommon:Strong,John,D.,,:3"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Strong</surname></persName>, who was on the other side of the channel in a tug, not to risk approaching us, but to steam on and finish the work, if he could. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1698"/>Short was his triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1699"/>Gliding round the point, he found himself instantly engaged with a <orgName n="Light Battery" type="battery">light battery</orgName> of <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="6">six</num> guns, doubtless the same we had seen in the distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1700"/>The <rs>Milton</rs> was within <measure n="250yards" type="distance">two hundred and fifty yards</measure>. The <placeName key="tgn,7007159" n="1.000 1573" reg="connecticut">Connecticut</placeName> men fought their guns well, aided by the blacks, and it was exasperating for us to hear the shots, while we could see nothing and do nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1701"/>The scanty ammunition of our bow gun was exhausted, and the gun in the stern was useless, from the position in which we lay. In vain we moved the men from side to side, rocking the vessel, to dislodge it. The heat was terrific that <dateStruct><month>August</month></dateStruct> afternoon; I remember I found myself constantly changing places, on the scorched deck, to keep my feet from being blistered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1702"/>At last the officer in charge of the gun, a hardy lumberman from <placeName key="tgn,7007515" n="1.000 1232" reg="maine">Maine</placeName>, got the stern of the vessel so far round that he obtained the range of the battery through the cabin windows, <quote>but it would be necessary,</quote> he coolly added, on reporting to me this fact, <quote>to shoot away the corner of the cabin.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1703"/>I knew that this apartment was newly painted and gilded, and the idol of the poor captain's heart; but: <pb id="p.179" n="179"/> it was plain that even the thought of his own upholstery could not make the poor soul more wretched than he was. So I bade <persName n="Dolly,Captain,,,," id="n0021.0007.00179.00340" reg="mostcommon:Dolly,George,,,:2"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Dolly</surname></persName> blaze away, and thus we took our hand in the little game, though at a sacrifice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1704"/>It was of no use. Down drifted our little consort round the point, her engine disabled and her engineer killed, as we afterwards found, though then we could only look and wonder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1705"/>Still pluckily firing, she floated by upon the tide, which had now just turned; and when, with a last desperate effort, we got off, our engine had <num value="1">one</num> of its impracticable fits, and we could only follow her. The day was waning, and all its range of possibility had lain within the limits of that <num value="1">one</num> tide. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1706"/>All our previous expeditions had been so successful it now seemed hard to turn back; the river-banks and rice-fields, so beautiful before, seemed only a vexation now. But the swift current bore us on, and after our Parthian shots had died away, a new discharge of artillery opened upon us, from our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> antagonist of the morning, which still kept the other side of the stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1707"/>It had taken up a strong position on another bluff, almost out of range of the <rs>John Adams</rs>, but within easy range of us. The sharpest contest of the day was before us. Happily the engine and engineer were now behaving well, and we were steering in a channel already traversed, and of which the dangerous points were known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1708"/>But we had a long, straight reach of river before us, heading directly toward the battery, which, having once got our range, had only to keep it, while we could do nothing in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1709"/>The Rebels certainly served their guns well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1710"/>For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time I discovered that there were certain compensating advantages in a slightly built craft, as compared with <num value="1">one</num> more substantial; the missiles never lodged in <pb id="p.180" n="180"/> the vessel, but crashed through some thin partition as if it were paper, to explode beyond us, or fall harmless in the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1711"/>Splintering, the chief source of wounds and death in wooden ships, was thus entirely avoided; the danger was that our machinery might be disabled, or that shots might strike below the water-line and sink us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1712"/>This, however, did not happen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1713"/><num value="15">Fifteen</num> projectiles, as we afterwards computed, passed through the vessel or cut the rigging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1714"/>Yet few casualties occurred, and those instantly fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1715"/>As my orderly stood leaning on a comrade's shoulder, the head of the latter was shot off. At last I myself felt a sudden blow in the side, as if from some prize-fighter, doubling me up for a moment, while I sank upon a seat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1716"/>It proved afterwards to have been produced by the grazing of a ball, which, without tearing a garment, had yet made a large part of my side <rs type="color">black</rs> and <rs type="color">blue</rs>, leaving a sensation of paralysis which made it difficult to stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1717"/>Supporting myself on <persName n="Rogers,Captain,,,," id="n0021.0007.00180.00341" reg="mostcommon:Rogers,Seth,,,:3"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Rogers</surname></persName>, I tried to comprehend what had happened, and I remember being impressed by an odd feeling that I had now got my share, and should henceforth be a great deal safer than any of the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1718"/>I am told that this often follows <num value="1">one</num>'s <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> experience of a wound. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1719"/>But this immediate contest, sharp as it was, proved brief; a turn in the river enabled us to use our stern gun, and we soon glided into the comparative shelter of <placeName reg="Wiltown Bluff">Wiltown Bluff</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1720"/>There, however, we were to encounter the danger of shipwreck, superadded to that of fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1721"/>When the passage through the piles was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> cleared, it had been marked by stakes, lest the rising tide should cover the remaining piles, and make it difficult to run the passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1722"/>But when we again reached it, the stakes had somehow been knocked away, the piles were just covered <pb id="p.181" n="181"/> by the swift current, and the little tug-boat was aground upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1723"/>She came off easily, however, with our aid, and, when we in turn essayed the passage, we grounded also, but more firmly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1724"/>We getting off at last, and making the passage, the tug again became lodged, when nearly past danger, and all our efforts proved powerless to pull her through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1725"/>I therefore dropped down below, and sent the <rs>John Adams</rs> to her aid, while I superintended the final recall of the pickets, and the embarkation of the remaining refugees. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1726"/>While thus engaged, I felt little solicitude about the boats above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1727"/>It was certain that the <rs>John Adams</rs> could safely go close to the piles on the lower side, that she was very strong, and that the other was very light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1728"/>Still, it was natural to cast some anxious glances up the river, and it was with surprise that I presently saw a canoe descending, which contained <persName n="Strong,Major,,,," id="n0021.0007.00181.00342" reg="mostcommon:Strong,John,D.,,:3"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Strong</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1729"/>Coming on board, he told me with some excitement that the tug could not possibly be got off, and he wished for orders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1730"/>It was no time to consider whether it was not his place to have given orders, instead of going half a mile to seek them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1731"/>I was by this time so far exhausted that everything seemed to pass by me as by <num value="1">one</num> in a dream; but I got into a boat, pushed up stream, met presently the <rs>John Adams</rs> returning, and was informed by the officer in charge of the <placeName key="tgn,7007159" n="1.000 1573" reg="connecticut">Connecticut</placeName> battery that he had abandoned the tug, and &mdash; worse news yet &mdash; that his guns had been thrown overboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1732"/>It seemed to me then, and has always seemed, that this sacrifice was utterly needless, because, although the captain of the <rs>John Adams</rs> had refused to risk his vessel by going near enough to receive the guns, he should have been compelled to do so. Though the thing was done without my <pb id="p.182" n="182"/> knowledge, and beyond my reach, yet, as commander of the expedition, I was technically responsible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1733"/>It was hard to blame a lieutenant when his senior had shrunk from a decision, and left him alone; nor was it easy to blame <persName n="Strong,Major,,,," id="n0021.0007.00182.00343" reg="mostcommon:Strong,John,D.,,:3"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Strong</surname></persName>, whom I knew to be a man of personal courage, though without much decision of character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1734"/>He was subsequently tried by court-martial and acquitted, after which he resigned, and was lost at sea on his way home. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1735"/>The tug, being thus abandoned, must of course be burned to prevent her falling into the enemy's hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1737"/>Exhausted as I was, I could still observe, in a vague way, the scene around me. Every available corner of the boat seemed like some vast auction-room of <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-hand goods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1738"/>Great piles of bedding and bundles lay on every side, with black heads emerging and black forms reclining in every stage of squalidness.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1746"/>Thus we glided down the river in the waning light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1747"/>Once more we encountered a battery, making <num value="5">five</num> in all; I could hear the guns of the assailants, and could not distinguish the explosion of their shells from the answering throb of our own guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1748"/>The kind Quartermaster kept bringing me news of what occurred, like <persName><foreName>Rebecca</foreName></persName> in Front-de-Boeuf's castle, but discreetly withholding any actual casualties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1757"/>We were in our winter camp on <placeName reg="Port Royal Island, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2593932">Port Royal Island</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/>It was a lovely <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> morning, soft and spring-like; the mocking-birds were singing, and the cotton-fields still white with fleecy pods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>Morning drill was over, the men were cleaning their guns and singing very happily; the officers were in their tents, reading still more happily their letters just arrived from home. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>Suddenly I heard a knock at my tent-door, and the latch clicked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>It was the only latch in camp, and I was very proud of it, and the officers always clicked it as loudly as possible, in order to gratify my feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1773"/></p> 
<p><quote>But, my dear fellow,</quote> said I, rather anxiously, <quote>how <pb id="p.186" n="186"/> can you make the little thing comfortable in a tent, amidst these rigors of a <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> winter, when it is uncomfortably hot for drill at <time value="12pm">noon</time>, and ice forms by your bedside at night?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1774"/></p> 
<p><quote>Trust me for that,</quote> said the delighted papa, and went off whistling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1775"/>I could hear him telling the same news to <num value="3">three</num> others, at least, before he got to his own tent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1776"/>That day the preparations began, and soon his abode was a wonder of comfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1777"/>There were posts and rafters, and a raised floor, and a great chimney, and a door with hinges,--every luxury except a latch, and that he could not have, for mine was the last that could be purchased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1778"/><num value="1">One</num> of the regimental carpenters was employed to make a cradle, and another to make a bedstead high enough for the cradle to go under.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1779"/>Then there must be a bit of red carpet beside the bedstead, and thus the progress of splendor went on. The wife of <num value="1">one</num> of the colored sergeants was engaged to act as nursery-maid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1780"/>She was a very respectable young woman; the only objection to her being that she smoked a pipe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1781"/>But we thought that perhaps Baby might not dislike tobacco and if she did, she would have excellent opportunities to break the pipe in pieces. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1782"/>In due time the steamer arrived, and Baby and her mother were among the passengers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1783"/>The little recruit was soon settled in her new cradle, and slept in it as if she had never known any other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1784"/>The sergeant's wife soon had her on exhibition through the neighborhood, and from that time forward she was quite a queen among us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1785"/>She had sweet blue eyes and pretty brown hair, with round, dimpled cheeks, and that perfect dignity which is so beautiful in a baby.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1786"/>She hardly ever cried, and was <pb id="p.187" n="187"/> not at all timid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1787"/>She would go to anybody, and yet did not encourage any romping from any but the most intimate friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1788"/>She always wore a warm long-sleeved scarlet cloak with a hood, and in this costume was carried or <quote>toted,</quote> as the soldiers said, all about the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1789"/>At <quote>guard-mounting</quote> in the morning, when the men who are to go on guard duty for the day are drawn up to be inspected, Baby was always there, to help inspect them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1790"/>She did not say much, but she eyed them very closely, and seemed fully to appreciate their bright buttons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1791"/>Then the Officer-of-the-Day, who appears at guard-mounting with his sword and sash, and comes afterwards to the <rs>Colonel</rs>'s tent for orders, would come and speak to Baby on his way, and receive her orders <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1792"/>When the time came for drill she was usually present to watch the troops; and when the drum beat for dinner she liked to see the long row of men in each company march up to the cook-house, in single file, each with tin cup and plate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1793"/>During the day, in pleasant weather, she might be seen in her nurse's arms, about the company streets, the centre of an admiring circle, her scarlet costume looking very pretty amidst the shining black cheeks and neat blue uniforms of the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1794"/>At <quote>dress-parade,</quote> just before sunset, she was always an attendant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1795"/>As I stood before the regiment, I could see the little spot of red out of the corner of my eye, at <num value="1">one</num> end of the long line of men; and I looked with so much interest for her small person, that, instead of saying at the proper time, <quote>At &mdash; tention, battalion!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1797"/></p> 
<p>Our little lady was very impartial, and distributed her kind looks to everybody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/>She had not the slightest <pb id="p.188" n="188"/> prejudice against color, and did not care in the least whether her particular friends were <rs type="color">black</rs> or <rs type="color">white</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1799"/>Her especial favorites, I think, were the drummer-boys, who were not my favorites by any means, for they were a roguish set of scamps, and gave more trouble than all the grown men in the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1800"/>I think <persName><foreName>Annie</foreName></persName> liked them because they were small, and made a noise, and had red caps like her hood, and red facings on their jackets, and also because they occasionally stood on their heads for her amusement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1801"/>After dress-parade the whole drum-corps would march to the great flag-staff, and wait till just sunset-time, when they would beat <quote>the retreat,</quote> and then the flag would be hauled down,--a great festival for <persName><foreName>Annie</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1802"/>Sometimes the <rs type="role" reg="Sergeant-Major">Sergeant-Major</rs> would wrap her in the great folds of the flag, after it was taken down, and she would peep out very prettily from amidst the stars and stripes, like a new-born Goddess of Liberty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1803"/>About once a month, some inspecting officer was sent to the camp by the general in command, to see to the condition of everything in the regiment, from bayonets to buttons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1804"/>It was usually a long and tiresome process, and, when everything else was done, I used to tell the officer that I had <num value="1">one</num> thing more for him to inspect, which was peculiar to our regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1805"/>Then I would send for Baby to be exhibited, and I never saw an inspecting officer, old or young, who did not look pleased at the sudden appearance of the little, fresh, smiling creature,--a flower in the midst of war. And <persName><foreName>Annie</foreName></persName> in her turn would look at them, with the true baby dignity in her face,--that deep, earnest look which babies often have, and which people think so wonderful when <persName><foreName>Raphael</foreName></persName> paints it, although they might often see just <pb id="p.189" n="189"/> the same expression in the faces of their own darlings at home. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/>Meanwhile <persName><foreName>Annie</foreName></persName> seemed to like the camp style of housekeeping very much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1807"/>Her father's tent was double, and he used the front apartment for his office, and the inner room for parlor and bedroom; while the nurse had a separate tent and wash-room behind all. I remember that, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time I went there in the evening, it was to borrow some writing-paper; and while Baby's mother was hunting for it in the front tent, I heard a great cooing and murmuring in the inner room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1808"/>I asked if <persName><foreName>Annie</foreName></persName> was still awake, and her mother told me to go in and see. Pushing aside the canvas door, I entered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1809"/>No sign of anybody was to be seen; but a variety of soft little happy noises seemed to come from some unseen corner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1810"/><rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> C. came quietly in, pulled away the counterpane of her own bed, and drew out the rough cradle where lay the little damsel, perfectly happy, and wider awake than anything but a baby possibly can be. She looked as if the seclusion of a dozen family bedsteads would not be enough to discourage her spirits, and I saw that camp life was likely to suit her very well. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1811"/>A tent can be kept very warm, for it is merely a house with a thinner wall than usual; and I do not think that Baby felt the cold much more than if she had been at home that winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>The great trouble is, that a tent-chimney, not being built very high, is apt to smoke when the wind is in a certain direction; and when that happens it is hardly possible to stay inside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1813"/>So we used to build the chimneys of some tents on the east side, and those of others on the west, and thus some of the tents were always comfortable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1814"/>I have seen Baby's mother running in a hard rain, with little Red-Riding-<persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0021.0008.00189.00349" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> in <pb id="p.190" n="190"/> her arms, to take refuge with the <rs>Adjutant</rs>'s wife, when every other abode was full of smoke; and I must admit that there were <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> windy days that season when nobody could really keep warm, and <persName><foreName>Annie</foreName></persName> had to remain ignominiously in her cradle, with as many clothes on as possible, for almost the whole time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1815"/>The Quartermaster's tent was very attractive to us in the evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1816"/>I remember that once, on passing near it after nightfall, I heard our <rs type="role2">Major</rs>'s fine voice singing <name>Methodist</name> hymns within, and <rs type="role2">Mrs</rs>. C.&lsquo;s sweet tones chiming in. So I peeped through the outer door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1817"/>The fire was burning very pleasantly in the inner tent, and the scrap of new red carpet made the floor look quite magnificent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1818"/>The <rs>Major</rs> sat on a box, our surgeon on a stool; <quote>Q. M.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1819"/>and his wife, and the <rs>Adjutant</rs>'s wife, and <num value="1">one</num> of the captains, were all sitting on the bed, singing as well as they knew how; and the baby was under the bed. Baby had retired for the night, was overshadowed, suppressed, sat upon; the singing went on, and she had wandered away into her own land of dreams, nearer to heaven, perhaps, than any pitch their voices could attain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>I went in, and joined the party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1821"/>Presently the music stopped, and another officer was sent for, to sing some particular song.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/>At this pause the invisible innocent waked a little, and began to cluck and coo. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/><quote>It's the kitten,</quote> exclaimed somebody. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/><quote>It's my baby!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/>exclaimed <rs type="role2">Mrs</rs>. C. triumphantly, in that tone of unfailing personal pride which belongs to young mothers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1826"/>The people all got up from the bed for a moment, while <persName><foreName>Annie</foreName></persName> was pulled from beneath, wide awake and placid as usual; and she sat in <num value="1">one</num> lap or another during the rest of the concert, sometimes winking at the <pb id="p.191" n="191"/> candle, but usually listening to the songs, with a calm and critical expression, as if she could make as much noise as any of them, whenever she saw fit to try. Not a sound did she make, however, except <num value="1">one</num> little soft sneeze, which led to an immediate flood-tide of red shawl, covering every part of her but the forehead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1827"/>But I soon hinted that the concert had better be ended, because I knew from observation that the small damsel had carefully watched a regimental inspection and a brigade drill on that day, and that an interval of repose was certainly necessary. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1828"/><persName><foreName>Annie</foreName></persName> did not long remain the only baby in camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1829"/><num value="1">One</num> day, on going out to the stables to look at a horse, I heard a sound of baby-talk, addressed by some man to a child near by, and, looking round the corner of a tent, I saw that <num value="1">one</num> of the hostlers had something black and round, lying on the sloping side of a tent, with which he was playing very eagerly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1830"/>It proved to be his baby, a plump, shiny thing, younger than <persName><foreName>Annie</foreName></persName>; and I never saw,a merrier picture than the happy father frolicking with his child, while the mother stood quietly by. This was <rs n="Baby 2">Baby Number Two</rs>, and she stayed in camp several weeks, the <num value="2">two</num> innocents meeting each other every day, in the placid indifference that belonged to their years; both were happy little healthy things, and it never seemed to cross their minds that there was any difference in their complexions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1831"/>As I said before, <persName><foreName>Annie</foreName></persName> was not troubled by any prejudice in regard to color, nor do I suppose that the other little maiden was. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1832"/><persName><foreName>Annie</foreName></persName> enjoyed the tent-life very much; but when we were sent out on picket soon after, she enjoyed it still more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1833"/>Our Headquarters were at a deserted plantation house, with <num value="1">one</num> large parlor, a dining-room, and a few <pb id="p.192" n="192"/> bedrooms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1834"/>Baby's father and mother had a room up stairs, with a stove whose pipe went straight out at the window.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1835"/>This was quite comfortable, though half the windows were broken, and there was no glass and no glazier to mend them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1836"/>The windows of the large parlor were in much the same condition, though we had an immense fireplace, where we had a bright fire whenever it was cold, and always in the evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1837"/>The walls of this room were very dirty, and it took our ladies several days to cover all the unsightly places with wreaths and hangings of evergreen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1838"/>In this performance Baby took an active part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/>Her duties consisted in sitting in a great nest of evergreen, pulling and fingering the fragrant leaves, and occasionally giving a little cry of glee when she had accomplished some piece of decided mischief. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1840"/>There was less entertainment to be found in the camp itself at this time; but the household at Headquarters was larger than Baby had been accustomed to. We had a great deal of company, moreover, and she had quite a gay life of it. She usually made her appearance in the large parlor soon after breakfast; and to dance her for a few moments in our arms was <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> daily duties of each <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1841"/>Then the morning reports began to arrive from the different outposts,--a mounted officer or courier coming in from each place, dismounting at the door, and clattering in with jingling arms and spurs, each a new excitement for <persName><foreName>Annie</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1842"/>She usually got some attention from any officer who came, receiving with her wonted dignity any daring caress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1843"/>When the messengers had ceased to be interesting, there were always the horses to look at, held or tethered under the trees beside the sunny piazza.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1844"/>After the various couriers had been received, other messengers would be despatched to the <pb id="p.193" n="193"/> town, <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure> away, and Baby had all the excitement of their mounting and departure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/>Her father was often <num value="1">one</num> of the riders, and would sometimes seize <persName><foreName>Annie</foreName></persName> for a good-by kiss, place her on the saddle before him, gallop her round the house once or twice, and then give her back to her nurse's arms again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>She was perfectly fearless, and such boisterous attentions never frightened her, nor did they ever interfere with her sweet, infantine self-possession. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>After the riding-parties had gone, there was the piazza still for entertainment, with a sentinel pacing up and down before it; but <persName><foreName>Annie</foreName></persName> did not enjoy the sentinel, though his breastplate and buttons shone like gold, so much as the hammock which always hung swinging between the pillars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>It was a pretty hammock, with great open meshes; and she delighted to lie in it, and have the netting closed above her, so that she could only be seen through the apertures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1849"/>I can see her now, the fresh little rosy thing, in her blue and scarlet wrappings, with <num value="1">one</num> round and dimpled arm thrust forth through the netting, and the other grasping an armful of blushing roses and fragrant magnolias.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1850"/>She looked like those pretty <name>French</name> bas-reliefs of Cupids imprisoned in baskets, and peeping through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1851"/>That hammock was a very useful appendage; it was a couch for us, a cradle for Baby, a nest for the kittens; and we had, moreover, a little hen, which tried to roost there every night. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1852"/>When the mornings were colder, and the stove up stairs smoked the wrong way, Baby was brought down in a very incomplete state of toilet, and finished her dressing by the great fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1853"/>We found her bare shoulders very becoming, and she was very much interested in her own little pink toes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1854"/>After a very slow dressing, she <pb id="p.194" n="194"/> had a still slower breakfast out of a tin cup of warm milk, of which she generally spilt a good deal, as she had much to do in watching everybody who came into the room, and seeing that there was no mischief done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/>Then she would be, placed on the floor, on our only piece of carpet, and the kittens would be brought in for her to play with. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>We had, at different times, a variety of pets, of whom <persName><foreName>Annie</foreName></persName> did not take much notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/>Sometimes we had young partridges, caught by the drummer-boys in trap-cages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1858"/>The children called them <quote><persName><foreName>Bob</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Chloe,,,,," id="n0021.0008.00194.00350" reg="mostcommon:Chloe,nomatch:0"><surname>Chloe</surname></persName>,</quote> because the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> notes of the male and female sound like those names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/><num value="1">One</num> day I brought home an opossum, with her blind bare little young clinging to the droll pouch where their mothers keep them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>Sometimes we had pretty green lizards, their color darkening or deepening, like that of chameleons, in light or shade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1861"/>But the only pets that took Baby's fancy were the kittens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1862"/>They perfectly delighted her, from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> moment she saw them; they were the only things younger than herself that she had ever beheld, and the only things softer than themselves that her small hands had grasped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1863"/>It was astonishing to see how much the kittens would endure from her. They could scarcely be touched by any <num value="1">one</num> else without mewing; but when <persName><foreName>Annie</foreName></persName> seized <num value="1">one</num> by the head and the other by the tail, and rubbed them violently together, they did not make a sound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1864"/>I suppose that a baby's grasp is really soft, even if it seems ferocious, and so it gives less pain than <num value="1">one</num> would think.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1865"/>At any rate, the little animals had the best of it very soon; for they entirely outstripped <persName><foreName>Annie</foreName></persName> in learning to walk, and they could soon scramble away beyond her reach, while she sat in a sort of dumb despair, unable to <pb id="p.195" n="195"/> comprehend why anything so much smaller than herself should be so much nimbler.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1866"/>Meanwhile, the kittens would sit up and look at her with the most provoking indifference, just out of arm's length, until some of us would take pity on the young lady, and toss her furry playthings back to her again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1867"/><quote>Little baby,</quote> she learned to call them; and these were the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> words she spoke. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/>Baby had evidently a natural turn for war, further cultivated by an intimate knowledge of drills and parades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>The nearer she came to actual conflict the better she seemed to like it, peaceful as her own little ways might be. Twice, at least, while she was with us on picket, we had alarms from the <rs>Rebel</rs> troops, who would bring down cannon to the opposite side of the <rs type="place">Ferry</rs>, about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> beyond us, and throw shot and shell over upon our side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1870"/>Then the officer at the <rs type="place">Ferry</rs> would think that there was to be an attack made, and couriers would be sent, riding to and fro, and the men would all be called to arms in a hurry, and the ladies at Headquarters would all put on their best bonnets and come down stairs, and the ambulance would be made ready to carry them to a place of safety before the expected fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>On such occasions Baby was in all her glory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1872"/>She shouted with delight at being suddenly uncribbed and thrust into her little scarlet cloak, and brought down stairs, at an utterly unusual and improper hour, to a piazza with lights and people and horses and general excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1873"/>She crowed and gurgled and made gestures with her little fists, and screamed out what seemed to be her advice on the military situation, as freely as if she had been a newspaper editor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1874"/>Except that it was rather difficult to understand her precise directions, I do not know but the whole Rebel <pb id="p.196" n="196"/> force might have been captured through her plans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1875"/>And at any rate, I should much rather obey her orders than those of some generals whom I have known; for she at least meant no harm, and would lead <num value="1">one</num> into no mischief. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1876"/>However, at last the danger, such as it was, would be all over, and the ladies would be induced to go peacefully to bed again; and <persName><foreName>Annie</foreName></persName> would retreat with them to her ignoble cradle, very much disappointed, and looking vainly back at the more martial scene below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1877"/>The next morning she would seem to have forgotten all about it, and would spill her bread and milk by the fire as if nothing had happened. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1878"/>I suppose we hardly knew, at the time, how large a part of the sunshine of our daily lives was contributed by dear little <persName><foreName>Annie</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1879"/>Yet, when I now look back on that pleasant Southern home, she seems as essential a part of it as the mocking-birds or the magnolias, and I cannot convince myself that in returning to it I should not find her there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1880"/>But <persName><foreName>Annie</foreName></persName> went back, with the spring, to her Northern birthplace, and then passed away from this earth before her little feet had fairly learned to tread its paths; and when I meet her next it must be in some world where there is triumph without armies, and where innocence is trained in scenes of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1881"/>I know, however, that her little life, short as it seemed, was a blessing to us all, giving a perpetual image of serenity and sweetness, recalling the lovely atmosphere of far-off homes, and holding us by unsuspected ties to whatsoever things were pure. </p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1882"/>The war brought to some of us, besides its direct experiences, many a strange fulfilment of dreams of other days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1883"/>For instance, the present writer had been a faithful student of the <name>Scottish</name> ballads, and had always envied <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Walter</foreName></persName> the delight of tracing them out amid their own heather, and of writing them down piecemeal from the lips of aged crones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1884"/>It was a strange enjoyment, therefore, to be suddenly brought into the midst of a kindred world of unwritten songs, as simple and indigenous as the <rs>Border Minstrelsy</rs>, more uniformly plaintive, almost always more quaint, and often as essentially poetic. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1885"/>This interest was rather increased by the fact that I had for many years heard of this class of songs under the name of <quote>Negro Spirituals,</quote> and had even heard some of them sung by friends from <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1886"/>I could now gather on their own soil these strange plants, which I had before seen as in museums alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1887"/>True, the individual songs rarely coincided; there was a line here, a chorus there,--just enough to fix the class, but this was unmistakable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1888"/>It was not strange that they differed, for the range seemed almost endless, and <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> seemed to have nothing but the generic character in common, until all were mingled in the united stock of camp-melodies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1889"/>Often in the starlit evening I have returned from some lonely ride by the swift river, or on the plover-haunted <pb id="p.198" n="198"/> barrens, and, entering the camp, have silently approached some glimmering fire, round which the dusky figures moved in the rhythmical barbaric dance the negroes call a <quote>shout,</quote> chanting, often harshly, but always in the most perfect time, some monotonous refrain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1890"/>Writing down in the darkness, as I best could,--perhaps with my hand in the safe covert of my pocket,--the words of the song, I have afterwards carried it to my tent, like some captured bird or insect, and then, after examination, put it by. Or, summoning <num value="1">one</num> of the men at some period of leisure,--<persName n="Sutton,Corporal,Robert,,," id="n0021.0009.00198.00351" reg="default:Sutton,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Corporal">Corporal</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName> <surname>Sutton</surname></persName>, for instance, whose iron memory held all the details of a song as if it were a ford or a forest,--I have completed the new specimen by supplying the absent parts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1891"/>The music I could only retain by ear, and though the more common strains were repeated often enough to fix their impression, there were others that occurred only once or twice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/>The words will be here given, as nearly as possible, in the original dialect; and if the spelling seems sometimes inconsistent, or the misspelling insufficient, it is because I could get no nearer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>I wished to avoid what seems to me the only error of <placeName reg="Lowell, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013975">Lowell</placeName>'s <quote><persName n="Biglow,,,,," id="n0021.0009.00198.00352" reg="mostcommon:Biglow,nomatch:0"><surname>Biglow</surname></persName> papers</quote> in respect to-dialect,--the occasional use of an extreme misspelling, which merely confuses the eye, without taking us any closer to the peculiarity of sound. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/>The favorite song in camp was the following,--sung with no accompaniment but the measured clapping of hands and the clatter of many feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1895"/>It was sung perhaps twice as often as any other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1896"/>This was partly due to the fact that it properly consisted of a chorus alone, with which the verses of other songs might be combined at random.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2245"/>In the streets of <placeName reg="Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013364">Beaufort</placeName> I had met <persName n="Shaw,Colonel,,,," id="n0021.0010.00225.00417" reg="mostcommon:Shaw,R.,G.,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Shaw</surname></persName>, riding with his lieutenant-colonel and successor, <persName n="Hallowell,,Edward,,," id="n0021.0010.00225.00418" reg="default:Hallowell,Edward,,,"><foreName>Edward</foreName> <surname>Hallowell</surname></persName>, and had gone back with them to share their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meal in camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2246"/>I should have known <persName n="Shaw,,,,," id="n0021.0010.00225.00419" reg="mostcommon:Shaw,R.,G.,,:1"><surname>Shaw</surname></persName> anywhere by his resemblance to his kindred, nor did it take long to perceive that he shared their habitual truthfulness and courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2247"/>Moreover, he and <persName n="Hallowell,,,,," id="n0021.0010.00225.00420" reg="nearbymention:Hallowell,Edward,,,"><surname>Hallowell</surname></persName> had already got beyond the commonplaces of inexperience, in regard to colored troops, and, for a wonder, asked only sensible questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2248"/>For instance, he admitted the mere matter of courage to be settled, as regarded the colored <pb id="p.226" n="226"/> troops, and his whole solicitude bore on this point,--Would they do as well in line-of-battle as they had already done in more irregular service, and on picket and guard duty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2249"/>Of this I had, of course, no doubt, nor, I think, had he; though I remember his saying something about the possibility of putting them between <num value="2">two</num> fires in case of need, and so cutting off their retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2250"/>I should never have thought of such a project, but I could not have expected him to trust them as I did, until he had been actually under fire with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2251"/>That, doubtless, removed all his anxieties, if he really had any. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2252"/>This interview had occurred on the <dateStruct value="-06-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2253"/><persName n="Shaw,,,,," id="n0021.0010.00226.00421" reg="mostcommon:Shaw,R.,G.,,:1"><surname>Shaw</surname></persName> and his regiment had very soon been ordered to <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, then to <placeName reg="Morris Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2525074">Morris Island</placeName>; <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 107" reg="morris island, charleston, south carolina">Fort Wagner</placeName> had been assaulted, and he had been killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2254"/>Most of the men knew about the circumstances of his death, and many of them had subscribed towards a monument for him,--a project which originated with <persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0021.0010.00226.00422" reg="mostcommon:Saxton,Rufus,,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName>, and which was finally embodied in the <quote><placeName reg="Shaw school">Shaw school</placeName>-house</quote> at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2255"/>So it gave us all pleasure to name this camp for him, as its predecessor had been named for <persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0021.0010.00226.00423" reg="mostcommon:Saxton,Rufus,,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2256"/>The new camp was soon brought into good order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2257"/>The men had great ingenuity in building screens and shelters of light poles, filled in with the gray moss from the live-oaks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2258"/>The officers had vestibules built in this way, before all their tents; the cooking-places were walled round in the same fashion; and some of the wide company-streets had sheltered sidewalks down the whole line of tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2259"/>The sergeant on duty at the entrance of the camp had a similar bower, and the architecture culminated in a <quote><placeName reg="Praise-house">Praise-house</placeName></quote> for school and prayer-meetings, some <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure> in diameter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2260"/>As for chimneys <pb id="p.227" n="227"/> and flooring, they were provided with that magic and invisible facility which marks the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> year of a regiment's life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2261"/>That officer is happy who, besides a constitutional love of adventure, has also a love for the details of camp life, and likes to bring them to perfection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2262"/>Nothing but a hen with her chickens about her can symbolize the content I felt on getting my scattered companies together, after some temporary separation on picket or fatigue duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2263"/>Then we went to work upon the nest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2264"/>The only way to keep a camp in order is to set about everything as if you expected to stay there forever; if you stay, you get the comfort of it; if ordered away in <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>, you forget all wasted labor in the excitement of departure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2265"/>Thus viewed, a camp is a sort of model farm or bit of landscape gardening; there is always some small improvement to be made, a trench, a well, more shade against the sun, an increased vigilance in sweeping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2266"/>Then it is pleasant to take care of the men, to sea them happy, to hear them purr. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2267"/>Then the duties of inspection and drill, suspended during active service, resume their importance with a month or <num value="2">two</num> of quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2268"/>It really costs unceasing labor to keep a regiment in perfect condition and ready for service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2269"/>The work is made up of minute and endless details, like a bird's pruning her feathers or a cat's licking her kittens into their proper toilet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2270"/>Here are <num value="800">eight hundred</num> men, every <num value="1">one</num> of whom, every <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> at farthest, must be perfectly <foreign lang="fr">soigne</foreign> in all personal proprieties; he must exhibit himself provided with every article of clothing, buttons, shoe-strings, hooks and eyes, company letter, regimental number, rifle, bayonet, bayonet-scabbard, cap-pouch, cartridge-box, cartridgebox <pb id="p.228" n="228"/> belt, cartridge-box belt-plate, gun-sling, canteen, haversack, knapsack, packed according to rule, <num value="40">forty</num> cartridges, <num value="40">forty</num> <rs n="percussion caps" type="product">percussion caps</rs>; and every <num value="1">one</num> of these articles polished to the highest brightness or blackness as the case may be, and moreover hung or slung or tied or carried in precisely the correct manner. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2271"/>What a vast and formidable housekeeping is here, my patriotic sisters!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2272"/>Consider, too, that every corner of the camp is to be kept absolutely clean and ready for exhibition at the shortest notice; hospital, stables, guardhouse, cook-houses, company tents, must all be brought to perfection, and every square inch of this <quote>farm of <measure n="4acres" type="area">four acres</measure></quote> must look as smooth as an English lawn, twice a day. All this, beside the discipline and the drill and the regimental and company books, which must keep rigid account of all these details; consider all this, and then wonder no more that officers and men rejoice in being ordered on active service, where a few strokes of the pen will dispose of all this multiplicity of trappings as <quote>expended in action</quote> or <quote>lost in service.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2273"/></p> 
<p>For <num value="1">one</num>, the longer I remained in service, the better I appreciated the good sense of most of the regular army niceties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2274"/>True, these things must all vanish when the time of action comes, but it is these things that have prepared you for action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2275"/>Of course, if you dwell on them only, military life becomes millinery life alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2276"/><persName n="Kinglake,,,,," id="n0021.0010.00228.00424" reg="mostcommon:Kinglake,nomatch:0"><surname>Kinglake</surname></persName> says that the <rs>Russian</rs> <persName n="Constantine,Grand Duke,,,," id="n0021.0010.00228.00425" reg="mostcommon:Constantine,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Grand Duke">Grand-Duke</roleName> <surname>Constantine</surname></persName>, contemplating his beautiful toy-regiments, said that he dreaded war, for he knew that it would spoil the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2277"/>The simple fact is, that a soldier is like the weapon he carries; service implies soiling, but you must have it clean in advance, that when soiled it may be of some use. <pb id="p.229" n="229"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2278"/>The men had that year a Christmas present which they enjoyed to the utmost,--furnishing the detail, every other day, for <orgName n="Provost Guard" type="guard">provost-guard</orgName> duty in <placeName reg="Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013364">Beaufort</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2279"/>It was the only military service which they had ever shared within the town, and it moreover gave a sense of self-respect to be keeping the peace of their own streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2280"/>I enjoyed seeing them put on duty those mornings; there was such a twinkle of delight in their eyes, though their features were immovable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2281"/>As the <quote>reliefs</quote> went round, posting the guard, under charge of a corporal, <num value="1">one</num> could watch the black sentinels successively dropped and the whites picked up,--gradually changing the complexion, like <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Somebody</foreName></persName>'s black stockings which became white stockings,--till at last there was only a squad of white soldiers obeying the <quote>Support arms!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2282"/>Forward, <dateStruct><month>March</month></dateStruct>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2283"/>of a black corporal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2284"/>Then, when once posted, they glorified their office, you may be sure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2285"/>Discipline had grown rather free-and-easy in the town about that time, and it is said that the guard-house never was so full within human memory as after their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> tour of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2286"/>I remember hearing that <num value="1">one</num> young reprobate, son of a leading Northern philanthropist in those parts, was much aggrieved at being taken to the lock &mdash; up merely because he was found drunk in the streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2287"/><quote>Why,</quote> said he, <quote>the white corporals always showed me the way home.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2288"/>And I can testify that, after an evening party, some weeks later, I heard with pleasure the officers asking eagerly for the countersign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2289"/><quote>Who has the countersign?;</quote> said they.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2290"/><quote>The darkeys are on guard to-night, and we must look out for our lives.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2291"/>Even after a Christmas party at <persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0021.0010.00229.00426" reg="mostcommon:Saxton,Rufus,,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName>'s, the guard at the door very properly refused to let the ambulance be brought <pb id="p.230" n="230"/> round from the stable for the ladies because the driver had not the countersign. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2292"/><num value="1">One</num> of the sergeants of the guard, on <num value="1">one</num> of these occasions, made to <num value="1">one</num> who questioned his authority an answer that could hardly have been improved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2293"/>The questioner had just been arrested for some offence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2294"/><quote>Know what dat mean?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2295"/>said the indignant sergeant, pointing to the chevrons on his own sleeve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2296"/><quote>Dat mean <hi rend="italics">Guv'ment</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2297"/>Volumes could not have said more, and the victim collapsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2298"/>The thing soon settled itself, and nobody remembered to notice whether the face beside the musket of a sentinel were <rs type="color">white</rs> or <rs type="color">black</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2299"/>It meant Government, all the same. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2300"/>The men were also indulged with several raids on the main-land, under the direction of <persName n="Bryant,Captain,J.,E.,," id="n0021.0010.00230.00427" reg="default:Bryant,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Bryant</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="ME8">Eighth Maine</orgName>, the most experienced scout in that region, who was endeavoring to raise by enlistment a regiment of colored troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2301"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion <persName n="Whitney,Captain,,,," id="n0021.0010.00230.00428" reg="nearbymention:Whitney,H.,A.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captains</roleName> <surname>Whitney</surname></persName> and <persName n="Heasley,Captain,,,," id="n0021.0010.00230.00429" reg="nearbymention:Heasley,Alexander,,,"><roleName n="Captain"></roleName><surname>Heasley</surname></persName>, with their companies, penetrated nearly to <placeName key="tgn,2589001" n="1.000 3" reg="pocotaligo, jasper, south carolina">Pocataligo</placeName>, capturing some pickets and bringing away all the slaves of a plantation,--the latter operation being entirely under the charge of <persName n="Williams,Sergeant,Harry,,," id="n0021.0010.00230.00430" reg="default:Williams,Harry,,,"><roleName n="Sergeant">Sergeant</roleName> <foreName>Harry</foreName> <surname>Williams</surname></persName> (<orgName type="company" n="Company K">Co.

The whole command was attacked on the return by a rebel force, which turned out to be what was called in those regions a <quote>dog-company,</quote> consisting of mounted riflemen with half a dozen trained bloodhounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2302"/>The men met these dogs with their bayonets, <measure n="4" type="killed">killed four</measure> or <num value="5">five</num> of their old tormentors with great relish, and brought away the carcass of <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2303"/>I had the creature skinned, and sent the skin to New York to be stuffed and mounted, meaning to exhibit it at the <orgName n="Sanitary Commission" type="commission">Sanitary Commission</orgName> Fair in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>; but it spoiled on the passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2304"/><pb id="p.231" n="231"/> These quadruped allies were not originally intended as <quote>dogs of war,</quote> but simply to detect fugitive slaves, and the men were delighted at this confirmation of their tales of dog-companies, which some of the officers had always disbelieved. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2305"/><persName n="Bryant,Captain,,,," id="n0021.0010.00231.00431" reg="nearbymention:Bryant,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Bryant</surname></persName>; during his scouting adventures, had learned to outwit these bloodhounds, and used his skill in eluding escape, during another expedition of the same kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2306"/>He was sent with <orgName n="company"><persName n="Metcalf,Captain,,,," id="n0021.0010.00231.00432" reg="nearbymention:Metcalf,L.,W.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Metcalf</surname></persName>'s company</orgName> far up the <placeName key="tgn,1123003" n="1.000 16" reg="combahee, south carolina, united states">Combahee River</placeName> to cut the telegraphic wires and intercept despatches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2307"/>Our adventurous chaplain and a telegraphic operator went with the party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2308"/>They ascended the river, cut the wires, and read the despatches for an hour or <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2309"/>Unfortunately, the attached wire was too conspicuously hung, and was seen by a passenger on the railway train in passing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2310"/>The train was stopped and a swift stampede followed; a squad of cavalry was sent in pursuit, and our chaplain, with <persName n="Osborn,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0021.0010.00231.00433" reg="mostcommon:Osborn,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Osborn</surname></persName>, of <persName n="Bryant,,,,," id="n0021.0010.00231.00434" reg="nearbymention:Bryant,J.,E.,,"><surname>Bryant</surname></persName>'s projected regiment, were captured; also <num value="1">one</num> private,--the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of our men who had ever been taken prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2311"/>In spite of an agreement at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to the contrary, our chaplain was held as prisoner of war, the only spiritual adviser in uniform, so far as I know, who had that honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2312"/>I do not know but his reverence would have agreed with <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n0021.0010.00231.00435" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><surname>Scott</surname></persName>'s pirate-lieutenant, that it was better to live as plain <persName n="Bunce,,Jack,,," id="n0021.0010.00231.00436" reg="default:Bunce,Jack,,,"><foreName>Jack</foreName> <surname>Bunce</surname></persName> than die as Frederick Altamont; but I am very sure that he would rather have been kept prisoner to the close of the war, as a combatant, than have been released on parole as a non-resistant. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2313"/>After his return, I remember, he gave the most animated accounts of the whole adventure, of which he had enjoyed every instant, from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> entrance on the <pb id="p.232" n="232"/> enemy's soil to the final capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2314"/>I suppose we should all like to tap the telegraphic wires anywhere and read our neighbor's messages, if we could only throw round this process the dignity of a Sacred Cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2315"/>This was what our good chaplain had done, with the same conscientious zest with which he had conducted his <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> foraging in <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2316"/>But he told me that nothing so impressed him on the whole trip as the sudden transformation in the black soldier who was taken prisoner with him. The chaplain at once adopted the policy, natural to him, of talking boldly and even defiantly to his captors, and commanding instead of beseeching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2317"/>He pursued the same policy always and gained by it, he thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2318"/>But the negro adopted the diametrically opposite policy, also congenial to his crushed race,--all the force seemed to go out of him, and he surrendered himself like a tortoise to be kicked and trodden upon at their will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2319"/>This manly, well-trained soldier at once became a slave again, asked no questions, and, if any were asked, made meek and conciliatory answers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2320"/>He did not know, nor did any of us know, whether he would be treated as a prisoner of war, or shot, or sent to a rice-plantation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2321"/>He simply acted according to the traditions of his race, as did the chaplain on his side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2322"/>In the end the soldier's cunning was vindicated by the result; he escaped, and rejoined us in <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, while the chaplain was imprisoned for a year. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2323"/>The men came back very much exhausted from this expedition, and those who were in the chaplain's squad narrowly escaped with their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2325"/>Some of these men had led such wandering lives, in woods and swamps, that to hunt them was like hunting an otter; shyness and concealment had grown to be their <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> nature. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2326"/>After these little episodes came <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2378"/>I sincerely hope the regiment would never behave after a defeat as they behaved then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2379"/>Every man seemed crushed, officers and soldiers alike; when they broke ranks, they went and lay down like sheep where their tents used to be, or wandered disconsolately about, looking for their stray belongings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2380"/>The <pb id="p.239" n="239"/> scene was so infinitely dolorous that it gradually put me in the highest spirits; the ludicrousness of the whole affair was so complete, there was nothing to do but laugh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2381"/>The horrible dust blew till every officer had some black spot on his nose which paralyzed pathos.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2382"/>Of course the only way was to set them all at work as soon as possible; and work them we did,--I at the camp and the <rs>Major</rs> at the wharf,-- loading and unloading wagons and just reversing all which the morning had done. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2383"/>The <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName> men were very considerate, and gave back most of what.they had taken, though many of our men were really too delicate or proud to ask or even take what they had once given to soldiers or to the colored people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2384"/>I had no such delicacy about my tent-frame, and by night things had resumed something of their old aspect, and cheerfulness was in part restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2385"/>Yet long after this I found <num value="1">one</num> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sergeant absolutely in tears,--a Florida man, most of whose kindred were up the <rs>St. John</rs>'s.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2386"/>No doubt my precarious health makes it now easier for me personally to remain here &mdash; easier on reflection at least-- than for the others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2387"/>At the same time <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> is fascinating, and offers not only adventure, but the command of a brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2397"/>All the collected flags of the garrison hung round and over us, as if the stars and stripes were devised for an ornament alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2435"/>We all admitted that it was a striking and comprehensive description. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2436"/>For instance, as to courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2437"/>So far as I have seen, the mass of men are naturally courageous up to a certain point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2438"/>A man seldom runs away from danger which he ought to face, unless others run; each is apt to keep with the mass, and colored soldiers have more than usual of this gregariousness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2439"/>In almost every regiment, <rs type="color">black</rs> or <rs type="color">white</rs>, there are a score or <num value="2">two</num> of men who are naturally daring, who really hunger after dangerous adventures, and are happiest when allowed to seek them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2440"/>Every commander gradually finds out who these men are, <pb id="p.245" n="245"/> and habitually uses them; certainly I had such, and I remember with delight their bearing, their coolness, and their dash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2441"/>Some of them were negroes, some mulattoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2442"/><num value="1">One</num> of them would have passed for white, with brown hair and blue eyes, while others were so black you could hardly see their features.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2443"/>These picked men varied in other respects too; some were neat and well-drilled soldiers, while others were slovenly, heedless fellows,--the despair of their officers at inspection, their pride on a raid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2444"/>They were the natural scouts and rangers of the regiment; they had the <num value="2">two</num>-o'clock-in-the-morning courage, which <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0021.0012.00245.00464" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> thought so rare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2445"/>The mass of the regiment rose to the same level under excitement, and were more excitable, I think, than whites, but neither more nor less courageous. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2446"/>Perhaps the best proof of a good average of courage among them was in the readiness they always showed for any special enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2447"/>I do not remember ever to have had the slightest difficulty in obtaining volunteers, but rather in keeping down the number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2448"/>The previous pages include many illustrations of this, as well as of their endurance of pain and discomfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2449"/>For instance, <num value="1">one</num> of my lieutenants, a very daring <persName><foreName>Irishman</foreName></persName>, who had served for <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> as a sergeant of <orgName n="Regular Artillery" type="artillery">regular artillery</orgName> in <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, <placeName reg="Utah" key="tgn,7007827">Utah</placeName>, and <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, said he had never been engaged in anything so risky as our raid up the <rs>St. Mary</rs>'s. But in truth it seems to me a mere absurdity to deliberately argue the question of courage, as applied to men among whom I waked and slept, day and night, for so many months together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2450"/>As well might he who has been wandering for years upon the desert, with a Bedouin escort, discuss the courage of the men whose tents have been his shelter and whose spears his guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2451"/>We, their <pb id="p.246" n="246"/> officers, did not go there to teach lessons, but to receive them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2452"/>There were more than a <num value="100">hundred</num> men in the ranks who had voluntarily met more dangers in their escape from slavery than any of my young captains had incurred in all their lives. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2453"/>There was a family named <persName n="Wilson,,,,," id="n0021.0012.00246.00465" reg="mostcommon:Wilson,Henry,,,:2"><surname>Wilson</surname></persName>, I remember, of which we had several representatives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2454"/><num value="3">Three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> brothers had planned an escape from the interior to our lines; they finally decided that the youngest should stay and take care of the old mother; the rest, with their sister and her children, came in a <quote>dug-out</quote> down <num value="1">one</num> of the rivers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2455"/>They were fired upon, again and again, by the pickets along the banks, until finally every man on board was wounded; and still they got safely through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2456"/>When the bullets began to fly about them, the woman shed tears, and her little girl of <num value="9">nine</num> said to her, <quote>Don't cry, mother, <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> will help you,</quote> and then the child began praying as the wounded men still urged the boat along.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2457"/>This the mother told me, but I had previously heard it from an officer who was on the gunboat that picked them up,--a big, rough man, whose voice fairly broke as he described their appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2458"/>He said that the mother and child had been hid for <measure n="9months" type="date">nine months</measure> in the woods before attempting their escape, and the child would speak to no <num value="1">one</num>,--indeed, she hardly would when she came to our camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2459"/>She was almost white, and this officer wished to adopt her, but the mother said, <quote>I would do anything but that for <hi rend="italics">oonah</hi>,</quote> --this being a sort of <name>Indian</name> formation of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-person-plural, such as they sometimes use.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2464"/>She had escaped from the main-land in a boat, with that child and another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2465"/>Her baby was shot dead in her arms, and she reached our lines with <num value="1">one</num> child safe on earth and the other in heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2467"/>There was another family of brothers in the regiment named <persName n="Miller,,,,," id="n0021.0012.00247.00469" reg="mostcommon:Miller,nomatch:0"><surname>Miller</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2468"/>Their grandmother, a fine-looking old woman, nearly <num value="70">seventy</num>, I should think, but erect as a pine-tree, used sometimes to come and visit them.

<p>I hardly need point out that my young lieutenants did not have to teach the principles of courage to this woman's grandchildren. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2476"/>I often asked myself why it was that, with this capacity of daring and endurance, they had not kept the land in a perpetual flame of insurrection; why, especially since the opening of the war, they had kept so still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2477"/>The answer was to be found in the peculiar temperament of the races, in their religious faith, and in the habit of patience that centuries had fortified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2478"/>The shrewder men all said substantially the same thing What was the use of insurrection, where everything was. against them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2479"/>They had no knowledge, no money, no arms, no drill, no organization,--above all, no mutual confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2480"/>It was the tradition among them that all insurrections were always betrayed by somebody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2481"/>They had no mountain passes to defend like the <name>Maroons</name> of <placeName reg="Jamaica, Queens, New York" key="tgn,7015863">Jamaica</placeName>, -no impenetrable swamps, like the <name>Maroons</name> of <placeName key="tgn,7015386" n="1.000 2" reg="suriname,south america">Surinam</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2482"/>Where they had these, even on a small scale, they had used them,--as in certain swamps round <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> and in the everglades of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, where they united with the <name>Indians</name>, and would stand fire-so I was told by <persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0021.0012.00248.00471" reg="mostcommon:Saxton,Rufus,,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName>, who had fought them there &mdash; when the <name>Indians</name> would retreat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2483"/>It always seemed to me that, had I been a slave, my life would have been <num value="1">one</num> long scheme of insurrection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2484"/>But I learned to respect the patient self-control of those who had waited till the course of events should open a better way. When it came they accepted it. Insurrection on their part would at once have divided the <rs>Northern</rs> sentiment; and a large part of our army would have joined with the <rs>Southern</rs> army to hunt them down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2485"/>By their waiting till we needed them, their freedom was secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2486"/><pb id="p.249" n="249"/> </p> 
<p><num value="2">Two</num> things chiefly surprised me in their feeling toward their former masters,--the absence of affection and the absence of revenge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2487"/>I expected to find a good deal of the patriarchal feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2488"/>It always seemed to me a very ill-applied emotion, as connected with the facts and laws of American slavery,--still I expected to find it. I suppose that my men and their families and visitors may have had as much of it as the mass of freed slaves; but certainly they had not a particle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2489"/>I never could cajole <num value="1">one</num> of them, in his most discontented moment, into regretting <quote>ole mas'r time</quote> form a single instant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2490"/>I never heard <num value="1">one</num> speak of the masters except as natural enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2491"/>Yet they were perfectly discriminating as to individuals; many of them claimed to have had kind owners, and some expressed great gratitude to them for particular favors received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2492"/>It was not the individuals, but the ownership, of which they complained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2493"/>That they saw to be a wrong which no special kindnesses could right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2494"/>On this, as on all points connected with slavery, they understood the matter as clearly as <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0021.0012.00249.00472" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,W.,L.,,:1"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> or <persName n="Phillips,,,,," id="n0021.0012.00249.00473" reg="mostcommon:Phillips,Wendell,,,:2"><surname>Phillips</surname></persName>; the wisest philosophy could teach them nothing as to that, nor could any false philosophy befog them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2495"/>After all, personal experience is the best logician. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2496"/>Certainly this indifference did not proceed from any want of personal affection, for they were the most affectionate people among whom I had ever lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2497"/>They attached themselves to every officer who deserved love, and to some who did not; and if they failed to show it to their masters, it proved the wrongfulness of the mastery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2498"/>On the other hand, they rarely showed <num value="1">one</num> gleam of revenge, and I shall never forget the self-control with which <num value="1">one</num> of our best sergeants pointed out to me, at <placeName reg="Jacksonville, Duval, Florida" key="tgn,7013804">Jacksonville</placeName>, the very place where <num value="1">one</num> of his brothers <pb id="p.250" n="250"/> had been hanged by the whites for leading a party of fugitive slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2499"/>He spoke of it as a historic matter, without any bearing on the present issue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2500"/>But side by side with this faculty of patience, there was a certain tropical element in the men, a sort of fiery ecstasy when aroused, which seemed to link them by blood with the <rs>French Turcos</rs>, and made them really resemble their natural enemies, the <name>Celts</name>, far more than the <name>Anglo</name>-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0021.0012.00250.00474" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> temperament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2501"/>To balance this there were great individual resources when alone,--a sort of <name>Indian</name> wiliness and subtlety of resource.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2502"/>Their gregariousness and love of drill made them more easy to keep in hand than white American troops, who rather like to straggle or go in little squads, looking out for themselves, without being bothered with officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2503"/>The blacks prefer organization. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2504"/>The point of inferiority that I always feared, though I never had occasion to prove it, was that they might show less fibre, less tough and dogged resistance, than whites, during a prolonged trial,--a long, disastrous march, for instance, or the hopeless defence of a besieged town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2505"/>I should not be afraid of their mutinying or running away, but of their drooping and dying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2506"/>It might not turn out so; but I mention it for the sake of fairness, and to avoid overstating the merits of these troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2507"/>As to the simple general fact of courage and reliability I think no officer in our camp ever thought of there being any difference between <rs type="color">black</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2508"/>And certainly the opinions of these officers, who for years risked their lives every moment on the fidelity of their men, were worth more than those of all the world beside. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2509"/>No doubt there were reasons why this particular war was an especially favorable test of the colored soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2510"/><pb id="p.251" n="251"/> They had more to fight for than the whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2511"/>Besides the flag and the <rs>Union</rs>, they had home and wife and child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2512"/>They fought with ropes round their necks, and when orders were issued that the officers of colored troops should be put to death on capture, they took a grim satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2513"/>It helped their <foreign lang="fr">esprit de corps</foreign> immensely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2514"/>With us, at least, there was to be no play soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2515"/>Though they had begun with a slight feeling of inferiority to the white troops, this compliment substituted a peculiar sense of self-respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2516"/>And even when the new colored regiments began to arrive from the <rs>North</rs> my men still pointed out this difference,--that in case of ultimate defeat, the <rs>Northern</rs> troops, <rs type="color">black</rs> or <rs type="color">white</rs>, would go home, while the <orgName type="regiment" key="SC1">First South Carolina</orgName> must fight it out or be re-enslaved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2517"/>This was <num value="1">one</num> thing that made the <placeName key="tgn,1129377" n="1.000 3" reg="saint johns, florida, united states">St. John's River</placeName> so attractive to them and even to me;--it:was so much nearer the everglades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2518"/>I used seriously to ponder, during the darker periods of the war, whether I might not end my days as an outlaw,--a leader of Maroons. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2519"/>Meanwhile, I used to try to make some capital for the <rs>Northern</rs> troops, in their estimate, by pointing out that it was a disinterested thing in these men from the free States, to come down there and fight, that the slaves might be free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2520"/>But they were apt keenly to reply, that many of the white soldiers disavowed this object, and said that that was not the object of the war, nor even likely to be its end. Some of them even repeated <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n0021.0012.00251.00475" reg="mostcommon:Seward,W.,H.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>'s unfortunate words to <persName n="Adams,Mister,,,," id="n0021.0012.00251.00476" reg="mostcommon:Adams,C.,F.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName>, which some general had been heard to quote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2521"/>So, on the whole, I took nothing by the motion, as was apt to be the case with those who spoke a good word for our Government, in those vacillating and half proslavery days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2522"/><pb id="p.252" n="252"/> </p> 
<p>At any rate, this ungenerous discouragement had this good effect, that it touched their pride; they would deserve justice, even if they did not obtain it. This pride was afterwards severely tested during the disgraceful period when the party of repudiation in Congress temporarily deprived them of their promised pay. In my regiment the men never mutinied, nor even threatened mutiny; they seemed to make it a matter of honor to do their part, even if the <rs>Government</rs> proved a defaulter; but <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of them, including the best men in the regiment, quietly refused to take a dollar's pay, at the reduced price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2535"/>I cannot conceive what people at the <rs>North</rs> mean by speaking of the negroes as a bestial or brutal race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2536"/>Except in some insensibility to animal pain, I never knew of an act in my regiment which I should call brutal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2537"/>In reading <persName n="Kay,,,,," id="n0021.0012.00253.00481" reg="mostcommon:Kay,nomatch:0"><surname>Kay</surname></persName>'s <quote>Condition of the <rs>English Peasantry</rs></quote> I was constantly struck with the unlikeness of my men to those therein described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2538"/>This could not proceed from my prejudices as an abolitionist, for they would have led me the other way, and indeed I had once written a little essay to show the brutalizing influences of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2539"/>I learned to think that we abolitionists had underrated the suffering produced by slavery among the negroes, but had overrated the demoralization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2540"/>Or rather, we did not know how the religious temperament of the negroes had checked the demoralization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2541"/>Yet again, it must be admitted that this temperament, born of sorrow and oppression, is far more marked in the slave than in the native <rs>African</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2542"/>Theorize as we may, there was certainly in our camp an average tone of propriety which all visitors noticed, and which was not created, but only preserved by discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2543"/>I was always struck, not merely by the courtesy of the men, but also by a certain sober decency of language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2544"/>If a man had to report to me any disagreeable fact, for instance, he was sure to do it with gravity and decorum, and not blurt it out in an offensive <pb id="p.254" n="254"/> way. And it certainly was a significant fact that the ladies of our camp, when we were so fortunate as to have such guests,--the young wives, especially, of the adjutant and quartermaster,--used to go among the tents when the men were off duty, in order to hear their big pupils read and spell, without the slightest fear of annoyance, I do not mean direct annoyance or insult, for no man who valued his life would have ventured that in presence of the others, but I mean the annoyance of accidentally seeing or hearing improprieties not intended for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2545"/>They both declared that they would not have moved about with anything like the same freedom in any white camp they had ever entered, and it always roused their indignation to hear the negro race called brutal or depraved. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2546"/>This came partly from natural good manners, partly from the habit of deference, partly from ignorance of the refined and ingenious evil which is learned in large towns; but a large part came from their strongly religious temperament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2547"/>Their comparative freedom from swearing, for instance,--an abstinence which I fear military life did not strengthen,--was partly a matter of principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2548"/>Once I heard <num value="1">one</num> of them say to another, in a transport of indignation, <quote>Ha-a-a, boy, s'pose I no be a Christian, I cuss you so!</quote> --which was certainly drawing pretty hard upon the bridle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2549"/><quote>Cuss,</quote> however, was a generic term for all manner of evil speaking; they would say, <quote>He cuss me fool,</quote> or <quote>He cuss me coward,</quote> as if the essence of propriety were in harsh and angry speech,--which I take to be good ethics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2552"/><quote>A religious army,</quote> <quote>a gospel army,</quote> were their frequent phrases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2553"/>In their prayer-meetings there was always a mingling, often quaint enough, of the warlike and the pious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2556"/>The extremes of religious enthusiasm I did not venture to encourage, for I could not do it honestly; neither did I discourage them, but simply treated them with respect, and let them have their way, so long as they did not interfere with discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2557"/>In general they promoted it. The mischievous little drummer-boys, whose scrapes and quarrels were the torment of my existence, might be seen kneeling together in their tents to say their prayers at night, and I could hope that their slumbers were blessed by some spirit of peace, such as certainly did not rule over their waking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2558"/>The most reckless and daring fellows in the regiment were perfect fatalists in their confidence that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> would watch over them, and that if they died, it would be because their time had come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2559"/>This almost excessive faith, and the love of freedom and of their families, all co-operated with their pride as soldiers to <pb id="p.256" n="256"/> make them do their duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2560"/>I could not have spared any of these incentives.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2562"/>I am bound to say that this strongly devotional turn was not always accompanied by the practical virtues; but neither was it strikingly divorced from them.

<p>Another man of somewhat similar quality went among us by the name of <persName n="Beecher,,Henry,Ward,," id="n0021.0012.00256.00487" reg="default:Beecher,Henry,Ward,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <foreName>Ward</foreName> <surname>Beecher</surname></persName>, from a remarkable resemblance in face and figure to that sturdy divine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2570"/>I always felt a sort of admiration for this worthy, because of the thoroughness with which he outwitted me, and the sublime impudence in which he culminated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2571"/>He got a series of passes from me, every week or <num value="2">two</num>, to go and see his wife on a neighboring plantation, and finally, when this resource seemed exhausted, he came boldly for <num value="1">one</num> more pass, that he might go and be married. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2572"/>We used to quote him a good deal, also, as a sample of a certain Shakespearian boldness of personification in which the men sometimes indulged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2573"/>Once, I remember, <pb id="p.257" n="257"/> his captain had given him a fowling-piece to clean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2581"/></p> 
<p>Still, I maintain that, as a whole, the men were remarkably free from inconvenient vices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2582"/>There was no more lying and stealing than in average white regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2583"/>The surgeon was not much troubled by shamming sickness, and there were not a great many complaints of theft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2584"/>There was less quarrelling than among white soldiers, and scarcely ever an instance of drunkenness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2585"/>Perhaps the influence of their officers had something to do with this; for not a ration of whiskey was ever issued to the men, nor did I ever touch it, while in the army, nor approve a requisition for any of the officers, without which it could not easily be obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2586"/>In this respect our surgeons fortunately agreed with me, and we never had reason to regret it. I believe the use of ardent spirits to be as useless and injurious in the army as on board ship, and among the colored troops, especially, who had never been accustomed to it, I think that it did only harm. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2587"/>The point of greatest laxity in their moral habitsthe want of a high standard of chastity &mdash; was not <num value="1">one</num> which affected their camp life to any great extent, and it therefore came less under my observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2588"/>But I found <pb id="p.258" n="258"/> to my relief that, whatever their deficiency in this respect, it was modified by the general quality of their temperament, and indicated rather a softening and relaxation than a hardening and brutalizing of their moral natures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2589"/>Any insult or violence in this direction was a thing unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2590"/>I never heard of an instance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2591"/>It was not uncommon for men to have <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> wives in different plantations,--the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, or remoter, partner being called a <quote>&lsquo;broad wife,</quote> --i. e. wife abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2592"/>But the whole tendency was toward marriage, and this state of things was only regarded as a bequest from <quote>mas'r time.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2593"/></p> 
<p>I knew a great deal about their marriages, for they often consulted me, and took my counsel as lovers are wont to do,--that is, when it pleased their fancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2594"/>Sometimes they would consult their captains <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and then come to me in despairing appeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2601"/>They were married the next day, and I believe that she proved an excellent wife, though she had <num value="7">seven</num> children, whose father was also in the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2602"/>If she did not, I know many others who did, and certainly I have never seen more faithful or more happy marriages than among that people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2603"/><pb id="p.259" n="259"/> </p> 
<p>The question was often asked, whether the <rs>Southern</rs> slaves or the <rs>Northern</rs> free blacks made the best soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2604"/>It was a compliment to both classes that each officer usually preferred those whom he had personally commanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2605"/>I preferred those who had been slaves, for their greater docility and affectionateness, for the powerful stimulus which their new freedom gave, and for the fact that they were fighting, in a manner, for their own homes and firesides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2606"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> of these considerations afforded a special aid to discipline, and cemented a peculiar tie of sympathy between them and their officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2607"/>They seemed like clansmen, and had a more confiding and filial relation to us than seemed to me to exist in the <rs>Northern</rs> colored regiments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2608"/>So far as the mere habits of slavery went, they were a poor preparation for military duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2609"/>Inexperienced officers often assumed that, because these men had been slaves before enlistment, they would bear to be treated as such afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2610"/>Experience proved the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2611"/>The more strongly we marked the difference between the slave and the soldier, the better for the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2612"/><num value="0.5">One half</num> of military duty lies in obedience, the other half in self-respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2613"/>A soldier without self-respect is worthless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2614"/>Consequently there were no regiments in which it was so important to observe the courtesies and proprieties of military life as in these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2615"/>I had to caution the officers to be more than usually particular in returning the salutations of the men; to be very careful in their dealings with those on picket or guard-duty; and on no account to omit the titles of the non-commissioned officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2616"/>So, in dealing out punishments, we had carefully to avoid all that was brutal and arbitrary, all that savored of the overseer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2617"/>Any such dealing found them as obstinate and <pb id="p.260" n="260"/> contemptuous as was Topsy when <persName><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <foreName>Ophelia</foreName></persName> undertook to chastise her. A system of light punishments, rigidly administered according to the prescribed military forms, had more weight with them than any amount of angry severity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2618"/>To make them feel as remote as possible from the plantation, this was essential.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2619"/>By adhering to this, and constantly appealing to their pride as soldiers and their sense of duty, we were able to maintain a high standard of discipline,--so, at least, the inspecting officers said,--and to get rid, almost entirely, of the more degrading class of punishments,--standing on barrels, tying up by the thumbs, and the ball and chain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2620"/>In all ways we had to educate their self-respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2621"/>For instance, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> they disliked to obey their own non-commissioned officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2622"/><quote>I don't want him to play de white man ober me,</quote> was a sincere objection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2623"/>They had been so impressed with a sense of inferiority that the distinction extended to the very principles of honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2624"/><quote>I ain't got colored-man principles,</quote> said <persName n="Simmons,Corporal,London,,," id="n0021.0012.00260.00490" reg="default:Simmons,London,,,"><roleName n="Corporal">Corporal</roleName> <foreName>London</foreName> <surname>Simmons</surname></persName>, indignantly defending himself from some charge before me. <quote>I'se got white-gemman principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2625"/>I'se do my best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2626"/>If Cap'n tell me to take a man, s'pose de man be as big as a house, I'll clam hold on him till I die, inception [excepting] I'm sick.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2627"/></p> 
<p>But it was plain that this feeling was a bequest of slavery, which military life would wear off. We impressed it upon them that they did not obey their officers because they were white, but because they were their officers, just as the <rs>Captain</rs> must obey me, and I the <rs>General</rs>; that we were all subject to military law, and protected by it in turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2628"/>Then we taught them to take pride in having good material for non-commissioned officers among themselves, and in obeying them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2629"/>On <pb id="p.261" n="261"/> my arrival there was <num value="1">one</num> white <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sergeant, and it was a question whether to appoint others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2630"/>This I prevented, but left that <num value="1">one</num>, hoping the men themselves would at last petition for his removal, which at length they did. He was at once detailed on other duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2631"/>The picturesqueness of the regiment suffered, for he was very tall and fair, and I liked to see him step forward in the centre when the line of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sergeants came together at dress-parade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2632"/>But it was a help to discipline to eliminate the <rs>Saxon</rs>, for it recognized a principle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2633"/>Afterwards I had excellent battalion-drills without a single white officer, by way of experiment; putting each company under a sergeant, and going through the most difficult movements, such as division-columns and oblique-squares.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2634"/>And as to actual discipline, it is doing no injustice to the line-officers of the regiment to say that none of them received from the men more implicit obedience than <persName n="Rivers,Color-Sergeant,,,," id="n0021.0012.00261.00491" reg="nearbymention:Rivers,Prince,,,"><roleName n="Color-Sergeant">Color-Sergeant</roleName> <surname>Rivers</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2635"/>I should have tried to obtain commissions for him and several others before I left the regiment, had their literary education been sufficient; and such an attempt was finally made by <persName n="Trowbridge,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0021.0012.00261.00492" reg="nearbymention:Trowbridge,Charles,T.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>Trowbridge</surname></persName>, my successor in immediate command, but it proved unsuccessful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2636"/>It always seemed to me an insult to those brave men to have novices put over their heads, on the ground of color alone; and the men felt it the more keenly as they remained longer in service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2637"/>There were more than <num value="700">seven hundred</num> enlisted men in the regiment, when mustered out after more than <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2638"/>The ranks had been kept full by enlistment, but there were only <num value="14">fourteen</num> line-officers instead of the full <num value="30">thirty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2639"/>The men who should have filled those vacancies were doing duty as sergeants in the ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2640"/><pb id="p.262" n="262"/> </p> 
<p>In what respect were the colored troops a source of disappointment?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2641"/>To me in <num value="1">one</num> respect only,--that of health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2642"/>Their health improved, indeed, as they grew more familiar with military life; but I think that neither their physical nor moral temperament gave them that toughness, that obstinate purpose of living, which sustains the more materialistic Anglo-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0021.0012.00262.00493" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2643"/>They had not, to be sure, the same predominant diseases, suffering in the pulmonary, not in the digestive organs; but they suffered a good deal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2644"/>They felt malaria less, but they were more easily choked by dust and made ill by dampness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2645"/>On the other hand, they submitted more readily to sanitary measures than whites, and, with efficient officers, were more easily kept clean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2646"/>They were injured throughout the army by an undue share of fatigue duty, which is not only exhausting but demoralizing to a soldier; by the unsuitableness of the rations, which gave them salt meat instead of rice and hominy; and by the lack of good medical attendance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2647"/>Their childlike constitutions peculiarly needed prompt and efficient surgical care; but almost all the colored troops were enlisted late in the war, when it was hard to get good surgeons for any regiments, and especially for these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2648"/>In this respect I had nothing to complain of, since there were no surgeons in the army for whom I would have exchanged my own. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2649"/>And this late arrival on the scene affected not only the medical supervision of the colored troops, but their opportunity for a career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2650"/>It is not my province to write their history, nor to vindicate them, nor to follow them upon those larger fields compared with which the adventures of my regiment appear but a partisan warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2651"/>Yet this, at least, may be said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2652"/>The operations on the <placeName reg="Atlantic Ocean" key="tgn,7014206">South Atlantic</placeName> coast, which long seemed a merely subordinate <pb id="p.263" n="263"/> and incidental part of the great contest, proved to be <num value="1">one</num> of the final pivots on which it turned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2653"/>All now admit that the fate of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> was decided by <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0021.0012.00263.00494" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:1"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s march to the sea. <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> was the objective point to which he marched, and he found the <orgName>Department of the South</orgName>, when he reached it, held almost exclusively by colored troops.

<head>Appendix D: the struggle for pay.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2877"/>The story of the attempt to cut down the pay of the colored troops is too long, too complicated, and too humiliating, to be here narrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2878"/>In the case of my regiment there stood on record the direct pledge of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> to <persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0021.0017.00280.00645" reg="nearbymention:Saxton,Mirand,W.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName> that their pay should be the same as that of whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2879"/>So clear was this that our kind paymaster, <persName n="Wood,Major,W.,J.,," id="n0021.0017.00280.00646" reg="default:Wood,W.,J.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Wood</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName>, took upon himself the responsibility of paying the price agreed upon, for <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure>, till he was compelled by express orders to reduce it from <measure n="13dollars" type="currency">thirteen dollars</measure> per month to <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollars</measure>, and from that to <measure n="7dollars" type="currency">seven dollars</measure>, -the pay of quartermaster's men and day-laborers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2880"/>At the same time the <quote>stoppages</quote> from the pay-rolls for the loss of all equipments and articles of clothing remained the same as for all other soldiers, so that it placed the men in the most painful and humiliating condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2881"/>Many of them had families to provide for, and between the actual distress, the sense of wrong, the taunts of those who had refused to enlist from the fear of being cheated, and the doubt how much farther the cheat might be carried, the poor fellows were goaded to the utmost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2882"/>In the <orgName type="regiment" key="3SCRegiment">Third South Carolina regiment</orgName>, <persName n="Walker,Sergeant,William,,," id="n0021.0017.00280.00647" reg="default:Walker,William,,,"><roleName n="Sergeant">Sergeant</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName> was shot, by order of court-martial, for leading his company to stack arms before their captain's tent, on the avowed ground that they were released from duty by the refusal of the <rs>Government</rs> to fulfil its share of the contract.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2883"/>The fear of such tragedies spread a cloud of solicitude over every <pb id="p.281" n="281"/> camp of colored soldiers for more than a year, and the following series of letters will show through what wearisome labors the final triumph of justice was secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2884"/>In these labors the chief credit must be given to my admirable Adjutant, <persName n="Dewhurst,Lieutenant,G.,W.,," id="n0021.0017.00281.00648" reg="default:Dewhurst,G.,W.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Dewhurst</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2885"/>In the matter of bounty justice is not yet obtained; there is a discrimination against those colored soldiers who were slaves on <dateStruct value="1861-04-19"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="19">19</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2886"/>Every officer, who through indolence or benevolent design claimed on his muster-rolls that all his men had been free on that day, secured for them the bounty; while every officer who, like my. self, obeyed orders and told the truth in each case, saw his men and their families suffer for it, as I have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2887"/>A bill to abolish this distinction was introduced by <persName n="Wilson,Mister,,,," id="n0021.0017.00281.00649" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName> at the last session, but failed to pass the <rs type="place">House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2888"/>It is hoped that next winter may remove this last vestige of the weary contest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2889"/>To show how persistently and for how long a period these claims had to be urged on Congress, I reprint such of my own printed letters on the subject as are now in my possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2890"/>There are <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of which I have no copies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2891"/>It was especially in the <name>Senate</name> that it was so difficult to get justice done; and our thanks will always be especially due to <persName n="Sumner,the Honorable,Charles,,," id="n0021.0017.00281.00650" reg="default:Sumner,Charles,,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> and <persName n="Wilson,the Honorable,Henry,,," id="n0021.0017.00281.00651" reg="default:Wilson,Henry,,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName> for their advocacy of our simple rights.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2893"/>Sir,--No <num value="1">one</num> can overstate the intense anxiety with which the officers of colored regiments in this Department are awaiting action from Congress in regard to arrears of pay of their men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2894"/>It is not a matter of dollars and cents only; it is a question of common honesty,--whether the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> has sufficient integrity for the fulfilment of an explicit business contract. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2895"/>The public seems to suppose that all required justice will <pb id="p.282" n="282"/> be done by the passage of a bill equalizing the pay of all soldiers for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2896"/>But, so far as my own regiment is concerned, this is but half the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2897"/>My men have been nearly <measure n="16months" type="date">sixteen months</measure> in the service, and for them the immediate issue is the question of arrears. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2898"/>They understand the matter thoroughly, if the public do not. Every <num value="1">one</num> of them knows that he volunteered under an explicit <hi rend="italics">written assurance</hi> from the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> that he should have the pay of a white soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2899"/>He knows that for <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure> the regiment received that pay, after which it was cut down from the promised <measure n="13dollars" type="currency">thirteen dollars</measure> per month to <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollars</measure>, for some reason to him inscrutable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2900"/>He does <hi rend="italics">not</hi> know &mdash; for I have not yet dared to tell the men &mdash; that the <rs>Paymaster</rs> has been already reproved by the <rs>Pay Department</rs> for fulfilling even in part the pledges of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>; that at the next payment the <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollars</measure> are to be further reduced to <num value="7">seven</num>; and that, to crown the whole, all the previous overpay is to be again deducted or <quote>stopped</quote> from the future wages, thus leaving them a little more than a dollar a month for <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> to come, unless Congress interfere! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2901"/>Yet so clear were the terms of the contract that <persName n="Whiting,Mister,Solicitor,,," id="n0021.0017.00282.00652" reg="default:Whiting,Solicitor,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Solicitor</foreName> <surname>Whiting</surname></persName>, having examined the original instructions from the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> issued to <persName n="Saxton,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n0021.0017.00282.00653" reg="nearbymention:Saxton,Mirand,W.,,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Military-Governor">Military Governor</rs>, admits to me (under date of <dateStruct value="1863-12-04"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="4">4</day>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>,) that <quote>the faith of the <rs>Government</rs> was thereby pledged to every officer and soldier enlisted under that call.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2902"/></p> 
<p>He goes on to express the generous confidence that <quote>the pledge will be honorably fulfilled.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2903"/>I observe that every <num value="1">one</num> at the <rs>North</rs> seems to feel the same confidence, but that, meanwhile, the pledge is unfulfilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2904"/>Nothing is said in Congress about fulfilling it. I have not seen even a proposition in Congress to pay the colored soldiers, <hi rend="italics">from date of enlistment</hi>, the same pay with white soldiers; and yet anything short of that is an unequivocal breach of contract, so far as this regiment is concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2905"/><pb id="p.283" n="283"/> </p> 
<p>Meanwhile, the land sales are beginning, and there is danger of every foot of land being sold from beneath my soldiers' feet, because they have not the petty sum which Government <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> promised, and then refused to pay. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2906"/>The officers' pay comes promptly and fully enough, and this makes the position more embarrassing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2907"/>For how are we to explain to the men the mystery that Government can afford us a <num value="100">hundred</num> or <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">two dollars</measure> a month, and yet must keep back <num value="6">six</num> of the poor <num value="13">thirteen</num> which it promised them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2908"/>Does it not naturally suggest the most cruel suspicions in regard to us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2909"/>And yet nothing but their childlike faith in their officers, and in that incarnate soul of honor, <persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0021.0017.00283.00654" reg="nearbymention:Saxton,Mirand,W.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName>, has sustained their faith, or kept them patient, thus far. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2910"/>There is nothing mean or mercenary about these men in general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2911"/>Convince them that the <rs>Government</rs> actually needs their money, and they would serve it barefooted and on half-rations, and without a dollar &mdash; for a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2912"/>But, unfortunately, they see white soldiers beside them, whom they know to be in no way their superiors for any military service, receiving hundreds of dollars for re-enlisting from this impoverished Government, which can only pay <measure n="7dollars" type="currency">seven dollars</measure> out of <num value="13">thirteen</num> to its black regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2913"/>And they see, on the other hand, those colored men who refused to volunteer as soldiers, and who have found more honest paymasters than the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName>, now exulting in well-filled pockets, and able to buy the little homesteads the soldiers need, and to turn the soldiers' families into the streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2914"/>Is this a school for self-sacrificing patriotism? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2915"/>I should not speak thus urgently were it not becoming manifest that there is to be no promptness of action in Congress, even as regards the future pay of colored soldiers,and that there is especial danger of the whole matter of <hi rend="italics">arrears</hi> going by default.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2916"/>Should it be so, it will be a repudiation more ungenerous than any which <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0021.0017.00283.00655" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> advocated or <persName n="Smith,,Sydney,,," id="n0021.0017.00283.00656" reg="default:Smith,Sydney,,,"><foreName>Sydney</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> denounced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2917"/>It will sully with dishonor all the nobleness of this opening page of history, and <pb id="p.284" n="284"/> fix upon the <rs>North</rs> a brand of meanness worse than either <persName><foreName>Southerner</foreName></persName> or Englishman has yet dared to impute.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2961"/>By an order of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, dated <dateStruct value="1864-08-01"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg="1">1</day>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, it is at length ruled that colored soldiers shall be paid the full pay of soldiers from date of enlistment, provided they were free on <dateStruct value="1861-04-19"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="19">19</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>,--not otherwise; and this distinction is to be noted on the pay-roll &mdash; so In other words, if <num value="0.5">one half</num> of a company escaped from slavery on <dateStruct value="1861-04-18"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="18">18</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, they are to be paid <measure n="13dollars" type="currency">thirteen dollars</measure> per month and allowed <num value="3">three</num> <pb id="p.288" n="288"/> dollars and <num value="0.5">a half</num> per month for clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2964"/>It had not occurred to me that anything could make the pay-rolls of these regiments more complicated than at present, or the men more rationally discontented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2965"/>I had not the ingenuity to imagine such an order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2966"/>Yet it is no doubt in accordance with the spirit, if not with the letter, of the final bill which was adopted by Congress under the lead of <persName n="Stevens,Mister,Thaddeus,,," id="n0021.0017.00288.00673" reg="default:Stevens,Thaddeus,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Thaddeus</foreName> <surname>Stevens</surname></persName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2968"/><hi rend="italics">But the <rs>Government</rs> should have thought of this before it made the contract with these men and received their services</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2973"/>They enlisted to serve the <rs>Government</rs>, trusting in its honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2974"/>Now the nation turns upon them and says: Your part of the contract is fulfilled; we have had <pb id="p.289" n="289"/> your services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2975"/>If you can show that you had previously been free for a certain length of time, we will fulfil the other side of the contract.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2976"/>If not, we repudiate it. Help yourselves, if you can. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2977"/>In other words, a freedman (since <dateStruct value="1861-04-19"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="19">19</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>) has no rights which a white man is bound to respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2980"/>He has no motive to honest industry, or to honesty of any kind.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2982"/>Under this order, the greater part of the <rs>Massachusetts</rs> colored regiments will get their pay at last, and be able to take their wives and children out of the almshouses, to which, as <persName n="Andrew,Governor,,,," id="n0021.0017.00289.00677" reg="nearbymention:Andrew,J.,A.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName> informs us, the gracious charity of the nation has consigned so many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2983"/>For so much I am grateful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2984"/>But toward my regiment, which had been in service and under fire, months before a Northern colored soldier was recruited, the policy of repudiation has at last been officially adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2985"/>There is no alternative for the officers of <orgName type="mil" key="SCRegiment">South Carolina regiments</orgName> but to wait for another session of Congress, and meanwhile, if necessary, act as executioners for those soldiers who, like <persName n="Walker,Sergeant,,,," id="n0021.0017.00289.00678" reg="nearbymention:Walker,William,,,"><roleName n="Sergeant">Sergeant</roleName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName>, refuse to fulfil their share of a contract where the <rs>Government</rs> has openly repudiated the other share.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2997"/><pb id="p.291" n="291"/> </p> 
<p>I call it defrauding, because it is not a question of abstract justice, but of the fulfilment of an express contract. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2999"/>It is therefore the plain duty of Congress to repeal the law which discriminates between different classes of colored soldiers, or at least so to modify it as to secure the fulfilment of actual contracts.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3008"/>On the <dateStruct value="1862-05-9"><day reg="9">ninth</day> day of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year>1862</year>,</dateStruct> at which time there were nearly <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of your race in a bondage sanctioned by the laws of the land, and protected by our flag,on that day, in the face of floods of prejudice, that well-nigh deluged every avenue to manhood and true liberty, you came forth to do battle for your country and your kindred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3009"/>For long and weary months without pay, or even the privilege of being recognized as soldiers, you labored on, only to be disbanded and sent to your homes, without even a hope of reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3010"/>And when our country, necessitated by the deadly struggle with armed traitors, finally granted you the opportunity <hi rend="italics">again</hi> to come forth in defence of the nation's life, the alacrity with which you responded to the call gave abundant evidence of your readiness to strike a manly blow for the liberty of your race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3011"/>And from that little band of hopeful, <pb id="p.293" n="293"/> trusting, and brave men, who gathered at <placeName reg="Camp Saxton">Camp Saxton</placeName>, on <placeName reg="Port Royal Island, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2593932">Port Royal Island</placeName>, in the fall of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, amidst the terrible prejudices that then surrounded us, has grown an army of a <num value="140000">hundred and forty thousand</num> black soldiers, whose valor and heroism has won for your race a name which will live as long as the undying pages of history shall endure; and by whose efforts, united with those of the white man, armed rebellion has been conquered, the <num value="1000000">millions</num> of bondmen have been emancipated, and the fundamental law of the land has been so altered as to remove forever the possibility of human slavery being re-established within the borders of redeemed America.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3016"/>It seems fitting to me that the last hours of our existence as a regiment should be passed amidst the unmarked graves of your comrades,--at <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 107" reg="morris island, charleston, south carolina">Fort Wagner</placeName>.
