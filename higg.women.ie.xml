<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>In beginning a series of modest papers under this rather ambitious title, I am reminded that, comprehensive as it seems, the phrase is in <num value="1">one</num> respect very recent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>It is only within a century or so that the <num value="2">two</num> sexes have been habitually addressed together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>The phrase <quote>women and men,</quote> or its more common form, <quote>ladies and gentlemen,</quote> or that other form, <quote>gentlemen and ladies,</quote> which the late <persName n="Emerson,Mister,,,," id="n0192.0001.00001.00002" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,M.,J.,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Emerson</surname></persName> habitually used, is a comparatively modern thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Before the advent of Christianity we should not expect to find it used, and accordingly the great orations of ancient times were addressed to men only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Even after Christianity had brought a theoretic equality between the sexes the <name>Jewish</name> tradition still held strongly, and most of the fathers of the <rs type="place">Church</rs> are, it must be owned, rather oppressively masculine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>But among them there is <num value="1">one</num> great <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> exception, <num value="1">one</num> who for non-theological purposes is more readable than all the rest put together; and he it is, <persName n="Clement,,,,," id="n0192.0001.00002.00003" reg="mostcommon:Clement,nomatch:0"><surname>Clement</surname></persName> of <placeName key="tgn,7019664;tgn,7013269;tgn,7013268;tgn,7001188;tgn,2097704;tgn,2085912" n="0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7019664;alexandria, grafton, new hampshire,Grafton,New Hampshire,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7013269;alexandria, alexandria, virginia,Alexandria,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7013268;alexandria, rapides, louisiana,Rapides,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7001188;al-iskandariyah,al-iskandariyah,urban,misr,africa,Al-Iskandariyah,Urban,Misr,Africa;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,2097704;alexandria, dekalb, tennessee,DeKalb,Tennessee,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,2085912;alexandria, huntingdon, pennsylvania,Huntingdon,Pennsylvania,United States,North and Central America" reg="alexandria, grafton, new hampshire,Grafton,New Hampshire,United States,North and Central America;alexandria, alexandria, virginia,Alexandria,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;alexandria, rapides, louisiana,Rapides,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America;al-iskandariyah,al-iskandariyah,urban,misr,africa,Al-Iskandariyah,Urban,Misr,Africa;alexandria, dekalb, tennessee,DeKalb,Tennessee,United States,North and Central America;alexandria, huntingdon, pennsylvania,Huntingdon,Pennsylvania,United States,North and Central America">Alexandria</placeName> by name, who introduced to the world in his discourses the phrase <quote>men and women,</quote> or <quote>women and men,</quote> for he uses both forms.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The truth is that <persName n="Clement,,,,," id="n0192.0001.00002.00004" reg="mostcommon:Clement,nomatch:0"><surname>Clement</surname></persName> was a very learned <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> philosopher, who had gone through a conversion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/><hi rend="italics">Tie</hi> dearly loved the <name>Greek</name> mythology, in which women take a part so conspicuous; and though he felt bound to preach against that mythology all the time, he could not help dwelling on its picturesque details.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>To him every woman was a sort of reformed <persName n="Artemis,,,,," id="n0192.0001.00002.00005" reg="mostcommon:Artemis,nomatch:0"><surname>Artemis</surname></persName> or <persName n="Aphrodite,,,,," id="n0192.0001.00002.00006" reg="mostcommon:Aphrodite,nomatch:0"><surname>Aphrodite</surname></persName>, always tempted to relapse into her sins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The vanities of dress especially horrified him, though it surely was not in any undue profusion or variety of costume that the beautiful <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> goddesses chiefly erred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Had he lived in these times, and written for <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Harper,,,,," id="n0192.0001.00002.00007" reg="mostcommon:Harper,nomatch:0"><surname>Harper</surname></persName>'s Bazaar</hi>, he would doubtless have entered his protest on every page against the new fashions on the page opposite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>But his merit was that he bore his testimony, whether wise or unwise, for the benefit of both sexes alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>For women to braid false hair upon the crown of the head was no worse than for men to displace from the chin the hair that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has placed there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>If women wear false hair, he says, they not only deceive men, but commit inpiety <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> towards the presbyter, who in blessing them really lays his hand of benediction on another's hair, and therefore on another head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>But men should crop their hair decently, and not disturb that upon the chin, as it <quote>lends to the face dignity and paternal majesty.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>All this in a single paragraph of his series of discourses known as the <quote>Instructor,</quote> and he afterwards sends tile <num value="2">two</num> sexes, thus impartially instructed, to church together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/><quote>Women and men are to go to church decently attired, with natural step, embracing silence, possessing unfeigned love, pure in body, pure in heart, fit to pray to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>And again he says in a passage often quoted, <quote>The virtue of man and woman is the same.</quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It was long after the days of <persName n="Clement,,,,," id="n0192.0001.00003.00009" reg="mostcommon:Clement,nomatch:0"><surname>Clement</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> when it became a common thing to unite the <num value="2">two</num> sexes for the purpose even of scolding them conjointly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Gradually the habit arose of putting these admonitions into little twin volumes, always kept carefully apart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The duties of men and women travelled, so to speak, on the same conveyance and with equal accommodations, but in separate cars or distinct cabins, and always, as in our own travelling arrangements, with a slight excess of courtesy towards the feminine side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The author of <quote>The <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> whole duty of man</quote> published at <placeName reg="Oxford, Lafayette, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057155">Oxford</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1673--"><year reg="1673">1673</year></dateStruct> another volume called <quote>The ladies' calling,</quote> with a frontispiece representing a British matron sitting in a transverse ray of sunlight, and stretching a robust right arm upward after the crown of wisdom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>According to the titles of these books it would seem that men have their <quote>whole duty</quote> to perform as <quote>men,</quote> while women follow their <quote>calling</quote> as <quote>ladies,</quote> a distinction even more confusing than that of the stations on the <rs>American</rs> railways, whose doors are sometimes tersely labelled <quote>Men</quote> and <quote>Women,</quote> while others bear in preference the more fastidious designation <quote>Gentlemen</quote> and <quote>Ladies.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It was not till <dateStruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></dateStruct> that <persName n="Gisborne,Reverend,Thomas,,," id="n0192.0001.00004.00010" reg="default:Gisborne,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev.</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Gisborne</surname></persName>, having already published his <quote>Duties of men,</quote> came out with a corresponding volume, <quote>Duties of women,</quote> which at once superseded all similar works, and instructed the women of England-leaving the <quote>ladies</quote> to take care of themselves &mdash; for <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>, the <num value="14" type="ordinal">fourteenth</num> edition appearing in <dateStruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></dateStruct>, and I know not how many others since that day. Since his time men and women have so constantly worked together for the purpose of moral instruction, at least, that we almost forget that the joint phrase practically originated with St. Clement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>But it was the <rs>British</rs> stage, after all, which took the hint more promptly than the <rs type="place">Church</rs>; and although <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> it would not tolerate women upon its boards, soon addressed to both sexes its prologues and its epilogues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>In the epilogue to the old play of <quote><persName n="Juliana,,,,," id="n0192.0001.00005.00011" reg="mostcommon:Juliana,nomatch:0"><surname>Juliana</surname></persName>, or tie <rs type="role2">Princess</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7006366" n="1.000 33" reg="polska">Poland</placeName>,</quote> this being spoken in dialogue, as often happened, by an actor of each sex, the woman rebukes the man for addressing the audience as <quote>You, gentlemen!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>She says: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/></p><l>You, gentlemen!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>and why, I pray, to them?</l> <l>What!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>do the ladies merit no esteem?</l></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>She then takes his place, and addresses the whole audience as if it were a parliament, or, in the phrase then familiar, a diet: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/></p><l>Fair English Diet, then,</l> <l>Senate of ladies, lower house of men,</l> <l>I humbly pray, decree before you go.</l></quote> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>In these days the joint phrase <quote>Men and women</quote> has thoroughly established itself, and needs no further vindication; and if I reverse it, putting women <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, it is with no revolutionary design, although <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> for a definite purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/><quote>It is all very well,</quote> said <persName n="Danton,,,,," id="n0192.0001.00006.00014" reg="mostcommon:Danton,G.,J.,,:1"><surname>Danton</surname></persName>, in the <rs>French Revolution</rs>, <quote>so long as people cry <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Danton,,,,," id="n0192.0001.00006.00015" reg="mostcommon:Danton,G.,J.,,:1"><surname>Danton</surname></persName> and Robespierre</hi>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>In saying <quote>Women and men</quote> it is only implied that these papers are addressed more to the <num value="1">one</num> sex than the other, though exclusively to neither.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The interests, tastes, duties, and position of women have come to constitute a separate department of literature, and often a literature by itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The time has passed when men wrote down to women; and it was the mile-stone of a new era when the greatest of modern poets put into the hands of woman, at the close of his <quote>Faust,</quote> the guiding thread of the world's immediate future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>She called attention to the simple fact that a very large proportion of <name>English</name> women now earn their own bread, and that upon this changed condition the whole question must turn.

<p>Nearly <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> have passed, and a great many people seem still to believe that if women would only behave themselves they could easily live indoors, and spend their whole lives in weaving and spinning, like their great-grandmothers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>But they could not do it, simply because there would be no market for their labors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>She finds them still in-doors: <quote>Her mother sat by the hearth among the waiting-women, spinning sea-purple yarn; she met her father at the door, just going forth to join the famous princes at the council.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>But if Nausikaa of the white arms went to tell her parents a dream in these days, she might still very possibly meet her father going forth to join the princes (merchant princes) at the council (Stock Exchange), but she certainly would not find her mother amid her attendants spinning clothes for the family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Nor would Nausikaa herself afterwards go with her own maidens to the river with the family washing for the avowed purpose of putting in order the costumes of <num value="3">three</num> bachelor brothers, always eager to wear something new to the dance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The whole conditions of labor, of costume, and of everything else are changed; so that to wear homespun, which was once the glory of the highest, is <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> now the painful necessity of only the humblest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>A smoking-cap is now the only garment that Nausikaa can prepare for her bachelor brothers, or at the most she can crochet for them an afghan-or, as <name>Irish</name> house-maids with geographical boldness term it, <quote>an African</quote> --to put over them during an afternoon nap. Even the home-made shirts, which lasted till within the memory of this generation, have now come within the domain of the shopkeeper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The sister would not weave or spin for her brother if he wished it; and he, in turn, would rather gratify her in any other way than by wearing garments of her spinning or weaving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>We sometimes hear surprise expressed that woman has contributed so little to the masterpieces of the world in science, art, literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>To me the wonder is always the other way &mdash; that she has produced anything in that direction at all; and this for the plain reason that the shadow of repression, which is the bequest of the <rs>Oriental</rs> harem, still hangs over her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The real disadvantage of women has lain in being systematically taught from childhood up that it is their highest duty to efface themselves, or at least keep out of sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>It is not habitually mentioned that this is but a swing of the same pendulum which seemed, <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> ago, to be swinging the other way, and carrying us away from everything English and towards everything <persName n="French,,,,," id="n0192.0005.00022.00075" reg="mostcommon:French,nomatch:0"><surname>French</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>The same pendulum has been steadily vibrating, indeed, ever since the foundation of our government, and its movements have never had any great or important influence upon the mass of the <rs>American</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Be this as it may, it is perfectly certain that the whim in fashion <num value="30">thirty</num> and even <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> ago was quite unlike what it now is.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>The reason thus assigned may have been flimsy, but the fact recognized was important; it indicated a period when <name>French</name> standards, not <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0192.0005.00023.00079" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>, prevailed in our more fashionable society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>There is not much gained, perhaps, by the substitution of <num value="1">one</num> <hi rend="italics">roue</hi>; for another, as the arbiter of manners for our young people; but it is something to know that it is only a temporary swing of the pendulum after all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>It must be remembered that Anglomania is confined among us to a limited class, and to certain very limited pursuits and interests of that class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>It does not exist, for instance, among our men of science, inasmuch as they go to <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> in shoals for study, and rarely visit <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> since the death of <persName n="Darwin,,,,," id="n0192.0005.00023.00080" reg="mostcommon:Darwin,Erasmus,,,:2"><surname>Darwin</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>It is not now charged upon our literary <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> men, since the death of <persName n="White,,Richard,Grant,," id="n0192.0005.00024.00081" reg="default:White,Richard,Grant,,"><foreName>Richard</foreName> <foreName>Grant</foreName> <surname>White</surname></persName>, who was, moreover, as ardently anti-English in some directions as he was vehemently English in others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>It is not found in our journalism, which aspires to lead the <rs>English</rs>, and actually leads it in enterprise, while falling behind it in evenness of execution and in the minor proprieties of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>It is not to be found in our public-school system or in our college systems, for these, where they are not American, are <persName n="German,,,,," id="n0192.0005.00024.00082" reg="mostcommon:German,nomatch:0"><surname>German</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>It is not found in our library methods, for in the librarians' conventions of the last few years <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0192.0005.00024.00083" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> have led and not followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Even when we come on more intimate and domestic ground, limitations still exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>Our standard of cookery, so far as we have any, is French and not <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0192.0005.00024.00084" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>No American lady would wish to be charged with dressing like an English woman, and no American man, when travelling anywhere but in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, would wish to be taken for an Englishman, for the simple reason that <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0192.0005.00024.00085" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> are everywhere so much more popular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Nor would any <num value="1">one</num> of our own countrymen desire to be said to speak foreign languages like an Englishman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Even in our amusements there exists a similar limitation, In yachting the interest is in the <rs>American</rs> type of yachts; as to horse-racing, mainly in the <rs>American</rs> breed of trotting-horses; our college students compete in base-ball, rarely in cricket; and almost all <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> the prizes won by our bicyclists are won on American machines.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>The key to this alleged Anglomania, therefore, is simply this: that the <rs>American</rs> habit of mind is essentially cosmopolitan, and goes to each nation for that which it finds best of its kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>As unerringly as it goes to <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> for its scientific instruction, or to <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 6" reg="france">France</placeName> for its cools, so it goes to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> for what is not so well to he found in <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> or <placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>--the minor conveniences and facilities which belong to a highly trained leisure class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>Itself newly developed, this American class turns to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> for a good standard of minor essentials, as horse equipments and coachmen's clothes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>It borrows more than these; it borrows those accessaries of high-bred life which promote daily comfort and convenience, the organization of a large household, the routine of social life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>In these directions <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> is very strong, though it may be doubted if this is the highest sphere; if it can be set against the dignity of the best <rs>Spanish</rs> or <rs>Italian</rs> manners, the keenness of <name>French</name> wit, and the depth and solidity of <name>German</name> knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>These also are fully appreciated among us, but their traces do not lie so much on the surface.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>All these things, so far as we can, we borrow ; why not?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>If older nations borrow from <num value="1">one</num> another, why not younger from older?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>It is no discredit to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> that her <num value="1">one</num> high philological <pb id="p.26" n="26"/> authority, <persName n="Muller,,Max,,," id="n0192.0005.00026.00086" reg="default:Muller,Max,,,"><foreName>Max</foreName> <surname>Muller</surname></persName>, is a German, and that her <num value="1">one</num> humorous periodical &mdash; in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> every newspaper is humorous-still bears trace of its <name>French</name> origin in the title, <hi rend="italics">Punch, or the <rs>London Charivari</rs></hi>. The <name>English</name> journals are constantly pointing out that their own people are becoming Americanized; why, then, should not an American here or there be Anglicized?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>It is pretty certain all the while that we are exerting far more influence than we receive.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>Let us not disturb ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Out of the <num value="50000000">fifty millions</num> of <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0192.0005.00026.00087" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>, the passing wave of Anglomania or Francomania reaches but a few <num value="1000">thousands</num>, and merely touches close on the surface.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Even the young men whom it reaches are at heart good <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0192.0005.00026.00088" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>, and if another civil war or foreign war arose, would respond as promptly as they did in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>They will doubtless buy their clothes in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> while these can be bought there more cheaply and of better material; they will employ <name>English</name> grooms or Scotch gardeners if these do their work better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>But so long as monarchy and hereditary aristocracy exist in England-and I fear that they will last our time &mdash; there will be an essential and ineradicable difference in the habits of mind of English and American young men; and this will show itself in their whole feeling as to caste, as to labor, as to self-respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>And since climate and institutions are <pb id="p.27" n="27"/> constantly tending to produce a physical difference also, there seems every prospect that Englishmen and <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0192.0005.00027.00089" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> will be farther apart, instead of nearer, <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> hence than now.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>The excess of single women, which is small for a State of more than a <num value="1000000.5">million and a half</num> of people, is due in part to the families where the brothers <quote>go West</quote> and the sisters stay at home, but far more to the factory system of the <rs>State</rs>, which is always importing young women from beyond the borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>The main discrepancy lies in the vast preponderance of widows over widowers, there being in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> <num value="73527">73,527</num> of the former, and only <num value="20624">20,624</num> of the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>This, again, is due to several causes: the great annual losses of life in seaport towns, the factory system again, and the natural tendency of women left widowed to return to the home of their youth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>At any rate, these facts make short work of the <quote>anxious and aimless</quote> theory, since no widow can belong to the latter class, at least if she has children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Indeed, the statistics leave it an open question whether the supply of spinsters is in any of our States sufficient-whether we do not suffer from a deficit rather than from an excess of maiden aunts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>To decide this question we must remember that there is in any community an immense and constant demand for this class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>They are the natural stopgaps, the flying buttresses, the emergency lectures, <pb id="p.40" n="40"/> of all families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>Even <pb id="p.41" n="41"/> in this, we perceive, is the utility of maiden aunts vindicated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>It might seem, as we look around at these priceless relatives, as if there were a good many of them in the world, but in reality there are far too few.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>It is said that young men are growing dilatory about marriage, and this is, if true, a blessing in disguise; for what would become of us if all the maiden aunts were married, and had to look round in vain for other maiden aunts to help take care of their babies?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>Illness makes a demand for aunts; temporary absences make room for them; they are needed when company is to be received, presents are to be made, new curtains to be decided upon, the family dress-making to be attended to; when, in short, are they not needed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Indeed, they are sometimes supposed to exist merely to <quote>accommodate,</quote> as the phrase is at intelligence-offices for a temporary supply; and there is sometimes as much <pb id="p.42" n="42"/> outcry in a large family when a maiden aunt ventures to be married as if she had taken a vow of celibacy in early life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>No! the maiden aunts of this rough world are not anxious and aimless; they are the salt of the earth, and, like the salt described in the little boy's composition, they are something that makes the world taste badly when there is nothing of them in it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>But the half truth which lies at the basis of it has always been springing up all over the world, not. alone among barbarous nations, but among the most civilized in the ancient and medieval worlds.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>For instance, in a valuable paper on the social and family relations among Australian tribes, in the <rs>Smithsonian Report</rs> for <dateStruct value="1883--"><year reg="1883">1883</year></dateStruct>, by <persName n="Howitt,,A.,W.,," id="n0192.0009.00045.00115" reg="default:Howitt,A.,W.,,"><foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Howitt</surname></persName>, we find just this same theory modifying the law of descent among savages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>The mother, as these people state it, is merely the nurse of the child; it is something given her to take care of.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Into this household the wife entered as a subordinate only; she was, as it were, <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> a daughter to her husband, <foreign lang="la">filiae loco,</foreign> the jurists say. Her legal connection with her own family was broken off; she could not belong to <num value="2">two</num> families, so she was merged in her husband's.

She was essential to the home ; it was incomplete without her &mdash; a Roman priest lost his office on becoming a widower; but she was utterly subordinate, almost an accident; the children not only belonged by law to the father, but they were recognized as intrinsically his; she was their custodian, their nurse, even as the <name>Australian</name> islander said.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>We may admit that all this belongs to ages of darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>The question is whether those ages are quite over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>While men may properly argue for this or that specific reform in the condition of women, it is better to remember that the whole relation of the sexes has its roots far back in the very oldest traditions of the <name>Aryan</name> race, and their transformation must be a matter of very gradual evolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Changes have been made that seemed utterly to imperil the old theory of the wife's subordination; and yet in some way or other this tradition has held its own. <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> In the <orgName n="Friends Society" type="society">Society of Friends</orgName>, for instance, the equality and independent action of the sexes has been brought almost to its highest point; and yet, even there, every woman abandons her family name on marriage, and is so far identified from that moment with her husband's household instead of her own; <persName n="Coffin,,Lucretia,,," id="n0192.0009.00047.00119" reg="default:Coffin,Lucretia,,,"><foreName>Lucretia</foreName> <surname>Coffin</surname></persName> vanishes, and <persName n="Mott,,Lucretia,,," id="n0192.0009.00047.00120" reg="default:Mott,Lucretia,,,"><foreName>Lucretia</foreName> <surname>Mott</surname></persName> takes her place.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>In the few cases among reformers where the wife has, as a matter of supposed consistency, refused to take her husband's name, the children have borne it nevertheless; and the tradition of the old <name>Roman</name> law &mdash; that they were her husband's children rather than hers &mdash; has thus been maintained in spite of her protest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>Nor is it easy to see how we can get away from the remnant of this logical entanglement, since no child can bear all its inherited names; and if it is to keep but <num value="1">one</num>, it is in many respects easier that it should be the father's.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>marketable accomplishments.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>I once knew of a young man who had a methodical mind and a large acquaintance among young women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>He used to keep their names in a book, with memoranda of their accomplishments &mdash; noting carefully which could dance well, which could embroider prettily, which make sponge-cake, which drive a horse; so that, should there be a social demand for either of these gifts, it could be supplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>A similar variety of attainments is found in the nursery ballad about the <num value="3">three</num> ships that came sailing by with a pretty maid in each <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/></p><l>And <num value="1">one</num> could whistle, and <num value="1">one</num> could sing,</l> <l>And <num value="1">one</num> could play on the violin.</l></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>But, after all, it is often asked, What is to become of the pretty maids on some day when their fathers' ships do not come in, and they are left in poverty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>What good will their accomplishments do them?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>It is pleasant to be able to answer that all these resources may, if well handled, do a great deal for them in just that emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>Accomplishments <pb id="p.61" n="61"/> are really just as marketable as anything else, so long as there are other people who wish to learn or borrow them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>It is common to say that adversity comes peculiarly hard on those who are new to it, but the truth is that such sufferers often feel it less than those who have been ground down by it all the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>The courage of the new beginners is better; their spirits are better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>I have known young girls who pronounced it <quote>a lark</quote> to have their fathers lose all their possessions, so that they themselves could have the new excitement of self-support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>Again, they have usually more friends and more zealous counsellors than those who have been poor all their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>In our easy <orgName n="American Society" type="society">American society</orgName> a sudden loss of property does not, as in older countries, at once transfer a person to a different social grade; we see too many ups and downs for that; and towards a young woman especially, who is obliged to shift for herself, there is usually a cordial and generous sentiment among the friends of more prosperous hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>It is apt to be easier for her to obtain work or instruction or capital than if she had always been poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>The things essential are energy, a cheerful spirit, and a quick discovery of the gift, whatever it is, that will be her strongest hold.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>As to the selection of this gift, it is, perhaps, good advice to say, Try the thing that you can do <pb id="p.62" n="62"/> best already, before spending time and money in learning something else that you cannot do at all. If you have a particular kind of preserves for which you <hi rend="italics">are</hi> famous, see if they are not available in a wider circle; many a household of Southern women made this their main resource after the devastations of the civil war. In the same way the mere possession of a remarkably good receipt for molasses candy was once quite a treasure to a Northern family of my acquaintance during a time of commercial panic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>Among non-culinary accomplishments the range is also considerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>In boyhood I learned dancing of an accomplished lady, the daughter of a judge and the sister of a naval officer who was afterwards eminent; being temporarily straitened in circumstances, she tried this means of support, and was only the more respected in consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>I know another lady of whom the same is true today; she teaches in a private school in the morning, and has <num value="5">five</num> different dancing-classes in the afternoons.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>I heard lately of another who had always been accustomed to wealth, but who, on falling suddenly into poverty, called the roll of her acquirements, and found that she knew nothing really well, except whist-playing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>She had, therefore, the courage and ingenuity to see if she could not make something out of that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>Her proficiency was well known, and <pb id="p.63" n="63"/> she now has <num value="10">ten</num> small classes in that difficult art, and receives from them a fair compensation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>There are women who are so well known among their friends for their especial skill in tennis-playing or skating or swimming that they would find it easy to form classes for these accomplishments if they went into the matter with energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>Of course the work must be done, if undertaken, in a perfectly business-like way &mdash; no fine-lady dawdlin ; it must be simply trying to earn an honest penny by the thing a woman knows, instead of apprenticing herself to stenography or to type-writing, which she does not know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>The list could easily be extended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>In the large community where I live there is absolutely no <num value="1">one</num> to teach a young girl to ride on horseback &mdash; a thing which an accomplished horsewoman could do as well as a man. Last year I knew a young girl who, having mechanical aptitude, bought a jig-saw, and had to search through the whole neighborhood, and almost give up in despair, before she could find any <num value="1">one</num> to teach her how to use it; yet she would willingly have paid for the instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>Even in a thing so universal as crochet, I am told that there is always a demand for some <num value="1">one</num> who knows the very newest stitches.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>All such suggestions as these are apt to be misconstrued; the adviser is supposed to have given the absurd assurance that such enterprises will find <pb id="p.64" n="64"/> an easy success, without allowance for time or place or circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>Quite otherwise; the path of self-support is never very easy under any circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>It is failure that is easy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>You may find no employment as a governess, no pupils for a school, no encouragement as a copyist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>These occupations are always crowded; but if you have a special gift it is likely to lie in some line where, if the demand be less, there is also less competition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>As civilization advances, arts and accomplishments develop.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>Why is it that nobody ever speaks of a man's <quote>chances</quote> in a sense wholly matrimonial?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>Perhaps they do in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, where, I must say, <num value="1">one</num> grows accustomed to hearing the worldly side of marriage presented in a way that rather disgusts an American; but even a travelling Englishman would hardly, I fancy, go through <placeName reg="Harvard Station, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2379301">Harvard</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,1013843" n="1.000 1" reg="yale, british columbia">Yale</placeName> asking himself whether the lecture-rooms and the gymnasium were likely to hinder or help the young men's chances of marriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>Yet he-and possibly some of our own countrymen also-would use this odd phrase about women without thinking of its oddity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>The assumption is, of course, that marriage is the <num value="1">one</num> momentous event of a woman's life, and a very subordinate matter in a man's; and, moreover, that in a woman's case it is a matter of chance, and <pb id="p.67" n="67"/> in a man's of certainty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>Let us consider all this a little.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>We may well grant that marriage must hold a more controlling share in a woman's life than in a man's, because she is anchored by her children as a man is not. Yet when we look round us and see the enormous number of cases where a woman either is never married, or is childless, or is left widowed, it is quite evident that there are for her in life other opportunities and duties, and therefore <quote>chances,</quote> besides those determined by marriage alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>And as to the risk involved in marriage, the more we reduce it to a minimum by care and judgment and good sense, the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>There is no surer preparation for misery, <num value="1">one</num> would think, than to accustom a young girl to think of every offer of marriage as a <quote>chance,</quote> to be eagerly seized as a fish swallows the bait, without knowing who or what is at the other end of the fishing-rod.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>So long as it is the custom of society for men to ask the momentous question and for women only to answer it-and this custom will probably last, in spite of certain philosophers, forever-so long there will be a little more clement of chance in the marriage relations of women than of men. A ballroom is in this respect a mimic world, and it is perfectly clear that the young lady who must sit still behind her bouquet and be asked has less control of <pb id="p.68" n="68"/> her own destiny than the young man who can try every girl in the room in succession until he finds a partner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>But we certainly cannot say that chance entirely controls either sex, in real life, when we consider how many men die unmarried through inability to find or win the woman they want; and when we reflect, on the other hand, that there are probably very few women who do not have <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> or last an opportunity of marriage, if they were only as easy to satisfy as men sometimes seem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>Perhaps nobody will ever frame a philosophical theory of the law that brings together certain men and certain women as lovers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>The brilliant author of <quote>Counterparts</quote> tried her hand at it, and while she produced a remarkable novel, she did not establish her theory very firmly after all. But whatever the true philosophy may be, it is pretty certain that the clement of chance is distributed between man and woman, and that a good deal of it exists for both in that formidable practical problem we call marriage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>But why, oh why, if <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName></persName> and his fellow-worldlings are so anxious about a girl's <quote>chances</quote> at all, do they not carry their solicitude far beyond marriage, and make it include the whole life?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>Up to the wedding-day it is comparatively easy to ward off the storms of fate; indeed, the only serious storm to young people in love consists in the possible <pb id="p.69" n="69"/> putting off of that day of bliss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>The time has come when the watering-places are mainly deserted, their banquet-halls unoccupied, their bar-rooms closed, their dancing-halls silent; while all the innumerable small dealers and showmen who clustered in their neighborhood have put away their wares, if they still have any, in boxes; have secreted their gains, if they have made any, in their pockets; and have disappeared-whither?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>Their destination seems as inscrutable as that of the birds of summer, and we only know that, like the birds, they will return in spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>But there is <num value="1">one</num> class of summer toilers by the sea whom we can trace and whose destination we know &mdash; the most laborious toilers of all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>These women of endless and exhausting industry are, it is needless to say, the class who are looked upon as idlers, butterflies, daughters of case and luxury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>They are the women who, as they sit in their luxurious carriages, are regarded by the mill-girl or the fisherman's daughter as the embodiment of pampered bliss; while their lives are unquestionably harder in many cases than any that mill-girl or fisherman's daughter ever imagined.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/><quote>It requires my whole time and strength during the whole summer,</quote> said <num value="1">one</num> of this class to me once at <placeName reg="Newport, Rhode Island, Newport" key="tgn,7014221">Newport</placeName>, <quote>and the whole time and strength of my <num value="3">three</num> daughters, to keep up with the ordinary round of social duties &mdash; to welcome our guests, to drive and go to entertainments with them, to receive calls, to make calls, and to keep the ordinary machinery of the establishment in operation.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>This lady was <num value="1">one</num> of the very best and most high-minded of her class --conscientious, domestic, enlightened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>I knew from observation that what she said was strictly true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>I knew also that as she did in summer at a so-called <quote>scene of recreation,</quote> so she lived in winter in the city where she dwelt; and this almost of necessity, from the social connections of her family and the real or supposed needs of her children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>Professional <pb id="p.72" n="72"/> men have their vacations, farmers have their hibernating season, many mechanics have a portion of the year when work is only too light-but this woman had really no period when the strain was in the least relaxed, except during Lent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>There were, to be sure, a few weeks of comparative leisure gained by going unusually early to her country-seat in spring or staying unusually late in autumn; but even these, for a mother whose daughters must have unimpeachable wardrobes, and for a house-keeper whose <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> mansions needed constantly to be kept in presentable order, could scarcely be given to anything like rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>And as with this estimable lady, so with all <quote>society women</quote> who are heads of households.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>They seem to me to be absolutely the hardest-worked women in the community; and I knew <num value="1">one</num> of them who used to explain her repeated voyages to and from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> by declaring that the <rs n="state room" type="product">state-room</rs> of an ocean steamer was literally the only place that could give her <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> of peace.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>In all this complication of labor, it must be remembered, the <rs>American</rs> woman of society is placed under greater hardship than any other; for she undertakes to do without machinery what the <rs>European</rs> woman does with instrumentalities that have been perfected by years of use. Let any <num value="1">one</num> read the descriptions given by travellers of the great country-houses in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, or even read carefully <pb id="p.73" n="73"/> the recent papers in <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Harper's Bazar" type="newspaper">Harper's Bazar</orgName></hi> upon the organization of domestic service in large households, and it will become plain that nothing but the utmost method can possibly carry on such an establishment without constant failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>In <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> that method is easily provided, because money can at once secure a retinue of servants, each of whom knows his place; and it can, moreover, provide a house-keeper or major-domo who will keep everybody to his work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>The trouble here is that no money can buy such an organization, and <num value="9">nine</num>-<num value=".1">tenths</num> of the labor of forming it comes upon the lady of the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>A young college graduate, taken suddenly from the laboratory and placed at the head of a great factory in which he finds no foreman and no overlookers, is not so helpless as a young girl taken suddenly from the ballroom and placed at the head of <num value="10">ten</num> or a dozen servants, in a beautiful house, with a <quote>social position</quote> awaiting her. For there actually are foremen and overlookers somewhere in the community, and an energetic young man with money at command can find them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>But no wealth can obtain for the <rs>American</rs> lady that admirable and perfect being, the <rs>English</rs> housekeeper, so completely adjusted to her environment that she seems as if she must have been created on purpose, and sent straight down from heaven in a black silk gown, to stand behind her mistress's chair, looking more stately than her mistress even <pb id="p.74" n="74"/> when she says, with dignified deference, <quote>As you please, ma'am.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>And as with the <rs>English</rs> house-keeper, so with those who are to work under her; each is supposed to know his place, and practically does know it; there is no disputing, as sometimes in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, as to which of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> men-servants ought to fetch a glass of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>I am far from asserting that this perfection of domestic service is the highest test of social progress; but it is thus far the only condition that can save the lady of the house from being prematurely worn out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>And it needs to be solved without delay, since in all our summer resorts, as they develop, the cottager is replacing the old-time boarder &mdash; a gain to the guests, but destructive to the hostess, who, after keeping house all winter under great difficulties, has to do the same thing all summer under greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>The traditions and habits of society are to a great extent <hi rend="italics">what</hi> might be called funded or accumulated good feeling; they are largely the product of long years of experience, which have brought to perfection the art of avoiding awkwardness and simplifying all procedure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>Some of them are <quote>survivals</quote> from old times of hate and violence &mdash; as the grasp of the ungloved right hand implied the laying aside of the sword, and the wine pledge was the proof that there was no guile in the cup.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>In an interesting paper on <quote>Marriage and the family,</quote> by <persName n="Lotzc,,Hermann,,," id="n0192.0018.00090.00177" reg="default:Lotzc,Hermann,,,"><foreName>Hermann</foreName> <surname>Lotzc</surname></persName>, lately translated by <persName n="Ladd,Professor,,,," id="n0192.0018.00090.00178" reg="mostcommon:Ladd,G.,T.,,:1"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Ladd</surname></persName>, of <orgName n="Yale University" type="university">Yale University</orgName>, there may be found some very liberal views, for a German, in regard to marriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>He readily admits that <quote>nothing but the ancient depreciation of the female sex could lead to the thought of a <foreign lang="la">patria potestas</foreign> (paternal authority), which ascribed to the father the unconditional right over the child's life and death.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>He defines marriage as being a complete surrender of personality in respect to what is most peculiar to this personality, namely, the body; but instead of making this a wholly <num value="1">one</num>-sided surrender, as has been too common with both civil and religious writers, he makes it distinctly and explicitly mutual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>He finely says, following <persName n="Kant,,,,," id="n0192.0018.00090.00179" reg="mostcommon:Kant,Emmanuel,,,:1"><surname>Kant</surname></persName> in this, that <quote>this complete surrender works no detriment to personal honor only in case it is returned by just as complete and unreserved surrender of the other personality in relation to all the interests of life.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>From this he concludes, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that marriage must be no temporary union, but a <pb id="p.91" n="91"/> fellowship of the whole life, of all human and divine interests; and then that only monogamy corresponds to this ideal.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>All this is afterwards summed up by him as <quote>the perfect moral equivalence of the <num value="2">two</num> partners in marriage;</quote> and it is rather a disappointment when we find him, nevertheless, declaring that this equivalence <quote>does not annul the necessity that a single will must decide in relation to the externalities of the conduct of life.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>What he afterwards says under this head seems a little indistinct, and might be variously interpreted; but this general proposition, heard so often from the lips of mediocre men, seems a little unworthy of the strength and fearlessness of Lotzc.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>It is my experience that the men who talk in this way, and who dwell on the companion conviction that <quote>a woman is never so well off as when she finds a strong man to rule her,</quote> do not belong in general to the strongest class of men. A man of really large and broad force likes to find some companion quality in the partner of his life, as <persName n="Shakespeare,,,,," id="n0192.0018.00091.00180" reg="mostcommon:Shakespeare,William,,,:1"><surname>Shakespeare</surname></persName>'s Brutus found it in Portia: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>A weak wife will sometimes be happy in being crushed by such a fireside despot; and a strong and good-natured wife will smile inwardly while she listens to the lofty words of a husband whom she perhaps winds round her finger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>But neither of these represents the ideal household.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>That is found only where the <quote>moral equivalence of the <num value="2">two</num> partners</quote> is recognized through everything, and they learn to harmonize into <num value="1">one</num> joint power, or else by mutual agreement assign to each a separate portion of the sway.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>This is now partially recognized by our courts, in regard to the custody of the children, for instance; and there are probably few judges within the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> who would go as far as that <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> judge who lately ruled that a mother had no legal right to the custody of her child so long as her husband lived, although that husband had long deserted both her and the child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>It is more and more recognized also in respect to the management of property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>This joint control of the <num value="2">two</num> most important possessions is a recognition of the possibility of equal alliances where neither party shall have absolute sway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>That this is perfectly practicable in the affairs of common life is shown by the vast multitude of business partnerships between <num value="2">two</num> persons, neither of whom claims to control the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>Enormous commercial responsibilities, involving delicate <pb id="p.93" n="93"/> and complicated decisions, are often vested in <num value="2">two</num> persons who have to rely solely on mutual confidence to settle all differences of opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>It is not found necessary to reason abstractly that government must be in the hands of <num value="1">one</num> person, and that therefore the <num value="1">one</num> partner must be an autocrat and the other a figure-head only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>We thus know that in the most active business of life-that, indeed, which is technically and habitually called <quote>business,</quote> as if it were the only serious matter-things may be as well managed by <num value="2">two</num> leads as by <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>Indeed the assumption is that the <num value="2">two</num> heads will be even better than <num value="1">one</num>, as the common proverb goes, for purposes of consultation; and where final action is needed, it can be delegated by mutual agreement to the <num value="1">one</num> or the other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>Now if <num value="2">two</num> business partners, coming together with only material interests at stake, can thus work successfully on what may be called the <num value="2">two</num>-headed plan, why is it not to be expected that <num value="2">two</num> married persons can do it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>Their success, if they succeed, is a success far more important <pb id="p.94" n="94"/> to their happiness than any business triumph; their failure, if they fail, is more disastrous than a whole series of mercantile bankruptcies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>Under ordinary circumstances they can go on by mutual agreement; in extraordinary circumstances they must consent, as business partners do, to delegate t-he decision by the same mutual agreement to that <num value="1">one</num> for whom it is most obviously fitting, or who has most at stake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>In most families this is already done, so far as concerns the broad general method of letting the husband decide on the domicile, and the wife as to the care of children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>Even here the <num value="2">two</num> things intermingle, since in a proposed change of domicile the welfare of the children is <num value="1">one</num> of the most important elements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>It has always seemed to me that <placeName reg="Lowell, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013975">Lowell</placeName>'s paper on the condescension of foreigners should be followed by <num value="1">one</num> on the humility of <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0192.0019.00095.00186" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>It may be that we do not make that quality obtrusive when travelling abroad, for there we are frequently stung and goaded out of this fine constitutional trait.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/><quote>My dear young lady,</quote> said the kind <name>English</name> clergyman to a certain American traveller in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, <quote>Let me urge you not to make use of that word unless you are willing to be known as an American.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>To this the good man had no answer ready, as it was a contingency he had not foreseen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>In such cases the bruised <rs>Yankee</rs> will turn upon his assailant; nor does he always fail to offer the original provocation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>But it is chiefly at home and in our dealings with foreigners that the constitutional humility asserts itself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>It is needless to deny that many or most of our <pb id="p.96" n="96"/> foreign visitors are persons of fairly good manners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>It was especially to be noticed, in the large company of scientific men who visited the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> a few years ago, what simplicity and modesty marked the most eminent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>Yet taking a whole year's yield, so to speak, of foreign arrivals, how much discrimination is needed, and how little we make!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>There is something admirable in the meekness with which we associate, on equal or even deferential terms, with persons of a far lower grade of courtesy than that to which we are accustomed-provided they come in under the laws of hospitality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>Who has not dined in company with some travelling Englishman, perhaps a man of note, whose manners were so intolerable that, as a Boston woman said lately on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, they justified dynamite?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>And who has not lived to see the same person's book of travels, in which he kindly gave his own verdict of approval or condemnation of the society which had made an exception from its general standard of good-breeding when it admitted him?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>Who has not heard some <name>English</name> lecturer, while coiling and uncoiling himself into and out of positions of inconceivable awkwardness, dole out elementary lessons on literature and science, as it were in words of <num value="1">one</num> syllable, to audiences which had heard these same themes discussed by <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0192.0019.00096.00188" reg="mostcommon:Agassiz,Louis,,,:1"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> or <persName n="Rogers,,,,," id="n0192.0019.00096.00189" reg="mostcommon:Rogers,W.,B.,,:1"><surname>Rogers</surname></persName> or <persName n="Holmes,,,,," id="n0192.0019.00096.00190" reg="mostcommon:Holmes,O.,W.,,:1"><surname>Holmes</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>And who has not subsequently read that worthy man's <pb id="p.97" n="97"/> book or magazine essay, in which he perhaps benignantly complimented the intelligence of his audience --an intelligence which he never could fairly compute, since he never found out how it had criticised him. I forget which of these excellent gentlemen it was who gravely recommended to the good people of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> a wholly new means of mental improvement-reading aloud in the evening!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>What is it that carries us calmly through these inflictions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>No doubt good-nature has something to do with it, and the feeling of hospitality ; but it is also largely due to the tradition of humility, the habit of thinking that light and grace come from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>-<foreign lang="la">ex oriente lux</foreign>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>We early overcame this humility in political matters, because it took a race of strong men to free us from the parental yoke, and we recognized their strength; but literature and art and science and refined manners come more slowly, and in these we do not yet trust ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>That was true of our early days which <persName n="Gellius,,Aulus,,," id="n0192.0019.00097.00191" reg="default:Gellius,Aulus,,,"><foreName>Aulus</foreName> <surname>Gellius</surname></persName> quotes <persName n="Cato,,,,," id="n0192.0019.00097.00192" reg="mostcommon:Cato,M.,P.,,:1"><surname>Cato</surname></persName> as saying of early <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>: <quote>Poetry was not held in honor; if any <num value="1">one</num> devoted himself to it, or went about to banquets, he was called a vagabond</quote> (<foreign lang="la">grassator vocabatur</foreign>). Hence we were slower to assert ourselves in these finer arts, and when we did, it was with becoming modesty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>It was thought daring in <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0192.0019.00097.00193" reg="nearbymention:Emerson,M.,J.,,"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> to sing of the bumblebee, or <persName n="Lowell,,,,," id="n0192.0019.00097.00194" reg="mostcommon:Lowell,J.,R.,,:1"><surname>Lowell</surname></persName> of the <pb id="p.98" n="98"/> bobolink; as for <persName n="Whittier,,,,," id="n0192.0019.00098.00195" reg="mostcommon:Whittier,J.,G.,,:1"><surname>Whittier</surname></persName>, who had never even crossed the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, how could he sing at all?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>Especially in the realm of manners this humility has prevailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>During the last French Empire it used to be held at <placeName reg="Newport, Rhode Island, Newport" key="tgn,7014221">Newport</placeName> and New York that there was no standard of good-breeding but in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, as if the best-bred <orgName n="American Society" type="society">American society</orgName> were not of older tradition as well as better strain than the dynasty of the <name>Napoleons</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>The truth is that the finest American manners are indigenous, not imported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>You will find such manners in little towns in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, where not a person has ever seen <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and where to have been to <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> or New York is to be a great traveller.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>Never have I seen more truly gracious and dignified manners than in the little <rs>Boston</rs> and <rs>Cambridge</rs> of my youth, among ladies mostly untravelled, and speaking no language but their own.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>They are as well trained, intellectually, for the most part, as their sisters of the <rs>Eastern States</rs>, have quite as often had the advantages of foreign travel; and derive from the life of newer communities, and from the more varied material under their charge a certain breadth of view and freedom from tradition which are rarer at the <rs>East</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>The Eastern colleges, and conspicuously <persName n="Wellesley,,,,," id="n0192.0020.00100.00206" reg="mostcommon:Wellesley,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellesley</surname></persName>, draw much of their supply of teachers from this class, who thus give back to the <rs>East</rs> that benefit of culture which was formerly supposed to flow westward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>Thus much for my authority; the passage in the letter that most strikes me is this; <quote>We have in school a lovely girl from the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>This was not a bit of dulcet flattery, for it was addressed to a man. It was founded on an observation that we all may make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>We listen to the reading of letters from some foreign country, perhaps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>If they are written by a man, they may be very good, perhaps brilliant; but if so, it is probably because the man himself is known as brilliant; we are rarely surprised by finding a man's letters much better than we should have expected of him. With women, on the other hand, the surprise is constant; we may almost say that every woman writes better letters than we should expect of her; that <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num>-rate woman writes better than any but a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-rate man. Whence is this difference?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/><pb id="p.112" n="112"/></p> 
<p>It may come, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, from the closer observation of details by women, the result of the early training of their lives, this being also based on a quality of original temperament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>Now details are what we need in a letter; for philosophy and general grasp we go to a book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>Method, order, combination, are quite unimportant in a letter; we need to know what each man or woman described was doing at a certain time &mdash; where they stood, what they wore, what they appeared to have had for breakfast or to expect for dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>This is what a letter should bring us; the logic and the deductions may come in separate packages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>Now the letters of women will vary with the period; they may be stiff or they may be gushing, but they will give details.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>I remember an educated American who, on returning from <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, could only say, when asked to describe the <name>Pyramids</name>, <quote>Oh yes, enormous things-enormous things!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/><quote>Now there is not in tie world,</quote> he says, <quote>so certain a guarantee for pure idiomatic diction, without trick or affectation, as a case of genuine excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>Real situations are always pledges of a real natural language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>It is in counterfeit passion, in the minical situations of novels, or in poems that are efforts of ingenuity,</quote> that women write badly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>Yet he must remember that women, like men, or more than men, are influenced by current fashion; and letters, as well as anything else, may be conventional and over-elaborate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>Thus, after a delightful epistle to the then famous poet <persName n="Hayley,,,,," id="n0192.0022.00113.00243" reg="mostcommon:Hayley,William,,,:1"><surname>Hayley</surname></persName>, sloe must needs close with this apology for too long a letter: <quote>But be still, thou repining heart of mine; stifle thy selfish regrets, and with a sincere benediction on thy favorite bard, that health, peace, and fame may long be his, arrest the pen thou art so <pb id="p.114" n="114"/> prone to lead through thy mazes, governing it, as thou dost, with resistless despotism.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>Yet all this is simplicity itself compared to the habitual inflation of <persName n="Seward,Miss,,,," id="n0192.0022.00114.00244" reg="nearbymention:Seward,Anna,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>'s style when writing anything that is not a letter-as, for instance, her life of <persName n="Darwin,Doctor,Erasmus,,," id="n0192.0022.00114.00245" reg="default:Darwin,Erasmus,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>Erasmus</foreName> <surname>Darwin</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>And I perfectly remember certain maiden ladies of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, who were justly renowned in my youth for what they would have called by no briefer name than <quote>epistolary correspondence,</quote> who modelled their style upon <persName n="Seward,Miss,,,," id="n0192.0022.00114.00246" reg="nearbymention:Seward,Anna,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>'s, and would have disdained to close a letter with a sentence of <num value="1">one</num> clause or a word of <num value="1">one</num> syllable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>They wrote charming descriptions, yet were never satisfied without getting on their stilts at the end, or at least dropping a stately old-fashioned courtesy to their audience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>the independent Purse.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>Where I asked what change would make most difference in the happiness of married pairs, it would not be hard to answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>The change would not relate to the laws of divorce, whether loosened or tightened; it would not even he in conceding to women the right of the separate boudoir, though it has always seemed to me that it would enhance the dignity and delicacy, and therefore the happiness, of wedded life, if every woman had an apartment of which she might turn the key, even against her husband, as freely as he may turn the key of his study or his office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>But the change now meant is <num value="1">one</num> already effected in many families, and always, I suspect, with happy results &mdash; the introduction, under some form, of the <rs>Independent Purse</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>By this institution is meant something quite beyond that mere allowance for dress, or for household expenses, which is so often made in families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>That is usually based on sheer convenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>There is no more thought of justice in it than in the sum allowed to Bridget to buy yeast, or to <persName n="Michael,,,,," id="n0192.0023.00115.00249" reg="mostcommon:Michael,nomatch:0"><surname>Michael</surname></persName> for <pb id="p.116" n="116"/> horse-feed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>The true division is not based on convenience, but on right &mdash; on the knowledge, namely, that the wife's share of the day's work is as essential as the husband's, and that there should be some equality in the distribution of proceeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>The family relation is, in its merely business aspects, a kind of co-partnership.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>Now it is very common in such partnerships for <num value="1">one</num> partner to see to the manufacturing or to the care of the property, while all the money passes through another partner's hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>But he who handles the money does not therefore regard it all as primarily his own, nor does he talk of <quote>giving</quote> it to the other partners; they simply draw their share of the profits from time to time, under conditions agreed upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>They draw it as of right, not through his kindness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>Why is it not so with a wife?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>In a few cases, no doubt, such a proposition would be unreasonable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>There are cases where the wife is a toy, and does nothing to help her husband, so that he could both make and spend his income more judiciously without her. So there are cases, on the other side, where the wife supports the husband outright, whether this be done by ballet-dancing or at the wash-tub.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>These are extreme cases, and may be set aside together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>In the great mass of instances the wife helps the husband in establishing the fortunes of the family, or &mdash; in modester phrase-earning <pb id="p.117" n="117"/> its daily bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>Often she does this directly, as in case of the farmer's wife, who usually works as hard as her husband, and, indeed, in new communities, where domestics are hard to get, much harder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>Even in this case it is almost always the husband who is the treasurer, who collects the money earned, and <quote>gives</quote> --or perhaps does not give it to his wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>But where her share is not so obvious, it is just as essential.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>Every woman who takes care of her own household lifts exactly that much off her husband's shoulders, and leaves him free to attend to the outside business of the firm, for which the money comes in. Alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>many a woman works herself to death before her husband discovers, by what it costs him to buy the services of housekeepers and nurses, that the mere material labor of his wife was worth a salary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>He is happy if he does not see reason to think that if he had only <quote>given</quote> her the amount of that salary he might have saved her. After all, <persName n="Whittier,,,,," id="n0192.0023.00117.00250" reg="mostcommon:Whittier,J.,G.,,:1"><surname>Whittier</surname></persName> is mistaken; it is not <quote>It might have been!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>that are the saddest words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/><quote>ad I only known!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>are a great deal sadder.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>Some time or other, it may be, we shall discover the simple mathematical formula by which to adjust this matter of income.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>Meanwhile we must guess at it. It will be evident, on a little thought, that a married woman needs much more than an allowance for food and clothing &mdash; the food to be shared by <pb id="p.118" n="118"/> her household, the clothing to include probably that of her younger children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>She needs such an income as will make her in some sort the equal of her husband as to her general expenditures, dress included.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>Probably the item of dress is the <num value="1">one</num> department in which women are habitually more liberal in expenditure than their husbands; and this results in part from the customs of society &mdash; customs from which the husbands would by no means wish their wives to depart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>But, apart from dress, there certainly prevails among men a much freer standard of small expenditures than among women, and this where there are no habits properly to be called profligate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/><quote>A cheap lunch for a man,</quote> said a hotel-keeper once to me, <quote>seems a (dear lunch to a woman.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>I never visited a woman's club-room that did not look impoverished beside the furnishings of the plainest club-room for men that I ever entered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>Who that has collected money for benevolent purposes has not noticed the difference between the sexes as to the standard of giving?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>Half the time the wife does not venture to give at all until her husband comes home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>If, however, she is accustomed to acting independently, she draws from her purse a dollar with some hesitation, whereas he would perhaps give <num value="5">five</num> with none at all; or she tales out <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure> where he would write a check for <num value="20">twenty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>Women are certainly as much interested <pb id="p.119" n="119"/> in benevolent enterprises as men, and as willing to give what they have, but they have not the money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>Even if they have it by them, they fear to use it, for they have not the habit of the separate purse.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>It may be said that it is base and unworthy to treat married life as a co-partnership only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>I do not so treat it, for it is much more than that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>The trouble is that the system prevalent in many families makes it much less than that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>A wrong system makes it a business affair, as far as the labor goes, but tie alliance ceases when the distribution of profits is concerned &mdash; as if in a large firm the partner having charge of the books should balance them for his own convenience at the end of the year, and deposit the undivided profits to his own private credit in the bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>Marriage is something more than a co-partnership, but it is nothing less; it is governed by higher laws, but by no lower.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>Fortunately the business knowledge of women is steadily increasing, and with it their capacity to deal with money.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>It is not many years since there prevailed in some parts of this country a method of discipline which would now be generally held barbarous even among the most conscientious parents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>It was held to be an essential part of a child's training that as soon as its will was developed up to a certain point, it should be as definitely and distinctly broken as you break a plant upon its stalk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>Instead of avoiding or postponing such a necessity, the parent fearlessly met the occasion, and was &mdash; for even the most rigorous parents were human-glad when it was over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>The child must definitely be taught submission on some specific occasion, for submission's sake; and this without reference to its state of health, to its nervous condition, or to the possibility of obtaining the same result without such a direct contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>In fact, the direct contest was considered an advantage in itself; even if the way was clear to bending the will, that was not desirable &mdash; it must be broken.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>Many persons now past middle age will recall <pb id="p.122" n="122"/> such contests as this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>Generally the ordeal came from the father; often the mother would have chosen milder ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>Sometimes it came, however, from the mother, in which case the process was more formidable still, a stern woman being generally a sterner being than a man who shares that same attribute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>What was the result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>Often, no doubt, to create a strong and conscientious character, the will not being really broken, but only subordinated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>Often it tended only to create the faults of a slave --evasion, insincerity, cowardice &mdash; in place of manly self-assertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>Very often it left a barrier of ice between parent and child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>A woman of <num value="40">forty</num>, the daughter of an educated lawyer in a country town, once told me that she never knew, until she was nearly <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> old, how to tell time by the clock; the reason being that her father had undertaken to explain to her the method when she was but a child, and she had failed to comprehend it. She had been afraid to tell him that she did not understand, and equally afraid to ask light from any <num value="1">one</num> else, lest he should hear of it, and blame her; so she said nothing about it for years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>Yet that man, so crushing in his domestic authority, had never laid his hand on <num value="1">one</num> of his children in punishment; his word and look were a sufficient rod. It is no wonder that when he died-respected and trusted by the whole community &mdash; his daughter <pb id="p.123" n="123"/> wrote to me, <quote>His heart was pure-and terrible; I think there was not another like it on earth.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>She was wrong; for there were, in the older and sterner times, a good many like it, though none more heroic, more single-minded, or more tenacious.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>The modern theory is-and I confess it seems to Inc the wiser <num value="1">one</num>--that the will itself is a part of the sacredness of our nature, and should no more be broken than the main shaft of a steam &mdash; engine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>There is <num value="1">one</num> thing that I dread more for my little Maiden than to hear her say <quote>I will,</quote> namely, that she should lose the power of saying it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>It is not necessary to say, on the other hand, as some persons hold, that all moral error is but disease, and never needs direct contest, but only soothing medicines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>Yet I believe more and more, as I grow older, that a large part of our contests with children are wasted, and that patience and tact would commonly accomplish the same end, without the crossing of bayonets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>There is no doubt that much of what seems violence or stubbornness in children is merely a phase of physical development, and will be outgrown as unconsciously as a boy outgrows the habit of treading his boot-heels sideways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>I know several grown persons whose temper was a terror in childhood, and who have long since passed, by mere natural development, and without especial struggle, into a self-controlled and perhaps commonplace maturity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>The wisest and most successful parents seem to me those who take this into account; who reduce direct contests to a minimum, bend the twig instead of breaking it, divert the course of the torrent instead of trying to dam it up. We recognize this with all domestic animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>While half a dozen men are collected around a balky horse in the street, beating, hauling, swearing, and <pb id="p.125" n="125"/> all in vain, a single expert will sometimes come along and by some very simple device-perhaps a change in the harness, or a chestnut bur inserted under the headstall &mdash; will so alter the current of the creature's dim thoughts that he will trot away bewildered, trying to conjecture what has happened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>Thus it is that wise mothers do; a little bit of ingenuity, a sudden change of theme, will often clear away all clouds in a minute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>This is not indulgence; it is common-sense and tact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>It may not always answer, but for that very reason let us use it when we can; avert the direct collisions when possible, instead of welcoming them all the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>Even the most <rs>Spartan</rs> or Puritanic mother-like <num value="1">one</num> I know, who herself put her little girl's finger to the red-hot stove, that she might learn thenceforth to avoid it &mdash; will admit that a sick child must be managed through tact and skill as well as through authority; and it is my experience that much the same is true of the healthiest and the strongest. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>An accomplished <name>English</name> writer, endeavoring to explain to <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0192.0025.00126.00254" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>, as many have done before him, how it is that educated men in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> do not feel aggrieved at giving precedence to persons of mere hereditary rank, gives a curious illustration of the very habit criticised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>He says that <quote>no sensible Englishman ever sees in it a want of real consideration for himself.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>The hosts simply employ a convenient rule, he says: the titled guests follow the order of their rank; but the person held in the greatest esteem may be some <num value="1">one</num> who comes in last of all. <quote>How frequently do we discern, from biographies and memoirs, that some untitled man, living in perfect obscurity so far as the world is concerned, has been looked up to with unaffected deference by people of exalted station!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>In saying this he seems to feel that he has said all that was needed; and that he fully justifies this curious practice, by which the very guest for whom the entertainment is made, instead of being placed at his hostess's side and treated with honor, may find himself utterly subordinated <pb id="p.127" n="127"/> to every person in the room who happens to count among his ancestors a royal mistress or a brewer sufficiently wealthy to have been rewarded with a peerage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>To the average republican mind he simply justifies the criticism, and prolongs that attitude which seems to most <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0192.0025.00127.00255" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> so cringing; and which does more than any <num value="1">one</num> difference, perhaps, to transmit from <num value="1">one</num> generation to another the alienation between the <num value="2">two</num> races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>It is the worst part of any degrading practice that it makes men accustomed to its working.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>It may be that no sensible Englishman ever sees in this a want of consideration for himself personally-that is a small matter; but if he does not see in it something which is insulting to the dignity of human nature itself he differs inconceivably from a sensible American.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>A cast-iron etiquette like this puts a ceremony above a man ; a descent above a character; and above all, a social rule above that instinct of hospitality which bids even the <rs>Bedouin Arab</rs> and the <rs>American Indian</rs> give the guest the place of honor at his board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>In the long series of social insults which <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0192.0025.00127.00257" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, according to his <pb id="p.128" n="128"/> chronicler, <persName n="Badeau,General,,,," id="n0192.0025.00128.00258" reg="mostcommon:Badeau,Adam,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Badeau</surname></persName>, received in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, the point of disrespect lay not in the fact that he was the greatest general of the age or an ex-President of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, but in the circumstance that he was the guest for whom the entertainment was in most cases made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>He being the guest, all this subordination was as essentially degrading as when the guests of some <placeName reg="Oriental, Okfuskee, Oklahoma" key="tgn,2560760">Oriental</placeName> potentate are expected.to enter his presence on all fours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>That, no doubt, is esteemed by his loyal subjects a most <quote>convenient</quote> arrangement, for which the king himself is <quote>in nowise personally responsible.</quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>But it is in the closing sentence of the defence, after all, that the weakest point lies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>People of exalted station, it is said, may often look up to some untitled man. In a right condition of society-even in a republican condition of society, as <num value="60000000">sixty millions</num> of people here maintain it-how can there be such a thing as an exalted station?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>It is character that should be exalted, not station; and the more the character counts for, the less important is the station.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>This ideal may not yet be fulfilled anywhere, but it certainly comes far nearer <pb id="p.129" n="129"/> fulfilment in this country than in any monarchy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>What station in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> could be regarded, properly speaking, as exalted?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>I can think of none except the <name>Presidency</name>, and even as to that such a phrase would seem too fulsome for truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>For although this post involves far more of direct personal power than do most thrones, yet it has no permanence; it is held by a <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> lease, after which the occupant reverts to the ranks of common men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>The question has been seriously raised by <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> reformers, such as <persName n="Mazzini,,,,," id="n0192.0025.00129.00260" reg="mostcommon:Mazzini,nomatch:0"><surname>Mazzini</surname></persName> and <persName n="Blanc,,Louis,,," id="n0192.0025.00129.00261" reg="default:Blanc,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Blanc</surname></persName>, whether the same trust could not more fitly be exercised by the mere chairman of a committee, and <persName n="Conway,Mister,M.,D.,," id="n0192.0025.00129.00262" reg="default:Conway,M.,D.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Conway</surname></persName> has of late revived this theory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>Surely the phrase <quote>exalted station</quote> is too extravagant for a function thus temporary and derivative; and setting the <rs>President</rs> aside, there is no <num value="1">one</num> else among us on whose position it could be fitly bestowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>We can recognize the exaltation of a great public character, but hardly of a <quote>station.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>For there is no station which any American might not aspire to hold; and it would be the spirit in which he held it that made it exalted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>This is at least the <rs>American</rs> habit of mind, and the interest we habitually take in what are called <pb id="p.130" n="130"/> <quote>exalted stations</quote> in other countries is like that we feel in the Blue-coat School or the picturesque <quote>Beefeaters</quote> who do duty at the <name>Tower</name> of <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, or the powdered footmen who are gradually vanishing from the streets of that city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>It fell to the writer's lot, on his very earliest entrance on the work of the <orgName n="School Committee" type="committee">school-committee</orgName> man, to encounter a sort of object-lesson in this finer force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>There was an out-of-town school, in a farming district, where the <quote>winter boys</quote> lad long been a terror to teachers and committee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>Tweedledum in <quote><persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> in Wonderland</quote> points out that nothing more inconvenient can possibly happen to a man in battle than to have his head taken off.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>This was the final situation in that school; and there was a summer of hopeless doubt as to what teacher to put in for the winter season again approaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>At last a veteran member, who rarely opened his lips, parted them for this brief proposition, <quote>Let's appoint Miss Blank</quote> --naming a well-known teacher of the centre district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>Miss Blank was accordingly put in, and in a few weeks the very boys who had ejected her predecessor were searching the woods for ground-pine with which to deck her school-room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>She had applied a finer force.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>And this finer force has the interest of being in a manner an American patent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>The influence of women in the school, as in the family, is all the greater because it substitutes affection for physical strength, and must accomplish its results by tact and not by brute strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>In every village the schoolteacher is the natural ally of all civilizing agencies &mdash; of the librarian, the lecturer, the clergyman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>That which is claimed for the established church in any country, that it secures the presence of at least <num value="1">one</num> cultivated person in each small precinct, is in a quiet way accomplished by the presence of the teacher in every school district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>And if it be claimed that she does not make a life-work of this pursuit, as a man would do, the answer is that men usually pass as rapidly through teaching to some other profession as do women to matrimony; and that statistics taken in several different towns have shown that there is no great average difference in this respect between the sexes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>It is also to be noticed that when a man leaves this vocation for some other, he often quits teaching altogether; but that when a woman leaves it for marriage she soon resumes it in another form, and applies her finer force in the nursery instead of the school-room. </p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>What is the secret of this curious variableness of emotion, this undisguised terror of the little, this courage before that which is great?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>It may be said that women are cool in shipwreck because they are <pb id="p.144" n="144"/> merely passive, or because they expect to be taken care of. But all military experience shows that the passive condition is least favorable to courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>The severest test of soldiers is to keep still under fire when they themselves can do nothing; the mere order to march or shoot is an immense relief to the nervous tension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>Then as to the certainty of being taken care of, that is the very thing that never looks quite sure to the person most concerned, especially where, as on the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Oregon" key="tgn,7007708">Oregon</placeName></hi>, women see the firemen taking possession of boats and running away with them before their eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>Still, it is fair to remember that a good deal of the apparent excitement and confusion among men in a shipwreck, as at a fire, comes from the fact that they feel called upon as men to bustle about and see if they can find something to do &mdash; a necessity under which women do not labor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>When it comes to the test of the mouse, I fancy that we really pass beyond the domain of physical courage, and enter that of nervous excitability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>I was once told by a very courageous woman that men also, if they wore long skirts, would probably scream and jump upon chairs whenever a mouse showed itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>The feeling is not properly to be called fear, any more than is the shriek of a girl when her wicked brother puts a caterpillar on her neck; she does not seriously think that the little woolly thing will hurt her, but it makes her <quote>crawl.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>Great men <pb id="p.145" n="145"/> and warriors have had similar nervous loathings for some particular animal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>So the mouse and the caterpillar do not decide the question, while the general fact doubtless is that the outlets of tears and terrors are made easier in the case of women, without thereby prejudicing their capacity for great endurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>The woman who weeps over a little disappointment may be the same woman who watches without sleep for night after night over her sick husband.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>There goes through the <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName> in early summer an immense interchange of views in respect to summer boarding-places in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>It is safe to say that in <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of these letters there appears, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> or last, a remark like this: <quote>The man of the house is not very efficient; it is his wife who carries it on.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>In <num value="1">one</num> case it was the man himself who frankly admitted the precise state of things to me, and volunteered the following commentary: <quote>The reason is, you see, that it is my wife who has what I call the organizing mind.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>There is a great deal of philosophy in this honest man's admission, and he saw just the point which many of our amateur political economists and labor reformers seem to me to miss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>They assume that the hands of man produce everything-clothes, food, and fuel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>This may be true in certain tropical countries, where clothes and fuel are almost superfluous, and food is obtained by stretching out the hands and picking a fruit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>But the theory certainly becomes false so soon as man has, or needs to have, a more <pb id="p.147" n="147"/> systematic way of living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>Wherever we drive in our summer jaunts through the country we see either the farmer at work in his fields or the operative in some little factory village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>Yet the factory village has not been created by the <quote>hands,</quote> but by some <num value="1">one</num>'s head or by a series of heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>If it were burned down to-morrow, those who now labor in it would probably be powerless to recreate it and carry it on, even if all the capital it cost were put into their pockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>It seems unfair that the man who lives in the largest house in the village, and who never does a stroke of bodily labor, should have more consideration than those who work with their hands from morning till night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>But the reason is that he is more important to the village than all the rest: his place cannot be filled, while theirs can. He has the organizing mind, or at least represents some <num value="1">one</num> else who has it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>In case of the farmer, or at least the farmer of the <rs>Atlantic States</rs>, the distinction is less obvious, because his labor is less highly organized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>He not only does his own work, but plans it also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>Yet he uses at every moment the tools and processes which only the highest organization has perfected ; his mower, his reaper, even his plough and pitchfork, are the result of organizing mind brought to bear in some great establishment, perhaps a <measure n="1000miles" type="distance">thousand miles</measure> away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>Not only does the organizing mind <pb id="p.148" n="148"/> control the working hand, but it controls even the merely inventive mind; and every improvement in the curves of a plough-share is the result of a series of single suggestions of separate inventors combined by some organizer into a structure which is, compared with the original sharpened stick, almost wholly the product of intellect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>There is nothing which commands such power as organizing mind, unless it be that subtle faculty which we call genius in the poet or the man of science &mdash; a finer and higher force, which unconsciously remoulds the world, organizing mind and all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>I have been hoping all my life to see some signs that co-operation will <num value="1">one</num> day displace competition; but that day seems as far off as ever, because it is competition, not co-operation, that knows how to avail itself of the organizing mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>All the testimony from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, where co-operation has gone much farther than here, is to the effect that while distributive co-operation-that is, the selling of goods on that method-lhas been carried very far, yet productive co-operation, or the production of goods by joint effort, has made very little progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>The explanation is very obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>The ablest writer who has come from the ranks of hand-labor in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, so far as I know, Thomas Wright-who calls himself <quote>The working Engineer,</quote> and names his book <quote>Our New masters</quote> --charges the difficulty <pb id="p.149" n="149"/> to tie impossibility of enlisting the organizing mind on the side of co-operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>There is, he says, such a thing as <quote>a capitalist talent,</quote> and the existence of this is fatal to co-operation, because workmen themselves cannot be relied upon either to find out this talent or to trust it. The objection does not seem quite conclusive, when we remember that <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0192.0029.00149.00289" reg="mostcommon:Carlyle,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName> and others have considered all republican government impracticable on the same ground &mdash; that human beings could not or would not of themselves select their ablest men to rule them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>In governmental affairs this has been partly compensated by the fact that men have at least learned better to rule themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>For some reason or other this principle does not apply itself so readily in business as in politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>Perhaps it is because business, which concerns every man's bread, is more intense and absorbing than politics, and hence is reorganized more slowly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>Undoubtedly the practical quality that needs most to be developed in women is the organizing mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>Not merely for the keeping of boarding-houses, but for all other purposes, what they need the most is the power of headship, the capacity of managing a large enterprise, and having other workers to labor under their direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>It is idle to say that they are wanting by nature in this faculty; the <rs>State</rs> has always assumed that it was a thing to be expected <pb id="p.150" n="150"/> of queens, and the <rs type="place">Church</rs> has recognized it alike in the abbesses of the <rs>Roman Catholic</rs> faith and in the deaconesses of Protestantism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>It has been developed more slowly in women, because the exigencies of home and child-bearing have largely preoccupied them and have made it necessary for men to undertake the task of organizing the life and labor of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>But no <num value="1">one</num> who sees how rapidly women have come, during the last <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>, into the charge of great benevolent operations, such as were once left to men only, can doubt the existence of a gradually maturing power in them, which shall yet make them far more potent factors even than now in <orgName n="Public Works" type="works">public works</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>Meantime, the knowledge of their own need of organizing mind should give them a good object-lesson in political economy, and enable them to understand much that is now puzzling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>As society advances to greater complication we need the organizing mind more and more; we cannot ignore its existence; we must have its service; we must pay its price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>For many years to come the natural organizers will have largely the management of the world; and almost all social inequalities result from the fact that there are still too few such organizers to get the world's work well done. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>I have some longer stories that I think might be accepted by some papers or magazines if I only had some good friend to speak a word for me. Now my health is better, and I could write constantly if I could only receive encouragement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>I have had much to keep me down --poverty and sickness; but for the next year I can write constantly if I can only get encouragement.</p></quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>This is taken literally, except that the spelling is corrected, from the last letter of the kind that reached me. They come almost invariably from small towns or inland cities, and this <num value="1">one</num> is from a village on the <rs type="place">Pacific coast</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>It is based, as they usually are, upon <num value="2">two</num> utter delusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>These are, firstly, that publication, like the proverbial kissing, <quote>goes by favor,</quote> so that all <num value="1">one</num> needs is a friend at court; and secondly, that literature is the <num value="1">one</num> vocation that needs neither training nor practice nor gradual preparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>Let us consider these <num value="2">two</num> errors a little.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, as to <quote>influence.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>If there is a class of men on the face of the earth who may be said to know their own minds, it is, I think, the editors of American periodicals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>They may not aim at the right thing, ,but they at least know what they aim at. What they seek is what their public desires; but their own interpretation of this is a matter of life and death to them, and they stand by it. So far as I have seen, no men are less influenced by the ties of personal friendship or by the judgment of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>In a considerable experience of literature <pb id="p.153" n="153"/> I have known but <num value="1">one</num> editor over whom any literary recommendations of mine appeared to have the slightest influence; and even this was not, after all, a real influence, but consisted only in knowing him so intimately as to foretell pretty accurately what his judgment would be. As to coaxing him against his judgment, it was impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>In truth, literary men are secretly rather distrusted by editors, and with some reason, as. having too many favorites and being too lenient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>The late <persName n="Longfellow,Professor,,,," id="n0192.0030.00153.00290" reg="mostcommon:Longfellow,H.,W.,,:1"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Longfellow</surname></persName>, for instance, would soon have bankrupted any publisher who should have accepted the intellectual work that he praised, for he was so amiable that he praised almost everything; and there is evidence that <persName n="Holmes,,,,," id="n0192.0030.00153.00291" reg="mostcommon:Holmes,O.,W.,,:1"><surname>Holmes</surname></persName> and <persName n="Whittier,,,,," id="n0192.0030.00153.00292" reg="mostcommon:Whittier,J.,G.,,:1"><surname>Whittier</surname></persName>, as they grow older, are growing almost as tolerant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>If the best literary endorsement thus goes for very little, what can the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-best be worth?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>Moreover, the editor is constantly looking out for new names; he hungers and thirsts after the genius of the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>Just as the great trotting horses of the turf fare often those which the keen eye of a jockey has rescued from a dray or a coal-cart, so it is the editor's dream to detect a coming <persName n="Mark Twain,,,,," id="n0192.0030.00153.00293" reg="mostcommon:Mark Twain,nomatch:0"><surname>Mark Twain</surname></persName> or <persName n="Harte,,Bret,,," id="n0192.0030.00153.00294" reg="default:Harte,Bret,,,"><foreName>Bret</foreName> <surname>Harte</surname></persName> in some nameless young aspirant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>Past celebrities, he knows very well, go rapidly off the stage; what he wants is a fresh <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>The difficulty is to know his rising genius when still harnessed to the coal-cart; <pb id="p.154" n="154"/> and here he must trust only himself and take his own risks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>Now as to entering the profession of literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>My correspondent who writes the above letter knows that, if she has a son or a brother who wishes success as a physician or a watch-maker, he must take time to train himself for his work-must educate his observation, his memory, his very sense of touch, for that pursuit-and the education will involve time, patience, tools, and a teacher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>Why is it that she herself expects to enter at once on a profession involving wider observation and more delicate forces than either medicine or watch-making, without any special preparation whatever?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>This is the discouraging thing about almost all letters of this class, that they are so rarely accompanied by any sign of personal humility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>What the most successful writers have won by years of early study, followed by other years of incessant practice, these aspirants expect to gain at a grasp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>The very letter from which the above quotation is given contained <num value="11">eleven</num> misspellings, so little attention had been given by the writer to the very rudiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>Like the country girl who came to consult <persName n="Butler,Mrs.,Fanny,Kemble,," id="n0192.0030.00154.00295" reg="default:Butler,Fanny,Kemble,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>Fanny</foreName> <foreName>Kemble</foreName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> about her career as an elocutionist, and explained frankly that what she wanted was not to learn how to read in public, but how to get her audiences together, so these mistaken persons <pb id="p.155" n="155"/> are looking out for external success, when they should be busy with the training that leads to it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>What success commonly stands for is this, that a writer has either done really good work-work excellent in itself-or else has done the kind of work that the public demands, good or bad. This last is a lower standard of success, of course, though it often brings greater pecuniary rewards; but it is a clear and definite thing, nevertheless, and needs as distinct a training as the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>In either case triumph usually follows merit, though often slowly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/><quote>There never was a good tongue,</quote> says old <persName n="Fuller,,,,," id="n0192.0030.00155.00296" reg="mostcommon:Fuller,Margaret,,,:3"><surname>Fuller</surname></persName>, <quote>that lacked ears to hear it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/><quote>Excel and you will live</quote> (<foreign lang="fr">excelle et tu vivras</foreign>), says the prince of <name>French</name> aphorists, <persName n="Joubert,,Joseph,,," id="n0192.0030.00155.00297" reg="default:Joubert,Joseph,,,"><foreName>Joseph</foreName> <surname>Joubert</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>There are grades in merit: it is merit to produce a work of genius; but there is also a great, though lower, merit in studying the taste of your time, watching its tendencies, and thereby producing just the work that is currently demanded-just what readers want and children cry for. This also needs labor and special preparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>The advice I should therefore give to every young person who asks me how to find a publisher, would be, if I dared &mdash; for we are all weak --<quote><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> produce something so good that no publisher can afford to do without it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>She herself spoke of her exquisitely wrought novels as her <quote>little bit of ivory, <measure n="2inches" type="distance">two inches</measure> wide, on which,</quote> she said, <quote>I work with a brush so fine <pb id="p.157" n="157"/> as to produce little effect after much labor.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>As a result, she has far surpassed in fame her immediate contemporaries of her own sex. <persName n="D'Arblay,Madame,,,," id="n0192.0031.00157.00304" reg="mostcommon:D'Arblay,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Madame">Madame</roleName> <surname>D'Arblay</surname></persName> (<persName n="Burney,,Fanny,,," id="n0192.0031.00157.00305" reg="default:Burney,Fanny,,,"><foreName>Fanny</foreName> <surname>Burney</surname></persName>), <persName n="Porter,Miss,,,," id="n0192.0031.00157.00306" reg="mostcommon:Porter,Jane,,,:1"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName>, <persName n="Opic,Mrs.,,,," id="n0192.0031.00157.00307" reg="mostcommon:Opic,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Opic</surname></persName>, and even <persName n="Edgeworth,Miss,,,," id="n0192.0031.00157.00308" reg="nearbymention:Edgeworth,Aliss,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Edgeworth</surname></persName>, are now little read, while <persName n="Austen,Miss,,,," id="n0192.0031.00157.00309" reg="nearbymention:Austen,Jane,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Austen</surname></persName>'s novels seem as if they were written yesterday.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>In such a book we see that the really great novel includes the creation of character, and does not stop there; for after all <num value="1">one</num> asks, What is the use of the finest delineation of persons if they do nothing worth doing after they are created?

No <num value="2">two</num> chairs were alike; nothing was paired; the carved marble mantle-piece was concealed by a lambrequin; there were screens, fans, a knot of some <placeName reg="Oriental, Okfuskee, Oklahoma" key="tgn,2560760">Oriental</placeName> stuff at the back of every chair, <num value="3">three</num> various vases of bulrushes, and <num value="7">seven</num> seltzer-water jars painted by the young lady herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>This room did not belong to the iron age, nor yet to the glacial, but to the recent or Japanese formation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/>Considered as a step forward from the earlier stages represented in that house, it indicated a great advance; regarded as a finality, it was something to appall the human heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1049"/><pb id="p.163" n="163"/></p> 
<p>Now all these successive transformations were the work of women, and they suggest the question, If woman is thus the born and appointed decorator of the home, why should she not be trained to do it artistically and professionally?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1050"/>It is not truly artistic to plunge at once into the most exclusive extreme of the present fashion, whether it lead to black, or white, or a multiplicity of hue, but to take what is truly the best of each period and adapt it gracefully to modern use and to the needs of each separate family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1051"/>In many houses this is now exquisitely done; no <num value="1">one</num> can deny the great improvement in our <quote>interiors</quote> within <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>. But if it is to be done systematically for the community, it is impossible to leave it wholly to amateurs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1052"/>The modern decoration implies architects, designers, and artificers of its own. In the foreman of an art-blacksmith's shop I found the other day <num value="1">one</num> whom I had previously known as a working jeweller; he had simply transferred his energy and skill from <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs> to brass and iron, and was laboring with hands harder than before, yet no less cunning, upon graceful <rs n="gas fixtures" type="product">gas-fixtures</rs> and in-door ornamentations of his own designing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1053"/>It must be the same with women; they must undergo professional training to do their best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1054"/>Here is this whole continent waiting to be made graceful and beautiful in its in-door homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1055"/>It is said by dealers that, outside of a few large <pb id="p.164" n="164"/> cities, there is absolutely no arrangement to supply this demand &mdash; no <num value="1">one</num> who can give to a young couple setting up their house-keeping more than that amount of information possessed by the average furniture dealer, which is very little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1056"/>For want of this, many a young pair, as their wedding-day approaches, sit down and ponder helplessly over some book on <quote>The house beautiful,</quote> or <quote>In-door decoration,</quote> until their souls are filled with despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/>Where are they to find these charming <hi rend="italics">portieres</hi>, these aesthetic wall-papers, these delightful <persName n="Russian,,,,," id="n0192.0032.00164.00328" reg="mostcommon:Russian,nomatch:0"><surname>Russian</surname></persName> wash-bowls that are lighter and prettier and cheaper and more durable than any china?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1058"/>And the dealers receive unavailing letters from a <measure n="1000miles" type="distance">thousand miles</measure> away, asking for the wrong things or under the wrong names, and ending in failure?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1059"/>What is the remedy?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1060"/>The remedy is for a few women <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and then a good many women, after training themselves properly, to take up decoration as a profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1061"/>Let any <num value="2">two</num> bright and capable girls who have wearied themselves in painting water-colors that people do not want, or Christmas-cards for which the market is waning, try another experiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1062"/>Let them, after studying in the art schools of New York or <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> or <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>, make also a careful study of the markets and workshops of those cities, so far as they relate to decoration; and then go, armed with circulars, <pb id="p.165" n="165"/> price-lists, plans, and patterns, to establish themselves as household decorators in some interior city where the wave of modern improvement has thus far come only as a matter of intelligent interest, not of systematic supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1063"/>They will have to wait a while, no doubt, to command public confidence, or even to make their mission understood; but they will not have to wait so long as their brothers will wait for clients or for patients.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1064"/>They will need to be very practical, very accurate, very efficient, and very patient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1065"/>The great dealers in the larger cities will gladly make them their agents, give them letters of introduction, and pay them a commission on sales.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1066"/>With a little tact they can learn to co-operate with the local dealers, to whom they will naturally leave the coarser supplies, devoting themselves to the finer touches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1067"/>If they succeed at all, their circle of clients or correspondents may extend through whole States, and they will help to refine the life and thought of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>By all means let us see women take up household decoration as an educated profession. </p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1070"/>An exceedingly well-informed young woman said to another, in my hearing, the other day, <quote>Do you not think that there is something in a voice?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/>It was my impulse to answer, <quote>There is everything in a voice.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/>What is beauty, symmetry, or grace in man or woman if, the moment the lips part, there issue sounds so discordant that they drive you away like the harsh scream of a peacock?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1073"/>If we travel in the dark by stage-coach or sleeping-car, we instantly form an opinion of every person around us whose voice we hear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1074"/>Their standard of manners, their chances of training, their course of education, often the very locality from which they come, reveal themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1075"/>Qualities of character, as peevishness or sweetness, habitual interests, home habits, all indicate themselves there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1076"/>And yet the voice has been until lately quite neglected in our schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/>At this day, if anything is taught in that direction, it is mainly elocution; that is, the pronunciation of words and the utterance of sentences, while the <pb id="p.167" n="167"/> voice itself, which is the foundation of all elocution, remains untrained.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1078"/>Yet there is no training which we as a nation need more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1079"/>Whether by change of climate or of habits, we in this country have lost the good average of clear enunciation which prevails in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/>Through the general spread of popular education we have really less of local dialect than the <rs>English</rs>; and the mere pronunciation of words is on the whole as well done here; it is in the tones of voice that the disadvantage lies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/><name>English</name> people make the mistake of supposing that what they call <quote>the <rs>American</rs> twang</quote> is universal, just as we make the mistake of supposing the dropped <quote>h</quote> to be universal in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>; but each evil is too common.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1082"/>Nor is it in comparing the best-trained people especially that we notice any drawback among ourselves, for <name>English</name> public speakers are very awkward compared to ours; and there is now much of the <name>Dundreary</name> affectation in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> fashionable circles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/>But that the ordinary well-to-do Englishman speaks in a more agreeable voice than the ordinary well-to-do American is something that there is no use in denying; and when the comparison is applied to the average woman, the answer is still more inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/>I must confess to preferring a well-bred American woman to her <name>English</name> compeer in every aspect but this <num value="1">one</num>; her greater <pb id="p.168" n="168"/> quickness of mind is as unquestionable as her greater vivacity of spirits or taste in dress; it is only when you come to the voice that she is at a disadvantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/>It is not that <num value="1">one</num> does not hear attractive voices of women in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>; they, indeed, are growing more and more common, and this is encouraging, because it shows that the climate offers no real obstacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/>But, after all, there is in the voice of the typical <name>English</name> <quote>gentlewoman,</quote> tame, conventional, narrow though she may be, a peculiar and soothing charm --a combination of mellowness and clearness and crispness that makes you willing, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> few days at least, to listen to the very tamest discourse on lawn-tennis or water-colors or the new curate, for the sake of the agreeable vehicle by which it comes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>It is amusing to find that <persName n="Carnegie,Mister,Andrew,,," id="n0192.0033.00168.00329" reg="default:Carnegie,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Andrew</foreName> <surname>Carnegie</surname></persName> --<quote>the star-spangled Scotchman,</quote> as William Black, the novelist, appropriately calls him-interrupts his altogether jubilant book on <quote>Triumphant democracy</quote> by an expression of discontent over the <rs>American</rs> voice &mdash; the only thing about which he makes the slightest concession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/><quote>The American voice,</quote> he says, <quote>is thin to begin with &mdash; the effect of climate, I fear-and to this is added the abominable practice of slurring over or cutting off inconvenient syllables.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>The American woman is the most intelligent, entertaining, and agreeable in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>If <pb id="p.169" n="169"/> she had her English sister's voice and enunciation, she would be perfect, but these she has not.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>Certainly I have little more liking than he for royal families and hereditary nobles, nor does it seem to me that even the manners of the community are benefited by their presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>The difference in voice is not a social difference between the <num value="2">two</num> countries, but mainly, no doubt, a partial modification of organs in a new environment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>In other words, it is something for attention and education; we have to work out our own salvation in this respect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>It is altogether probable that there is to be a new voice developed in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, as there is already a new temperament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/>It used to be thought that we could never be so strong or healthy as the <rs>English</rs>, because we were thinner; but it is now pretty well proved that we needed only to become acclimated and adapt ourselves to the new ways of living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>So with the <rs>American</rs> voice; it will probably never be a chest voice, like the <rs>English</rs>, but it will come more from the head, and when well trained will be an instrument capable of finer modulation and greater expression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>As the very best American manners &mdash; such <pb id="p.170" n="170"/> manners, for instance, as those of the late <persName n="Dabney,Mister,Charles,,," id="n0192.0033.00170.00332" reg="default:Dabney,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Dabney</surname></persName>, so long our consul at <placeName key="tgn,1007070" n="1.000 1" reg="faial,horta,ilhas dos acores,portugal,europe">Fayal</placeName> &mdash; seem to me finer than the best <name>English</name> manners, so the very best American voices seem to me better than the best <name>English</name> voices, being equally clear and mellow, with more positive sweetness and far more range of expression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/>But such really good voices are rarer here than in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, mainly because there is not the same close attention given to the matter on this side the <rs>Atlantic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>An <name>English</name> mother, in the well-bred classes, is as solicitous about her daughter's way of speaking as about her clothes-perhaps more so, if we may judge by results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>An American mother, under similar circumstances, is apt to attend to the clothes, and leave the voice untended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/>In schools, however, and especially in public schools, this matter is being more and more brought to attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>Remarking, a few years since, in a large family, how much better the youngest daughter used her voice than any of her sisters, I found with surprise that much of the difference was due to the pains taken in the public schools of the rural city where she lived-schools which she alone had attended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/>If we can once see American education achieving superiority in a point like this, it will be striking at the very root of the evil. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>It reminded me of a saying by a classmate of mine, so fond of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and so ashamed of his own country that he used to define it as the mission of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <quote>to vulgarize the whole world,</quote> who yet resented being taken too literally in this remark; and would tell a story of the disgusting sycophancy of middle-class Englishmen towards people of rank, contrasting it with the perfect indifference of the average American traveller, unconscious of having a social superior anywhere.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/>But there is an aspect of this <quote>social superior</quote> question so obvious that I wonder to see so little said about it. Does it not really form a key to the <pb id="p.172" n="172"/> whole question of domestic service?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/>It often seems to me that the estimable ladies who are always urging, and with many good arguments, that young girls thrown upon themselves for support should choose house-work rather than the factory, miss the most important point in the whole affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1111"/>Those who refuse house-work in this form do it, not because they dread work, for they usually work harder elsewhere; nor because house-work seems to them degrading, because they have almost all helped their mothers to do it, and they probably expect to do it for themselves when they are married.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1112"/>There is nothing that the ladies who advise them can say about it which has any effect upon their minds, because the main point is so often left untouched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>The thing that really influences them is the dislike --which they share with dukes and duchesses-of having social superiors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>Say what you please, they are not made conscious, in the life of factory operatives or <quote>sales-ladies,</quote> of having distinct social superiors, whereas every day of domestic service seems to imply the clear and formal recognition of such a thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1115"/>The more distinct this recognition, the less it is liked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1116"/>To be the <quote>help</quote> in a farmer's family, eating at the family table and coming in at the same door with the rest, reduces this sense of social inferiority to the smallest point, or extinguishes it altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1117"/>Nor is <pb id="p.173" n="173"/> there much of it in the summer hotel, where the life of the hired men and girls is a thing by itself, and no sense of actual inferiority is pressed on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1118"/>Then there are many families where a tone of kindly friendliness prevails, and excludes all oppressive sense of social superiority; and if all families were like this, there would be much less scarcity of <quote>living-out girls,</quote> as they like to call themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1119"/>But just in proportion as distinctions become marked and artificial, the dislike to anything that implies social superiority becomes greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1120"/>It is useless to tell those thus situated that labor is honorable, and household labor especially so; to say that a good servant ranks higher than a good factory land, and so on. The ladies who say this fail to convince others because they do not really convince themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1121"/>That is the real difficulty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1122"/>The trouble is that these benevolent ladies themselves in their secret souls regard that member of a poor family who goes out to service as occupying a lower social plane than her sister who tends in a store or works in a shoe factory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1123"/>It is the same with men. No novelist could ever put such a brand upon the whole class of farmers or mechanics as <persName n="Thackeray,,,,," id="n0192.0034.00173.00336" reg="mostcommon:Thackeray,W.,M.,,:1"><surname>Thackeray</surname></persName> puts upon his footmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1124"/>I remember an occasion, many years ago, when a whole suburban village was thrown into confusion because <rs type="role">Mr.</rs>--'s man-servant was allowed to buy a ticket and dance <pb id="p.174" n="174"/> at a village ball, although the young farmers and mechanics were all expected and even begged to attend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1125"/><quote>What is the difference?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1126"/>I asked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1127"/><quote>Why, of course,</quote> said the ladies on the committee, <quote>you expect to dance in the same set, at a country ball, with your milkman and shoemaker, but as to meeting on the same terms Mr.--'s man-servant, that is a very different thing.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1128"/>I never could see why it was different, but long observation has convinced me that it is so regarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1129"/>Now if the very ladies who give all the good advice still make this distinction, and if they rank household service as socially inferior to the more independent lines of work, how can they expect not to be taken at their word?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1130"/>They may talk never so much about the dignity of household employment, but they do not really believe in it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1131"/>I have lately asked a series of ladies, who are all content with their own social positions, whether they would prefer to have a son or a brother marry a young girl who had been a seamstress or <num value="1">one</num> who had been a domestic servant, and they have always said that they should prefer the seamstress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1132"/>On being pressed for reasons, some said that they did not know, but that this was the way they felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/>Others said that household service seemed <quote>more menial ;</quote> others, that it would be awkward to receive as an equal <num value="1">one</num> who had opened the door for you or <pb id="p.175" n="175"/> swept your room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1134"/>Each of these reasons seemed rather flimsy, but not more so than the general feeling of which it is a part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1135"/>To me it is all unmeaning; the only things really important are character, intelligence, and refinement; and nothing can be less important than the mere question what a person's employment is or has been, so it be honest.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1137"/>But the point now of interest is to know what tie general impression is; and so long as the employers themselves regard household service as being socially lower than working at the needle or at the loom, how can they expect that the persons most concerned will fail to see it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1138"/>If we regard all this as a prejudice, let us go to work to correct it. In the mean time we must remember that those who are in our employ are really taking themselves at our own valuation, and cannot consistently be censured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1139"/>When your best handmaiden leaves your employ and accepts lower pay in a <quote>box factory</quote> or at some <quote>straw-works,</quote> remember that she may be doing it for precisely the same reason that <persName><roleName n="Queen">Queen</roleName> <foreName>Victoria</foreName></persName> got herself declared <quote>Empress of <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName></quote> as well as <rs type="role" reg="Queen">Queen</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> &mdash; in order that she might thenceforth have no social superior. </p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1141"/>In a late treatise on American literature, while the year of birth is carefully given for each male author, the same fact is systematically omitted in the case of women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1142"/>If any class of women might be supposed free from the affectation of more youth than belongs to them, it is the sisterhood of the pen, inasmuch as to them the increase of years usually implies a more assured position and a better income.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1143"/>Yet on inquiring of a friend who makes books of reference professionally, I am assured that literary women do occasionally show this sensitiveness as to their ages; and it is also sometimes the case, he adds, with literary men. In fact, he tells me very frankly that he does not quite enjoy giving the exact figures as to his own age, or seeing them in print.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1144"/>Reticence as to years is not, then, a monopoly of either sex; but it belongs, no doubt, more especially to women, among whom the graces, and especially the earlier graces, of life are not only more lavishly distributed, but bring a more delicious adulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1281"/>The farm in question must of course be <num value="1">one</num> where the air is good, the drainage sufficient, and, above all, the farmer good-natured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1283"/>The farmer's wife also needs to be of a very magnanimous nature, not merely as to large appetites and soiled feet-for these, it is to be presumed, she has always with her --but as to the armfuls of fragrant rubbish that the children bring in with them from the fields and forget to clear away again, or the tree-frogs which are placed under tumblers for a time and then accidentally let loose in the parlor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1284"/>If caterpillars' nests are unacceptable in the apple-trees, they are still less welcome in the sitting-room; and after the <pb id="p.198" n="198"/> farmer has laboriously mowed down a too exuberant crop of white-weed, it is asking a good deal of his wife when she is called upon to supply her best pitcher for a bouquet of it under the name of oxeye daisy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1292"/>Such a peering of eager eyes and protruding of timid beaks, drawn back and thrust forward again a dozen times before actual contact with the children's fingers, while bolder hens meanwhile advance unseen and steal the whole bit of bread from the lap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1326"/>The <num value="1">one</num> question for him to determine is whether the book or article really promises to be profitable, and as to this he must rely on his own judgment, for he has nothing else to rely upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1342"/>A woman's enterprise.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1343"/>I had a call the other day from a lady below middle-age who wished to consult me about some business arrangements that had become necessary for her. Instead of having become entangled in financial difficulties &mdash; which is, I am sorry to say, the condition of most of those of her sex who come to me for such consultations-she was embarrassed by too much success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1344"/>She was, it appeared, a married woman from some interior town in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, who had inherited from her father several pieces of property, a small woollen mill being among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1345"/>The property included another mill of a different kind, and of this her husband took charge; and they were at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> inclined to sell the woollen mill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1346"/>It proved, however, to be an unfavorable time for this; and while the matter was pending, she took the entire charge of the mill and carried it on. Becoming interested in it, she made improvements and tried experiments, the result of which was that she had now made blankets of such a quality that she had been offered contracts which would keep <pb id="p.208" n="208"/> the mill running day and night for a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1347"/>But for this there would be absolutely required certain expenditures in the way of machinery, buildings, etc., and her object was to ask advice as to the best way of raising the necessary money for this purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1348"/>She had been advised to form a joint-stock company, and yet felt a natural dislike to having the enterprise pass into other hands, after carrying it thus far herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1349"/>She ended by showing me a sample of the blankets, which I could only regard with inexperienced amazement, having never seen anything of the kind so thick, soft, and luxurious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1350"/>I could hardly wonder that they were worth, as she claimed, <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">fifty dollars</measure> a pair.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1351"/>Leaving neither money to invest nor practical knowledge of the woollen manufacture, I could only give her letters of introduction to <num value="3">three</num> men of high standing in different branches of that business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1352"/>From <num value="2">two</num> of these I have since heard; and they were apparently even more surprised than I was, because they were better acquainted with the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1353"/><num value="1">One</num> of them writes thus: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1354"/></p> 
<p> <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs>--called on me to-day, and I am very glad you introduced her. She is not only a bright woman but an exceptional manufacturer, and I shall try to help her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1355"/>He thought they must have been made by the <rs>Mission Mills</rs> of <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>, which make the best blankets in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1356"/>It is those blankets she set herself to beat, if possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1357"/>he was genuinely surprised.</p></quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1358"/>My other correspondent sent me word that neither of his mills-He being treasurer of several-had attained to producing such a quality of blankets as these, or to obtaining a price so high as these might fairly command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1359"/>He also said that it had become known in the trade that there was <num value="1">one</num> mill in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> which produced goods of this high grade, all sold by <num value="1">one</num> house, and not generally accessible, and that these were apparently the very ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1360"/>He gave the lady a letter to a capitalist, and was quite confident that she would obtain the funds needed to enlarge her establishment and fulfil her proposed contracts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1361"/>I quote the opinions of these gentlemen because they are experts, and not easily to be misled as to the quality of goods, or to be carried away by sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1362"/>Their verdict may be taken as establishing the fact that a woman has succeeded in taking the lead of all others in the <rs>Eastern States</rs> in a most difficult branch of manufacture, and this by her own energies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1363"/>It is easy to say that a woman thus successful must be a very exceptional woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1364"/>No doubt; just as all great inventors, such as <persName n="Bell,,,,," id="n0192.0041.00209.00401" reg="mostcommon:Bell,Currer,,,:2"><surname>Bell</surname></persName> or <persName n="Edison,,,,," id="n0192.0041.00209.00402" reg="mostcommon:Edison,T.,A.,,:1"><surname>Edison</surname></persName>, <pb id="p.210" n="210"/> are very exceptional men. It is quite probable that she may have inherited from lier father, who preceded her in the mill, some special talent for machinery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1365"/>It is often so with men, since talent is often hereditary and even cumulative, what is mere taste in a father sometimes becoming a distinct gift in the son, and being called genius in the grandson.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1366"/>But talent or even genius alone makes a mere amateur; she had also the courage to plan and the will to carry out, and with such results as we have seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1367"/>She expressly told me that it had cost her a good deal of labor, and that she habitually went to the mill at <time value="6am">6 A. M.</time>, and knew all that was going on there every day. Her husband, as has been said, was occupied with his own share of business, and left hers undisturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1368"/>Her success shows not merely the ability of a woman to plan and execute, but the readiness of practical men to co-operate with such a woman after she has once proved her credentials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1369"/>She said that she had found no trouble in this respect, and that the banks in her region had been as willing to accommodate her as if she were a man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1370"/>Such an example does not prove that it is the duty of all women to undertake business enterprises, any more than it is the duty of all men to paint pictures or open retail shops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1371"/>There must be a proper consideration of special talents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1372"/>In <pb id="p.211" n="211"/> this case, it appears, my visitor had tested herself very carefully as she went along, had taken up the undertaking as a temporary matter only, and had been carried on by the interest with which it inspired her, and by her own evident adaptation to the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1373"/>The use of her example is not in its being followed implicitly or foolishly, but in the help it gives to all women who dare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1374"/>When <persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0192.0041.00211.00403" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName>, in answer to a question from <num value="1">one</num> who wished to set limits to the sphere of women, answered, <quote>Let them be sea-captains, if yon will,</quote> she did not foresee that <persName n="Miller,Captain,Betsey,,," id="n0192.0041.00211.00404" reg="default:Miller,Betsey,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>Betsey</foreName> <surname>Miller</surname></persName>, of the <term type="ship">bark</term> <rs type="ship">Cleotus</rs>, would erelong be doing the very thing which she had selected at random as an extreme instance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1375"/><num value="1">One</num> of the very functions which have been oftenest named as beyond the natural gift of woman has been the superintendence of a large manufacturing establishment, involving as it does <num value="3">three</num> separate faculties &mdash; a knowledge of machinery, a business aptitude, and the capacity to control men. Yet here these <num value="3">three</num> qualities have been combined, and have been tested by success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/>The result should surely encourage every other woman who hesitates before some similar opportunity.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1419"/>Of course many of the droll sayings we quote from children are not droll to those who said them; but there are more which are so, and we can distinguish them by watching for the twinkle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1420"/>The little girl who rebelled against the bathing-tub, and said, indignantly, to her mother, <quote>Don't wash me; wash &apos;at baby,</quote> pointing to the naked child in Knaus's Madonna on the wall, evidently enjoyed the flavor of her own remark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1421"/>She knew that the proposed scapegoat of her punishment was but a flat surface, for she had often examined it with eye and finger, but the humor of the defiance pleased her very soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1422"/>Again, where the mistakes and whims of very young children are not humorous to themselves at the time, they usually become so very soon after.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1423"/>Any child of <num value="5">five</num> will be entertained by your narrative of what it said and did at <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, nor will it miss a single good point in the retrospect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1424"/>In a family of children, all under <num value="12">twelve</num>, each will commonly appreciate the unconscious drolleries of the next younger; Susy quotes what Prudy has said, and Prudy again ,cites with delight the unexpected remarks of <persName n="Dimple,,Dotty,,," id="n0192.0043.00218.00416" reg="default:Dimple,Dotty,,,"><foreName>Dotty</foreName> <surname>Dimple</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1425"/>How does this happen unless children have humor in themselves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1426"/>If there <pb id="p.219" n="219"/> is any faculty not transferable at <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-hand it is this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1427"/>No maternal assurances that a thing is amusing will ever make it such to a child, unless the child has a sense of humor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1428"/>The games of young children, and, above all, their play with dolls, are a scene of genuine humor from the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1429"/>The doll is not merely loved and kissed, but is rebuked, scolded, put on probation, punished; a child will do this alone, or <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> will do it together, and with a zest which certainly comes by nature, not by instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1430"/>You might as well say that there is no instinct in the way a kitten plays with its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> mouse as to deny the instinct of humor to the child when she <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <quote>makes believe</quote> that her doll <persName n="Arabella,,,,," id="n0192.0043.00219.00417" reg="mostcommon:Arabella,nomatch:0"><surname>Arabella</surname></persName> is naughty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1432"/>The doll really appeals to the child's whole nature, not merely to the affectional part of it; land a doll's house with no sense of humor brought to bear on it would be a blighted home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1433"/>It was in the full appreciation of what she said that a little girl remarked to me, many years ago, holding up a doll of her own sex whose legs had wholly vanished, <quote>See!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1437"/>Again, if children have no sense of humor, whence comes their admitted dramatic aptitude?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1438"/>So far as I have seen, this gift is far more universally distributed among children than among their elders, as any <num value="1">one</num> can test by alternately getting up little dramatic performances in the younger and older circles of a large family connection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1439"/>Perhaps the greater unconsciousness of children may have something to do with it, yet it really seems as if, apart from this, the imitative power were more flexible in early youth than later, as is well known to be the case with the organs of language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1440"/>Nothing is more marvellous to me than the manner in which these young creatures will create for themselves, or with the very slightest aid from others, the proper tone or expression belonging to an emotion they never have experienced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1441"/><pb id="p.221" n="221"/> The favorite play of the most petted children is often that of a family with a scolding mother; and how admirably do they in turn enact a character which they have never even seen!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1444"/>The little performers got into a great frolic just before the curtain went up; there was not a moment to tutor them; but in the very instant, as the curtain rose, both faces passed into a look of childish anger that was absolutely startling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1445"/>They were peculiarly amiable children, and had never had anything but happiness with <num value="1">one</num> another; yet they brought instantaneously into their looks, without a hint from any <num value="1">one</num>, an expression which <persName n="Janauschek,,,,," id="n0192.0043.00221.00420" reg="mostcommon:Janauschek,nomatch:0"><surname>Janauschek</surname></persName> or <persName n="Terry,,Ellen,,," id="n0192.0043.00221.00421" reg="default:Terry,Ellen,,,"><foreName>Ellen</foreName> <surname>Terry</surname></persName> might have envied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1455"/>In general, however, the war may be said to have put an end to this feeling, in a political sense, and to have substituted the nation for the individual State as the unit of loyalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>To begin on the lowest plane, there is often the material need of self-support, and of that which is much more than self-support, since it may involve the sustaining of children and even of a husband.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>In a late report of <num value="1">one</num> of our highest institutions for women, the estimate was made by the directors that about half the students apparently came there to prepare for earning a living, and the other half from a simple desire for self-improvement.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1592"/>At a private discussion lately held among persons interested in collegiate and other education it seemed to me that there was too general a deference to <name>German</name> standards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1593"/>It was assumed, in particular, that schools for young children must necessarily be far better if taught by university-bred men, as in <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, than if taught t by young women, as in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1594"/>To all this I should demur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1595"/>No man in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> ever studied the <name>German</name> systems of common-school instruction more faithfully than <persName n="Mann,,Horace,,," id="n0192.0048.00243.00448" reg="default:Mann,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Mann</surname></persName>; and it was chiefly to him that we owe, as a result, the general substitution of women for men as teachers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1596"/>Tie greater economy of employing women has no doubt assisted the change; it would have been simply impossible, in fact, with the greater expensiveness of living in this country, to obtain the services of a sufficient number of men to give to our public-school system anything like the vast spread it has now obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1597"/>Yet <persName n="Mann,,Horace,,," id="n0192.0048.00243.00449" reg="default:Mann,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Mann</surname></persName> urged the change, not on the ground of economy alone, but because he regarded women as the natural <pb id="p.244" n="244"/> teachers of all children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1598"/>His views have prevailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1599"/>When he began his career, just half a century ago, <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of the teachers in his own State were men, whereas we are told in the <num value="50" type="ordinal">Fiftieth</num> Report of the <rs>Massachusetts</rs> <orgName n="Education Board" type="board">Board of Education</orgName>, just issued, that there are now <num value="8610">8610</num> women to <dateStruct value="1060--"><year reg="1060">1060</year></dateStruct> men-more than <num value="8">eight</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1600"/>The objections usually made against these young women lie, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, as to their sex, which is, however, if <persName n="Mann,,Horace,,," id="n0192.0048.00244.00450" reg="default:Mann,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Mann</surname></persName>'s theory be correct, rather an advantage than a disadvantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1601"/>Then it is objected that they only teach temporarily, on their way to something else, while men would teach for life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1602"/>This claim has been refuted over and over again by statistics taken in particular towns, and showing that women teachers are apt to remain actually longer than men who teach in the same grade of school; because men are more often won away by some more lucrative pursuit than are women by matrimony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1603"/>Of course, if you give all the higher positions and all the higher salaries, as is still done, to men, you give to those holding these more advantageous posts greater inducements to remain permanently; but as between teachers of the same grade, which is the only fair comparison, these statistics hold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1604"/>As a rule, women find no vocation more profitable than teaching; while men are more fortunate, and have many better openings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1605"/>Women are therefore kept <pb id="p.245" n="245"/> in the profession unless they quit it for matrimony, while men are easily withdrawn from it. Most of the able public-school teachers whom I have known in years past, of the male sex, are now clergymen or lawyers, while many of the ablest women are still teaching.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1606"/>There remains the assumption that women, as women, are ordinarily less well trained for teaching than men would be-certainly than <name>German</name> men. This disadvantage as to training did undoubtedly exist in times past, and it is still found in small country hamlets, where the teachers are often young women trained only in the schools of the village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1607"/>But the disproportion of educational facilities is diminishing every day. With the <rs type="place">Normal Schools</rs> on the <num value="1">one</num> side, and the colleges admitting women on the other, there is a rapid equalization going on. In many of our <placeName reg="Normal Schools">Normal Schools</placeName> there is now a <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> course; the books, apparatus, and teaching are all of the best: if <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> is the standard, the teachers have often been trained in <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>; and with the women's colleges it is much the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1608"/>The grade is steadily rising as to the higher education of women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1609"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7007517" n="1.000 8170" reg="massachusetts">Massachusetts</placeName> about <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of the public-school teachers are graduates of <placeName reg="Normal Schools">Normal Schools</placeName>, and nearly <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> have attended such schools &mdash; while of the number who are college graduates no statistics are given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1610"/>Should men again replace <pb id="p.246" n="246"/> women in these schools there is no reason to suppose that they would surpass the present teachers in respect to education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1611"/>It is certain that the average male teacher of <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> ago was inferior in this respect to the average woman teacher of to-day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1612"/>Tried, therefore, even by the <name>German</name> standard, there is no reason to suppose that the present arrangements as to teaching force in our schools could be materially bettered, with the materials now at command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1613"/>But I am not afraid to go <num value="1">one</num> step further and raise the question whether the <name>German</name> standard is absolute and final.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1616"/>No <num value="1">one</num> can deny the sure tendency of the <name>German</name> training to produce thorough investigators and admirable analysts; but, after all, our system, with all its faults, produces mental alertness, and theirs does not. <pb id="p.247" n="247"/> Compare an American boy at <num value="18">eighteen</num> with a German or even an English boy of the same age; which is it that has originality, impulse, initiative?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1627"/>Such students are usually brought to the conviction that the difference between the sexes in point of intellect is not a question of comparative quantity or quality, but simply of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1628"/>It is a matter of acceleration and retardation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1631"/>Even to the present time, for some reason, the corresponding figure among musical composers has not appeared, and any speculations on this point may have a certain value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1632"/>Of course some particular sphere must come last in women's successive advances, and it is interesting to inquire why that sphere should be music.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1633"/>But the inquiry should always proceed in connection with such facts as those already stated-facts indicating that it is not at all a case of proved incapacity, but only of admitted delay.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1634"/>The general cause of the delay, in all these cases, is essentially the same: it lies partly in specific disadvantages and partly in general repression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1635"/>Women have never yet been trained on any large scale, as men are trained, in the science of music.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1636"/>They have been and still are trained as amateurs only; and I can distinctly remember when the study of harmony or counterpoint was considered as clearly unwomanly as that of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1637"/>Where, in spite of this, a woman came of a musical stock, and showed positive marks of genius, she was still held to a subordinate and almost suppressed position &mdash; as in the <pb id="p.251" n="251"/> striking case of <persName n="Mendelssohn,,Fanny,,," id="n0192.0049.00251.00470" reg="default:Mendelssohn,Fanny,,,"><foreName>Fanny</foreName> <surname>Mendelssohn</surname></persName>, who was only encouraged by her family to compose so long as her beautiful compositions passed under her brother's name and helped to swell his fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1638"/>When she proposed to publish for herself, she was regarded by her family as unsexing herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1639"/>Is that the way genius is developed among men?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1640"/>Genius in men is watched for, helped, trained, supported, furnished with prizes and incentives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1641"/>The fact that we give it all these aids is proof that genius needs them; withdraw the aids, and it suffers, or if it excels it will be still at a great disadvantage, and fall short of its full success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1642"/>High <name>English</name> scientific authority has said that we never shall know how much science lost by the almost total early neglect of the rare powers of <persName n="Somerville,,Mary,,," id="n0192.0049.00251.00471" reg="default:Somerville,Mary,,,"><foreName>Mary</foreName> <surname>Somerville</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1652"/>It is a comfort to know that, even in <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, if women have not composed great music in their own names, they have at least, so to speak, composed the composers-through their influence on them-and thus fulfilled what Cotton <persName n="Mather,,,,," id="n0192.0049.00252.00483" reg="mostcommon:Mather,Cotton,,,:1"><surname>Mather</surname></persName> thought the high function of the president of a university-to train those who were to train others--<foreign lang="la">non lapides dolare, sed architectos</foreign>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/>From beginning to end the performance has not <num value="1">one</num> redeeming trait.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>All the fun lies in the fact that <pb id="p.255" n="255"/> Punch successively knocks on the head or otherwise slaughters his baby, his wife, the doctor, the policeman, the servant, and such others as the varying ingenuity of the operator may introduce; that he counts the corpses over, hustles then about, and stuffs them into coffins with every form of irreverence; that for these offences he is haunted by ghosts, executed by hangmen, and dragged down by demons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/>It is not strange that there should be city precincts so degraded that this sort of thing should just meet the public taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1719"/>It is a very instructive fact that <num value="2">two</num> of the best mothers I know-and mothers, it must be added, on the largest scale &mdash; have had their preliminary training solely through the charge of dolls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1720"/>I visited lately the nursery of <num value="1">one</num> of these mothers, arranged as the collective play-room of <num value="6">six</num> children under <num value="10">ten</num>--there being also <num value="3">three</num> older offspring who have graduated from this play-room, and are in a manner launched into the world outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1721"/>In this room everything is provided by wholesale-whole freight-trains of toy-wagons, wooden horses enough for all to ride at once, and <num value="400">four hundred</num> blocks for purposes of architecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1722"/>Here the <num value="6">six</num> play perpetually together while they are in-doors; and when peace is interrupted by discord, and there is a momentary tendency among the younger members to pull each other's hair-hair, it must be said, so curly that it seems almost a waste of the blessings of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> not to pull it occasionally-the tranquil mother, wisely remembering that most of the ill-temper of children comes from the stomach, <pb id="p.265" n="265"/> sends the little things down-stairs for a glass of Mellin's Food, and they come back beaming and reconciled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1723"/>Yet this pattern mother, conducting without a nurse this large world of little beings, tells me that she grew up not only without younger brothers and sisters, but without knowledge of young children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1724"/>Up to the time of her marriage, at <num value="22">twenty-two</num>, she has no recollection of ever having taken any care of a child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1725"/>What, then, prepared her for this vast sphere of duty, this rearing of <num value="9">nine</num> young immortals upon no severer pains and penalties than Mellin's Food?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1727"/>Up to the age of <num value="13">thirteen</num> her experience with dolls was on the very largest scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1728"/>She had seldom less than <num value="20">twenty</num>, each with its own wardrobe, ornaments, and possessions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1729"/>Every night of her life the <num value="20">twenty</num> dolls were undressed and put to bed before their mistress went; and all their clothes were neatly folded and put away separately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1730"/>During the day, doubtless, each doll had its own career and position; was fed at table, fitted with new clothes, elevated into grandeur or repressed into humbleness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1731"/>When their young mistress grew up they were doubtless laid aside, or transferred to other children, or banished to that dusty purgatory of the garret from which no doll is ever translated to paradise.

An old horse is often tended, an aged dog is at least shot, but an old doll is left to lie forever on its back in the garret, gazing with <num value="1">one</num> remaining eye on the slowly gathering cobwebs above it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1733"/>On the other hand, there were fewer of them-only <num value="9">nine</num>-and they were, and are, even more interesting, as I can testify, than the dolls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1734"/>Her experience reminded me of that of another mother whose <num value="8">eight</num> children are now practically grown up, and whose early training was much the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1887"/>When we turn from science to literature, the advance is not quite so marked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1888"/>It is considerable and substantial; yet in view of the completeness with which literary work is now thrown open to women, and their equality as to pay, there is room for some surprise that it is not greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1889"/>Women have engaged largely in journalism, and with much success; but it must be remembered that journalism is not literature, though it belongs to the same genus, and may be quite as important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>It must be readily admitted that the contributions of American women to the poetry and fiction of the day are abundant and creditable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/>But it must be remembered that journalism itself is hardly more ephemeral than all poetry or fiction short of the highest; and our rapid American life has already created and forgotten several generations of such short-lived celebrities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1899"/><pb id="p.290" n="290"/></p> 
<p>There are really but <num value="2">two</num> grounds of permanence in literature &mdash; that won by positive genius and that won by labor.

But, even short of this, it is possible for an author who takes a good subject and does his work well to secure a tolerably permanent place, even without great genius.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1901"/>When will our women's colleges turn out a race of graduates who will devote themselves to literature even as faithfully as many men now do, making it an object for life to do thoughtful and serious work?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1903"/>This is the gap that needs to be filled by literary women at present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1904"/>The supply of <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-grade fiction-and by this is meant all fiction inferior in grade to <persName n="Eliot,,George,,," id="n0192.0056.00290.00571" reg="default:Eliot,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Eliot</surname></persName>'s --is now tolerably well secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1905"/>But the demand for general literary work of a solid and thoughtful nature, demanding both scholarship and a trained power of expression &mdash; this is never very well supplied among men, and is, with few exceptions, unsupplied among American women.
