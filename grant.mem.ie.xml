<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>There are but few important events in the affairs of men brought about by their own choice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Although frequently urged by friends to write my memoirs I had determined never to do so, nor to write anything for publication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>At the age of nearly <num value="62">sixty-two</num> I received an injury from a fall, which confined me closely to the house while it did not apparently affect my general health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>This made study a pleasant pastime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Shortly after, the rascality of a business partner [<persName n="Ward,,Ferdinand,,," id="n0019.0000.00000.00001" reg="default:Ward,Ferdinand,,,"><foreName>Ferdinand</foreName> <surname>Ward</surname></persName>] developed itself by the announcement of a failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>This was followed soon after by universal depression of all securities, which seemed to threaten the extinction of a good part of the income still retained, and for which I am indebted to the kindly act of friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>At this juncture the editor of the <hi rend="italics">Century Magazine</hi> asked me to write a few articles for him. I consented for the money it gave me; for at that moment I was living upon borrowed money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The work I found congenial, and I determined to continue it. The event is an important <num value="1">one</num> for me, for good or evil; I hope for the former. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>In preparing these volumes for the public, I have entered upon the task with the sincere desire to avoid doing injustice to any <num value="1">one</num>, whether on the <rs>National</rs> or Confederate side, other than the unavoidable injustice of not making mention often where special mention is due. There must be many errors of omission in this work, because the subject is too large to be treated of in <num value="2">two</num> volumes in such way as to do justice to all the officers and men engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>There were <num value="1000">thousands</num> of instances, during the rebellion, of individual, company, regimental and brigade deeds of heroism which deserve special mention and are not here alluded to. The troops engaged in them will have to look to the detailed reports of their individual commanders for the full history of those deeds. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volume, as well as a portion of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, was written before I had reason to suppose I was in a critical condition of health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Later I was reduced almost to the point of death, and it became impossible for me to attend to anything for weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>I have, however, somewhat regained my strength, and am able, often, to devote as many hours a day as a person should devote to such work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>I would have more hope of satisfying the expectation of the public if I could have allowed myself more time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>I have used my best efforts, with the <pb id="p.viii" n="viii"/> aid of my eldest son, <persName n="Grant,,F.,D.,," id="n0019.0000.00000.00002" reg="expanded:Grant,Frederick,D.,,"><foreName>F.</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, assisted by his brothers, to verify from the records every statement of fact given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The comments are my own, and show how I saw the matters treated of whether others saw them in the same light or not. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>With these remarks I present these volumes to the public, asking no favor but hoping they will meet the approval of the reader. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>While my father carried on the manufacture of leather and worked at the trade himself, he owned and tilled considerable land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>I detested the trade, preferring almost any other labor; but I was fond of agriculture, and of all employment in which horses were used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>We had, among other lands, <measure n="50acres" type="area">fifty acres</measure> of forest within a mile of the village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>We got along very well for a few miles, when we encountered a ferocious dog that frightened the horses and made them run. The new animal kicked at every jump he made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>I got the horses stopped, however, before any damage was done, and without running into anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>After giving them a little rest, to quiet their fears, we started again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Every time I attempted to start, my new horse would commence to kick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>My father had offered <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">twenty dollars</measure> for it, but <persName n="Ralston,,,,," id="n0019.0001.00009.00057" reg="mostcommon:Ralston,nomatch:0"><surname>Ralston</surname></persName> wanted <num value="25">twenty-five</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>I was so anxious to have the colt, that after the owner left, I begged to be allowed to <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> take him at the price demanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>My father yielded, but said <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">twenty dollars</measure> was all the horse was worth, and told me to offer that price; if it was not accepted I was to offer <num value="22.5">twenty-two and a half</num>, and if that would not get him, to give the <num value="25">twenty-five</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>I at once mounted a horse and went for the colt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>When I got to <placeName><persName n="Ralston,Mister,,,," id="n0019.0001.00010.00058" reg="mostcommon:Ralston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ralston</surname></persName>'s house</placeName>, I said to him: <quote>Papa says I may offer you <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">twenty dollars</measure> for the colt, but if you won't take that, I am to offer <num value="22.5">twenty-two and a half</num>, and if you won't take that, to give you <num value="25">twenty-five</num>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>It would not require a Connecticut man to guess the price finally agreed upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>This story is nearly true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>I certainly showed very plainly that I had come for the colt and meant to have him. I could not have been over <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> old at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>This transaction caused me great heart-burning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>The story got out among the boys of the village, and it was a long time before I heard the last of it. Boys enjoy the misery of their companions, at least village boys in that day did, and in later life I have found that all adults are not free from the peculiarity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>I kept the horse until he was <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> old, when he went blind, and I sold him for <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">twenty dollars</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>I have described enough of my early life to give an impression of the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>I did not like to work; but I did as much of it, while young, as grown men can be hired to do in these days, and attended school at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>I had as many privileges as any boy in the village, and probably more than most of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>I have no recollection of ever having been punished at home, either by scolding or by the rod. But at school the case was different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>The rod was freely used there, and I was not exempt from its influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>I can see <persName n="White,,John,D.,," id="n0019.0001.00010.00059" reg="default:White,John,D.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>White</surname></persName> &mdash; the school teacher-now, with his long beech switch always in his hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>It was not always the same <num value="1">one</num>, either.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Switches were brought in bundles, from a beech wood near the school house, by the boys for whose benefit they were intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>Often a whole bundle would be used up in a single day. I never had any hard feelings against my teacher, either while attending the school, or in later years when reflecting upon my experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/><placeName reg="Georgetown, Quitman, Georgia" key="tgn,2022988">Georgetown</placeName> has a remarkable record for a western village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>It is, and has been from its earliest existence, a democratic town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>The rebels helped themselves to whatever they could find, horses, boots and shoes, especially horses, and many ordered meals to be prepared for them by the families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>This was no doubt a far pleasanter duty for some families than it would have been to render a like service for Union soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>The line between the <rs>Rebel</rs> and Union element in <placeName reg="Georgetown, Quitman, Georgia" key="tgn,2022988">Georgetown</placeName> was so marked that it led to divisions even in the churches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>There were churches in that part of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> where treason was preached regularly, and where, to secure membership, hostility to the government, to the war and to the liberation of the slaves, was far more essential than a belief in the authenticity or credibility of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>Western boats at that day did not make <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> regular trips at stated times, but would stop anywhere, and for any length of time, for passengers or freight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>From <placeName reg="Pittsburgh, Allegheny, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013927">Pittsburgh</placeName> I chose passage by the canal to <placeName reg="Harrisburg, Dauphin, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013694">Harrisburg</placeName>, rather than by the more expeditious stage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>This gave a better opportunity of enjoying the fine scenery of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710"><rs type="direction">Western</rs> Pennsylvania</placeName>, and I had rather a dread of reaching my destination at all. At that time the canal was much patronized by travellers, and, with the comfortable packets of the period, no mode of conveyance could be more pleasant, when time was not an object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>From <placeName reg="Harrisburg, Dauphin, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013694">Harrisburg</placeName> to <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> there was a railroad, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> I had ever seen, except the <num value="1">one</num> on which I had just crossed the summit of the <rs type="place">Allegheny Mountains</rs>, and over which canal boats were transported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>In travelling by the road from <placeName reg="Harrisburg, Dauphin, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013694">Harrisburg</placeName>, I thought the perfection of rapid transit had been reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>We travelled at least <measure n="18miles" type="distance">eighteen miles</measure> an hour, when at full speed, and made the whole distance averaging probably as much as <measure n="12miles" type="distance">twelve miles</measure> an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>My sojourn in New York was shorter, but long enough to enable me to see the city very well.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>A military life had no charms for me, and I had not the faintest idea of staying in the army even if I should be graduated, which I did not expect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The encampment which preceded the commencement of academic studies was very wearisome and uninteresting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>When the <dateStruct value="-08-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> came &mdash; the date for breaking up camp and going into barracks &mdash; I felt as though I had been at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> always, and that if I staid [sic] to graduation, I would have to remain always.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>I did not take hold of my studies with avidity, in fact I rarely ever read over a lesson the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time during my entire cadetship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>I could not sit in my room doing nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>There is a fine library connected with the <name>Academy</name> from which cadets can get books to read in their quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>I devoted more time to these, than to books relating to the course of studies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Much of the time, I am sorry to say, was devoted to novels, but not those of a trashy sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>I read all of <persName n="Bulwer,,,,," id="n0019.0002.00014.00086" reg="mostcommon:Bulwer,nomatch:0"><surname>Bulwer</surname></persName>'s then published, <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> <persName n="Cooper,,,,," id="n0019.0002.00015.00087" reg="mostcommon:Cooper,nomatch:0"><surname>Cooper</surname></persName>'s, <persName n="Marryat,,,,," id="n0019.0002.00015.00088" reg="mostcommon:Marryat,nomatch:0"><surname>Marryat</surname></persName>'s, <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n0019.0002.00015.00089" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><surname>Scott</surname></persName>'s, <persName n="Irving,,Washington,,," id="n0019.0002.00015.00090" reg="default:Irving,Washington,,,"><foreName>Washington</foreName> <surname>Irving</surname></persName>'s works, Lever's, and many others that I do not now remember.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>Mathematics was very easy to me, so that when <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> came, I passed the examination, taking a good standing in that branch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>I never succeeded in getting squarely at either end of my class, in any <num value="1">one</num> study, during the <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>I saw in this an honorable way to obtain a discharge, and read the debates with much interest, but with impatience at the delay in taking action, for I was selfish enough to favor the bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>It never passed, and a year later, although the time hung drearily with me, I would have been sorry to have seen it succeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>My idea then was to get through the course, secure a detail for a few years as assistant professor of mathematics at the <name>Academy</name>, and afterwards obtain a permanent position as professor in some respectable college; but circumstances always did shape my course different from my plans. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>At the end of <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> the class received the usual furlough, extending from the close of the <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> examination to the <dateStruct value="-08-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>It did seem to me, in my early army days, that too many of the older officers, when they came to command posts, made it a study to think what orders they could publish to annoy their subordinates and render them uncomfortable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>I noticed, however, a few years later, when the <rs>Mexican</rs> war broke out, that most of this class of officers discovered they were possessed of disabilities which entirely incapacitated them for active field service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>My leave of absence required me to report for duty, at <placeName reg="Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, Missouri" key="tgn,2059231">Jefferson Barracks</placeName>, at the end of <measure n="20days" type="date">twenty days</measure>. I knew my regiment had gone up the <placeName reg="Natchitoches, Natchitoches, Louisiana" key="tgn,7014191">Red River</placeName>, but I was not disposed to break the letter of my leave; besides, if I had proceeded to <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> direct, I could not have reached there until after the expiration of my leave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Accordingly, at the end of the <measure n="20days" type="date">twenty days</measure>, I reported for duty to <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs> [Richard S.] <persName n="Ewell,,,,," id="n0019.0003.00020.00106" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,nomatch:0"><surname>Ewell</surname></persName>, commanding at <placeName reg="Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, Missouri" key="tgn,2059231">Jefferson Barracks</placeName>, handing him at the same time my leave of absence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>After noticing the phraseology of the order-leaves of absence were generally worded, <quote>at the end of which time he will report for duty with his proper command</quote> --he said he would give me an order to join my regiment in <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>I then asked for a few days' leave before starting, which he readily granted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>This was the same <rs>Ewell</rs> who acquired considerable reputation as a Confederate general during the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>He was a man much esteemed, and deservedly so, in the old army, and proved himself a gallant and efficient officer in <num value="2">two</num> wars-both in my estimation unholy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>I immediately procured a horse and started for the country, taking no baggage with me, of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>There is an insignificant creek-the Gravois-between <placeName reg="Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, Missouri" key="tgn,2059231">Jefferson Barracks</placeName> and the place to which I was going, and at that day there was not a bridge over it from its source to its mouth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>There is not water enough in the creek at ordinary stages to run a coffee mill, and at low water there is none running whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>On this occasion it had been raining heavily, and, when the creek was reached, I found the banks full to overflowing, and the current rapid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>I looked at it a moment to consider what to do. <num value="1">One</num> of my superstitions had always been when I started to go any where, or to do anything, not to turn back, or stop until the thing intended was accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>I have frequently started to go to places where I had never been and to which I did not know the way, depending upon making inquiries on the road, and if I got past the place without <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> knowing it, instead of turning back, I would go on until a road was found turning in the right direction, take that, and come in by the other side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>So I struck into the stream, and in an instant the horse was swimming and I being carried down by the current.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>I headed the horse towards the other bank and soon reached it, wet through and without other clothes on that side of the stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>I went on, however, to my destination and borrowed a dry suit from my-future-brother-in-law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>We were not of the same size, but the clothes answered every purpose until I got more of my own. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Before I returned I mustered up courage to make known, in the most awkward manner imaginable, the discovery I had made on learning that the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 4">4th infantry</orgName> had been ordered away from <placeName reg="Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, Missouri" key="tgn,2059231">Jefferson Barracks</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>The young lady afterwards admitted that she too, although until then she had never looked upon me other than as a visitor whose company was agreeable to her, had experienced a depression of spirits she could not account for when the regiment left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Before separating it was definitely understood that at a convenient time we would join our fortunes, and not let the removal of a regiment trouble us. This was in <dateStruct value="1844-05-"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1844">1844</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>It was the <dateStruct value="1848-08-22"><day reg="22">22d</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year>1848</year>,</dateStruct> before the fulfilment of this agreement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>My duties kept me on the frontier of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> with the <orgName n="Army of Observation" type="army">Army of Observation</orgName> during the pendency of Annexation; and afterwards I was absent through the war with <placeName reg="Mexico, Audrain, Missouri" key="tgn,2059719">Mexico</placeName>, provoked by the action of the army, if not by the annexation itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>During that time there was a constant correspondence between <persName n="Dent,Miss,,,," id="n0019.0003.00021.00107" reg="nearbymention:Dent,Frederick,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Dent</surname></persName> and myself, but we only met once in the period of <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> and <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>. In <dateStruct value="1845-05-"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1845">1845</year></dateStruct>, I procured a leave for <measure n="20days" type="date">twenty days</measure>, visited <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, and obtained the consent of the parents for the union, which had not been asked for before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>As already stated, it was never my intention to remain in the army long, but to prepare myself for a professorship in some college.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Accordingly, soon after I was settled at <placeName reg="Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, Missouri" key="tgn,2059231">Jefferson Barracks</placeName>, I wrote a letter to <placeName reg="Professor Church">Professor Church</placeName>-<rs type="role" reg="Professor">Professor</rs> of Mathematics at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> --requesting him to ask my designation as his assistant, when next a detail had to be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>The answer from <placeName reg="Professor Church">Professor Church</placeName> was entirely satisfactory, and no doubt I should have been detailed a year or <num value="2">two</num> later but for the <rs>Mexican</rs> <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> War coming on. Accordingly I laid out for myself a course of studies to be pursued in garrison, with regularity, if not persistency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>I reviewed my <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> course of mathematics during the <measure n="7months" type="date">seven months</measure> at <placeName reg="Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, Missouri" key="tgn,2059231">Jefferson Barracks</placeName>, and read many valuable historical works, besides an occasional novel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>To help my memory I kept a book in which I would write up, from time to time, my recollections of all I had read since last posting it. When the regiment was ordered away, I being absent at the time, my effects were packed up by <persName n="Haslett,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0019.0003.00022.00108" reg="mostcommon:Haslett,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Haslett</surname></persName> [<persName n="Hazlitt,,Robert,,," id="n0019.0003.00022.00109" reg="default:Hazlitt,Robert,,,"><foreName>Robert</foreName> <surname>Hazlitt</surname></persName>], of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 4">4th infantry</orgName>, and taken along.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>I never saw my journal after, nor did I ever keep another, except for a portion of the time while travelling abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>Often since a fear has crossed my mind lest that book might turn up yet, and fall into the hands of some malicious person who would publish it. I know its appearance would cause me as much heart-burning as my youthful horse trade, or the later rebuke for wearing uniform clothes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 3">3d infantry</orgName> had selected camping grounds on the reservation at <placeName key="tgn,2042799" n="1.000 2" reg="fort jesup, sabine, louisiana">Fort Jessup</placeName>, about midway between the <placeName reg="Natchitoches, Natchitoches, Louisiana" key="tgn,7014191">Red River</placeName> and the <rs>Sabine</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>Our orders required us to go into camp in the same neighborhood, and await further instructions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>Those authorized to do so selected a place in the pine woods, between the old town of <placeName reg="Natchitoches, Natchitoches, Louisiana" key="tgn,7014191">Natchitoches</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2042896" n="1.000 18" reg="grand ecore, natchitoches, louisiana">Grand Ecore</placeName>, about <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> from each, and on high ground back from the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The place was given the name of <placeName reg="Camp Salubrity">Camp Salubrity</placeName>, and proved entitled to it. The camp was on a high, sandy, pine ridge, with spring branches in the valley, in front and rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The springs furnished an abundance of cool, pure water, and the ridge was above the flight of mosquitoes, which abound in that region in great multitudes and of great voracity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>In the valley they swarmed in myriads, but never came to the summit of the ridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>The regiment occupied this camp <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> before the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> death occurred, and that was caused by an accident. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>Each officer carried a shot-gun, and every evening, after going into camp, some would go out and soon return with venison and wild turkeys enough for the entire camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>He was prompt, however, to volunteer when the rebellion broke out, and soon rose to the rank of majorgeneral <pb id="p.36" n="36"/> in the <rs>Union</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>I was not fortunate enough to meet him after he resigned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>In the old army he was esteemed very highly as a soldier and gentleman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>Our relations were always most pleasant. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>The preparations at <placeName key="tgn,7013655" n="1.000 33" reg="corpus christi, nueces, texas">Corpus Christi</placeName> for an advance progressed as rapidly in the absence of some <num value="20">twenty</num> or more lieutenants as if we had been there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>The principal business consisted in securing mules, and getting them broken to harness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>The process was slow but amusing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>The animals sold to the government were all young and unbroken, even to the saddle, and were quite as wild as the wild horses of the prairie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>Usually a number would be brought in by a company of Mexicans, partners in the delivery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>The mules were <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> driven into a stockade, called a <hi rend="italics">corral</hi>, inclosing an acre or more of ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>The <rs>Mexicans</rs> &mdash;&mdash; who were all experienced in throwing the lasso &mdash; would go into the <hi rend="italics">corral</hi> on horseback, with their lassos attached to the pommels of their saddles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>Soldiers detailed as teamsters and blacksmiths would also enter the <hi rend="italics">corral</hi>, the former with ropes to serve as halters, the latter with branding irons and a fire to keep the irons heated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>A lasso was then thrown over the neck of a mule, when he would immediately go to the length of his tether, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num> end, then the other in the air. While he was thus plunging and gyrating, another lasso would be thrown by another <placeName key="tgn,7005560" n="1.000 10" reg="Mexico,North and Central America">Mexican</placeName>, catching the animal by a fore-foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>This would bring the mule to the ground, when he was seized and held by the teamsters while the blacksmith put upon him, with hot irons, the initials <quote>U. S.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>Ropes were then put about the neck, with a slip-noose which would tighten around the throat if pulled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>With a man on each side holding these ropes, the mule was released from his other bindings and allowed to rise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>With more or less difficulty he would be conducted to a picket rope outside and fastened there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>The delivery of that mule was then complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>This process was gone through with every mule and wild horse with the <orgName n="Army of Occupation" type="army">army of occupation</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>The method of breaking them was less cruel and much more amusing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>It is a well-known fact that where domestic animals are used for specific purposes from generation to generation, the descendants are easily, as a rule, subdued to the same uses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>At that time in <placeName reg="Mexico" key="tgn,1001893"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Mexico</placeName> the mule, or his ancestors, the horse and the ass, was seldom used except for the saddle or pack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>At all events the <rs>Corpus Christi</rs> mule resisted the new use to which he was being put. The treatment he was subjected to in order to overcome his prejudices was summary and effective. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>The soldiers were principally foreigners who had enlisted in our <pb id="p.37" n="37"/> large cities, and, with the exception of a chance drayman among them, it is not probable that any of the men who reported themselves as competent teamsters had ever driven a mule-team in their lives, or indeed that many had had any previous experience in driving any animal whatever to harness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>Numbers together can accomplish what twice their number acting individually could not perform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/><num value="5">Five</num> mules were allotted to each wagon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>A teamster would select at the picket rope <num value="5">five</num> animals of nearly the same color and general appearance for his team.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>With a full corps of assistants, other teamsters, he would then proceed to get his mules together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>In <num value="2">two</num>'s the men would approach each animal selected, avoiding as far as possible its heels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/><num value="2">Two</num> ropes would be put about the neck of each animal, with a slip-noose, so that he could be choked if too unruly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>They were then led out, harnessed by force and hitched to the wagon in the position they had to keep ever after.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/><num value="2">Two</num> men remained on either side of the leader, with the lassos about its neck, and <num value="1">one</num> man retained the same restraining influence over each of the others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>All being ready, the hold would be slackened and the team started.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> motion was generally <num value="5">five</num> mules in the air at <num value="1">one</num> time, backs bowed, hind feet extended to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>After repeating this movement a few times the leaders would start to run. This would bring the breeching tight against the mules at the wheels, which these last seemed to regard as a most unwarrantable attempt at coercion and would resist by taking a seat, sometimes going so far as to lie down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>In time all were broken in to do their duty submissively if not cheerfully, but there never was a time during the war when it was safe to let a Mexican mule get entirely loose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>Their drivers were all teamsters by the time they got through. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>I recollect <num value="1">one</num> case of a mule that had worked in a team under the saddle, not only for some time at <placeName key="tgn,7013655" n="1.000 33" reg="corpus christi, nueces, texas">Corpus Christi</placeName>, where he was broken, but all the way to the point opposite <placeName reg="Matamoras, Pike, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2090619">Matamoras</placeName>, then to <placeName reg="Camargo, Lancaster, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2086931">Camargo</placeName>, where he got loose from his fastenings during the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>He did not run away at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, but staid in the neighborhood for a day or <num value="2">two</num>, coming up sometimes to the feed trough even; but on the approach of the teamster he always got out of the way. At last, growing tired of the constant effort to catch him, he disappeared altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>Nothing short of a Mexican with his lasso could have caught him. Regulations would not have warranted the expenditure of a dollar in hiring a man with a lasso to catch that mule; but they did allow the expenditure <quote>of the mule,</quote> on a certificate that he had run away without any fault of the quartermaster on whose returns he was <pb id="p.38" n="38"/> borne, and also the purchase of another to take his place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>I am a competent witness, for I was regimental quartermaster at the time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>While at <placeName key="tgn,7013655" n="1.000 33" reg="corpus christi, nueces, texas">Corpus Christi</placeName> all the officers who had a fancy for riding kept horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>The animals cost but little in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance, and when picketed they would get their living without any cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>I had <num value="3">three</num> not long before the army moved, but a sad accident bereft me of them all at <num value="1">one</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>A colored boy who gave them all the attention they got-besides looking after my tent and that of a class-mate and fellow-lieutenant and cooking for us, all for about <measure n="8dollars" type="currency">eight dollars</measure> per month, was riding <num value="1">one</num> to water and leading the other <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>The led horses pulled him from his seat and all <num value="3">three</num> ran away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>They never were heard of afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1274"/>This pass is very susceptible of defence by a smaller against a larger force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1279"/>It is true this road would have brought troops in by <persName n="Guadalupe,,,,," id="n0019.0012.00082.00453" reg="mostcommon:Guadalupe,nomatch:0"><surname>Guadalupe</surname></persName> &mdash; a town, church and detached spur of mountain about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> north of the capital, all <pb id="p.83" n="83"/> bearing the same general name-and at this point <persName n="Texcoco,,Lake,,," id="n0019.0012.00083.00454" reg="default:Texcoco,Lake,,,"><foreName>Lake</foreName> <surname>Texcoco</surname></persName> comes near to the mountain, which was fortified both at the base and on the sides: but troops could have passed north of the mountain and come in only a few miles to the north-west, and so flanked the position, as they actually did on the south. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1282"/>I know just enough about the <rs>Mexican</rs> war to approve heartily of most of the generalship, but to differ with a little of it. It is natural that an important city like <placeName key="tgn,7007118" n="1.000 1" reg="puebla,puebla,mexico,north and central america">Puebla</placeName> should not have been passed with contempt; it may be natural that the direct road to it should have been taken; but it could have been passed, its evacuation insured and possession acquired without danger of encountering the enemy in intricate mountain defiles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1409"/>The regimental bands at that day were kept up partly by pay from the government, and partly by pay from the regimental fund.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1410"/>There was authority of law for enlisting a certain number of men as musicians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1423"/>At a little village (Ozumba) near the base of Popocatapetl, where we purposed to commence the ascent, we procured guides and <num value="2">two</num> pack mules with forage for our horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1424"/>High up on the mountain there was a deserted house of <num value="1">one</num> room, called the <name>Vaqueria</name>, which had been occupied years before by men in charge of cattle ranging on the mountain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1425"/>The pasturage up there was very fine when we saw it, and there were still some cattle, descendants of the former domestic herd, which had now become wild.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1426"/>It was possible to go on horseback as far as the <name>Vaqueria</name>, though the road was somewhat hazardous in places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1427"/>Sometimes it was very narrow with a yawning precipice on <num value="1">one</num> side, hundreds of feet down to a roaring mountain torrent below, and almost perpendicular walls on the other side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1428"/>At <num value="1">one</num> of these places <num value="1">one</num> of our mules loaded with <measure n="2sacks" type="mass">two sacks</measure> of barley, <num value="1">one</num> on each side, the <num value="2">two</num> about as big as he was, struck his load against the mountain-side and was precipitated to the bottom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1429"/>The descent was steep but not perpendicular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1430"/>The mule rolled over and over until the bottom was reached, and we supposed of course the poor animal was dashed to pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1431"/>What was our surprise, not long after we had gone into bivouac, to see the lost mule, cargo and owner coming up the ascent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1432"/>The load had protected the animal from serious injury; and his owner had gone after him and found a way back to the path leading up to the hut where we were to stay. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1433"/>The night at the <name>Vaqueria</name> was <num value="1">one</num> of the most unpleasant I ever knew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1434"/>It was very cold and the rain fell in torrents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1435"/>A little higher <pb id="p.92" n="92"/> up the rain ceased and snow began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1436"/>The wind blew with great velocity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1437"/>The log-cabin we were in had lost the roof entirely on <num value="1">one</num> side, and on the other it was hardly better than a sieve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1438"/>There was little or no sleep that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1439"/>As soon as it was light the next morning, we started to make the ascent to the summit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1440"/>The wind continued to blow with violence and the weather was still cloudy, but there was neither rain nor snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1441"/>The clouds, however, concealed from our view the country below us, except at times a momentary glimpse could be got through a clear space between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1442"/>The wind carried the loose snow around the mountain-sides in such volumes as to make it almost impossible to stand up against it. We labored on and on, until it became evident that the top could not be reached before night, if at all in such a storm, and we concluded to return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1443"/>The descent was easy and rapid, though dangerous, until we got below the snow line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1444"/>At the cabin we mounted our horses, and by night were at Ozumba. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1445"/>The fatigues of the day and the loss of sleep the night before drove us to bed early.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1447"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> escaped it. By morning the eyes of half the party were so swollen that they were entirely closed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1448"/>The others suffered pain equally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1449"/>The feeling was about what might be expected from the prick of a sharp needle at a white heat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1450"/>We remained in quarters until the afternoon bathing our eyes in cold water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1451"/>This relieved us very much, and before night the pain had entirely left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1452"/>The swelling, however, continued, and about half the party still had their eyes entirely closed; but we concluded to make a start back, those who could see a little leading the horses of those who could not see at all. We moved back to the village of <placeName reg="Ameca Ameca">Ameca Ameca</placeName>, some <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure>, and stopped again for the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1453"/>The next morning all were entirely well and free from pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1454"/>The weather was clear and Popocatapetl stood out in all its beauty, the top looking as if not a mile away, and inviting us to return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1455"/>About half the party were anxious to try the ascent again, and concluded to do so. The remainder-I was with the remainder-concluded that we had got all the pleasure there was to be had out of mountain climbing, and that we would visit the great caves of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, some <measure n="90miles" type="distance">ninety miles</measure> from where we then were, on the road to <placeName key="tgn,7007127" n="1.000 1" reg="acapulco de juarez,guerrero,mexico,north and central america">Acapulco</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1458"/>I made no notes of this excursion, and have read nothing about it since, but it seems to me that I can see the whole of it as vividly as if it were but yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1462"/>The slope down is gradual as the traveller moves south, but <num value="1">one</num> would not judge that, in going to <placeName reg="Cuantla">Cuantla</placeName>, descent enough had been made to occasion a material change in the climate and productions of the soil; but such is the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1463"/>In the morning we left a temperate climate where the cereals and fruits are those common to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; we halted in the evening in a tropical climate where the orange and banana, the coffee and the sugar-cane were flourishing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1465"/>Soon after the capture of the <rs type="place">City of Mexico</rs> an armistice had been agreed to, designating the limits beyond which troops of the respective armies were not to go during its continuance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1466"/>Our party knew nothing about these limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1467"/>As we approached <placeName reg="Cuantla">Cuantla</placeName> bugles sounded the assembly, and soldiers rushed from the guard-house in the edge of the town towards us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1471"/>However, as we had no special authority from our own commanding general, and as we knew nothing about the terms of the truce, we were permitted to occupy a vacant house outside the guard for the night, with the promise of a guide to put us on the road to <placeName key="tgn,7007109" n="1.000 1" reg="cuernavaca,morelos,mexico,north and central america">Cuernavaca</placeName> the next morning. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1473"/>The country through which we passed, between these <num value="2">two</num> towns, is tropical in climate and productions and rich in scenery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1474"/>At <num value="1">one</num> point, about half-way between the <num value="2">two</num> places, the road goes over a low pass in the mountains in which there is a very quaint old town, the inhabitants of which at <pb id="p.94" n="94"/> that day were nearly all full-blooded <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0019.0013.00094.00509" reg="mostcommon:Indians,Modoc,,,:1"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1475"/>Very few of them even spoke Spanish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1476"/>The houses were built of stone and generally only <num value="1">one</num> story high.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1480"/>On a hill overlooking this town stands the tomb of an ancient king; and it was understood that the inhabitants venerated this tomb very highly, as well as the memory of the ruler who was supposed to be buried in it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1483"/>We had proceeded but a few miles when we were stopped, as before, by a guard and notified that the terms of the existing armistice did not permit us to go further in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1484"/>Upon convincing the guard that we were a mere party of pleasure seekers desirous of visiting the great natural curiosities of the country which we expected soon to leave, we were conducted to a large hacienda near by, and directed to remain there until the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs> of that department could be communicated with and his decision obtained as to whether we should be permitted to pursue our journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1485"/>The guard promised to send a messenger at once, and expected a reply by night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1486"/>At night there was no response from the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs>, but the captain of the guard was sure he would have a reply by morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1487"/>Again in the morning there was no reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1488"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> evening the same thing happened, and finally we learned that the guard had sent no message or messenger to the department commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1489"/>We determined therefore to go on unless stopped by a force sufficient to compel obedience. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1490"/>After a few hours' travel we came to a town where a scene similar to the <num value="1">one</num> at <placeName reg="Cuantla">Cuantla</placeName> occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1491"/>The commanding officer sent a guide to conduct our party around the village and to put us upon our road again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1492"/>This was the last interruption: that night we rested at a large coffee plantation, some <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles</measure> from the cave we were on the way to visit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1493"/>It must have been a <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>; the peons had been paid off, and spent part of the night in gambling away their scanty week's earnings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1494"/>Their coin was principally copper, and I do not believe there was a man among them who had received as much as <measure n="25cents" type="currency">twenty-five cents</measure> in money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1495"/>They were as much excited, however, <pb id="p.95" n="95"/> as if they had been staking <num value="1000">thousands</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1498"/>The next morning we were at the mouth of the cave at an early hour, provided with guides, candles and rockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1499"/>We explored to a distance of about <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> from the entrance, and found a succession of chambers of great dimensions and of great beauty when lit up with our rockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1500"/>Stalactites and stalagmites of all sizes were discovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1501"/>Some of the former were many feet in diameter and extended from ceiling to floor; some of the latter were but a few feet high from the floor; but the formation is going on constantly, and many centuries hence these stalagmites will extend to the ceiling and become complete columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1502"/>The stalagmites were all a little concave, and the cavities were filled with water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1503"/>The water percolates through the roof, a drop at a time-often the drops several minutes apart &mdash; and more or less charged with mineral matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1504"/>Evaporation goes on slowly, leaving the mineral behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1505"/>This in time makes the immense columns, many of them <num value="1000">thousands</num> of tons in weight, which serve to support the roofs over the vast chambers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1506"/>I recollect that at <num value="1">one</num> point in the cave <num value="1">one</num> of these columns is of such huge proportions that there is only a narrow passage left on either side of it. Some of our party became satisfied with their explorations before we had reached the point to which the guides were accustomed to take explorers, and started back without guides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1507"/>Coming to the large column spoken of, they followed it entirely around, and commenced retracing their steps into the bowels of the mountain, without being aware of the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1508"/>When the rest of us had completed our explorations, we started out with our guides, but had not gone far before we saw the torches of an approaching party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1509"/>We could not conceive who these could be, for all of us had come in together, and there were none but ourselves at the entrance when we started in. Very soon we found it was our friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1510"/>It took them some time to conceive how they had got where they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1511"/>They were sure they had kept straight on for the mouth of the cave, and had gone about far enough to have reached it. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1909"/>Up to this time the enemies of the government in <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName> had been bold and defiant, while Union men were quiet but determined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1911"/>The Union men had a place of meeting somewhere in the city, I did not know where, and I doubt whether they dared to enrage the enemies of the government by placing the national flag outside their Headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1912"/>As soon as the news of the capture of <placeName reg="Camp Jackson">Camp Jackson</placeName> reached the city the condition of affairs was changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1913"/>Union men became rampant, aggressive, and, if you will, intolerant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1918"/>I witnessed the scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1923"/>There were squads of other people at intervals down the street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1925"/>Before the car I was in had started, a dapper little fellow-he would be called a dude at this day-stepped in.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1931"/>The young man subsided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2209"/>On the <dateStruct value="--5"><day reg="2">5th</day></dateStruct> word came from the same source that the rebels were about to detach a large force from <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName> to be moved by boats down the <rs>Mississippi</rs> and up the <placeName reg="Fayetteville, Washington, Arkansas" key="tgn,7014258">White River, in Arkansas</placeName>, in order to reinforce <persName n="Price,,,,," id="n0019.0020.00138.00674" reg="nearbymention:Price,Sterling,,,"><surname>Price</surname></persName>, and I was directed to prevent this movement if possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2212"/>My force consisted of a little over <num value="3000">3,000</num> men and embraced <num value="5">five</num> regiments of infantry, <num value="2">two</num> guns [<num value="6">six</num>] and <num value="2">two</num> companies of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2213"/>We dropped down the river on the <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num> to within about <placeName><distance reg="6miles">six miles</distance> of <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName></placeName>, debarked a few men on the <rs>Kentucky</rs> side and established pickets to connect with the troops from <placeName key="tgn,2040656" n="1.000 206" reg="paducah, mccracken, kentucky">Paducah</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2214"/>I had no orders which contemplated an attack by the <rs>National</rs> troops, nor did I intend anything of the kind when I started out from <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName>; but after we started I saw that the officers and men were elated at the prospect of at last having the opportunity of doing what they had volunteered to do-fight the enemies of their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2215"/>I did not see how I could maintain discipline, or retain the confidence of my command, if we should return to <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName> without an effort to do something.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2216"/><placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>, besides being strongly fortified, contained a garrison much more numerous than the force I had with me. It would not do, therefore, to attack that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2217"/>About <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> on the morning of the <dateStruct value="--7"><day reg="7">7th</day></dateStruct>, I learned that the enemy was crossing troops from <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName> to the west bank to be dispatched, presumably, after <persName n="Oglesby,,,,," id="n0019.0020.00139.00678" reg="nearbymention:Oglesby,Richard,J.,,"><surname>Oglesby</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2218"/>I knew there was a small camp of Confederates at <placeName reg="Belmont, Bullitt, Kentucky" key="tgn,2037699">Belmont</placeName>, immediately opposite <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>, and I speedily resolved to push down the river, land on the <rs>Mississippi</rs> side, capture <placeName reg="Belmont, Bullitt, Kentucky" key="tgn,2037699">Belmont</placeName>, break up the camp and return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2219"/>Accordingly, the pickets above <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName> were drawn in at once, and about daylight the boats moved out from shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2220"/>In an hour we were debarking on the west bank of the <placeName key="tgn,7022231" n="1.000 43" reg="mississippi river">Mississippi</placeName>, just out of range of the batteries at <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2221"/>The ground on the west shore of the river, opposite <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>, is low and in places marshy and cut up with sloughs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2222"/>The soil is rich and the timber large and heavy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2223"/>There were some small clearings between <placeName reg="Belmont, Bullitt, Kentucky" key="tgn,2037699">Belmont</placeName> and the point where we landed, but most of the country was covered with the native forests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2224"/>We landed in front of a cornfield.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2225"/>When the debarkation commenced, I took a regiment [<num value="5">five</num> companies] down the river to post it as a guard against surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2226"/>At that time I had no staff officer who could be trusted with that duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2227"/>In the woods, at a short distance below the clearing, I found a depression, dry at the time, but which at high water became a slough or bayou.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2228"/>I placed the men in the hollow, gave them their instructions <pb id="p.140" n="140"/> and ordered them to remain there until they were properly relieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2229"/>These troops, with the gunboats, were to protect our transports. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2230"/>Up to this time the enemy had evidently failed to divine our intentions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2231"/>From <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName> they could, of course, see our gunboats and transports loaded with troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2232"/>But the force from <placeName key="tgn,2040656" n="1.000 206" reg="paducah, mccracken, kentucky">Paducah</placeName> was threatening them from the land side, and it was hardly to be expected that if <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName> was our object we would separate our troops by a wide river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2233"/>They doubtless thought we meant to draw a large force from the east bank, then embark ourselves, land on the east bank and make a sudden assault on <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName> before their divided command could be united. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2234"/>About <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time> we started from the point of debarkation, marching by the flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2235"/>After moving in this way for a mile or a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num>, I halted where there was marshy ground covered with a heavy growth of timber in our front, and deployed a large part of my force as skirmishers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2236"/>By this time the enemy discovered that we were moving upon <placeName reg="Belmont, Bullitt, Kentucky" key="tgn,2037699">Belmont</placeName> and sent out troops to meet us. Soon after we had started in line, his skirmishers were encountered and fighting commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2237"/>This continued, growing fiercer and fiercer, for about <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure>, the enemy being forced back gradually until he was driven into his camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2238"/>Early in this engagement my horse was shot under me, but I got another from <num value="1">one</num> of my staff and kept well up with the advance until the river was reached. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2239"/>The officers and men engaged at <placeName reg="Belmont, Bullitt, Kentucky" key="tgn,2037699">Belmont</placeName> were then under fire for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2240"/>Veterans could not have behaved better than they did up to the moment of reaching the rebel camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2241"/>At this point they became demoralized from their victory and failed to reap its full reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2242"/>The enemy had been followed so closely that when he reached the clear ground on which his camp was pitched he beat a hasty retreat over the river bank, which protected him from our shots and from view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2243"/>This precipitate retreat at the last moment enabled the <rs>National</rs> forces to pick their way without hinderance through the abatis &mdash; the only artificial defence the enemy had. The moment the camp was reached our men laid down their arms and commenced rummaging the tents to pick up trophies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2244"/>Some of the higher officers were little better than the privates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2245"/>They galloped about from <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.141" n="141"/> cluster of men to another and at every halt delivered a short eulogy upon the <rs>Union</rs> cause and the achievements of the command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2246"/>All this time the troops we had been engaged with for <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure>, lay crouched under cover of the river bank, ready to come up and surrender if summoned to do so; but finding that they were not pursued, they worked their way up the river and came up on the bank between us and our transports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2247"/>I saw at the same time <num value="2">two</num> steamers coming from the <rs>Columbus</rs> side towards the west shore, above us, black-or gray &mdash; with soldiers from boiler-deck to roof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2248"/>Some of my men were engaged in firing from captured guns at empty steamers down the river, out of range, cheering at every shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2249"/>I tried to get them to turn their guns upon the loaded steamers above and not so far away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2250"/>My efforts were in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2251"/>At last I directed my staff officers to set fire to the camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2252"/>This drew the fire of the enemy's guns located on the heights of <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2253"/>They had abstained from firing before, probably because they were afraid of hitting their own men; or they may have supposed, until the camp was on fire, that it was still in the possession of their friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2254"/>About this time, too, the men we had driven over the bank were seen in line up the river between us and our transports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2255"/>The alarm <quote>surrounded</quote> was given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2256"/>The guns of the enemy and the report of being surrounded, brought officers and men completely under control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2257"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> some of the officers seemed to think that to be surrounded was to be placed in a hopeless position, where there was nothing to do but surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2258"/>But when I announced that we had cut our way in and could cut our way out just as well, it seemed a new revelation to officers and soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2259"/>They formed line rapidly and we started back to our boats, with the men deployed as skirmishers as they had been on entering camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2260"/>The enemy was soon encountered, but his resistance this time was feeble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2261"/>Again the <rs>Confederates</rs> sought shelter under the river banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2262"/>We could not stop, however, to pick them up, because the troops we had seen crossing the river had debarked by this time and were nearer our transports than we were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2263"/>It would be prudent to get them behind us; but we were not again molested on our way to the boats. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2264"/>From the beginning of the fighting our wounded had been carried to the houses at the rear, near the place of debarkation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2265"/>I now set the troops to bringing their wounded to the boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2266"/>After this had gone on for some little time I rode down the road, without even a staff officer, to visit the guard I had stationed over the approach to our transports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2267"/>I knew the enemy had crossed over from <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName> in considerable <pb id="p.142" n="142"/> numbers and might be expected to attack us as we were embarking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2268"/>This guard would be encountered <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and, as they were in a natural intrenchment, would be able to hold the enemy for a considerable time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2269"/>My surprise was great to find there was not a single man in the trench.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2270"/>Riding back to the boat I found the officer who had commanded the guard and learned that he had withdrawn his force when the main body fell back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2271"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> I ordered the guard to return, but finding that it would take some time to get the men together and march them back to their position, I countermanded the order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2272"/>Then fearing that the enemy we had seen crossing the river below might be coming upon us unawares, I rode out in the field to our front, still entirely alone, to observe whether the enemy was passing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2273"/>The field was grown up with corn so tall and thick as to cut off the view of even a person on horseback, except directly along the rows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2274"/>Even in that direction, owing to the overhanging blades of corn, the view was not extensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2275"/>I had not gone more than a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> when I saw a body of troops marching past me not <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2276"/>I looked at them for a moment and then turned my horse towards the river and started back, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in a walk, and when I thought myself concealed from the view of the enemy, as fast as my horse could carry me. When at the river bank I still had to ride a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> to the point where the nearest transport lay. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2277"/>The cornfield in front of our transports terminated at the edge of a dense forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2278"/>Before I got back the enemy had entered this forest and had opened a brisk fire upon the boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2279"/>Our men, with the exception of details that had gone to the front after the wounded, were now either aboard the transports or very near them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2280"/>Those who were not aboard soon got there, and the boats pushed off. I was the only man of the <rs>National</rs> army between the rebels and our transports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2281"/>The captain of a boat that had just pushed out but had not started, recognized me and ordered the engineer not to start the engine; he then had a plank run out for me. My horse seemed to take in the situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2282"/>There was no path down the bank and every <num value="1">one</num> acquainted with the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi River</placeName> knows that its banks, in a natural state, do not vary at any great angle from the perpendicular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2283"/>My horse put his fore feet over the bank without hesitation or urging, and with his hind feet well under him, slid down the bank and trotted aboard the boat, <num value="12">twelve</num> or <measure n="15feet" type="distance">fifteen feet</measure> away, over a single gang plank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2284"/>I dismounted and went at once to the upper deck. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2285"/>The <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi River</placeName> was low on the <dateStruct value="1861-11-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> so that the banks were higher than the heads of men standing on the <pb id="p.143" n="143"/> upper decks of the steamers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2286"/>The rebels were some distance back from the river, so that their fire was high and did us but little harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2287"/>Our smoke-stack was riddled with bullets, but there were only <num value="3">three</num> men wounded on the boats, <num value="2">two</num> of whom were soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2288"/>When I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> went on deck I entered the captain's room adjoining the pilot-house, and threw myself on a sofa.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2289"/>I did not keep that position a moment, but rose to go out on the deck to observe what was going on. I had scarcely left when a musket ball entered the room, struck the head of the sofa, passed through it and lodged in the foot. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2290"/>When the enemy opened fire on the transports our gunboats returned it with vigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2291"/>They were well out in the stream and some distance down, so that they had to give but very little elevation to their guns to clear the banks of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2292"/>Their position very nearly enfiladed the line of the enemy while he was marching through the cornfield.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2293"/>The execution was very great, as we could see at the time and as I afterwards learned more positively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2294"/>We were very soon out of range and went peacefully on our way to <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName>, every man feeling that <placeName reg="Belmont, Bullitt, Kentucky" key="tgn,2037699">Belmont</placeName> was a great victory and that he had contributed his share to it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2295"/>Our loss at <placeName reg="Belmont, Bullitt, Kentucky" key="tgn,2037699">Belmont</placeName> was <num value="485">485</num> in killed, wounded and missing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2296"/>About <num value="125">125</num> of our wounded fell into the hands of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2297"/>We returned with <measure n="175" type="prisoners">175 prisoners</measure> and <num value="2">two</num> guns, and spiked <num value="4">four</num> other pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2298"/>The loss of the enemy, as officially reported, was <num value="642">642</num> men, killed, wounded and missing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2299"/>We had engaged about <num value="2500">2,500</num> men, exclusive of the guard left with the transports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2300"/>The enemy had about <num value="7000">7,000</num>; but this includes the troops brought over from <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName> who were not engaged in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> defence of <placeName reg="Belmont, Bullitt, Kentucky" key="tgn,2037699">Belmont</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2301"/>The <num value="2">two</num> objects for which the <rs n="Battle of Belmont" type="battle">battle of Belmont</rs> was fought were fully accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2302"/>The enemy gave up all idea of detaching troops from <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2303"/>His losses were very heavy for that period of the war. <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName> was beset by people looking for their wounded or dead kin, to take them home for medical treatment or burial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2304"/>I learned later, when I had moved further south, that <placeName reg="Belmont, Bullitt, Kentucky" key="tgn,2037699">Belmont</placeName> had caused more mourning than almost any other battle up to that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2305"/>The National troops acquired a confidence in themselves at <placeName reg="Belmont, Bullitt, Kentucky" key="tgn,2037699">Belmont</placeName> that did not desert them through the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2306"/>The day after the battle I met some officers from General <pb id="p.144" n="144"/> [Leonidas] <orgName n="command"><persName n="Polk,,,,," id="n0019.0020.00144.00679" reg="mostcommon:Polk,nomatch:0"><surname>Polk</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>, arranged for permission to bury our dead at <placeName reg="Belmont, Bullitt, Kentucky" key="tgn,2037699">Belmont</placeName> and also commenced negotiations for the exchange of prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2307"/>When our men went to bury their dead, before they were allowed to land they were conducted below the point where the enemy had engaged our transports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2308"/>Some of the officers expressed a desire to see the field; but the request was refused with the statement that we had no dead there. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2309"/>While on the truce-boat I mentioned to an officer, whom I had known both at <placeName reg="West Point, Hardin, Kentucky" key="tgn,2041899">West Point</placeName> and in the <rs>Mexican</rs> war, that I was in the cornfield near their troops when they passed; that I had been on horseback and had worn a soldier's overcoat at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2479"/>The plan was for the troops to hold the enemy within his lines, while the gunboats should attack the <orgName n="Water Battery" type="battery">water batteries</orgName> at close quarters and silence his guns if possible.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2490"/>The enemy had evidently been much demoralized by the assault, <pb id="p.155" n="155"/> but they were jubilant when they saw the disabled vessels dropping down the river entirely out of the control of the men on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2491"/>Of course I only witnessed the falling back of our gunboats and felt sad enough at the time over the repulse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2492"/>Subsequent reports, now published, show that the enemy telegraphed a great victory to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2494"/>The weather had turned intensely cold; the men were without tents and could not keep up fires where most of them had to stay, and, as previously stated, many had thrown away their overcoats and blankets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2495"/><num value="2">Two</num> of the strongest of our gunboats had been disabled, presumably beyond the possibility of rendering any present assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2496"/>I retired this night not knowing but that I would have to intrench my position, and bring up tents for the men or build huts under the cover of the hills. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2498"/>I directed my adjutant-general to notify each of the division commanders of my absence and instruct them to do nothing to bring on an engagement until they received further orders, but to hold their positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2499"/>From the heavy rains that had fallen for days and weeks preceding and from the constant use of the roads between the troops and the landing <num value="4">four</num> to <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure> below, these roads had become cut up so as to be hardly passable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2500"/>The intense cold of the night of the <num value="14" type="ordinal">14th</num>-<num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num> had frozen the ground solid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2501"/>This made travel on horseback even slower than through the mud; but I went as fast as the roads would allow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2502"/>When I reached the fleet I found the flag-ship was anchored out in the stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2503"/>A small boat, however, awaited my arrival and I was soon on board with the <rs type="role" reg="flag-Officer">flag-officer</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2504"/>He explained to me in short the condition in which he was left by the engagement of the evening before, and suggested that I should intrench while he returned to <placeName reg="Mound City, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,7014112">Mound City</placeName> with his disabled boats, expressing at the time the belief that he could have the necessary repairs made and be back in <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure>. I saw the absolute necessity of his gunboats going into hospital and did not know but I should be forced to the alternative of going through a siege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2505"/>But the enemy relieved me from this necessity. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2507"/>The conditions for battle were much more favorable to us than they had been for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> of the investment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2508"/>From the <num value="12" type="ordinal">12th</num> to the <num value="14" type="ordinal">14th</num> we had but <num value="15000">15,000</num> men of all arms and no gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2509"/>Now we had been reinforced by a fleet of <num value="6">six</num> naval vessels, a large division of troops under <persName n="Wallace,General,L.,,," id="n0019.0022.00156.00759" reg="expanded:Wallace,Lew:2:Lewis:14,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Wallace</surname></persName> and <num value="2500">2,500</num> men brought over from <placeName key="tgn,6002055" n="1.000 83" reg="fort henry, stewart, tennessee">Fort Henry</placeName> belonging to the <orgName>division of <persName n="Smith,,C.,F.,," id="n0019.0022.00156.00760" reg="default:Smith,C.,F.,,"><foreName>C.</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2510"/>The enemy, however, had taken the initiative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2513"/>The roads, as I have said, were unfit for making fast time, but I got to my command as soon as possible.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2519"/>I saw everything favorable for us along the line of our left and centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2520"/>When I came to the right appearances were different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2521"/>The enemy had come out in full force to cut his way out and make his escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2523"/>His men had stood up gallantly until the ammunition in their cartridge-boxes gave out. There was abundance of ammunition near by lying on the ground in boxes, but at that stage of the war it was not all of our commanders of regiments, brigades, or even divisions, who had been educated up to the point of seeing that their men were constantly supplied with ammunition during an engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2524"/>When the men found themselves without ammunition they could not stand up against troops who seemed to have plenty of it. The division broke and a portion fled, but most of the men, as they were not pursued, only fell back out of range of the fire of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2525"/>It must have been about this time that <persName n="Thayer,,,,," id="n0019.0022.00156.00770" reg="mostcommon:Thayer,nomatch:0"><surname>Thayer</surname></persName> pushed his brigade in between the enemy and those of our troops that were without ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2526"/>At all events the enemy fell back within his intrenchments and was there when I got on the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2527"/>I saw the men standing in knots talking in the most excited manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2528"/>No officer seemed to be giving any directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2530"/><pb id="p.157" n="157"/> I heard some of the men say that the enemy had come out with knapsacks, and haversacks filled with rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2531"/>They seemed to think this indicated a determination on his part to stay out and fight just as long as the provisions held out. I turned to <persName n="Webster,Colonel,J.,D.,," id="n0019.0022.00157.00771" reg="default:Webster,J.,D.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName>, of my staff, who was with me, and said: <quote>Some of our men are pretty badly demoralized, but the enemy must be more so, for he has attempted to force his way out, but has fallen back: the <num value="1">one</num> who attacks <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> now will be victorious and the enemy will have to be in a hurry if he gets ahead of me.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2532"/>I determined to make the assault at once on our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2533"/>It was clear to my mind that the enemy had started to march out with his entire force, except a few pickets, and if our attack could be made on the left before the enemy could redistribute his forces along the line, we would find but little opposition except from the intervening abatis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2534"/>I directed <persName n="Webster,Colonel,,,," id="n0019.0022.00157.00772" reg="nearbymention:Webster,J.,D.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName> to ride with me and call out to the men as we passed: <quote>Fill your cartridge-boxes, quick, and get into line; the enemy is trying to escape and he must not be permitted to do so.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2535"/>This acted like a charm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2536"/>The men only wanted some <num value="1">one</num> to give them a command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2538"/>The general was off in an incredibly short time, going in advance himself to keep his men from firing while they were working their way through the abatis intervening between them and the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2943"/>Besides this, the troops with me, officers and men, needed discipline and drill more than they did experience with the pick, shovel and axe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4424"/>On the <dateStruct value="--19"><day reg="2">19th</day></dateStruct> there was constant skirmishing with the enemy while we were getting into better position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4425"/>The enemy had been much demoralized by his defeats at <placeName reg="Champion's Hill">Champion's Hill</placeName> and the Big Black, and I believed he would not make much effort to hold <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4426"/>Accordingly, at <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> I ordered an assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4427"/>It resulted in securing more advanced positions for all our troops where they were fully covered from the fire of the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4428"/>The <num value="20" type="ordinal">20th</num> and <num value="21" type="ordinal">21st</num> were spent in strengthening our position and in making roads in rear of the army, from <placeName reg="Yazoo River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2784619">Yazoo River</placeName> or <placeName reg="Chickasaw Bayou, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,2236232">Chickasaw Bayou</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4441"/>The immediate capture of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> would save sending me the reinforcements which were so much wanted elsewhere, and would set free the army under me to drive <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0019.0036.00277.01936" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> from the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4450"/>This last attack only served to increase our casualties without giving any benefit whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4451"/>As soon as it was dark our troops that had reached the enemy's line and been obliged to remain there for security all day, were withdrawn; and thus ended the last assault upon <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4482"/>The ground about <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> is admirable for defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4483"/>On the north it is about <placeName><distance reg="200feet">two hundred feet</distance> above the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi River</placeName></placeName> at the highest point and very much cut up by the washing rains; the ravines were grown up with cane and underbrush, while the sides and tops were covered with a dense forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4484"/>Farther south the ground flattens out somewhat, and was in cultivation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4485"/>But here, too, it was cut up by ravines and small streams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4486"/>The enemy's line of defence followed the crest of a ridge from the river north of the city eastward, then southerly around to the <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName> road, full <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> back of the city; thence in a southwesterly direction to the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4487"/>Deep ravines of the description given lay in front of these defences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4488"/>As there is a succession of gullies, cut out by rains along the side of the ridge, the line was necessarily very irregular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4489"/>To follow each of these spurs with intrenchments, so as to command the slopes on either side, would have lengthened their line very much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4490"/>Generally therefore, or in many places, their line would run from near the head of <num value="1">one</num> gully nearly straight to the head of another, and an outer work triangular in shape, generally open in the rear, was thrown up on the point; with a few men in this outer work they commanded the approaches to the main line completely. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4491"/>The work to be done, to make our position as strong against the enemy as his was against us, was very great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4492"/>The problem was also complicated by our wanting our line as near that of the enemy as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4493"/>We had but <num value="4">four</num> <rs type="role" reg="Engineer-Officer">engineer officers</rs> with us. <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> [Frederick] Prime, of the <orgName type="mil" key="EngCorps">Engineer Corps</orgName>, was the chief, and the work at the beginning was mainly directed by him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4494"/>To provide assistants on such a long line I directed that all officers who had graduated at <placeName reg="West Point, Clay, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057765">West Point</placeName>, where they had necessarily to study military engineering, should in addition to their other duties assist in the work. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4498"/>We had no siege guns except <num value="6">six</num> <num value="32">thirty-two</num> pounders, and there were none at the <rs>West</rs> to draw from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4500"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing to do was to get the artillery in batteries where they would occupy commanding positions; then establish the camps, under cover from the fire of the enemy but as near up as possible; and then construct rifle-pits and covered ways, to connect the entire command by the shortest route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4501"/>The enemy did not harass us much while we were constructing our batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4502"/>Probably their artillery ammunition was short; and their infantry was kept down by our sharpshooters, who were always on the alert and ready to fire at a head whenever it showed itself above the rebel works. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4503"/>In no place were our lines more than <measure n="600yards" type="distance">six hundred yards</measure> from the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4504"/>It was necessary, therefore, to cover our men by something more than the ordinary parapet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4505"/>To give additional protection sand bags, bullet-proof, were placed along the tops of the parapets far enough apart to make loop-holes for musketry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4506"/>On top of these, logs were put. By these means the men were enabled to walk about erect when off duty, without fear of annoyance from sharpshooters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4507"/>The enemy used in their defence explosive musket-balls, no doubt thinking that, bursting over our men in the trenches, they would so some execution; but I do not remember a single case where a man was injured by a piece of <num value="1">one</num> of these shells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4508"/>When they were hit and the ball exploded, the wound was terrible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4509"/>In these cases a solid ball would have hit as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4510"/>Their use is barbarous, because they produce increased suffering without any corresponding advantage to those using them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4511"/>The enemy could not resort to our method to protect their men, because we had an inexhaustible supply of ammunition to draw upon and used it freely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4512"/>Splinters from the timber would have made havoc among the men behind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4513"/>There were no mortars with the besiegers, except what the navy had in front of the city; but wooden ones were made by taking logs of the toughest wood that could be found, boring them out for <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="12l." type="pounds"><num value="12">twelve</num> pound</measure> shells and binding them with strong iron bands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4514"/>These <pb id="p.282" n="282"/> answered as coehorns, and shells were successfully thrown from them into the trenches of the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4515"/>The labor of building the batteries and intrenching was largely done by the pioneers, assisted by Negroes who came within our lines and who were paid for their work; but details from the troops had often to be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4516"/>The work was pushed forward as rapidly as possible, and when an advanced position was secured and covered from the fire of the enemy the batteries were advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4517"/>By the <dateStruct value="-06-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> there were <num value="220">two hundred and twenty</num> guns in position, mostly light field-pieces, besides a battery of heavy guns belonging to, manned and commanded by the navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4518"/>We were now as strong for defence against the garrison of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> as they were against us; but I knew that <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0019.0037.00282.01963" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> was in our rear, and was receiving constant reinforcements from the east.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4520"/>As soon as the news of the arrival of the <rs>Union</rs> army behind <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> reached the <rs>North</rs>, floods of visitors began to pour in.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4521"/>Often those coming to see a son or brother would bring a dozen or <num value="2">two</num> of poultry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4522"/>They did not know how little the gift would be appreciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4523"/>Many of the soldiers had lived so much on chicken, ducks and turkeys without bread during the march, that the sight of poultry, if they could get bacon, almost took away their appetite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4528"/>I therefore took them to <placeName><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0019.0037.00282.01965" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s headquarters</placeName> and presented them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4529"/>Before starting out to look at the lines-possibly while <orgName n="horse"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0019.0037.00282.01966" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s horse</orgName> was being saddled &mdash; there were many questions asked about the late campaign, about which the <rs>North</rs> had been so imperfectly informed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4536"/>He said that it was an axiom in war that when any great body of troops moved against an enemy they should do so from a base of supplies, which they would guard as they would the apple of the eye, etc. He pointed out all the difficulties that might be encountered in the campaign proposed, and stated in turn what would be the true campaign to make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4537"/>This was, in substance, to go back until high ground could be reached on the east bank of the river; fortify there and establish a depot of supplies, and move from there, being always prepared to fall back upon it in case of disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4540"/>To this I replied, the country is already disheartened over the lack of success on the part of our armies; the last election went against the vigorous prosecution of the war, voluntary enlistments had ceased throughout most of the <rs>North</rs> and conscription was already resorted to, and if we went back so far as <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> it would discourage the people so much that bases of supplies would be of no use: neither men to hold them nor supplies to put in them would be furnished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7105"/>Indeed, they seemed to have given up any idea of gaining any advantage of their antagonist in the open field.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7110"/>There was more justification for the assault at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7111"/>We were in a Southern climate, at the beginning of the hot season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7116"/>The <orgName n="Army of the Tennessee" type="army">Army of the Tennessee</orgName> had come to believe that they could beat their antagonist under any circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7117"/>There was no telling how long a regular siege might last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7118"/>As I have stated, it was the beginning of the hot season in a Southern climate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7119"/><pb id="p.446" n="446"/> There was no telling what the casualties might be among Northern troops working and living in trenches, drinking surface water filtered through rich vegetation, under a tropical sun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7120"/>These are reasons justifying the assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7121"/>The only benefit we gained-and it was a slight <num value="1">one</num> for so great a sacrifice &mdash; was that the men worked cheerfully in the trenches after that, being satisfied with digging the enemy out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7125"/>To do so would give us a long vulnerable line of road to protect, exhausting much of our strength to guard it, and would leave open to the enemy all of his lines of communication on the south side of the <rs>James</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7126"/>My idea from the start has been to beat <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0019.0056.00446.04166" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> if possible north of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>; then after destroying his lines of communication on the north side of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName> to transfer the army to the south side and besiege <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0019.0056.00446.04167" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, or follow him south if he should retreat. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7127"/>I now find, after over <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure> of trial, the enemy deems it of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> importance to run no risks with the armies they now have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7128"/>They act purely on the defensive behind breastworks, or feebly on the offensive immediately in front of them, and where in case of repulse they can instantly retire behind them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7129"/>Without a greater sacrifice of human life than I am willing to make all cannot be accomplished that I had designed outside of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7130"/>I have therefore resolved upon the following plan: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7131"/>I will continue to hold substantially the ground now occupied by the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>, taking advantage of any favorable circumstance that may present itself until the cavalry can be sent west to destroy the <orgName n="Virginia Central Railroad" type="railroad">Virginia Central Railroad</orgName> from about <placeName reg="Beaver Dam, Dodge, Wisconsin" key="tgn,2120707">Beaver Dam</placeName> for some <num value="25">twenty-five</num> or <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure> west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7132"/>When this is effected I will move the army to the south side of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName>, either by crossing the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> and marching near to <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>, or by going to the mouth of the <placeName reg="Chickahominy, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1122759">Chickahominy</placeName> on north side and crossing there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7133"/>To provide for this last and most possible contingency, several ferry-boats of the largest class ought to be immediately provided. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7134"/>Once on the south side of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName>, I can cut off all sources of supply to the enemy except what is furnished by the canal.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7772"/>The troops, both of the right and left wings, made most of their advance along the line of railroads, which they destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7773"/>The method adopted to perform this work, was to burn and destroy all the bridges and culverts, and for a long distance, at places, to tear up the track and bend the rails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7774"/>Soldiers to do this rapidly would form a line along <num value="1">one</num> side of the road with crowbars and poles, place these under the rails and, hoisting all at once, turn over many rods of road at <num value="1">one</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7775"/>The ties would then be placed in piles, and the rails, as they were loosened, would be carried and put across these log heaps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7776"/>When a sufficient number of rails were placed upon a pile of ties it would be set on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7777"/>This would heat the rails very much more in the middle, that being over the main part of the fire, than at the ends, so that they would naturally bend of their own weight; but the soldiers, to increase the damage, would take tongs and, <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> men at each end of the rail, carry it with force against the nearest tree and twist it around, thus leaving rails forming bands to ornament the forest trees of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7778"/>All this work was going on at the same time, there being a sufficient number of men detailed for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7779"/>Some piled logs and built the fire; some put the rails upon the fire; while others would bend those that were sufficiently heated: so that, by the time the last bit of road was torn up, that it was designed to destroy at a certain place, the rails previously taken up were already destroyed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7780"/>The organization for supplying the army was very complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7781"/>Each brigade furnished a company to gather supplies of forage and provisions for the command to which they belonged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7782"/>Strict injunctions were issued against pillaging, or otherwise unnecessarily annoying the people; but everything in shape of food for man and forage for beast was taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7783"/>The supplies were turned over to the brigade commissary and quartermaster, and were issued by them to their <pb id="p.494" n="494"/> respective commands precisely the same as if they had been purchased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7784"/>The captures consisted largely of cattle, sheep, poultry, some bacon, cornmeal, often molasses, and occasionally coffee or other small rations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7785"/>The skill of these men, called by themselves and the army <quote>bummers,</quote> in collecting their loads and getting back to their respective commands, was marvellous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7786"/>When they started out in the morning, they were always on foot; but scarcely <num value="1">one</num> of them returned in the evening without being mounted on a horse or mule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7787"/>These would be turned in for the general use of the army, and the next day these men would start out afoot and return again in the evening mounted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7788"/>Many of the exploits of these men would fall under the head of romance; indeed, I am afraid that in telling some of their experiences, the romance got the better of the truth upon which the story was founded, and that, in the way many of these anecdotes are told, very little of the foundation is left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7789"/>I suspect that most of them consist chiefly of the fiction added to make the stories better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7790"/>In <num value="1">one</num> instance it was reported that a few men of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0019.0059.00494.04787" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> passed a house where they discovered some chickens under the dwelling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7791"/>They immediately proceeded to capture them, to add to the army's supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7792"/>The lady of the house, who happened to be at home, made piteous appeals to have these spared, saying they were a few she had put away to save by permission of other parties who had preceded and who had taken all the others that she had. The soldiers seemed moved at her appeal; but looking at the chickens again they were tempted and <num value="1">one</num> of them replied: <quote>The rebellion must be suppressed if it takes the last chicken in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>,</quote> and proceeded to appropriate the last <num value="1">one</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7793"/>Another anecdote characteristic of these times has been told.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7794"/>The South, prior to the rebellion, kept bloodhounds to pursue runaway slaves who took refuge in the neighboring swamps, and also to hunt convicts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7795"/>Orders were issued to kill all these animals as they were met with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7796"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion a soldier picked up a poodle, the favorite pet of its mistress, and was carrying it off to execution when the lady made a strong appeal to him to spare it. The soldier replied, <quote><rs type="role2">Madam</rs>, our orders are to kill every bloodhound.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7797"/><quote>But this is not a bloodhound,</quote> said the lady.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7798"/><quote>Well, madam, we cannot tell what it will grow into if we leave it behind,</quote> said the soldier as he went off with it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7799"/>Notwithstanding these anecdotes, and the necessary hardship they would seem to imply, I do not believe there was much unwarrantable pillaging considering that we were in the enemy's territory and without any supplies except such as the country afforded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8270"/>They proved to be <persName n="Stephens,,Alexander,H.,," id="n0019.0063.00522.05154" reg="default:Stephens,Alexander,H.,,"><foreName>Alexander</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice-President</rs> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, <rs type="role2">Judge</rs> [John A.] <persName n="Campbell,,,,," id="n0019.0063.00522.05155" reg="mostcommon:Campbell,nomatch:0"><surname>Campbell</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Secretary of War">Assistant-Secretary of War</rs>, and <persName n="Hunter,,R.,M.,T.," id="n0019.0063.00522.05156" reg="default:Hunter,R.,M.,T.,"><foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName>, formerly <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <rs type="role2">Senator</rs> and then a member of the <orgName n="Confederate Senate" type="org">Confederate Senate</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8271"/>It was about dark when they reached my headquarters, and I at once conducted them to the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Mary Martin</rs>, a <placeName reg="Hudson River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7013729">Hudson River</placeName> boat which was very comfortably fitted up for the use of passengers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8272"/>I at once communicated by telegraph with <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0019.0063.00522.05157" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> and informed the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> and the <rs>President</rs> of the arrival of these commissioners and that their object was to negotiate terms of peace between the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and, as they termed it, the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8273"/>I was instructed to retain them at <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>, until the <rs>President</rs>, or some <num value="1">one</num> whom he would designate, should come to meet them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8274"/>They remained several days as guests on board the boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8275"/>I saw them quite frequently, though I have no recollection of having <pb id="p.523" n="523"/> had any conversation whatever with them on the subject of their mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8276"/>It was something I had nothing to do with, and I therefore did not wish to express any views.on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8277"/>For my own part I never had admitted, and never was ready to admit, that they were the representatives of a <hi rend="italics">government</hi>. There had been too great a waste of blood and treasure to concede anything of the kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8278"/>As long as they remained there, however, our relations were pleasant and I found them all very agreeable gentlemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8279"/>I directed the captain to furnish them with the best the boat afforded, and to administer to their comfort in every way possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8280"/>No guard was placed over them and no restriction was put upon their movements; nor was there any pledge asked that they would not abuse the privileges extended to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8281"/>They were permitted to leave the boat when they felt like it, and did so, coming up on the bank and visiting me at my headquarters. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8282"/>I had never met either of these gentlemen before the war, but knew them well by reputation and through their public services, and I had been a particular admirer of <persName n="Stephens,Mister,,,," id="n0019.0063.00523.05158" reg="nearbymention:Stephens,Alexander,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8283"/>I had always supposed that he was a very small man, but when I saw him in the dusk of the evening I was very much surprised to find so large a man as he seemed to be. When he got down on to the boat I found that he was wearing a coarse gray woollen overcoat, a manufacture that had been introduced into the <rs>South</rs> during the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8284"/>The cloth was thicker than anything of the kind I had ever seen, even in <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8285"/>The overcoat extended nearly to his feet, and was so large that it gave him the appearance of being an average-sized man. He took this off when he reached the cabin of the boat, and I was struck with the apparent change in size, in the coat and out of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8286"/>After a few days, about the <dateStruct value="-02-2"><day reg="2">2d</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>, I received a dispatch from <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0019.0063.00523.05159" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, directing me to send the commissioners to <placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName> to meet the <rs>President</rs> and a member of the cabinet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8288"/>It was not a great while after they met that the <rs>President</rs> visited me at <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8289"/>He spoke of his having met the commissioners, and said he had told them that there would be no use in entering into any negotiations unless they would recognize, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>: that the <rs>Union</rs> as a whole must be forever preserved, and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>: that slavery must be abolished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8290"/>If they were willing to concede these <num value="2">two</num> points, then he was ready to enter into negotiations and was almost willing to hand them a blank sheet of paper with his signature attached for them to fill in the terms upon which they were willing to live with us in the <rs>Union</rs> and be <num value="1">one</num> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8291"/>He always showed a generous and kindly <pb id="p.524" n="524"/> spirit toward the <rs>Southern</rs> people, and I never heard him abuse an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8292"/>Some of the cruel things said about <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0019.0063.00524.05161" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:3"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, particularly in the <rs>North</rs>, used to pierce him to the heart; but never in my presence did he evince a revengeful disposition-and I saw a great deal of him at <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>, for he seemed glad to get away from the cares and anxieties of the capital. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8293"/>Right here I might relate an anecdote of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0019.0063.00524.05162" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:3"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8294"/>It was on the occasion of his visit to me just after he had talked with the peace commissioners at <placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8295"/>After a little conversation, he asked me if I had seen that overcoat of <persName n="Stephens,,,,," id="n0019.0063.00524.05163" reg="nearbymention:Stephens,Alexander,H.,,"><surname>Stephens</surname></persName>'s. I replied that I had. <quote>Well,</quote> said he, <quote>did you see him take it off?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8296"/>I said yes. <quote>Well,</quote> said he, <quote>didn't you think it was the biggest shuck and the littlest ear that ever you did see?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8297"/>Long afterwards I told this story to the <rs>Confederate</rs> <persName n="Gordon,General,J.,B.,," id="n0019.0063.00524.05164" reg="expanded:Gordon,John,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Gordon</surname></persName>, at the time a member of the <name>Senate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8298"/>He repeated it to <persName n="Stephens,,,,," id="n0019.0063.00524.05165" reg="nearbymention:Stephens,Alexander,H.,,"><surname>Stephens</surname></persName>, and, as I heard afterwards, <persName n="Stephens,,,,," id="n0019.0063.00524.05166" reg="nearbymention:Stephens,Alexander,H.,,"><surname>Stephens</surname></persName> laughed immoderately at the simile of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0019.0063.00524.05167" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:3"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8299"/>The rest of the winter, after the departure of the peace commissioners, passed off quietly and uneventfully, except for <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> little incidents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8300"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion during this period, while I was visiting <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington City</placeName> for the purpose of conferring with the administration, the enemy's cavalry under <persName n="Hampton,General,Wade,,," id="n0019.0063.00524.05168" reg="default:Hampton,Wade,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Wade</foreName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName>, passing our extreme left and then going to the south, got in east of us. Before their presence was known, they had driven off a large number of beef cattle that were grazing in that section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8301"/>It was a fair capture, and they were sufficiently needed by the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8302"/>It was only retaliating for what we had done, sometimes for many weeks at a time, when out of supplies-taking what the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> otherwise would have gotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8303"/>As appears in this book, on <num value="1">one</num> single occasion we <measure n="5000" type="captured">captured five thousand</measure> head of cattle which were crossing the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi River</placeName> near <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName> on their way from <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> to supply the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> in the <rs>East</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8304"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most anxious periods of my experience during the rebellion was the last few weeks before <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8305"/>I felt that the situation of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> was such that they would try to make an escape at the earliest practicable moment, and I was afraid, every morning, that I would awake from my sleep to hear that <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0019.0063.00524.05169" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:15"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> had gone, and that nothing was left but a picket line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8306"/>He had his railroad by the way of <placeName reg="Danville, Danville, Virginia" key="tgn,7014729">Danville</placeName> south, and I was afraid that he was running off his men and all stores and ordnance except such as it would be necessary to carry with him for his immediate defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8307"/>I knew he could move <pb id="p.525" n="525"/> much more lightly and more rapidly than I, and that, if he got the start, he would leave me behind so that we would have the same army to fight again farther south-and the war might be prolonged another year. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8308"/>I was led to this fear by the fact that I could not see how it was possible for the <rs>Confederates</rs> to hold out much longer where they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8309"/>There is no doubt that <persName n="Richmond,,,,," id="n0019.0063.00525.05170" reg="mostcommon:Richmond,nomatch:0"><surname>Richmond</surname></persName> would have been evacuated much sooner than it was, if it had not been that it was the capital of the so-called Confederacy, and the fact of evacuating the capital would, of course, have had a very demoralizing effect upon the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8310"/>When it was evacuated (as we shall see further on), the <rs>Confederacy</rs> at once began to crumble and fade away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8311"/>Then, too, desertions were taking place, not only among those who were with <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0019.0063.00525.05171" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:15"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> in the neighborhood of their capital, but throughout the whole Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8312"/>I remember that in a conversation with me on <num value="1">one</num> occasion long prior to this, <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0019.0063.00525.05172" reg="mostcommon:Butler,B.,F.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> remarked that the <rs>Confederates</rs> would find great difficulty in getting more men for their army; possibly adding, though I am not certain as to this, <quote>unless they should arm the slave.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8313"/></p> 
<p>The South, as we all knew, were conscripting every able-bodied man between the ages of <num value="18">eighteen</num> and <num value="45">forty-five</num>; and now they had passed a law for the further conscription of boys from <num value="14">fourteen</num> to <num value="18">eighteen</num>, calling them the junior reserves, and men from <num value="45">forty-five</num> to <num value="60">sixty</num> to be called the senior reserves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8314"/>The latter were to hold the necessary points not in immediate danger, and especially those in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8315"/><persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0019.0063.00525.05173" reg="mostcommon:Butler,B.,F.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>, in alluding to this conscription, remarked that they were thus <quote>robbing both the cradle and the grave,</quote> an expression which I afterwards used in writing a letter to <persName n="Washburn,Mister,,,," id="n0019.0063.00525.05174" reg="mostcommon:Washburn,C.,C.,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Washburn</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8316"/>It was my belief that while the enemy could get no more recruits they were losing at least a regiment a day, taking it throughout the entire army, by desertions alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8317"/>Then by casualties of war, sickness, and other natural causes, their losses were much heavier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8318"/>It was a mere question of arithmetic to calculate how long they could hold out while that rate of depletion was going on. Of course long before their army would be thus reduced to nothing the army which we had in the field would have been able to capture theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8319"/>Then too I knew from the great number of desertions, that the men who had fought so bravely, so gallantly and so long for the cause which they believed in-and as earnestly, I take it, as our men believed in the cause for which they were fighting-had lost hope and become despondent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8320"/><pb id="p.526" n="526"/> Many of them were making application to be sent North where they might get employment until the war was over, when they could return to their Southern homes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8321"/>For these and other reasons I was naturally very impatient for the time to come when I could commence the spring campaign, which I thoroughly believed would close the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8322"/>There were <num value="2">two</num> considerations I had to observe, however, and which detained me. <num value="1">One</num> was the fact that the winter had been <num value="1">one</num> of heavy rains, and the roads were impassable for artillery and teams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8323"/>It was necessary to wait until they had dried sufficiently to enable us to move the wagon trains and artillery necessary to the efficiency of an army operating in the enemy's country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8324"/>The other consideration was that <persName n="Sheridan,General,,,," id="n0019.0063.00526.05175" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,P.,H.,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> with the cavalry of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> was operating on the north side of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName>, having come down from the <rs>Shenandoah</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8325"/>It was necessary that I should have his cavalry with me, and I was therefore obliged to wait until he could join me south of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8326"/>Let us now take account of what he was doing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8327"/>On the <dateStruct value="-03-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> I had heard from <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0019.0063.00526.05176" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,P.,H.,,:4"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8328"/>He had met <persName n="Early,,,,," id="n0019.0063.00526.05177" reg="mostcommon:Early,Jubal,A.,,:1"><surname>Early</surname></persName> between <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7013585" n="1.000 66" reg="charlottesville, charlottesville, virginia">Charlottesville</placeName> and defeated him, capturing nearly his entire command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8329"/>Early and some of his officers escaped by finding refuge in the neighboring houses or in the woods. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8330"/>On the <dateStruct value="--12"><day reg="2">12th</day></dateStruct> I heard from him again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8331"/>He had turned east, to come to <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8332"/>He could not go to <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName> as ordered, because the rains had been so very heavy and the streams were so very much swollen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8333"/>He had a pontoon train with him, but it would not reach half way across some of the streams, at their then stage of water, which he would have to get over in going south as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ordered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8334"/>I had supplies sent around to <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName> for him, and kept the depot there open until he arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8335"/>We had intended to abandon it because the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName> had now become our base of supplies. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8339"/>They stopped at <placeName key="tgn,7013585" n="1.000 66" reg="charlottesville, charlottesville, virginia">Charlottesville</placeName> and commenced tearing up the railroad back toward <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8340"/>He also sent a division along the <rs type="place">James River Canal</rs> to destroy locks, culverts, etc. All mills and factories along the lines of march of his troops were destroyed also. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8342"/>He determined therefore to fight his way along the railroad and canal till he was as near to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> as it was possible to get, or until attacked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8343"/>He did this, destroying the canal as far as <placeName reg="Goochland, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002163">Goochland</placeName>, and the railroad to a point as near <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> as he could get.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8344"/>Negroes had joined his column to the number of <num value="2000">two thousand</num> or more, and they assisted considerably in the work of destroying the railroads and the canal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8345"/>His cavalry was in as fine a condition as when he started, because he had been able to find plenty of forage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8346"/>He had captured most of <orgName n="horse"><persName n="Early,,,,," id="n0019.0063.00527.05184" reg="mostcommon:Early,Jubal,A.,,:1"><surname>Early</surname></persName>'s horse</orgName>s and picked up a good many others on the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8347"/>When he reached <placeName reg="Ashland, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2110477">Ashland</placeName> he was assailed by the enemy in force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8348"/>He resisted their assault with part of his command, moved quickly across the <name>South</name> and <name>North</name> <persName n="Anna,,,,," id="n0019.0063.00527.05185" reg="mostcommon:Anna,Santa,,,:17"><surname>Anna</surname></persName>, going north, and reached <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName> safely on the <dateStruct value="--19"><day reg="2">19th</day></dateStruct>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8413"/>On that date I moved out with all the army available after leaving sufficient force to hold the line about <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8414"/>It soon set in raining again however, and in a very short time the roads became practically impassable for teams, and almost so for cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8415"/>Sometimes a horse or mule would be standing apparently on firm ground, when all at once <num value="1">one</num> foot would sink, and as he commenced scrambling to catch himself all his feet would sink and he would have to be drawn by hand out of the quicksands so common in that part of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and other southern States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8416"/>It became necessary therefore to build corduroy roads every foot of the way as we advanced, to move our artillery upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8417"/>The army had become so accustomed to this kind of work, and were so well prepared for it, that it was done very rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8419"/>This movement was made for the purpose of extending our lines to the west as far as practicable towards the enemy's extreme right, or <placeName reg="Five Forks, Dinwiddie, Virginia" key="tgn,2111769">Five Forks</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8420"/>The column moving detached from the army still in the trenches was, excluding the cavalry, very small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8432"/>He had only his cavalry with him. Soon encountering the rebel cavalry he met with a very stout resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8433"/>He gradually drove them back however until in the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Five Forks, Dinwiddie, Virginia" key="tgn,2111769">Five Forks</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8434"/>Here he had to encounter other troops besides those he had been contending with, and was forced to give way. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8435"/>In this condition of affairs he notified me of what had taken place and stated that he was falling back toward <placeName reg="Dinwiddie, Dinwiddie, Virginia" key="tgn,2111478">Dinwiddie</placeName> gradually and slowly, and asked me to send <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Wright,,,,," id="n0019.0064.00533.05246" reg="mostcommon:Wright,H.,G.,,:2"><surname>Wright</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> to his assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8438"/>When he did move it was done very deliberately, and on arriving at <placeName reg="Gravelly Run, Dinwiddie, Virginia" key="tgn,2361437">Gravelly Run</placeName> he found the stream swollen from the recent rains so that he regarded it as not fordable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8439"/>Sheridan of course knew of his coming, and being impatient to get the troops up as soon as possible, sent orders to him to hasten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8440"/>He was also hastened or at least ordered to move up rapidly by <persName n="Meade,General,,,," id="n0019.0064.00533.05253" reg="mostcommon:Meade,George,G.,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8774"/>As he was a man of much dignity, with an impassable face, it was impossible to say whether he felt inwardly glad that the end had finally come, or felt sad over the result, and was too manly to show it. Whatever his feelings, they were entirely concealed from my observation; but my own feelings, which had been quite jubilant on the receipt of his letter, were sad and depressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8775"/>I felt like anything rather than rejoicing at the downfall of a foe who had fought so long and valiantly, and had <pb id="p.556" n="556"/> suffered so much for a cause, though that cause was, I believe, <num value="1">one</num> of the worst for which a people ever fought, and <num value="1">one</num> for which there was the least excuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8778"/>In my rough traveling suit, the uniform of a private with the straps of a lieutenant-general, I must have contrasted very strangely with a man so handsomely dressed, <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> high and of faultless form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8779"/>But this was not a matter that I thought of until afterwards. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8780"/>We soon fell into a conversation about old army times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8781"/>He remarked that he remembered me very well in the old army; and I told him that as a matter of course I remembered him perfectly, but from the difference in our rank and years (there being about <measure n="16years" type="date">sixteen years</measure> difference in our ages), I had thought it very likely that I had not attracted his attention sufficiently to be remembered by him after such a long interval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8782"/>Our conversation grew so pleasant that I almost forgot the object of our meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8783"/>After the conversation had run on in this style for some time, <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0019.0067.00556.05542" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> called my attention to the object of our meeting, and said that he had asked for this interview for the purpose of getting from me the terms I proposed to give his army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8784"/>I said that I meant merely that his army should lay down their arms, not to take them up again during the continuance of the war unless duly and properly exchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8785"/>He said that he had so understood my letter. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8791"/>The arms, artillery and public property to be parked and stacked, and turned over to the officer appointed by me to receive them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8792"/>This will not embrace the side-arms of the officers, nor.their private horses or baggage.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8795"/>When I put my pen to the paper I did not know the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> word that I should make use of in writing the terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8796"/>I only knew what was in my mind, and I wished to express it clearly, so that there could be no mistaking it. As I wrote on, the thought occurred to me that the officers had their own private horses and effects, which were important to them, but of no value to us; also that it would be an unnecessary humiliation to call upon them to deliver their side arms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8797"/>No conversation, not <num value="1">one</num> word, passed between <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0019.0067.00557.05547" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> and myself, either about private property, side arms, or kindred subjects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8798"/>He appeared to have no objections to the terms <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> proposed; or if he had a point to make against them he wished to wait until they were in writing to make it. When he read over that part of the terms about side arms, horses and private property of the officers, he remarked, with some feeling, I thought, that this would have a happy effect upon his army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8799"/>Then, after a little further conversation, <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0019.0067.00557.05548" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> remarked to me again that their army was organized a little differently from the <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">army of the United States</orgName> (still maintaining by implication that we were <num value="2">two</num> countries); that in their army the cavalrymen and artillerists owned their own horses; and he asked if he was to understand that the men who so owned their horses were to be permitted to retain them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8800"/>I told him that as the terms were written they would not; that only the officers were permitted to take their private property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8801"/>He then, after reading over the terms a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time, remarked that that was clear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8802"/>I then said to him that I thought this would be about the last battle of the war &mdash; I sincerely hoped so; and I said further I took it that most of the men in the ranks were small farmers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8803"/>The whole country had been so raided by the <num value="2">two</num> armies that it was doubtful whether they would be able to put in a crop to carry themselves and their families through the next winter without the aid of the horses they <pb id="p.558" n="558"/> were then riding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8804"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> did not want them and I would, therefore, instruct the officers I left behind to receive the paroles of his troops to let every man of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> who claimed to own a horse or mule take the animal to his home.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8806"/>He then sat down and wrote out the following letter:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8811"/>The word sword or side arms was not mentioned by either of us until I wrote it in the terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8812"/>There was no premeditation, and it did not occur to me until the moment I wrote it down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8813"/>If I had happened to omit it, and <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0019.0067.00558.05554" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> had called my attention to it, I should have put it in the terms precisely as I acceded to the provision about the soldiers retaining their horses. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8815"/>I told him <quote>certainly,</quote> and asked for how many men he wanted rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8816"/>His answer was <quote>about <num value="25000">twenty-five thousand</num></quote> : and I authorized him to send his own commissary and quartermaster to <placeName reg="Appomattox Station">Appomattox Station</placeName>, <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> away, where he could have, out of the trains we had stopped, all the provisions wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8824"/>The Confederates were now our prisoners, and we did not want to exult over their downfall. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8825"/>I determined to return to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 27" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> at once, with a view to putting a stop to the purchase of supplies, and what I now deemed other useless outlay of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8826"/>Before leaving, however, I thought I would like to see <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0019.0067.00559.05570" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> again; so next morning I rode out beyond our lines towards his headquarters, preceded by a bugler and a staff-officer carrying a white flag. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8827"/><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0019.0067.00559.05571" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> soon mounted his horse, seeing who it was, and met me. We had there between the lines, sitting on horseback, a very pleasant conversation of over half an hour, in the course of which <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0019.0067.00559.05572" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> said to me that the <rs>South</rs> was a big country and that we might have to march over it <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> times before the war entirely ended, but that we would now be able to do it as they could no longer resist us. He expressed it as his earnest hope, however, that we would not be called upon to cause more loss and sacrifice of life; but he could not foretell the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8828"/>I then suggested to <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0019.0067.00559.05573" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> that there was not a man in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> whose influence with the soldiery and the whole people was as great as his, and that if he would now advise the surrender of all the armies I had no doubt his advice would be followed with alacrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8829"/>But <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0019.0067.00559.05574" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> said, that he could not do that without consulting the <rs>President</rs> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8830"/>I knew there was no use to urge him to do anything against his ideas of what was right. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8831"/>I was accompanied by my staff and other officers, some of whom <pb id="p.560" n="560"/> seemed to have a great desire to go inside the <rs>Confederate</rs> lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8832"/>They finally asked permission of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0019.0067.00560.05575" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> to do so for the purpose of seeing some of their old army friends, and the permission was granted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8833"/>They went over, had a very pleasant time with their old friends, and brought some of them back with them when they returned. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8834"/>When <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0019.0067.00560.05576" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> and I separated he went back to his lines and I returned to the house of <persName n="McLean,Mister,,,," id="n0019.0067.00560.05577" reg="mostcommon:McLean,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>McLean</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8835"/>Here the officers of both armies came in great numbers, and seemed to enjoy the meeting as much as though they had been friends separated for a long time while fighting battles under the same flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8836"/>For the time being it looked very much as if all thought of the war had escaped their minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8839"/>There was no more straggling, no more rear guards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8840"/>The men who in former times had been falling back, were now, as I have already stated, striving to get to the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8841"/>For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in <num value="4">four</num> weary years they felt that they were now nearing the time when they could return to their homes with their country saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8842"/>On the other hand, the <rs>Confederates</rs> were more than correspondingly depressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8843"/>Their despondency increased with each returning day, and especially after the battle of <placeName reg="Sailor's Creek, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2646522">Sailor's Creek</placeName>. <pb id="p.561" n="561"/> They threw away their arms in constantly increasing numbers, dropping out of the ranks and betaking themselves to the woods in the hope of reaching their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8844"/>I have already instanced the case of the entire disintegration of a regiment whose colonel I met at <placeName key="tgn,7014170" n="1.000 62" reg="farmville, prince edward, virginia">Farmville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8845"/>As a result of these and other influences, when <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0019.0068.00561.05582" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> finally surrendered at <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName>, there were only <num value="28356">28,356</num> officers and men left to be paroled, and many of these were without arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8846"/>It was probably this latter fact which gave rise to the statement sometimes made, <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, that <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0019.0068.00561.05583" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> surrendered a smaller number of men than what the official figures show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8847"/>As a matter of official record, and in addition to the number paroled as given above, we captured between <dateStruct value="-03-29"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="29">29th</day></dateStruct> and the date of surrender <num value="19132">19,132</num> Confederates, to say nothing of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0019.0068.00561.05584" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s other losses, killed, wounded and missing, during the series of desperate conflicts which marked his headlong and determined flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8848"/>The same record shows the number of cannon, including those at <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName>, to have been <num value="689">689</num> between the dates named. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8849"/>There has always been a great conflict of opinion as to the number of troops engaged in every battle, or all important battles, fought between the sections, the <rs>South</rs> magnifying the number of Union troops engaged and belittling their own. Northern writers have fallen, in many instances, into the same error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8850"/>I have often heard gentlemen, who were thoroughly loyal to the <rs>Union</rs>, speak of what a splendid fight the <rs>South</rs> had made and successfully continued for <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> before yielding, with their <num value="12000000">twelve million</num> of people against our <num value="20">twenty</num>, and of the <num value="12">twelve</num> <num value="4">four</num> being colored slaves, non-combatants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8851"/>I will add to their argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8852"/>We had many regiments of brave and loyal men who volunteered under great difficulty from the <num value="12000000">twelve million</num> belonging to the <rs>South</rs>.<num value="2">2</num> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8853"/>But the <rs>South</rs> had rebelled against the <rs>National</rs> government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8854"/>It was not bound by any constitutional restrictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8855"/>The whole <rs>South</rs> was a military camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8856"/>The occupation of the colored people was to furnish supplies for the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8857"/>Conscription was resorted to early, and embraced every male from the age of <num value="18">eighteen</num> to <num value="45">forty-five</num>, exeluding <pb id="p.562" n="562"/> only those physically unfit to serve in the field, and the necessary number of civil officers of State and intended National government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8858"/>The old and physically disabled furnished a good portion of these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8906"/>He was a man who never questioned his own authority, and who always did in war time what he wanted to do. He was an able constitutional lawyer and jurist; but the <rs>Constitution</rs> was not an impediment to him while the war lasted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8907"/>In this latter particular I entirely agree with the view he evidently held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8934"/>The people who had been in rebellion must necessarily come back into the <rs>Union</rs>, and be incorporated as an integral part of the nation.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8937"/>I do not believe that the majority of the <rs>Northern</rs> people at that time were in favor of Negro suffrage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8938"/>They supposed that it would naturally follow the freedom of the <name>Negro</name>, but that there would be a time of probation, in which the ex-slaves could prepare themselves for the privileges of citizenship before the full right would be conferred; but <persName n="Johnson,Mister,,,," id="n0019.0068.00567.05608" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,Edward,,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, after a complete revolution of sentiment, seemed to regard the <rs>South</rs> not only as an oppressed people, but as the people best entitled to consideration of any of our citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8939"/>This was more than the people who had secured to us the perpetuation of the <rs>Union</rs> were prepared for, and they became more radical in their views.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8941"/>Thus <persName n="Johnson,Mister,,,," id="n0019.0068.00567.05610" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,Edward,,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, fighting Congress on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, and receiving the support of the <rs>South</rs> on the other, drove Congress, which was overwhelmingly republican, to the passing of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num> measure and then another to restrict his power.

<head>Conclusion</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9170"/>The cause of the great War of the <rs>Rebellion</rs> against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> will have to be attributed to slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9171"/>For some years before the war began it was a trite saying among some politicians that <quote>A state half slave and half free cannot exist.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9172"/>All must become slave or all free, or the state will go down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9173"/>I took no part myself in any such view of the case at the time, but since the war is over, reviewing the whole question, I have come to the conclusion that the saying is quite true. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9174"/>Slavery was an institution that required unusual guarantees for its security wherever it existed; and in a country like ours where the larger portion of it was free territory inhabited by an intelligent and well-to-do population, the people would naturally have but little sympathy with demands upon them for its protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9175"/>Hence the people of the <rs>South</rs> were dependent upon keeping control of the general government to secure the perpetuation of their favorite institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9176"/>They were enabled to maintain this control long after the <name>States</name> where slavery existed had ceased to have the controlling power, through the assistance they received from odd men here and there throughout the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9177"/>They saw their power waning, and this led them to encroach upon the prerogatives and independence of the <rs>Northern States</rs> by enacting such laws as the <rs>Fugitive Slave Law</rs>. By this law every Northern man was obliged, when properly summoned, to turn out and help apprehend the runaway slave of a Southern man. Northern marshals became slave-catchers, and Northern courts had to contribute to the support and protection of the institution. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9178"/>This was a degradation which the <rs>North</rs> would not permit any longer than until they could get the power to expunge such laws from the statute books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9179"/>Prior to the time of these encroachments the great majority of the people of the <rs>North</rs> had no particular quarrel with slavery, so long as they were not forced to have it themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9180"/>But they were not willing to play the role of police for the <rs>South</rs> in the protection of this particular institution. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9181"/>In the early days of the country, before we had railroads, telegraphs and steamboats &mdash; in a word, rapid transit of any sort-the <name>States</name> were each almost a separate nationality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9182"/>At that time the <pb id="p.585" n="585"/> subject of slavery caused but little or no disturbance to the public mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9183"/>But the country grew, rapid transit was established, and trade and commerce between the <name>States</name> got to be so much greater than before, that the power of the <rs>National</rs> government became more felt and recognized and, therefore, had to be enlisted in the cause of this institution. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9184"/>It is probably well that we had the war when we did. We are better off now than we would have been without it, and have made more rapid progress than we otherwise should have made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9185"/>The civilized nations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> have been stimulated into unusual activity, so that commerce, trade, travel, and thorough acquaintance among people of different nationalities, has become common; whereas, before, it was but the few who had ever had the privilege of going beyond the limits of their own country or who knew anything about other people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9186"/>Then, too, our republican institutions were regarded as experiments up to the breaking out of the rebellion, and monarchical <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> generally believed that our republic was a rope of sand that would part the moment the slightest strain was brought upon it. Now it has shown itself capable of dealing with <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest wars that was ever made, and our people have proven themselves to be the most formidable in war of any nationality. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9187"/>But this war was a fearful lesson, and should teach us the necessity of avoiding wars in the future. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9188"/>The conduct of some of the <rs>European</rs> states during our troubles shows the lack of conscience of communities where the responsibility does not come upon a single individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9189"/>Seeing a nation that extended from ocean to ocean, embracing the better part of a continent, growing as we were growing in population, wealth and intelligence, the <rs>European</rs> nations thought it would be well to give us a check.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9190"/>We might, possibly, after a while threaten their peace, or, at least, the perpetuity of their institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9191"/>Hence, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was constantly finding fault with the administration at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 27" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> because we were not able to keep up an effective blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9195"/>Under pretence of protecting their citizens, these nations seized upon <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> as a foothold for establishing a European monarchy upon our continent, thus threatening our peace at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9196"/>I, myself, regarded this as a direct act of war against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> by the powers engaged, and supposed as a matter of course that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would treat it as such when their hands were free to strike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9197"/>I often spoke of the matter to <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0019.0071.00586.05771" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, but never heard any special views from them to enable me to judge what they thought or felt about it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9198"/>All of the powers except <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> very soon withdrew from the armed intervention for the establishment of an Austrian prince upon the throne of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>; but the governing people of these countries continued to the close of the war to throw obstacles in our way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9199"/>These troops got off before they could be stopped; and went to the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>, where <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0019.0071.00586.05775" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,P.,H.,,:4"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> distributed them up and down the river, much to the consternation of the troops in the quarter of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> bordering on that stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9235"/>Even in <placeName reg="Manchester, Manchester, England" key="tgn,7010477">Manchester</placeName>, which suffered so fearfully by having the cotton cut off from her mills, they had a monster demonstration in favor of the <rs>North</rs> at the very time when their workmen were almost famishing. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9236"/>It is possible that the question of a conflict between races may come up in the future, as did that between freedom and slavery before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9237"/>The condition of the colored man within our borders may become a source of anxiety, to say the least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9238"/>But he was brought to our shores by compulsion, and. he now should be considered as having as good a right to remain here as any other class of our citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9239"/>It was looking to a settlement of this question that led me to urge the annexation of <placeName reg="Republica Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">Santo Domingo</placeName> during the time I was <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9240"/><placeName reg="Republica Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">Santo Domingo</placeName> was freely offered to us, not only by the administration, but by all the people, almost without price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9241"/>The island is upon our shores, is very fertile, and is capable of supporting <num value="15000000">fifteen millions</num> of people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9242"/>The products of the soil are so valuable that labor in her fields would be so compensated as to enable those who wished to go there to quickly repay the cost of their passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9243"/>I took it that the colored people would go there in great numbers, so as to have independent states governed by their own race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9244"/>They would still be States of the <rs>Union</rs>, and under the protection of the <rs>General Government</rs>; but the citizens would be almost wholly colored. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9245"/>By the war with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, we had acquired, as we have seen, territory almost equal in extent to that we already possessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9246"/>It was seen that the volunteers of the <rs>Mexican</rs> war largely composed the pioneers to settle up the <rs type="place">Pacific coast</rs> country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9247"/>Their numbers, however, were scarcely sufficient to be a nucleus for the population of the important points of the territory acquired by that war. After our rebellion, when so many young men were at liberty to return to their homes, they found they were not satisfied with the farm, the store, or the work-shop of the villages, but wanted larger fields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9248"/>The mines of the <pb id="p.589" n="589"/> mountains <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attracted them; but afterwards they found that rich valleys and productive grazing and farming lands were there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9249"/>This territory, the geography of which was not known to us at the close of the rebellion, is now as well mapped as any portion of our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9250"/>Railroads traverse it in every direction, <name>north</name>, <name>south</name>, <name>east</name>, and <name>west</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9251"/>The mines are worked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9252"/>The high lands are used for grazing purposes, and rich agricultural lands are found in many of the valleys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9253"/>This is the work of the volunteer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9254"/>It is probable that the <name>Indians</name> would have had control of these lands for a century yet but for the war. We must conclude, therefore, that wars are not always evils unmixed with some good. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9255"/>Prior to the rebellion the great mass of the people were satisfied to remain near the scenes of their birth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9256"/>In fact an immense majority of the whole people did not feel secure against coming to want should they move among entire strangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9257"/>So much was the country divided into small communities that localized idioms had grown up, so that you could almost tell what section a person was from by hearing him speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9258"/>Before, new territories were settled by a <quote>class</quote> ; people who shunned contact with others; people who, when the country began to settle up around them, would push out farther from civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9259"/>Their guns furnished meat, and the cultivation of a very limited amount of the soil, their bread and vegetables.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9260"/>All the streams abounded with fish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9261"/>Trapping would furnish pelts to be brought into the <name>States</name> once a year, to pay for necessary articles which they could not raise-powder, lead, whiskey, tobacco and some store goods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9262"/>Occasionally some little articles of luxury would enter into these purchases--<num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a pound of tea, <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3l." type="pounds"><num value="3">three</num> pounds</measure> of coffee, more of sugar, some playing cards, and if anything was left over of the proceeds of the sale, more whiskey. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9263"/>Little was known of the topography of the country beyond the settlements of these frontiersmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9264"/>This is all changed now. The war begot a spirit of independence and enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9265"/>The feeling now is, that a youth must cut loose from his old surroundings to enable him to get up in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9266"/>There is now such a commingling of the people that particular idioms and pronunciation are no longer localized to any great extent; the country has filled up <quote>from the centre all around to the sea</quote> ; railroads connect the <num value="2">two</num> oceans and all parts of the interior; maps, nearly perfect, of every part of the country are now furnished the student of geography. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9267"/>The war has made us a nation of great power and intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9268"/>We have but little to do to preserve peace, happiness and prosperity <pb id="p.590" n="590"/> at home, and the respect of other nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9269"/>Our experience ought to teach us the necessity of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; our power secures the latter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9270"/>I feel that we are on the eve of a new era, when there is to be great harmony between the <rs>Federal</rs> and Confederate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9271"/>I cannot stay to be a living witness to the correctness of this prophecy; but I feel it within me that it is to be so. The universally kind feeling expressed for me at a time when it was supposed that each day would prove my last, seemed to me the beginning of the answer to <quote>Let us have peace.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9272"/></p> 
<p>The expressions of these kindly feelings were not restricted to a section of the country, nor to a division of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9273"/>They came from individual citizens of all nationalities; from all denominations &mdash; the <name>Protestant</name>, the <rs>Catholic</rs>, and the <name>Jew</name>; and from the various societies of the land-scientific, educational, religious, or otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9274"/>Politics did not enter into the matter at all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9275"/>I am not egotist enough to suppose all this significance should be given because I was the object of it. But the war between the <name>States</name> was a very bloody and a very costly war. <num value="1">One</num> side or the other had to yield principles they deemed dearer than life before it could be brought to an end. I commanded the whole of the mighty host engaged on the victorious side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9276"/>I was, no matter whether deservedly so or not, a representative of that side of the controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9277"/>It is a significant and gratifying fact that Confederates should have joined heartily in this spontaneous move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9278"/>I hope the good feeling inaugurated may continue to the end. </p></div1></body></text></TEI.2>
