<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/><num value="0.25">A quarter</num> of a century has well-nigh rolled by since the tragic death of <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n0025.0001.00000.00001" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>The prejudice and bitterness with which he was assailed have disappeared from the minds of men, and the world is now beginning to view him as a great historical character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Those who knew and walked with him are gradually passing away, and ere long the last man who ever heard his voice or grasped his hand will have gone from earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>With a view to throwing a light on some attributes of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0001.00000.00002" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s character heretofore obscure, and thus contributing to the great fund of history which goes down to posterity, these volumes are given to the world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>If <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0025.0001.00000.00003" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is destined to fill that exalted station in history or attain that high rank in the estimation of the coming generations which has been predicted of him, it is alike just to his memory and the proper legacy of mankind that the whole truth concerning him should be known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>If the story of his life is truthfully and courageously told &mdash; nothing colored or suppressed; nothing false either written or suggested &mdash; the reader will see and feel the presence of the living man. He will, in fact, live with him and be moved to think and act <pb id="p.viii" n="viii"/> with him. If, on the other hand, the story is colored or the facts in any degree suppressed, the reader will be not only misled, but imposed upon as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>At last the truth will come, and no man need hope to evade it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/><quote>There is but <num value="1">one</num> true history in the world,</quote> said <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0001.00000.00004" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s closest friends to whom I confided the project of writing a history of his life several years ago, <quote>and that is the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>It is often said of the old characters portrayed there that they were bad men. They are contrasted with other characters in history, and much to the detriment of the old worthies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The reason is, that the <name>Biblical</name> historian told the whole truth &mdash; the inner life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The heart and secret acts are brought to light and faithfully photographed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>In other histories virtues are perpetuated and vices concealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>If the life of <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>David</foreName></persName> had been written by an ordinary historian the affair of <persName><foreName>Uriah</foreName></persName> would at most have been a quashed indictment with a denial of all the substantial facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>You should not forget there is a skeleton in every house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The finest character dug out thoroughly, photographed honestly, and judged by that standard of morality or excellence which we exact for other men is never perfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Some men are cold, some lewd, some dishonest, some cruel, and many a combination of all. The trail of the serpent is over them all!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Excellence consists, not in the absence of these attributes, but in the degree in which they are redeemed by the virtues and graces of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0001.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s character will, I am certain, bear close scrutiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>I am <pb id="p.ix" n="ix"/> not afraid of you in this direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Don't let any thing deter you from digging to the bottom; yet don't forget that if <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0001.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had some faults, <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> had more &mdash; few men have less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>In drawing the portrait tell the world what the skeleton was with <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0001.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>What gave him that peculiar melancholy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>What cancer had he inside?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/></p> 
<p>Some persons will doubtless object to the narration of certain facts which appear here for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, and which they contend should have been consigned to the tomb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Their pretense is that no good can come from such ghastly exposures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>To such over-sensitive souls, if any such exist, my answer is that these facts are indispensable to a full knowledge of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0025.0001.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> in all the walks of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>In order properly to comprehend him and the stirring, bloody times in which he lived, and in which he played such an important part, we must have all the facts-we must be prepared to take him as he was. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>In determining <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0001.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s title to greatness we must not only keep in mind the times in which he lived, but we must, to a certain extent, measure him with other men. Many of our great men and our statesmen, it is true, have been self-made, rising gradually through struggles to the topmost round of the ladder; but <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0001.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> rose from a lower depth than any of them &mdash; from a stagnant, putrid pool, like the gas which, set on fire by its own energy and self-combustible nature, rises in jets, blazing, clear, and bright.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>I should be remiss in my duty if I did not throw the light on this part of the picture, so <pb id="p.x" n="x"/> that the world may realize what marvellous contrast <num value="1">one</num> phase of his life presents to another. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The purpose of these volumes is to narrate facts, avoiding as much as possible any expression of opinion, and leaving the reader to form his own conclusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Use has been made of the views and recollections of other persons, but only those known to be truthful and trustworthy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>A thread of the narrative of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0001.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s life runs through the work, but an especial feature is an analysis of the man and a portrayal of his attributes and characteristics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The attempt to delineate his qualities, his nature and its manifestations, may occasion frequent repetitions of fact, but if truthfully done this can only augment the store of matter from which posterity is to learn what manner of man he was. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The object of this work is to deal with <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0025.0001.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> individually and domestically; as lawyer, as citizen, as statesman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Especial attention is given to the history of his youth and early manhood; and while dwelling on this portion of his life the liberty is taken to insert many things that would be omitted or suppressed in other places, where the cast-iron rules that govern magazine writing are allowed to prevail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Thus much is stated in advance, so that no <num value="1">one</num> need be disappointed in the scope and extent of the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The endeavor is to keep <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0001.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> in sight all the time to cling close to his side all the way through &mdash; leaving to others the more comprehensive task of writing a history of his times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>I have no theory of his life to establish or destroy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/><persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0025.0001.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was my warm, devoted friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/><pb id="p.xi" n="xi"/> I always loved him, and I revere his name to this day. My purpose to tell the truth about him need occasion no apprehension; for I know that <quote><name n="God" type="God">God's</name> naked truth,</quote> as <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0025.0001.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Carlyle,nomatch:0"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName> puts it, can never injure the fame of <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n0025.0001.00000.00016" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It will stand that or any other test, and at last untarnished will reach the loftiest niche in American history. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>My long personal association with <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0025.0001.00000.00017" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> gave me special facilities in the direction of obtaining materials for these volumes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Such were our relations during all that portion of his life when he was rising to distinction, that I had only to exercise a moderate vigilance in order to gather and preserve the real data of his personal career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Being strongly drawn to the man, and believing in his destiny, I was not unobservant or careless in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>It thus happened that I became the personal depositary of the larger part of the most valuable <hi rend="italics">Lincolniana</hi> in existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Out of this store the major portion of the materials of the following volumes has been drawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>I take this, my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> general opportunity, to return thanks to the scores of friends in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>, <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, and elsewhere for the information they have so generously furnished and the favors they have so kindly extended me. Their names are too numerous for separate mention, but the recompense of each <num value="1">one</num> will be the consciousness of having contributed a share towards a true history of the <quote><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> American.</quote>

<p>Over <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> ago I began this book; but an active life at the bar has caused me to postpone <pb id="p.xii" n="xii"/> the work of composition, until, now, being somewhat advanced in years, I find myself unable to carry out the undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Within the past <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> I have been assisted in the preparation of the book by <persName n="Weik,Mister,Jesse,W.,," id="n0025.0001.00000.00018" reg="default:Weik,Jesse,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Jesse</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Weik</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Greencastle, Putnam, Indiana" key="tgn,2032031">Greencastle, Ind.</placeName>, whose industry, patience, and literary zeal have not only lessened my labors, but have secured for him the approbation of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0001.00000.00019" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s friends and admirers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/><persName n="Weik,Mister,,,," id="n0025.0001.00000.00020" reg="nearbymention:Weik,Jesse,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Weik</surname></persName> has by his personal investigation greatly enlarged our common treasure of facts and information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>He has for several years been indefatigable in exploring the course of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0001.00000.00021" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>In no particular has he been satisfied with anything taken at <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>He has visited &mdash; as I also did in <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>--<persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0001.00000.00022" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s birthplace in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, his early homes in <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName> and <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, and together, so to speak, he and I have followed our hero continuously and attentively till he left <placeName key="tgn,7014529" n="1.000 14" reg="springfield, sangamon, illinois">Springfield</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> to be inaugurated <rs type="role2">President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>We have retained the original Mss. in all cases, and they have never been out of our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>In relating facts therefore, we refer to them in most cases, rather than to the statements of other biographers. </p>

He was not peculiar or eccentric, and yet a shrewd observer would have seen that he was decidedly unique and original.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>Although imbued with a marked dislike for manual labor, it cannot be truthfully said of him that he was indolent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>From a mental standpoint he was <num value="1">one</num> of the most energetic young men of his day. He dwelt altogether in the land of thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>His deep meditation and abstraction easily induced the belief among his horny &mdash; handed companions that he was lazy.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>His chief delight during the day, if unmolested, was to lie down under the shade of some inviting tree to read and study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>At night, lying on his stomach in front of the open fireplace, with a piece of charcoal he would ciphler on a broad, wooden shovel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>When the latter was covered over on both sides he would take his father's drawing knife or <pb id="p.43" n="43"/> plane and shave it off clean, ready for a fresh supply of inscriptions the next day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>When every bare wooden surface had been filled with his letters and ciphers he would erase them and being anew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>Thus it was always; and the boy whom dull old <persName n="Lincoln,,Thomas,,," id="n0025.0003.00043.00249" reg="default:Lincoln,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and rustic <persName n="Romine,,John,,," id="n0025.0003.00043.00250" reg="default:Romine,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Romine</surname></persName> conceived to be lazy was in reality the most tireless worker in all the region around <placeName key="tgn,2031964" n="1.000 2" reg="gentryville, spencer, indiana">Gentryville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>If in his reading he came across anything that pleased his fancy, he entered it down in a copy-book &mdash; a sort of repository, in which he was wont to store everything worthy of preservation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/><quote>Frequently,</quote> related his stepmother, <quote>he had no paper to write his pieces down on. Then he would put them with chalk on a board or plank, sometimes only making a few signs of what he intended to write.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>He would ask my opinion of what he had read, and often explained things to me in his plain and simple language.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>How he contrived at the age of <num value="14">fourteen</num> to absorb information is thus told by <persName n="Hanks,,John,,," id="n0025.0003.00043.00251" reg="default:Hanks,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Hanks</surname></persName>: <quote>When <persName><foreName>Abe</foreName></persName> and I returned to the house from work he would go to the cupboard, snatch a piece of corn bread, sit down, take a book, cock his legs up as high as his head, and read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>We grubbed, plowed, mowed, and worked together barefooted in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>These <num value="2">two</num> volumes furnished him with the many figures of speech and parables which he used with such happy effect in his later and public utterances. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>Amid such restricted and unromantic environments the boy developed into the man. The intellectual fire burned slowly, but with a steady and intense glow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>Although denied the requisite training of the school-room, he was none the less competent to cope with those who had undergone that discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>No <num value="1">one</num> had a more retentive memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>If he read or heard a good thing it never escaped him. His powers of concentration were intense, and in the ability through analysis to strip bare a proposition he was unexcelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>His thoughtful and investigating mind dug down after ideas, and never stopped till bottom facts were reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>With such a mental equipment the day was destined to come when the world would need the services of his intellect and heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>That he was equal to the great task when the demand came is but another striking proof of the grandeur of his character. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/>His story-telling propensity, and the striking fitness of his yarns &mdash; many of them being of the bar-room <pb id="p.105" n="105"/> order &mdash; in illustrating public questions, as we shall see further along in these chapters, was really <num value="1">one</num> of the secrets of his popularity and strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>The election, as he had predicted, resulted in his defeat &mdash; the only defeat, as he himself afterward stated, that he ever suffered at the hands of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/>But there was little defeat in it after all. Out of the <num value="8">eight</num> unsuccessful candidates he stood <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> from the head of the list, receiving <num value="657">657</num> votes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/><num value="5">Five</num> others received less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1111"/>The most gratifying feature of it all was the hearty support of his neighbors at New Salem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>It may not be amiss to explain the cause of this remarkable endorsement of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0006.00105.00541" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> by the voters in New Salem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>It arose chiefly from his advocacy of the improvement of the <placeName key="tgn,1129619" n="1.000 3" reg="sangamon, illinois, united states">Sangamon river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1115"/>He proposed the digging of a canal a few miles east of the point where the <rs>Sangamon</rs> enters the <placeName reg="Illinois River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7020829">Illinois river</placeName>, thereby giving the former <num value="2">two</num> mouths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1119"/>The unsuccessful result of the election did not dampen his hopes nor sour his ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1120"/>The extensive <pb id="p.106" n="106"/> acquaintance, the practice in public speaking, the confidence gained with the people, together with what was augmented in himself, made a surplus of capital on which he was free to draw and of which he afterwards frequently availed himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1121"/>The election being over, however, he found himself without money, though with a goodly supply of experience, drifting again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1122"/>His political experience had forever weaned him from the dull routine of common labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1123"/>Labor afforded him no time for study and no incentive to profitable reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1124"/>What he seemed to want was some lighter work, employment in a store or tavern where he could meet the village celebrities, exchange views with strangers, discuss politics, horse-races, cock-fights, and narrate to listening loafers his striking and significant stories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1125"/>In the communities where he had lived, the village store-keeper held undisturbed sway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1126"/>He took the only newspaper, owned the only collection of books and half the property in the village; and in general was the social, and oftentimes the political head of the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1582"/>My impression is now that I tacitly admitted it, for it was a season of trouble with me, and I gave but little heed to the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1585"/><num value="1">One</num> circumstance presents itself just now to my mind's eye.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1595"/>In many things we were congenial spirits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1596"/>In politics we saw eye to eye, though since then we differed as widely as the <rs>South</rs> is from the <rs>North</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1670"/>Without apologizing for being egotistical, I shall make the history of so much of my life as has elapsed since I saw you the subject of this letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1671"/>And, by the way, I now discover that, in order to give a full and intelligible account of the things I have done and suffered since I saw you, I shall necessarily have to relate some that happened before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>It was, then, in the autumn of <dateStruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></dateStruct> that a married lady of my acquaintance and who was a great <pb id="p.158" n="158"/> friend of mine, being about to pay a visit to her father and other relatives residing in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, proposed to me that on her return she would bring a sister of hers with her on condition that I would engage to become her brother-in-law with all convenient despatch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1673"/>I, of course, accepted the proposal, for you know I could not have done otherwise, had I really been averse to it; but privately, between you and me I was most confoundedly well pleased with the project.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1674"/>I had seen the said sister some <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> before, thought her intelligent and agreeable, and saw no good objection to plodding life through hand in hand with her. Time passed on, the lady took her journey, and in due time returned, sister in company sure enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/>This astonished me a little; for it appeared to me that her coming so readily showed that she was a trifle too willing; but, on reflection, it occurred to me that she might have been prevailed on by her married sister to come, without anything concerning me ever having been mentioned to her; and so I concluded that, if no other objection presented itself, I would consent to waive this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1676"/>All this occurred to me on hearing of her arrival in the neighborhood; for, be it remembered, I had not yet seen her, except about <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> previous, as above mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1677"/>In a few days we had an interview; and, although I had seen her before, she did not look as my imagination had pictured her. I knew she was over-size, but she now appeared a fair match for <persName n="Falstaff,,,,," id="n0025.0008.00158.00902" reg="mostcommon:Falstaff,nomatch:0"><surname>Falstaff</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1678"/>I knew she was called an <quote>old maid,</quote> and I felt no doubt of the truth of at least half of the appellation; but now, when I beheld her, I could not for my life avoid thinking of my mother; and this, not from withered features, for her skin was too full of fat to permit of its contracting into wrinkles, but from her want of teeth, <pb id="p.159" n="159"/> weather-beaten appearance in general, and from a kind of notion that ran in my head that nothing could have commenced at the size of infancy and reached her present bulk in less than <num value="35">thirty-five</num> or <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure>; and, in short, I was not at all pleased with her. But what could I do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1679"/>I had told her sister I would take her for better or for worse; and I made a point of honor and conscience in all things to stick to my word, especially if others had been induced to act on it, which in this case I had no doubt they had; for I was now fairly convinced that no other man on earth would have her, and hence the conclusion that they were bent on holding me to my bargain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1680"/><quote>Well,</quote> thought I, <quote>I have said it, and, be the consequences what they may, it shall not be my fault if I fail to do it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1681"/>At once I determined to consider her my wife; and, this done, all my powers of discovery were put to work in search of perfections in her which might be fairly set off against her defects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1682"/>I tried to imagine her handsome, which, but for her unfortunate corpulency, was actually true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1683"/>Exclusive of this, no woman that I have ever seen has a finer face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1684"/>I also tried to convince myself that the mind was much more to be valued than the person; and in this she was not inferior, as I could discover, to any with whom I had been acquainted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1685"/>Shortly after this, without coming to any positive understanding with her, I set out for <placeName key="tgn,2030488" n="1.000 5" reg="vandalia, fayette, illinois">Vandalia</placeName>, when and where you <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> saw me. During my stay there I had letters from her which did not change my opinion of either her intellect or intention, but on the contrary confirmed it in both. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1686"/>All this while, although I was fixed, <quote>firm as the surge-repelling rock,</quote> in my resolution, I found I was continually repenting the rashness which had led me to make it. Through life, I have been in no bondage, either real or imaginary, from the thraldom <pb id="p.160" n="160"/> of which I so much desired to be free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1687"/>After my return home, I saw nothing to change my opinions of her in any particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1688"/>She was the same, and so was I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1689"/>I now spent my time in planning how I might get along through life after my contemplated change of circumstances should have taken place, and how I might procrastinate the evil day for a time, which I really dreaded as much, perhaps more, than an Irishman does the halter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1690"/>After all my suffering upon this deeply interesting subject, here I am, wholly, unexpectedly, completely, out of the <quote>scrape</quote> ; and now I want to know if you can guess how I got out of it-out, clear, in every sense of the term; no violation of word, honor, or conscience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1691"/>I don't believe you can guess, and so I might as well tell you at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1692"/>As the lawyer says, it was done in the manner following, to-wit: After I had delayed the matter as long as I thought I could in honor do (which, by the way, had brought me round into the last fall), I concluded I might as well bring it to a consummation without further delay; and so I mustered my resolution, and made the proposal to her direct; but, shocking to relate, she answered, No. At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> I supposed she did it through an affectation of modesty, which I thought but ill became her under the peculiar circumstances of her case; but on my renewal of the charge, I found she repelled it with greater firmness than before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1693"/>I tried it again and again, but with the same success, or rather with the same want of success. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1694"/>I finally was forced to give it up; at which I very unexpectedly found myself mortified almost beyond endurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1695"/>I was mortified, it seemed to me, in a <num value="100">hundred</num> different ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1696"/>My vanity was deeply wounded by the reflection that I had been too stupid to discover her intentions, and at the same time never doubting that I understood them <pb id="p.161" n="161"/> perfectly; and also that she, whom I had taught myself to believe nobody else would have, had actually rejected me with all my fancied greatness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1697"/>And, to cap the whole, I then for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time began to suspect that I was really a little in love with her. But let it all go. I'll try and outlive it. Others have been made fools of by the girls; but this can never with truth be said of me. I most emphatically, in this instance, made a fool of myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1698"/>I have now come to the conclusion never again to think of marrying, and for this reason: I can never be satisfied with any <num value="1">one</num> who would be blockhead enough to have me. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1714"/>At this session of the <name>Legislature</name> he was anything but conspicuous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1716"/>Made a member of the committee on Public Accounts and Expenditures, his name appears so seldom in the reports of the proceedings that we are prone to conclude that he must have contented himself with listening to the flashes of border oratory and absorbing his due proportion of parliamentary law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2299"/>I do fondly hope, however, that you will never again need any comfort from abroad . . . I incline to think it probable that your nerves will occasionally fail you for awhile; but once you get them firmly graded now, that trouble is over forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2730"/>He embraced every opportunity that offered for a speech in public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2731"/>Early in <dateStruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></dateStruct> he entered into the <rs>Washington</rs> movement organized to suppress the evils of intemperance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2734"/>Speaking of certain Christians who objected to the association of drunkards, even with the chance of reforming them, he said: <quote>If they (the <name>Christians</name>) believe, as they profess, that Omnipotence condescended to take on himself the form of sinful man, and as such die an ignominious death, surely they will not refuse submission to the infinitely lesser condescension, for the temporal and perhaps eternal salvation of a large, erring, and unfortunate class of their fellow-creatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2735"/>Nor is the condescension very great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2736"/>In my judgment such of us as have never fallen victims have been spared more from the absence of appetite than from any mental or moral superiority over those who have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2740"/>I was at the door of the church as the people passed out, and heard them discussing the speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2744"/>Many of them were too fresh from the gutter to be taken at once into the society of such people as worshipped at the church where the speech was delivered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2745"/>Neither was there that concert of effort so universal to-day between the churches and temperance societies to rescue the fallen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2747"/>The charge, therefore, that in matters of religion he was a skeptic was not without its supporters, especially where his opponent was himself a preacher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2908"/>As a nation should not, and the <name>Almighty</name> will not, be evaded, so let him attempt no evasion, no equivocation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2912"/>He remained within the official seclusion his position gave him, and declined to answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2913"/>In fact it is doubtless true that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0010.00279.01791" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> anticipated no response, but simply took that means of defining clearly his own position. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2915"/>He doubtless felt he was taking rather advanced and perhaps questionable ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2916"/>And so he was, for very soon after, murmurs of dissatisfaction began to run through the <rs>Whig</rs> ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2917"/>I did not, as some of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0010.00279.01793" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s biographers would have their readers believe, inaugurate this feeling of dissatisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2918"/>On the contrary, as the law partner of the <rs>Congressman</rs>, and as his ardent admirer, I discouraged the defection all I could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2919"/>Still, when I listened to the comments of his friends everywhere after the delivery of his speech, I felt that he had made a mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2920"/>I therefore wrote him to that effect, at the same time giving him my own views, which I knew were in full accord with the views of his Whig constituents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2921"/>My argument in substance was: That the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> and Navy; that as such commander it was his duty, in the absence of Congress, if the country was about to be invaded and armies were organized in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> for that purpose, to go -if necessary &mdash; into the very heart of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> and prevent the invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2922"/>I argued further that it would be a crime in the <rs>Executive</rs> to let the country be invaded in the least degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2923"/>The action of the <rs>President</rs> was a necessity, and under a similar necessity years afterward <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0025.0010.00279.01794" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> himself emancipated the slaves, although he had no special power under the <rs>Constitution</rs> to do so.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2924"/> </p> 
<p>I felt that measures otherwise unconstitutional might become lawful by becoming indispensable.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2925"/>Briefly stated, that was the strain of my argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2926"/>My judgment was formed on the law of nations and of war. If the facts were as I believed them, and my premises correct, then I assumed that the <rs>President</rs>'s acts became lawful by becoming indispensable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3511"/>I was not only associated with <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0025.0012.00336.02122" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> in <placeName key="tgn,7014529" n="1.000 14" reg="springfield, sangamon, illinois">Springfield</placeName>, but was frequently on the circuit with <pb id="p.337" n="337"/> him, but of course not so much as <persName n="Davis,Judge,,,," id="n0025.0012.00337.02123" reg="nearbymention:Davis,David,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, who held the court, and whom <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0012.00337.02124" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> followed around on the circuit for at least <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> out of the year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3512"/>I easily realized that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0012.00337.02125" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was strikingly deficient in the technical rules of the law. Although he was constantly reminding young legal aspirants to study and <quote>work, work,</quote> yet I doubt if he ever read a single elementary law book through in his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3513"/>In fact, I may truthfully say, I never knew him to read through a law book of any kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3514"/>Practically he knew nothing of the rules of evidence, of pleading, or practice, as laid down in the text-books, and seemed to care nothing about them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3515"/>He had a keen sense of justice, and struggled for it, throwing aside forms, methods, and rules, until it appeared pure as a ray of light flashing through a fog-bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3516"/>He was not a general reader in any field of knowledge, but when he had occasion to learn or investigate any subject he was thorough and indefatigable in his search.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3517"/>He not only went to the root of a question, but dug up the root, and separated and analyzed every fibre of it. He was in every respect a case lawyer, never cramming himself on any question till he had a case in which the question was involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3518"/>He thought slowly and acted slowly; he must needs have time to analyze all the facts in a case and wind them into a connected story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3519"/>I have seen him lose cases of the plainest justice, which the most inexperienced member of the bar would have gained without effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3520"/><num value="2">Two</num> things were essential to his success in managing a case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3521"/><num value="1">One</num> was time; <pb id="p.338" n="338"/> the other a feeling of confidence in the justice of the cause he represented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3522"/>He used to say, <quote>If I can free this case from technicalities and get it properly swung to the jury, I'll win it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3523"/>But if either of these essentials were lacking, he was the weakest man at the bar. He was greatest in my opinion as a lawyer in the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3524"/>There the cases were never hurried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3525"/>The attorneys generally prepared their cases in the form of briefs, and the movements of the court and counsel were so slow that no <num value="1">one</num> need be caught by surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3526"/>I was with <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0012.00338.02126" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> once and listened to an oral argument by him in which he rehearsed an extended history of the law. It was a carefully prepared and masterly discourse, but, as I thought, entirely useless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3527"/>After he was through and we were walking home I asked him why he went so far back in the history of the law. I presumed the court knew enough history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3528"/><quote>That's where you're mistaken,</quote> was his instant rejoinder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3529"/><quote>I dared not trust the case on the presumption that the court knows everything &mdash; in fact I argued it on the presumption that the court didn't know anything,</quote> a statement which, when <num value="1">one</num> reviews the decision of our appellate courts, is not so extravagant as <num value="1">one</num> would at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> suppose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3530"/>I used to grow restless at <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0012.00338.02127" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s slow movements and speeches in court.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3531"/><quote>Speak with more vim,</quote> I would frequently say, <quote>and arouse the jury -talk faster and keep them awake</quote> .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3532"/>Opening the blade of the pen-knife he said: <quote>You see, this blade at the point travels rapidly, but only through a small portion of space till it stops; while the long blade of the jack-knife moves no faster but through a much greater space than the small <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3533"/>Just so with the long, labored movements of my mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3534"/>I may not emit ideas as rapidly as others, because I am compelled by nature to speak slowly, but when I do throw off a thought it seems to me, though it comes with some effort, it has force enough to cut its own way and travel a greater distance.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3535"/>This was said to me when we were alone in our office simply for illustration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3536"/>It was not said boastingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4269"/>When standing erect he was <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> <measure n="4inches" type="distance">four inches</measure> high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4270"/>He was lean in flesh and ungainly in figure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4271"/>Aside from the sad, pained look due to habitual melancholy, his face had no characteristic or fixed expression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4272"/>He was thin through the chest, and hence slightly stoop-shouldered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4273"/>When he arose to address courts, juries, or crowds of people, his body inclined forward to a <pb id="p.406" n="406"/> slight degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4274"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> he was very awkward, and it seemed a real labor to adjust himself to his surroundings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4275"/>He struggled for a time under a feeling of apparent diffidence and sensitiveness, and these only added to his awkwardness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4276"/>I have often seen and sympathized with <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0025.0014.00406.02745" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> during these moments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4277"/>When he began speaking, his voice was shrill, piping, and unpleasant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4278"/>His manner, his attitude, his dark, yellow face, wrinkled and dry, his oddity of pose, his diffident movementseverything seemed to be against him, but only for a short time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4279"/>After having arisen, he generally placed his hands behind him, the back of his left hand in the palm of his right, the thumb and fingers of his right hand clasped around the left arm at the wrist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4280"/>For a few moments he played the combination of awkwardness, sensitiveness, and diffidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4281"/>As he proceeded he became somewhat animated, and to keep in harmony with his growing warmth his hands relaxed their grasp and fell to his side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4282"/>Presently he clasped them in front of him, interlocking his fingers, <num value="1">one</num> thumb meanwhile chasing another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4283"/>His speech now requiring more emphatic utterance, his fingers unlocked and his hands fell apart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4284"/>His left arm was thrown behind, the back of his hand resting against his body, his right hand seeking his side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4285"/>By this time he had gained sufficient composure, and his real speech began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4286"/>He did not gesticulate as much with his hands as with his head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4287"/>He used the latter frequently, throwing it with vim this way and that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4288"/>This movement was a significant <num value="1">one</num> when he <pb id="p.407" n="407"/> sought to enforce his statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4289"/>It sometimes came with a quick jerk, as if throwing off electric sparks into combustible material.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4290"/>He never sawed the air nor rent space into tatters and rags as some orators do. He never acted for stage effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4291"/>He was cool, considerate, reflective &mdash; in time self-possessed and self-reliant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4292"/>His style was clear, terse, and compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4293"/>In argument he was logical, demonstrative, and fair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4294"/>He was careless of his dress, and his clothes, instead of fitting neatly as did the garments of <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0025.0014.00407.02746" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:6"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> on the latter's well-rounded form, hung loosely on his giant frame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4295"/>As he moved along in his speech he became freer and less uneasy in his movements; to that extent he was graceful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4296"/>He had a perfect naturalness, a strong individuality; and to that extent he was dignified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4297"/>He despised glitter, show, set forms, and shams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4298"/>He spoke with effectiveness and to move the judgment as well as the emotions of men. There was a world of meaning and emphasis in the long, bony finger of his right hand as he dotted the ideas on the minds of his hearers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4299"/>Sometimes, to express joy or pleasure, he would raise both hands at an angle of about <num value="50">fifty</num> degrees, the palms upwards, as if desirous of embracing the spirit of that which he loved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4300"/>If the sentiment was <num value="1">one</num> of detestationdenunciation of slavery, for example &mdash; both arms, thrown upward and fists clenched, swept through the air, and he expressed an execration that was truly sublime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4301"/>This was <num value="1">one</num> of his most effective gestures, and signified most vividly a fixed determination to drag down the object of his hatred and trample it <pb id="p.408" n="408"/> in the dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4302"/>He always stood squarely on his feet, toe even with toe; that is, he never put <num value="1">one</num> foot before the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4303"/>He neither touched nor leaned on anything for support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4304"/>He made but few changes in his positions and attitudes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4305"/>He never ranted, never walked backward and forward on the platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4306"/>To ease his arms he frequently caught hold, with his left hand, of the lapel of his coat, keeping his thumb upright and leaving his right hand free to gesticulate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4308"/>As he proceeded with his speech the exercise of his vocal organs altered somewhat the tone of his voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4309"/>It lost in a measure its former acute and shrilling pitch, and mellowed into a more harmonious and pleasant sound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4310"/>His form expanded, and, notwithstanding the sunken breast, he rose up a splendid and imposing figure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4624"/>It is possible, however, that this may be the proper solution of this conflict of opinions; or it may be that, with no intention on the part of any <num value="1">one</num> to mislead the public mind, those who have represented him as believing in the popular theological views of the times may have misapprehended him, as experience shows to be quite common where no special effort has been made to attain critical accuracy on a subject of this nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4625"/>This is the more probable from the well-known fact, that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0025.0015.00443.02903" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> seldom communicated to any <num value="1">one</num> his views on this subject; but be this as it may, I have no hesitation whatever in saying that whilst he held many opinions in common with the great mass of <name>Christian</name> believers, he did not believe in what are regarded as the orthodox or evangelical views of Christianity. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4627"/>I should say that his expressed views on these and kindred topics were such as, in the estimation of most believers, would place him outside the <rs>Christian</rs> pale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4628"/>Yet, to my mind, such was not the <pb id="p.444" n="444"/> true position, since his principles and practices and the spirit of his whole life were of the very kind we universally agree to call <persName n="Christian,,,,," id="n0025.0015.00444.02904" reg="mostcommon:Christian,nomatch:0"><surname>Christian</surname></persName>; and I think this conclusion is in no wise affected by the circumstance that he never attached himself to any religious society whatever. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4644"/>The world has always insisted on making an orthodox <name>Christian</name> of him, and to analyze his sayings or sound his beliefs is but to break the idol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4646"/>If at any time in his life he was skeptical of the divine origin of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> he ought not for that reason to be condemned; for he accepted the practical precepts of that great book as binding alike upon his head and his conscience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4837"/>A few days later he wrote his official letter of acceptance, in which he warmly endorsed the resolutions of the convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4838"/>His actions and utterances so far had begun to dissipate the erroneous notion prevalent in some of the more remote Eastern States, that he was more of a backwoods boor than a gentleman; but with the arrival of the campaign in dead earnest, people paid less attention to the <pb id="p.464" n="464"/> candidates and more to the great issues at stake, Briefly stated, the <rs>Republican</rs> platform was a declaration that <quote>the new dogma, that the <rs>Constitution</rs> carries slavery into all the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, is a dangerous political heresy, revolutionary in tendency and subversive of the peace and harmony of the country; that the normal condition of all the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> is that of freedom; that neither Congress, the <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">territorial legislature</orgName>, nor any individual can give legal existence to slavery in any territory; that the opening of the slave trade would be a crime against humanity.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4839"/>Resolutions favoring a homestead law, river and harbor improvements, and the <orgName n="Pacific Railroad" type="railroad">Pacific railroad</orgName> were also included in the platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4842"/>There was not only the customary exultation and enthusiasm over candidates, but there was patient listening and hard thinking among the masses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4843"/>The slavery question, it was felt, must soon be decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4844"/>Threats of disunion were the texts of many a campaign speech in the <rs>South</rs>: in fact, as has since been shown, a deep laid conspiracy to overthrow the <rs>Union</rs> was then forming, and was only awaiting the election of a Republican <rs type="role2">President</rs> to show its hideous head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4847"/>The Republicans, cheered over the prospect, had joined hands with the <name>Abolitionists</name>, and both were marching to victory under the inspiration of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0016.00465.03028" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s sentiment, that <quote>the further spread of slavery should be arrested, and it should be placed where the public mind shall rest in the belief of its ultimate extinction.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5144"/>On the present occasion the whiskers were reinforced by brand-new clothes from top to toe; black dress-coat, instead of the usual frock, black cloth or satin vest, black pantaloons, and a glossy hat evidently just out of the box.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5441"/>I give this as his own illustration of the character of his mental faculties; it is as good as any I have seen from anyone. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5442"/>The beauty of his character was its entire simplicity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5443"/>He had no affectation in anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5444"/>True to nature, true to himself, he was true to everybody and everything around him; When he was ignorant on any subject, no matter how simple it might make him appear, he was always willing to acknowledge it. His whole aim in life was to be true to himself and being true to himself he could be false to no <num value="1">one</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5445"/>He had no vices, even as a young man. Intense thought with him was the rule and not, as with most of us, the exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5446"/>He often said that he could think better after breakfast, and better walking than sitting, lying, or standing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5447"/>His world-wide reputation for telling anecdotes and telling them so well was in my judgment necessary to his very <pb id="p.523" n="523"/> existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5448"/>Most men who have been great students, such as he was, in their hours of idleness have taken to the bottle, to cards or dice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5449"/>He had no fondness for any of these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5450"/>Hence he sought relaxation in anecdotes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5451"/>So far as I now remember of his study for composition, it was to make short sentences and a compact style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5452"/>Illustrative of this it might be well to state that he was a great admirer of the style of <persName n="Calhoun,,John,C.,," id="n0025.0019.00523.03415" reg="default:Calhoun,John,C.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5458"/>His familiar conversations were like his speeches and letters in this: that while no set speech of his (save the <rs>Gettysburg</rs> address) will be considered as entirely artistic and complete, yet, when the gems of American literature come to be selected, as many will be culled from <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0019.00523.03421" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Thomas,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s speeches as from any American orator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5461"/>My own opinion of the history of the <rs>Emancipation Proclamation</rs> is that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0025.0019.00524.03423" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> foresaw the necessity for it long before he issued it. He was anxious to avoid it, and came to it only when he saw that the measure would subtract from its labor, and add to our army quite a number of good fighting men. I have heard of the charge of duplicity against him by certain Western members of congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5462"/>I never believed the charge, because he has told me from his own lips that the charge was false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5464"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> I was opposed to the <name>Proclamation</name>, and so told him. I remember well our conversation on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5465"/>He seemed to treat it as certain that I would recognize the wisdom of the act when I should see the harvest of good which we would ere long glean from it. In that conversation he alluded to an incident in his life, long passed, when he was so much depressed that he almost contemplated suicide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5466"/>At the time of his deep depression he said to me that he had <quote>done nothing to make any human being remember that he had lived,</quote> and that to connect his name with the events transpiring in his day and generation, and so impress himself upon them as to link his name with something that would redound to the <pb id="p.525" n="525"/> interest of his fellow man, was what he desired to live for.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5468"/>The last interview but <num value="1">one</num> I had with him was about <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> prior to his last inauguration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5469"/>Congress was drawing to a close; it had been an important session; much attention had to be given to the important bills he was signing; a great war was upon him and the country; visitors were coming and going to the <rs>President</rs> with their varying complaints and grievances from morning till night with almost as much regularity as the ebb and flow of the tide; and he was worn down in health and spirits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5470"/>On this occasion I was sent for, to come and see him. Instructions were given that when I came I should be admitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5471"/>When I entered his office it was quite full, and many more &mdash; among them not a few <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> and members of Congress -still waiting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5472"/>As soon as I was fairly inside, the <rs>President</rs> remarked that he desired to see me as soon as he was through giving audiences, and that if I had nothing to do I could take the papers and amuse myself in that or any other way I saw fit till he was ready.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5473"/>In the room, when I entered, I observed sitting near the fireplace, dressed in humble attire, <num value="2">two</num> ladies modestly waiting their turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5477"/>They both commenced to speak at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5478"/>From what they said he soon learned that <num value="1">one</num> was the wife and the other the mother of <num value="2">two</num> men imprisoned for resisting the draft in <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710"><rs type="direction">western</rs> Pennsylvania</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5482"/><quote>Oh,</quote> said he, <quote>I understand your cases.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5484"/>The General soon came with the list.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5485"/>He enquired if there was any difference in the charges or degrees of guilt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5509"/>There is so much of what I know to be true in it, and it is so graphically told, that although there may be some repetition of what has already been touched upon in the preceding chapters, still I believe that the portrait of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0019.00528.03430" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Thomas,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> will be made all the more lifelike by inserting the letter without abridgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5510"/>Dear Sir: I received your letter today, asking me to write you <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5511"/>Fearing if I delay, you will not get it in time, I will give you such hasty thoughts as may occur to me to-night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5512"/>I have mislaid your <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> lecture, so that I have not read it at all, and have not read your <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num> since about the time it was published.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5513"/>What I shall say, therefore, will be based upon my own ideas rather than a review of the lecture. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5514"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0019.00528.03432" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Thomas,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s whole life was a calculation of the law of forces and ultimate results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5515"/>The whole world to him was a question of cause and effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5516"/>He believed the results to which certain causes tended; he did not believe that those results could be materially hastened or impeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5517"/>His whole political history, especially since the agitation of the slavery question, has been based upon this theory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5518"/>He believed from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, I think, that the agitation of slavery would produce its overthrow, and he acted upon the result as though it was present from the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5519"/>His tactics were to get himself in <pb id="p.529" n="529"/> the right place and remain there still, until events would find him in that place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5520"/>This course of action led him to say and do things which could not be understood when considered in reference to the immediate surroundings in which they were done or said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5521"/>You will remember, in his campaign against <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0025.0019.00529.03433" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:6"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></dateStruct>, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="10">ten</num> lines of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> speech he made defeated him. The sentiment of the <quote>house divided against itself</quote> seemed wholly inappropriate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5522"/>It was a speech made at the commencement of a campaign, and apparently made for the campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5523"/>Viewing it in this light alone, nothing could have been more unfortunate or inappropriate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5524"/>It was saying just the wrong thing; yet he saw it was an abstract truth, and standing by the speech would ultimately find him in the right place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5525"/>I was inclined at the time to believe these words were hastily and inconsiderately uttered, but subsequent facts have convinced me they were deliberate and had been matured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5526"/><persName n="Dickey,Judge,T.,L.,," id="n0025.0019.00529.03434" reg="expanded:Dickey,T.,Lyle,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Dickey</surname></persName> says, that at <placeName reg="Bloomington, McLean, Illinois" key="tgn,2026630">Bloomington</placeName>, at the <orgName n="Republican Convention 1" type="convention">first Republican Convention</orgName> in <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>, he uttered the same sentences in a speech delivered there, and that after the meeting was over, he (<persName n="Dickey,,,,," id="n0025.0019.00529.03435" reg="nearbymention:Dickey,T.,L.,,"><surname>Dickey</surname></persName>) called his attention to these remarks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5527"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0019.00529.03436" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Thomas,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> justified himself in making then by stating they were true; but finally, at <persName n="Dickey,,,,," id="n0025.0019.00529.03437" reg="nearbymention:Dickey,T.,L.,,"><surname>Dickey</surname></persName>'s urgent request, he promised that for his sake, or upon his advice, he would not repeat them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5528"/>In the summer of <dateStruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></dateStruct>, when he was dining with a party of his intimate friends at <placeName reg="Bloomington, McLean, Illinois" key="tgn,2026630">Bloomington</placeName>, the subject of his <placeName key="tgn,7014529" n="1.000 14" reg="springfield, sangamon, illinois">Springfield</placeName> speech was discussed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5529"/>We all insisted it was a great mistake, but he justified himself, and finally said, <quote>Well, gentlemen, you may think that speech was a mistake, but I never have believed it was, and you will see the day when you will consider it was the wisest thing I ever said.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5530"/></p> 
<p>He never believed in political combinations, <pb id="p.530" n="530"/> and consequently, whether an individual man or class of men supported or opposed him, never made any difference in his feelings, or his opinions of his own success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5531"/>If he was elected, he seemed to believe that no person or class of persons could ever have defeated him, and if defeated, he believed nothing could ever have elected him. Hence, when he was a candidate, he never wanted anything done for him in the line of political combination or management.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5532"/>He seemed to want to let the whole subject alone, and for everybody else to do the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5533"/>I remember, after the <orgName n="Chicago Convention" type="convention">Chicago Convention</orgName>, when a great portion of the <rs>East</rs> were known to be dissatisfied at his nomination, when fierce conflicts were going on in New York and <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, and when great exertions seemed requisite to harmonize and mould in concert the action of our friends, <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0019.00530.03438" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Thomas,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> always seemed to oppose all efforts made in the direction of uniting the party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5534"/>I arranged with <persName n="Weed,Mister,Thurlow,,," id="n0025.0019.00530.03439" reg="default:Weed,Thurlow,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Thurlow</foreName> <surname>Weed</surname></persName> after the <orgName n="Chicago Convention" type="convention">Chicago Convention</orgName> to meet him at <placeName key="tgn,7014529" n="1.000 14" reg="springfield, sangamon, illinois">Springfield</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5535"/>I was present at the interview, but <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0019.00530.03440" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Thomas,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> said nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5536"/>It was proposed that <persName n="Davis,Judge,,,," id="n0025.0019.00530.03441" reg="nearbymention:Davis,David,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> should go to New York and <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> to survey the field and see what was necessary to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5537"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0019.00530.03442" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Thomas,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> consented, but it was always my opinion that he consented reluctantly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5538"/>He saw that the pressure of a campaign was the external force coercing the party into unity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5539"/>If it failed to produce that result, he believed any individual effort would also fail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5540"/>If the desired result followed, he considered it attributable to the great cause, and not aided by the lesser ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5541"/>He sat down in his chair in <placeName key="tgn,7014529" n="1.000 14" reg="springfield, sangamon, illinois">Springfield</placeName> and made himself the <name>Mecca</name> to which all politicians made pilgrimages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5542"/>He told them all a story, said nothing, and sent them away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5543"/>All his efforts to procure a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> nomination were in the same direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5544"/>I <pb id="p.531" n="531"/> <pb id="p.532" n="532"/> believe he earnestly desired that nomination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5545"/>He was much more eager for it than he was for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and yet from the beginning he discouraged all efforts on the part of his friends to obtain it. From the middle of his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> term all his adversaries were busily at work for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5546"/><persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n0025.0019.00532.03443" reg="mostcommon:Chase,Salmon,P.,,:1"><surname>Chase</surname></persName> had <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> secret societies and an immense patronage extending all over the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5547"/><persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n0025.0019.00532.03444" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName> was constantly at work, yet <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0019.00532.03445" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Thomas,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> would never do anything either to hinder them or to help himself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5548"/>He was considered too conservative, and his adversaries were trying to outstrip him in satisfying the radical element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5549"/>I had a conversation with him upon this subject in <dateStruct value="1863-10-"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, and tried to induce him to recommend in his annual message a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5550"/>I told him I was not very radical, but I believed the result of the war would be the extermination of slavery; that Congress would pass the amendment making the slave free, and that it was proper at that time to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5551"/>I told him also, if he took that stand, it was an outside position, and no <num value="1">one</num> could maintain himself upon any measure more radical, and if he failed to take the position, his rivals would.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5552"/>Turning to me suddenly he said, <quote>Is not the question of emancipation doing well enough now?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5553"/>I replied it was. <quote>Well</quote> , said he, <quote>I have never done an official act with a view to promote my own personal aggrandizement, and I don't like to begin now. I can see that emancipation is coming; whoever can wait for it will see it; whoever stands in its way will be run over by it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5554"/></p> 
<p>His rivals were using money profusely; journals and influences were being subsidized against him. I accidentally learned that a Washington newspaper, through a purchase of the establishment, was to be turned against him, and consulted him about taking steps to prevent it. The only thing I could get him to say was that he would regret to see the paper turned against him. Whatever was done had to be done without his knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5555"/><persName n="Bennett,Mister,,,," id="n0025.0019.00532.03446" reg="mostcommon:Bennett,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bennett</surname></persName> of the <rs>Herald</rs>, with his paper, you know, is a power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5556"/>The old gentleman wanted to be noticed by <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0019.00532.03447" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Thomas,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, and he wanted to support him. A friend of his, who was certainly in his secrets, came to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and intimated if <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0019.00532.03448" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Thomas,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> would invite <persName n="Bennett,,,,," id="n0025.0019.00532.03449" reg="mostcommon:Bennett,nomatch:0"><surname>Bennett</surname></persName> to come over and chat with him, his paper would be all right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5559"/>I have never invited <persName n="Bryant,Mister,,,," id="n0025.0019.00532.03453" reg="mostcommon:Bryant,John,H.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bryant</surname></persName> or <persName n="Greeley,Mister,,,," id="n0025.0019.00532.03454" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> here; I shall not, therefore, especially invite <persName n="Bennett,Mister,,,," id="n0025.0019.00532.03455" reg="mostcommon:Bennett,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bennett</surname></persName>.</quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5561"/>Notwithstanding his entire inaction, he never for a moment doubted his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> nomination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5562"/><num value="1">One</num> time in his room discussing with him who his real friends were, he told me, if I would not show it, he would make a list of how the <name>Senate</name> stood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5563"/>When he got through, I pointed out some <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num>, and I told him I knew he was mistaken about them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5564"/>Said he, <quote>You may think so, but you keep that until the convention and tell me then whether I was right.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5565"/>He was right to a man. He kept a kind of account book of how things were progressing, for <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure>, and whenever I would get nervous and think things were going wrong, he would get out his estimates and show how everything on the great scale of action, such as the resolutions of legislatures, the instructions of delegates, and things of that character, were going exactly as he expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5566"/>These facts, with many others of a kindred nature, have convinced me that he managed <pb id="p.533" n="533"/> his politics upon a plan entirely different from any other man the country has ever produced. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5567"/>He managed his campaigns by ignoring men and by ignoring all small causes, but by closely calculating the tendencies of events and the great forces which were producing logical results. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5568"/>In his conduct of the war he acted upon the theory that but <num value="1">one</num> thing was necessary, and that was a united <name>North</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5569"/>He had all shades of sentiments and opinions to deal with, and the consideration was always presented to his mind, how can I hold these discordant elements together? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5570"/>It was here that he located his own greatness as a President.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5571"/><num value="1">One</num> time, about the middle of the war, I left his house about <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time> at night, at the <rs>Soldier</rs>'s Home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5572"/>We had been discussing the discords in the country, and particularly the <name>States</name> of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5573"/>As we separated at the door he said, <quote>I may not have made as great a President as, some other men, but I believe I have kept these discordant elements together as well as anyone could.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5574"/>Hence, in dealing with men he was a trimmer, and such a trimmer the world has never seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5575"/><placeName reg="Halifax, Halifax, North Carolina" key="tgn,2074968">Halifax</placeName>, who was great in his day as a trimmer, would blush by the side of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0019.00533.03458" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Thomas,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>; yet <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0019.00533.03459" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Thomas,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> never trimmed in principles, it was only in his conduct with men. He used the patronage of his office to feed the hunger of these various factions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5576"/><persName n="Weed,,,,," id="n0025.0019.00533.03460" reg="nearbymention:Weed,Thurlow,,,"><surname>Weed</surname></persName> always declared that he kept a regular account-book of his appointments in New York, dividing his various favors so as to give each faction more than it could get from any other source, yet never enough to satisfy its appetite. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5577"/>They all had access to him, they all received favors from him, and they all complained of ill treatment; but while unsatisfied, they all had <quote>large expectations,</quote> and saw in him the chance of obtaining more than from anyone else whom they could <pb id="p.534" n="534"/> be sure of getting in his place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5578"/>He used every force to the best possible advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5579"/>He never wasted anything, and would always give more to his enemies than he would to his friends; and the reason was, because he never had anything to spare, and in the close calculation of attaching the factions to him, he counted upon the abstract affection of his friends as an element to be offset against some gift with which he must appease his enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5580"/>Hence, there was always some truth in the charge of his friends that he failed to reciprocate their devotion with his favors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5581"/>The reason was, that he had only just so much to give away--<quote>He always had more horses than oats.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5582"/></p> 
<p>An adhesion of all forces was indispensable to his success and the success of the country; hence he husbanded his means with the greatest nicety of calculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5583"/>Adhesion was what he wanted; if he got it gratuitously he never wasted his substance paying for it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5584"/>His love of the ludicrous was not the least peculiar of his characteristics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5585"/>His love of fun made him overlook everything else but the point of the joke sought after.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5586"/>If he told a good story that was refined and had a sharp point, he did not like it any the better because it was refined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5587"/>If it was outrageously vulgar, he never seemed to see that part of it, if it had the sharp ring of wit; nothing ever reached him but the wit. Almost any man that will tell a very vulgar story, has, in a degree, a vulgar mind; but it was not so with him; with all his purity of character and exalted morality and sensibility, which no man can doubt, when hunting for wit he had no ability to discriminate between the vulgar and the refined substances from which he extracted it. It was the wit he was after, the pure jewel, and he would pick it up out of the mud or dirt just as readily as he would from a <rs n="parlor table" type="product">parlor table</rs>. <pb id="p.535" n="535"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5588"/>He had great kindness of heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5589"/>His mind was full of tender sensibilities, and he was extremely humane, yet while these attributes were fully developed in his character, and, unless intercepted by his judgment, controlled him, they never did control him contrary to his judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5590"/>He would strain, a point to be kind, but he never strained it to breaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5591"/>Most men of much kindly feeling are controlled by this sentiment against their judgment, or rather that sentiment beclouds their judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5592"/>It was never so with him; he would be just as kind and generous as his judgment would let him be &mdash; no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5593"/>If he ever deviated from this rule, it was to save life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5594"/>He would sometimes, I think, do things he knew to be impolitic and wrong to save some poor fellow's neck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5595"/>I remember <num value="1">one</num> day being in his room when he was sitting at his table with a large pile of papers before him, and after a pleasant talk he turned quite abruptly and said, <quote>Get out of the way, <persName n="Swett,,,,," id="n0025.0019.00535.03461" reg="nearbymention:Swett,Leonard,,,"><surname>Swett</surname></persName>; to-morrow is butcher-day, and I must go through these papers and see if I cannot find some excuse to let these poor fellows off.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5596"/>The pile of papers he had were the records of courts martial of men who on the following day were to be shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5597"/>He was not examining the records to see whether the evidence sustained the findings; he was purposely in search of occasions to evade the law, in favor of life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5598"/>Some of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0019.00535.03462" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Thomas,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s friends have insisted that he lacked the strong attributes of personal affection which he ought to have exhibited; but I think this is a mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5599"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0025.0019.00535.03463" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Thomas,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had too much justice to run a great government for a few favors; and the complaints against him in this regard, when properly digested, seem to amount to this and no more, that he would not abuse the privileges of his situation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5600"/>He was certainly a very poor hater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5601"/>He never <pb id="p.536" n="536"/> judged men by his like or dislike for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5602"/>If any given act was to be performed, he could understand that his enemy could do it just as well as anyone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5603"/>If a man had maligned him or been guilty of personal ill-treatment, and was the fittest man for the place, he would give him that place just as soon as he would give it to a friend. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5604"/>I do not think he ever removed a man because he was his enemy or because he disliked him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5610"/><persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0025.0019.00536.03467" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had this power greater than any man I have ever known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5611"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impression he generally conveyed was, that he had stated the case of his adversary better and more forcibly than his opponent could state it himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5612"/>He then answered that statement of facts fairly and fully, never passing by or skipping over a bad point. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5613"/>When this was done he presented his own case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5614"/>There was feeling, when he argued a case, in the mind of any man who listened to it, that nothing had been passed over; yet if he could not answer the objections he argued, in his own mind, and himself arrive at the conclusion to which he was leading others, he had very little power of argumentation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5615"/>The force of his logic was in conveying to the minds of others the same clear and thorough analysis he had in his own, and if his own mind <pb id="p.537" n="537"/> failed to be satisfied, he had little power to satisfy anybody else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5616"/>He never made a sophistical argument in his life, and never could make <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5617"/>I think he was of less real aid in trying a thoroughly bad case than any man I was ever associated with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5618"/>If he could not grasp the whole case and believe in it, he was never inclined to touch it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5619"/>From the commencement of his life to its close, I have sometimes doubted whether he ever asked anybody's advice about anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5620"/>He would listen to everybody; he would hear everybody; but he rarely, if ever, asked for opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5621"/>I never knew him in trying a case to ask the advice of any lawyer he was associated with. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5622"/>As a politician and as <rs type="role2">President</rs>, he arrived at all his conclusions from his own reflections, and when his opinion was once formed, he never doubted but what it was right. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5623"/><num value="1">One</num> great public mistake of his character, as generally received and acquiesced in, is that he is considered by the people of this country as a frank, guileless, and unsophisticated man. There never was a greater mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5624"/>Beneath a smooth surface of candor and apparent declaration of all his thoughts and feelings, he exercised the most exalted tact and the wisest discrimination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5625"/>He handled and moved men remotely as we do pieces upon a chess-board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5626"/>He retained through life all the friends he ever had, and he made the wrath of his enemies to praise him. This was not by cunning or intrigue, in the low acceptation of the term, but by far-seeing reason and discernment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5627"/>He always told enough only of his plans and purposes to induce the belief that he had communicated all, yet he reserved enough to have communicated nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5628"/>He told all that was unimportant with a gushing frankness, yet no man ever kept his real <pb id="p.538" n="538"/> purposes closer, or penetrated the future further with his deep designs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5629"/>You ask me whether he changed his religious opinions towards the close of his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5630"/>I think not. As he became involved in matters of the greatest importance, full of great responsibility and great doubt, a feeling of religious reverence, a belief in <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and his justice and overruling power increased with him. He was always full of natural religion; he believed in <name n="God" type="God">God</name> as much as the most approved Church member, yet he judged of Him by the same system of generalization as he judged everything else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5631"/>He had very little faith in ceremonials or forms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5632"/>In fact he cared nothing for the form of anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5633"/>But his heart was full of natural and cultivated religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5634"/>He believed in the great laws of truth, and the rigid discharge of duty, his accountability to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, the ultimate triumph of the right and the overthrow of wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5635"/>If his religion were to be judged by the lines and rules of Church creeds he would fall far short of the standard; but if by the higher rule of purity of conduct, of honesty of motive, of unyielding fidelity to the right, and acknowledging <name n="God" type="God">God</name> as the supreme ruler, then he filled all the requirements of true devotion, and his whole life was a life of love to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and love of his neighbor as of himself. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5752"/><hi rend="italics">My Dear Sir</hi>: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5753"/>Your letter inviting me to attend a mass meeting of <orgName n="Unconditional Union" type="union">Unconditional Union</orgName> men, to be held at the <rs>Capitol</rs> of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, on the <dateStruct value="-09-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> day of <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>, has been received. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5754"/>It would be very agreeable to me to thus meet my old friends at my own home; but I cannot, just now, be absent from here so long as a visit there would require. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5755"/>The meeting is to be of all those who maintain unconditional devotion to the <rs>Union</rs>; and I am sure my old political friends will thank me for tendering, as I do, the nation's gratitude to those other noble men, whom no partisan malice, or partisan's hope, can make false to the nation's life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5756"/>There are those who are dissatisfied with me. To such I would say: You desire peace; and you blame me that we do not have it. But how can we attain it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5757"/>There are but <num value="3">three</num> conceivable ways. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5758"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, to suppress the rebellion by force of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5759"/>This I am trying to do. Are you for it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5760"/>If <pb id="p.551" n="551"/> you are, so far we are agreed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5761"/>If you are not for it, a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> way is, to give up the <rs>Union</rs>, I am against this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5762"/>Are you for it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5763"/>If you are, you should say so plainly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5764"/>If you are not for <hi rend="italics">force</hi>, nor yet for dissolution, there only remains some imaginable <hi rend="italics">compromise</hi>. I do not believe any compromise, embracing the maintenance of the <rs>Union</rs>, is now possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5765"/>All I learn leads to a directly opposite belief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5766"/>The strength of the rebellion is its military -its army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5767"/>That army dominates all the country and all the people within its range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5768"/>Any offer of terms made by any man or men within that range in opposition to that army is simply nothing for the present, because such man or men have no power whatever to enforce their side of a compromise, if <num value="1">one</num> were made with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5769"/>To illustrate: suppose refugees from the <rs>South</rs>, and peace men of the <rs>North</rs>, get together in convention and frame and proclaim a compromise embracing a restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>; in what way can that compromise be used to keep <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0025.0020.00551.03549" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> out of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5770"/><orgName n="army"><persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n0025.0020.00551.03550" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> can keep <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0025.0020.00551.03551" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> out of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, and I think can ultimately drive it out of existence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5771"/>But no paper compromise, to which the controllers of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0025.0020.00551.03552" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> are not agreed, can at all affect that army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5772"/>In an effort at such compromise we should waste time, which the enemy would improve to our disadvantage; and that would be all. A compromise, to be effective, must be made either with those who control the rebel army, or with the people <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> liberated from the domination of that army by the success of our own army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5773"/>Now allow me to assure you that no word or intimation from that rebel army or from any of the men controlling it, in relation to any peace compromise, has ever come to my knowledge or belief. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5774"/>All changes and insinuations to the contrary <pb id="p.552" n="552"/> are deceptive and groundless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5775"/>And I promise you that, if any such proposition shall hereafter come, it shall not be rejected and kept a secret from you. I freely acknowledge myself the servant of the people, according to the bond of service &mdash; the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">United States Constitution</rs>, and that, as such, I am responsible to them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5776"/>But to be plain, you are dissatisfied with me about the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5777"/>Quite likely there is a difference of opinion between you and myself upon that subject. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5778"/>I certainly wish that all men could be free, while I suppose you do not. Yet I have neither adopted nor proposed any measure which is not consistent with even your view, provided you are for the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5779"/>I suggested compensated emancipation; to which you replied you wished not to be taxed to buy negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5780"/>But I had not asked you to be taxed to buy negroes, except in such way as to save you from greater taxation to save the <rs>Union</rs> exclusively by other means. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5781"/>You dislike the <rs>Emancipation Proclamation</rs>, and, perhaps, would have it retracted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5782"/>You say it is unconstitutional &mdash; I think differently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5783"/>I think the constitution invests its <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-chief</rs> with the law of war in time of war, The most that can be said, if so much, is that slaves are property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5784"/>Is there &mdash; has there ever been &mdash; any question that by the law of war, property, both of enemies and friends, may be taken when needed? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5785"/>And is it not needed wherever taking it helps us or hurts the enemy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5786"/>Armies the world over destroy enemies' property when they cannot use it; and even destroy their own to keep it from the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5787"/>Civilized belligerents do all in their power to help themselves or hurt the enemy, except a few things regarded as barbarous or cruel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5788"/>Among the exceptions are the massacre of vanquished foes and non-combatants, male and female.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5789"/><pb id="p.553" n="553"/> </p> 
<p>But the proclamation, as law, either is valid or is not valid. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5790"/>If it is not valid, it needs no retraction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5791"/>If it is valid, it cannot be retraced any more than the dead can be brought to life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5792"/>Some of you profess to think its retraction would operate favorably for the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5793"/>Why <hi rend="italics">better</hi> after the retraction than <hi rend="italics">before</hi> the issue? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5794"/>There was more than a year and <num value="0.5">a half</num> of trial to suppress the rebellion before the proclamation issued, the last <measure n="100days" type="date">one hundred days</measure> of which passed under an explicit notice that it was coming, unless averted by those in revolt returning to their allegiance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5795"/>The war has certainly progressed as favorably for us since the issue of the proclamation as before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5796"/>I know as fully as <num value="1">one</num> can know the opinion of others that some of the commanders of our armies in the field who have given us our most important successes believe the emancipation policy and the use of the colored troops constituted the heaviest blow yet dealt to the <rs>Rebellion</rs>, and that at least <num value="1">one</num> of these important successes could not have been achieved when it was but for the aid of black soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5797"/>Among the commanders holding these views are some who have never had any affinity with what is called abolitionism or with <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> policies, but who held them purely as military opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5798"/>I submit these opinions as being entitled to some weight against the objections often urged that emancipation and arming the blacks are unwise as military measures, and were not adopted as such in good faith.<note anchored="yes" id="n.553.1">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5799"/> 
<p>See note <ref n="page 540">p. 540</ref>.</p></note> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5800"/>You say you will not fight to free negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5801"/>Some of them seem willing to fight for you; but no matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5802"/><pb id="p.554" n="554"/> </p> 
<p>Fight you, then, exclusively to save the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5803"/>I issued the proclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5804"/>Whenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the <rs>Union</rs>, if I shall urge you to continue fighting, it will be an apt time then for you to declare you will not fight to free negroes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5805"/>I thought that in your struggle for the <rs>Union</rs>, to whatever extent the negroes should cease helping the enemy, to that extent it weakened the enemy in his resistance to you. Do you think differently?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5806"/>I thought that whatever negroes can be got to do as soldiers leaves just so much less for white soldiers to do, in saving the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5807"/>Does it appear otherwise to you? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5808"/>But negroes, like other people, act upon motives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5809"/>Why should they do anything for us, if we will do nothing for them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5810"/>If they stake their lives for us, they must be prompted by the strongest motive &mdash; even the promise of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5811"/>And the promise being made, must be kept. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5812"/>The signs look better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5813"/>The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the sea. Thanks to the great North-west for it. Nor yet wholly to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5814"/><measure n="300miles" type="distance">Three hundred miles</measure> up they met <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, Empire, Keystone, and <placeName reg="Jersey City, Hudson, New Jersey" key="tgn,7013813">Jersey</placeName>, hewing their way right and left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5815"/>The Sunny South too, in more colors than <num value="1">one</num>, also lent a hand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5816"/>On the spot, their part of the history was jotted down in <rs type="color">black</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5817"/>The job was a great national <num value="1">one</num>; and let none be barred who bore an honorable part in it. And while those who have cleared the great river may well be proud, even that is not all. It is hard to say that anything has been more bravely and well done than at <placeName key="tgn,7016218" n="1.000 581" reg="antietam, washington, maryland">Antietam</placeName>, <placeName reg="Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,7014175">Murfreesboro</placeName>, <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, and on many fields of lesser note.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5818"/>Nor must <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Sam</foreName></persName>'s web-feet be forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5819"/>At all the watery margins they have <pb id="p.555" n="555"/> been present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5820"/>Not only on the deep sea, the broad bay, and the rapid river, but also up the narrow, muddy bayou, and wherever the ground was a little damp, they have been, and made their tracks, thanks to all. For the great republic &mdash; for the principle it lives by and keeps alive &mdash; for man's vast future &mdash; thanks to all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5821"/>Peace does not appear so distant as it did. I hope it will come soon and come to stay, and so come as to be worth the keeping in all future time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5822"/>It will then have been proved that, among free men, there can be no successful appeal from the ballot to the bullet; and that they who take such appeal are sure to lose their case and pay the cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5823"/>And then there will be some black men who can remember that, with silent tongue, and clenched teeth, and steady eye, and well-poised bayonet, they have helped mankind on to this great consummation; while I fear there will be some white ones, unable to forget that, with malignant heart and deceitful speech, they have strove to hinder it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5824"/>Still, let us not be over-sanguine of a speedy final triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5825"/>Let us be quite sober.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5826"/>Let us diligently apply the means, never doubting that a just <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, in his own good time, will give us the rightful result. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6402"/>But he was not so. He may have seemed passive and lacking in interest; he may not have measured his friendly duties by the applicant's hot desire; but yet he was never ungrateful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6426"/>He was deeply and sincerely honest himself, and assumed that others were so. He never suspected men: and hence in dealing with them he was easily imposed upon. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6508"/>I received both your letters, and although I have not answered them, it is not because I have forgotten them, or [not] been interested about them, but because it appeared to me I could write nothing which could do any good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6510"/>My business is such that I could hardly leave home now, if it were not, as it is, that my own wife is sick a-bed (it is a case of baby-sickness, and I suppose is not dangerous). I sincerely hope Father may yet recover his health: but at all events tell him to remember to call upon and confide in our great, and good, and merciful Maker, who will not turn away from him in any extremity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6511"/>He notes the fall of a sparrow, and numbers the hairs of our heads; and He will not forget the dying man who puts his trust in Him.
