<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>If any correspondents miss some favorite letter in the collection, we would remind them of the embarrassment of riches; for her correspondence extended over <measure n="60years" type="date">sixty years</measure>; and of the impossibility of suiting all tastes; and we cordially thank them all for the abundant supply of material. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>This lady has been long before the public as an author with much success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Few female writers, if any, have done more or better things for our literature in the lighter or graver departments.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Its numbers were small, and it was everywhere spoken against.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It is quite impossible for any <num value="1">one</num> of the present generation to imagine the popular surprise and indignation which the book called forth, or how entirely its author cut herself off from the favor and sympathy of a large number of those who had previously delighted to do her honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Social and literary circles, which had been proud of her presence, closed their doors against her. The sale of her books, the subscriptions to her magazine, fell off to a ruinous extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>She knew all she was hazarding, and made the great sacrifice, prepared for all the consequences which followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>In the preface to her book she says, <quote>I am fully aware of the unpopularity of the task I have undertaken; but though I <hi rend="italics">expect</hi> ridicule and censure, I do <hi rend="italics">not fear</hi> them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>A few years hence, the opinion of the world will be a matter in which I have not even the most transient interest; but this book will be abroad on its mission of humanity long after the hand that wrote it is mingling with the dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Should it be the means of advancing, even <num value="1">one</num> single hour, the inevitable progress of truth and justice, I would not exchange the consciousness for all <persName n="Rothschild,,,,," id="n0190.0003.00008.00027" reg="mostcommon:Rothschild,nomatch:0"><surname>Rothschild</surname></persName>'s wealth or <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Walter</foreName></persName>'s fame.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Thenceforth her life was a battle; a constant rowing hard against the stream of popular prejudice and hatred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>And through it all &mdash; pecuniary privation, loss of friends and position, the painfulness of being suddenly thrust from <quote>the still air of delightful studies</quote> into the bitterest and sternest controversy of the age &mdash; she bore herself with patience, fortitude, and unshaken reliance upon the justice and ultimate triumph of the cause she had espoused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Her pen was <pb id="p.-009" n="-009"/> never idle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Wherever there was a brave word to be spoken, her voice was heard, and never without effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>It is not exaggeration to say that no man or woman at that period rendered more substantial service to the cause of freedom, or made such a <quote>great renunciation</quote> in doing it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>A practical philanthropist, she had the courage of her convictions, and from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was no mere closet moralist, or sentimental bewailer of the woes of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>She was the <name>Samaritan</name> stooping over the wounded Jew. She calmly and unflinchingly took her place by the side of the despised slave and free man of color, and in word and act protested against the cruel prejudice which shut out its victims from the rights and privileges of American citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Her philanthropy had no taint of fanaticism; throughout the long struggle, in which she was a prominent actor, she kept her fine sense of humor, good taste, and sensibility to the beautiful in art and nature.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> 
<p>The opposition she met with from those who had shared her confidence and friendship was of course keenly felt, but her kindly and genial disposition remained unsoured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>She rarely spoke of her personal trials, and never posed as a martyr.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>I urged that their willingness to go was strong presumptive evidence in favor of their moral character; and expressed a reasonable doubt whether the <num value="70">seventy</num> sent out by the apostles were all equally gifted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>He admitted that the foundation principles of Christianity and abolition were identical; but still this subject was so intertwisted with politics, prejudice, and interest, and the manner of illustrating it might be so injudicious, that he thought it every way desirable <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> to have agents peculiarly qualified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>I answered that we had good reason to suppose the early opposition to Christianity was interwoven with the prejudices and interests of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>My dear friend,--You see I reciprocate your familiar and affectionate phrase, and I do it heartily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>There are, indeed, few people whom I address in this way, for I fear to use language stronger than my feelings, and I shrink so much from the appearance of flattering words, that I not seldom smother affections that struggle for utterance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>But I grow free as I grow older.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>Age has no freezing influence, and the inward fountain gushes out more naturally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>To you I ought to open my heart after what you have told me of the good a loving, cheering word does you. I confess I had thought of you as raised more than the most of us above the need of sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>I had heard so often of your brave endurance of adversity, and was conscious of having suffered so little myself for truth and humanity, that I almost questioned my right to send you encouraging words, and certainly did not expect so affectionate a response.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>It shows <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> me I can do more than I believed by expressions of esteem and admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>If I can lift up and strengthen such a spirit, how can I keep silence? . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>I understand fully your language when you speak of reform as your work-shop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>I fear I understand it too well; that is, I am too prone to shrink from the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>Reform is the resistance of rooted corruptions and evils, and my tendency is to turn away from the contemplation of evils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>My mind seeks the good, the perfect, the beautiful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>It is a degree of torture to bring vividly to my apprehension what man is suffering from his own crimes, and from the wrongs and cruelty of his brother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>No perfection of art expended on purely tragic and horrible subjects can reconcile me to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>It is only from a sense of duty that I read a narrative of guilt or woe in the papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>When the darkness is lighted up by moral greatness or beauty, I can endure and even enjoy it. You see I am made of but poor material for a reformer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>But on this very account the work is good for me. I need it not, as many do, to give me excitement, for I find enough, perhaps too much, to excite me in the common experience of life, in meditation, in abstract truth; but to save me from a refined selfishness, to give me force, disinterestedness, true dignity and elevation, to link me by a new faith to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, by a deeper love to my race, and to make me a blessing to the world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>I know not how far I have explained my shrinking from the work of reform, but, be the cause what it may, let us not turn away from us the cross, but willingly, gratefully accept it when <name n="God" type="God">God</name> lays it on us, and he does lay it on us whenever he penetrates our hearts with a deep feeling of the degradation, miseries, <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> oppressions, crimes, of our human brethren, and awakens longings for their redemption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>In thus calling us, he imposes on us a burden such as the ancient prophets groaned under.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>We must drink of the cup and be baptized into the baptism of our Master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>We must expect persecution in some form or other: but this is a light matter compared with the painful necessity of fixing our eyes and souls on evil, and with the frequent apparent failure of our labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>Here, here is the trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>Could we lift up our fellow-creatures at once to the happiness and excellence which we aspire after, what a joy would reform be!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>But, alas, if we do remove a few pressing evils, how many remain!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>What a cloud still hangs over the earth!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>Sometimes evil seems to grow up under the efforts to repress it: Were it not for our faith, who could persevere?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>But with this faith what a secret sustaining joy flows into and mingles with sincere labors for humanity!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>The little we accomplish becomes to us a pledge of something infinitely greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>We know that the brighter futurity which our hearts yearn for is not a dream, that good is to triumph over evil, and to triumph through the sacrifices of the good.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>You see I would wed you and myself to reform, and yet we must do something more than reformers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>We must give our nature a fair chance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>We must not wither it by too narrow modes of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>Let your genius have free play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>We are better reformers, because calmer and wiser, because we have more weapons to work with, if we give a wide range to thought, imagination, taste, and the affections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>We must be cheerful, too, in our war with evil; for gloom is apt to become sullenness, ill-humor, and bitterness. </p></div2></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>A publication taking broad anti-slavery ground was then a rarity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>I sent a copy to <persName n="Channing,Doctor,,,," id="n0190.0042.00048.00196" reg="nearbymention:Channing,William,Ellery,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Channing</surname></persName>, and a few days after he came to see me at <address><street n="Cottage Place">Cottage Place</street></address>, a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> from his residence on <address><street n="Mt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>Vernon Street</street></address>. It was a very bright sunny day; but he carried his cloak on his arm for fear of changes in temperature, and he seemed fatigued with the long walk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>He stayed nearly <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure>, during which time we held a most interesting conversation on the general interests of humanity, and on slavery in particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>He told me something of his experience in the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West Indies</placeName>, and said the painful impression made by the sight of slavery had never left his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>He expressed great joy at the publication of the <quote>Appeal,</quote> and added, <quote>The reading of it has aroused my conscience to the query whether I ought to remain silent on the subject.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>He urged me never to desert the cause through evil report or good report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>In some respects he thought I went too far. He then entertained the idea, which he afterwards discarded, that slavery existed in a milder form in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> than elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>I was fresh from the bloody records of our own legislation, and was somewhat vehement in my opposition to this statement, and he sought to moderate my zeal with those calm, wise words which none spoke so well as he. <pb id="p.49" n="49"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>We afterwards had many interviews.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>He often sent for me when I was in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, and always urged me to come and tell him of every new aspect of the anti-slavery cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>At every interview I could see that he grew bolder and stronger on the subject, while I felt that I grew wiser and more just.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> I thought him timid and even slightly time-serving, but I soon discovered that I formed this estimate merely from ignorance of his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>I learned that it was justice to all, not popularity for himself, which rendered him so cautious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>He constantly grew upon my respect, until I came to regard him as the wisest as well as the gentlest apostle of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>I owe him thanks for helping to preserve me from the <num value="1">one</num>-sidedness into which zealous reformers are apt to run. He never sought to undervalue the importance of anti-slavery, but he said many things to prevent my looking upon it as the only question interesting to humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>My mind needed this check, and I never think of his many-sided conversations without deep gratitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>His interest in the subject constantly increased, and I never met him without being struck with the progress he had made in overcoming some difficulty which for a time troubled his sensitive conscience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>I can distinctly recollect several such steps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>At <num value="1">one</num> time he was doubtful whether it were right to petition Congress on the subject, because such petition exasperated our Southern brethren, and, as he thought, made them more tenacious of their system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>He afterward headed a petition himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>In all such cases he was held back by the conscientious fear of violating some other duty, while endeavoring to fulfil his duty to the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>Some zealous reformers misunderstood this, and construed <pb id="p.50" n="50"/> into a love of popularity what was, in fact, but a fine sense of justice, a more universal love of his species.</p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/>In the morning I went to look after the poor little sparrow in the rose-bush, whom I had seen the day before, shutting her eyes hard and sticking tight to her nest, which was tossed about like a ship in a heavy gale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1394"/>I wanted much to help her, but could not. Next morning I found the nest nearly wrenched from the bush and <num value="2">two</num> of the eggs on the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1395"/>They were still warm, so I replaced them, righted the nest and fastened it to the twigs with strings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1398"/>But as I was toiling along I heard a voice behind me exclaim, <quote><persName n="Child,,Maria,,," id="n0190.0080.00097.00357" reg="default:Child,Maria,,,"><foreName>Maria</foreName> <surname>Child</surname></persName>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1417"/>I have buckled to Buckle's <quote>History of civilization,</quote> though I said I would not read it because I dreaded being made uncomfortable by the point of view from which he looks at things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1418"/>This making moral progress depend entirely on intellectual progress seems to turn things so inside out that it twists my poor brain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1419"/>I care more that the world should grow better, than it should grow wiser.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1420"/>The external must be developed from the internal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1421"/>It makes my head ache to look at human growth from any other point of view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1422"/>That is the great mistake of <persName n="Fourier,,,,," id="n0190.0083.00099.00364" reg="mostcommon:Fourier,Francois,Charles,Marie,:1"><surname>Fourier</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1423"/>He is wise and great, and often prophetic, but he thinks to produce perfect men by surrounding them with perfect circumstances; whereas the perfect circumstances must be the result of perfect men. How can the marriage relation, for instance, be well ordered, until men and women are <pb id="p.100" n="100"/> more pure?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1427"/>But there is no help for it. I must read every word of Buckle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1428"/>It seems to me the most remarkable book of the age; bold, clear, strong, comprehensive, candid, and, above all, free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1431"/>Hope not &mdash; hope not.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1432"/>The fact is, I shall never be easy till you read it, and write me your opinion of it. It delights me, with none of the modern affectations of style; no resuscitated words, whose only merit is their obsoleteness; no inverted sentences; no parentheses within parentheses; no clouds of language between the reader and the subject; no vague Orphic sayings, which may mean <num value="1">one</num> thing, or another thing, or no thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1437"/>He is a full, deep river, showing clearly every pebble over which it flows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1438"/>But I don't agree with all his statements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1439"/>He says <pb id="p.101" n="101"/> that moral truths were exactly the same as they are now ages ago; that intellect is the sole cause of progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1711"/>This could not be, unless their fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers had been white men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1712"/>Throughout the slave States, the testimony of no colored person, bond or free, can be received against t white man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1927"/>With deep sadness I saw your respected and influential name signed to an address in favor of repealing the <rs>Personal Liberty Bill</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1928"/>I trust you will not deem me disrespectful if I ask whether you have reflected well on all the bearings of this important subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1929"/>Perhaps you may consider me, and those with whom I labor, as persons prone to look only on <num value="1">one</num> side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1933"/>I presume that your social environment is almost entirely conservative; and conservative of habits and stereotyped sayings, rather than of the original principles on which the government of this country was founded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1934"/>Have you carefully examined and duly considered the other side?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1935"/>This mutual agreement between <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> to keep <num value="1000000">millions</num> of fellow-beings in abject degradation and misery cannot possibly be right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1941"/>If you set aside heart and conscience as appropriate guides for women only, and assume pure cold intellect for a standard of action, what answer will enlightened reason give, if you ask whether free institutions in <num value="1">one</num> part of the country can possibly survive continual compromises with despotism in another part?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1942"/>If the lowest person in the community is legally oppressed, is not the highest endangered thereby?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1944"/>I again ask you, respectfully and earnestly, to read my pamphlets with candid attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1945"/>If the request seems to you obtrusive or presumptuous, my apology is that I believe you to be an upright and kind man, and therefore infer that your heart and conscience are not in fault, but only the blinding influences of your social environment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1949"/>The hall inside was beautiful with light and banners; and outside the street was beautiful with moonlight and prismatic icicles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1950"/>All went on quietly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1951"/>People walked about and talked, occasionally enlivened by music of the <rs>Germania Band</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1952"/>They seemed to enjoy themselves, and I (being released from the care of unruly boys, demolishing cake and spilling slops as they did last year) did my best to help them have a good time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1953"/>But what with being introduced to strangers, and chatting with old acquaintances half forgotten, I went home to <address><street n="Derne Street">Derne Street</street></address> very weary, yet found it impossible for me to sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1954"/>I knew there were very formidable preparations to mob the anti-slavery meeting the next day, and that the mayor was avowedly on the side of the mob.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1956"/>Hour after hour of the night, I heard the clock strike, while visions were passing through my mind of that noble head assailed by murderous hands, and I obliged to stand by without the power to save him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1957"/>I went very early in the morning, and entered the <rs type="place">Tremont Temple</rs> by a private labyrinthine passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1958"/>There I found a company of young men, a portion of the self-constituted body-guard of <persName n="Phillips,Mister,,,," id="n0190.0097.00147.00531" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1959"/>They looked calm, but resolute and stern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1960"/>I knew they were all armed, as well as hundreds of others; but their <pb id="p.148" n="148"/> weapons were not visible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1961"/>The women friends came in gradually by the same private passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1962"/>It was a solemn gathering, I assure you ; for though there was a pledge not to use weapons unless <persName n="Phillips,Mister,,,," id="n0190.0097.00148.00532" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> or some other anti-slavery speaker was personally in danger, still nobody could foresee what might happen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1963"/>The meeting opened well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1964"/>The anti-slavery sentiment was there in strong force; but soon the mob began to yell from the galleries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1965"/>They came tumbling in by hundreds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1966"/>The papers will tell you of their goings on. Such yelling, screeching, stamping, and bellowing I never heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1976"/>My heart beat so fast I could hear it; for I did not then know how <persName n="Phillips,Mister,,,," id="n0190.0097.00148.00537" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>'s armed friends were stationed at every door and in the middle of every aisle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1977"/>They formed a firm wall which the mob could not pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1978"/>At last it was announced that the police were coming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1981"/>Then by a clever stroke of management he stooped forward and addressed his speech to the reporters stationed directly below him. <pb id="p.149" n="149"/> This tantalized the mob, and they began to call out, <quote>Speak louder!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1982"/>We want to hear what you're saying.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/>Whereupon he raised his voice, and for half an hour he seemed to hold them in the hollow of his hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1984"/>But as soon as he sat down they began to yell and sing again, to prevent any more speaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1985"/>But <persName n="Higginson,,,,," id="n0190.0097.00149.00539" reg="mostcommon:Higginson,Thomas,Wentworth,,:5"><surname>Higginson</surname></persName> made himself heard through the storm, and spoke in very manly and effective style; the purport of which was that to-day he would set aside the subject of slavery, and take his stand upon the right of free speech, which the members of this society were determined to maintain at every hazard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1986"/>I forgot to mention that <persName n="Phillips,,Wendell,,," id="n0190.0097.00149.00540" reg="default:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><foreName>Wendell</foreName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> was preceded by <persName n="Clarke,,James,Freeman,," id="n0190.0097.00149.00541" reg="default:Clarke,James,Freeman,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>Freeman</foreName> <surname>Clarke</surname></persName>, whom the mob treated with such boisterous insults that he was often obliged to pause in his remarks.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1989"/>In the afternoon meeting the uproar was greater than it had been in the forenoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1991"/>The mayor came at last, and, mounting the platform, informed his <quote>fellow-citizens</quote> in the galleries that the trustees of the building had requested him to disperse the meeting and clear the hall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1992"/>Turning the meeting out-of-doors was precisely what they wanted him to do.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1993"/>[The remainder of this letter has been lost, but the purport of it was, that on the mayor's complying with the demand that he should read the letter aloud <pb id="p.150" n="150"/> to the meeting, it appeared that the trustees had desired him to disperse the <hi rend="italics">mob</hi>, and not the meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2902"/>A feeling akin to remorse renders my grief almost insupportable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2903"/>Certainly it was not my fault, that I could not view the last election in the light he did; but I wept bitterly when he wrote to me: <quote>It makes the tears come to my eyes to find that you do not sympathize with me in the stand I have taken from motives the most conscientious that <pb id="p.225" n="225"/> have ever influenced my life.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2907"/>He believed that Democrats and rebels had met with a great change of heart; but I thought, and still think,.there was superabounding evidence that they were still essentially in the same state of mind as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3038"/>I spent last winter with the parents of <persName n="Shaw,Colonel,,,," id="n0190.0166.00236.00817" reg="nearbymention:Shaw,Robert,G.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Shaw</surname></persName>....

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3039"/>There is a history about that sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3040"/>It is very handsome, being richly damascened with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> coat-of-arms, and the letters R. G. S. beneath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3041"/>It was a present from a wealthy uncle in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and he received it a few days before the attack on <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 107" reg="morris island, charleston, south carolina">Fort Wagner</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3042"/>You know of his instantaneous death, and the manner of his burial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3043"/>When it was suggested to his father and mother to ask for his body, to be buried at the <rs>North</rs>, they replied; <quote>No.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3044"/>Let it remain where it fell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3045"/>No monument can be so honorable to him, as to lie among the brave followers whom he was leading in the cause of freedom.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3046"/>When he went South, he of course had many parting keepsakes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3047"/>For the sake of tender associations, his family made earnest efforts to obtain some of these; but amid the <pb id="p.237" n="237"/> turmoil and reckless robbery of war they had all vanished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3048"/>They could not obtain even the smallest memorial of him. But, months after, an officer of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> heard that his sword was in possession of a Confederate family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3049"/>He took a small band of soldiers and went to their dwelling to ask for the sword to send to <persName n="Shaw,Colonel,,,," id="n0190.0166.00237.00819" reg="nearbymention:Shaw,Robert,G.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Shaw</surname></persName>'s parents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3050"/>No <num value="1">one</num> was at home but a few colored servants, who of course were not very reluctant to admit the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3051"/>He searched the premises, found the sword, and carried it off, without taking any other article from the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3052"/>It nearly escaped their notice, on account of being concealed in an old worn scabbard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3053"/>The elegant sheath which belonged to it was probably fastened to <persName n="Shaw,Colonel,,,," id="n0190.0166.00237.00820" reg="nearbymention:Shaw,Robert,G.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Shaw</surname></persName>'s body, and thrown into the pit with him. When his mother showed me the weapon she said: <quote>This is the sword that <persName><foreName>Robert</foreName></persName> waved over his followers, as he urged them to the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3054"/>I am so glad it was never used in battle!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3055"/>Not a drop of blood was ever on it. He had received it but a few days before he died.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3056"/>These noble-hearted people manifested the same spirit about the burning of <placeName reg="Darien, McIntosh, Georgia" key="tgn,2022633">Darien</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3058"/>I will tell you another touching incident, not without <pb id="p.238" n="238"/> its beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3059"/>Years after the war was over, a rumor reached the <rs>North</rs> that the embankment at <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 107" reg="morris island, charleston, south carolina">Fort Wagner</placeName> had broken away, and that some of the bones buried there were falling through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3061"/>Accordingly she procured a boat and was rowed to <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 107" reg="morris island, charleston, south carolina">Fort Wagner</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3062"/>The embankment was not broken, and the place where <persName><foreName>Robert</foreName></persName> was <quote>buried with his niggers</quote> was <num value="1">one</num> mass of white blossoms!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3063"/>It had happened thus: <persName n="Hay,,,,," id="n0190.0166.00238.00824" reg="mostcommon:Hay,nomatch:0"><surname>Hay</surname></persName> had been carried from the <rs>North</rs> for the horses of the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3066"/>You and I have the same feelings about war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3076"/>When they bought the place the house was so very old that it was thrown into the bargain, with the supposition that it was fit for nothing but fire-wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3079"/>The result is a house full of queer nooks and corners, and all manner of juttings in and out.
