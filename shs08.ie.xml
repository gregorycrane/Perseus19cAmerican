<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Marching my brigade over a broad extent of cleared ground, swept by the artillery of the enemy, I reached the designated point at dusk, and having no time nor sufficient light to reconnoitre the ground, I placed my command in a field to support a battery on my left, which seemed to be doing good service and to be much exposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>My brigade held its ground with heroic tenacity, but must have been driven back, by overwheming forces, but for the timely arrival of reinforcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 7">Seventh regiment</orgName>, having been the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> engaged, and having remained constantly under heavy fire, suffered most severely in officers and men. <persName n="Campbell,Colonel,Reuben,P.,," id="n0121.0002.00004.00028" reg="default:Campbell,Reuben,P.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Reuben</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Campbell</surname></persName>, who might be justly classed among <quote>the bravest of the brave,</quote> fell while bearing in his hands the colors of the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The enemy having been driven from the field, my brigade bivouacked near it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>I remained in that position, when the shells of the enemy's artillery commenced falling near us, and I was ordered to proceed and attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Having no guide and no knowledge of the enemy's position, I took the direction whence came the shells, which carried me to the right of the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Forming my line of battle in a cleared field, and advancing we soon encountered the enemy, and drove them for nearly a mile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>This was done under the fire of <num value="2">two</num> batteries--<num value="1">one</num> of which we silenced and the other of which enfiladed the left of my line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>After proceeding about this distance, the enemy's force rapidly accumulated as they fell back, and finding that the enemy extended much beyond my right flank, no further advance was attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>At dark I placed my brigade in bivouac on the edge of the battlefield, and having reported to <persName n="Hill,Major-General,,,," id="n0121.0002.00004.00030" reg="mostcommon:Hill,A.,P.,,:51"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName> through a member of my staff, was ordered to remain there until daylight, and then return to the point from which I had started into battle on the previous afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>During the afternoon of <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> I received marching orders, and after proceeding a short distance down the road on which we had previously been moving, was ordered to return to camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>I was returning, when a heavy fire of artillery and small arms on the left showed that attack had been made on <placeName reg="Malvern Hill, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2489907">Malvern hill</placeName>, and it <pb id="p.5" n="5"/>was clear that our forces were being driven back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Orders were given to me to move in quickly to the support of our forces engaged, and I did so at a double-quick across the fields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>On arriving near the field of battle, a staff officer of some of the commands engaged volunteered to direct me to the position in which I could render much service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Under his direction, I had posted <num value="2">two</num> of my regiments and was in the act of posting the remainder, when I ascertained that I had been misled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Taking the troops I still had present with me, I proceeded towards the left, and reached a position near the enemy's batteries, but still too far for my short range guns and in full range of their artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Making my men lie on the ground, they remained in the position until the firing from our side had ceased; then collecting my brigade, I returned to my camp of the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Thus ended the actual fighting of this memorable week &mdash; the enemy having, during the night, evacuated <placeName reg="Malvern Hill, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2489907">Malvern hill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/><dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> we were ordered to defend the batteries planted upon the position which had been taken from the enemy, from any attempt that might be made to retake them during the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Consequently we slept upon our arms in the immediate vicinity, with the proper picket force out on all sides; but no demonstration was made by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/><dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, at dawn of day, he opened upon us with his artillery, and the fire was continued until his position was turned and he was thus forced to abandon it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>By your order, my line of battle was formed on the right of the road, and in this order I advanced through the dense woods in which the enemy was posted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>A small ravine, deep and boggy, compelled us to flank still farther to the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>By this means I became separated from the remainder of the brigade (which had been formed on the left), and for a long time was wholly without assistance in my attempts upon the enemy's position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Again and again was that position assailed, and again and again were we repulsed by vastly superior numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Regiment after regiment sent into the same attack shared the same fate; and it was not until late in the afternoon, when the continuous arrival of fresh troops had given us somewhat an equality of forces, that any decided impression was made upon the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>His position was carried in that late general charge which swept his whole army from the field in a perfect rout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>In his flight I was perfectly satisfied with the conduct of my regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The position of the enemy was such that we were exposed to a heavy fire from the flank as well as from the front; and though the regiment was frequently broken and compelled to fall back, yet I did not once lose the command of it. The men reformed with great alacrity, and my commands were obeyed with the promptness, if not the precision of drill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>My loss, in killed and wounded, was <num value="68">sixty-eight</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Nothing but the thickness of the woods saved us from total destruction in our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> unassisted effort upon the enemy's position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Taking advantage of this slight shelter, they maintained themselves in this position until the arrival of reinforcements, when they joined in the general charge which won the batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>That there were many stragglers from the field of battle is not to be denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>There have been stragglers from every field since the war began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>As a general rule, however, it appeared to me that the men fought throughout the whole army as if each individual were, thoroughly impressed with the belief that it was necessary that we should be victorious in the field before <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 21" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Amid this army of heroes, I have no reason to be dissatisfied with my regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>Whether on a march or in the field, exposed to fatigue and privation, in the midst of danger and in the face of death, they were cheerful and obedient, prompt and daring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Sir &mdash; I have read the communication from the <rs>Russian Minister</rs> in relation to the abolishment of the use of explosive projectiles in military warfare, with the attention and care it well deserves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>I concur heartily in the sentiments therein expressed, and I trust that our Government will respond unhesitatingly to the proposition in behalf of humanity and civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>The use in warfare of explosive balls, so sensitive as to ignite and burst on striking a substance as soft and yielding as animal flesh (of men or horses), I consider barbarous and no more to be tolerated by civilized nations than the universally reprobated practice of using poisoned missiles, or of poisoning food or drink to be left in the <pb id="p.25" n="25"/>way of an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Such a practice is inexcusable among any people above the grade of ignorant savages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Neither do I regard the use in war of such explosive.balls as of any public advantage, but rather the reverse; for it will have the effect of killing outright, rather than wounding, and it is known that the care of wounded men much more embarrasses the future operations of the enemy than the loss of the same number killed, who require no further attention which may delay or impede them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>There is a class of explosive projectiles now used, the discontinuance of which is not demanded by humanity, and the use of which may be considered legitimate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>These are the projectiles which can only be exploded by contact with hard, resisting substances, and which are generally used for destroying ships, caissons, or light fortifications, and not directly against men or animals in the opposing ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>These latter ought not and probably cannot be included in an agreement or treaty to prohibit their use in warfare; but I strongly advocate an agreement or treaty binding all civilized nations to discontinue and forever abandon the use in war of that class of missiles or projectiles which may be used in. small arms and be so sensitive as to explode on contact with animal, flesh.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>The papers in the case, received through the <rs>State</rs> and War Departments, are herewith returned.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>In this connection, I also notice a letter from <persName n="Clay,the Honorable,C.,M.,," id="n0121.0005.00025.00172" reg="default:Clay,C.,M.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">the Hon.</roleName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName>, our Minister to <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, which has been referred to this office and herewith returned, and on which I have to report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>The poor fellow at once applied for a furlough, and was refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>He then went to the gallant soldier who is my informant and stated the case in full, and told him that he must and would go home if he was shot for it the day he returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>He moved his wife and child to a place of safety, and made provision for their support.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>Perhaps some of these might serve to <hi rend="italics">punctuate</hi> or help to emphasize the many admirable <quote>official reports</quote> which are now appearing in the <hi rend="italics">Southern Historical Papers</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>Among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> troops to leave the <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">State of Alabama</placeName> was the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 3">Third regiment</orgName>, which proceeded by rail to <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg, Virginia</placeName>, and was there mustered in by <persName n="Smith,,Kirby,,," id="n0121.0008.00037.00253" reg="default:Smith,Kirby,,,"><foreName>Kirby</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>; thence to <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>, where we remained in camp <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>Nevertheless we marched, and there was many a tearful leave-taking &mdash; for from the cordial reception given us by the noble women of <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> had grown many sincere friendships, and I recall no other occasion of the war which so much resembled the home-partings as the day our regiment left the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>I was near enough to hear him, and shall never forget his calm, philosophical, not to say prophetic manner, as he addressed his troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>Clouds had gathered, a light rain had fallen, and a storm threatened to break upon us. His opening words were: <quote>Fellow soldiers, our hearts are as heavy as the murky clouds above us; yet we must not despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>Our duties in the field and camp are ended.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>He then admonished them to observe the conditions of their paroles; that grave responsibilities as citizens would now devolve upon them, and if faithfully met, would only make their heroism as soldiers shine the brighter.

Unheeding the cold, for his heart beat high at the prospect of once more being with his comrades in the field, and proving with his sword the faith that was in him, he gained the strip of land <measure n="12miles" type="distance">twelve miles distant</measure>, and pursued his way through the woods until daylight, <pb id="p.65" n="65"/>when he was halted by some farmers, with shot-guns in close proximity to his body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>Those fellows, when aroused by the alarm guns, were ever on the alert to capture an escaping prisoner, and claim the reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>The gallant fellow often said that he felt more chagrined and discouraged at being brought back by civilians than if captured by regular soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>But his fortitude soon returned, and his mind constantly dwelt upon the <num value="1">one</num> darling object of escape.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>It is not to be wondered at that <persName><foreName>Charlie</foreName></persName> now became an object of the strictest surveillance on the part of every agent of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>His every movement was watched, so that his sole reliance was upon strategy for his <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> attempt.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>Procuring a Federal uniform (it was supposed from some <num value="1">one</num> connected with the hospital), he carefully concealed it in his bunk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>With a piece of wood, of which there was plenty, he manufactured a gun-stock; with a lot of fruit cans, which he procured from the hospital, he manufactured a barrel, and a piece of the handle of a camp-kettle was wrought into a lock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>After <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure> incessant labor, he completed his task, and during that time he was exceedingly reticent, confining himself to his bunk as much as possible, keeping his own counsel, like a good general, but working like a beaver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>As a piece of workmanship, it was pronounced by all who saw it a marvel of mechanical ingenuity and skill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>He was fortunate enough to find an old, rusty bayonet, which he soon made look like polished steel, and how he stained the gun to make it look real no <num value="1">one</num> but himself knew; but that it did look so the sequel will show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>Having everything in readiness, how put them to use?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>The guard must be brought into the block at night, so that he could fall in with the men and march out with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>Confiding his intention to only a trusted few of his mess-mates, he requested <persName n="Long,Lieutenant,Michael,,," id="n0121.0015.00065.00657" reg="default:Long,Michael,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <foreName>Michael</foreName> <surname>Long</surname></persName> (now living in New Orleans) to inform the guard that an attempt would be made to break out that night from Block <num value="8">8</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>While passing through Block <num value="8">8</num>, <persName><foreName>Charlie</foreName></persName>, with his Federal uniform and improvised gun, quietly fell in with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>Not finding any thing suspicious in that block, they <pb id="p.66" n="66"/>were marched out. All the other blocks were visited without any discoveries being made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>The guard was then formed in line for inspection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>The <rs>Lieutenant</rs> in command, examining the accoutrements of the men, discovered that <persName><foreName>Charlie</foreName></persName> had no cartridge box, when the following dialogue took place:</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/><persName><foreName>Charlie</foreName></persName> seeing this his last effort was defeated, straightened himself, brought his gun to <quote>inspection arms,</quote> in true military style, and passed it to the officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>Of course, its weight told the tale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>The ruse was discovered, and by neglecting the cartridge-box, the easiest of all to make, our hero was again defeated in his plans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>By permission of the <rs>Lieutenant</rs>, however, he was allowed to make the experiment of passing the sentinel at the gate, which he did without eliciting any surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>He was then taken before <persName n="Hill,Colonel,Charles,W.,," id="n0121.0015.00066.00658" reg="default:Hill,Charles,W.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="OH112">112th Ohio</orgName>, then commandant of the prison at <placeName reg="Johnson Island, Ottawa, Ohio" key="tgn,2424997">Johnson's Island</placeName>, who showed himself a humane and considerate officer, and who frankly admitted the prisoner's right to attempt to escape, complimented him on his courage and strategy, and condemned him to no other puishment than the removal of his disguises and his money, but insisted on keeping his gun, which he deemed a fit trophy to be placed among the archives of the <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">State of Ohio</placeName>, where it is at present.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/><persName><foreName>Charlie</foreName></persName> was then sent back to his quarters to brood in sorrow over his several failures, notwithstanding the indomitable courage, the strategy, the energy and the patience with which he prosecuted them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>So confident was his comrades that he had been successful in this last attempt, that they prepared his bunk to lead the sentinel to believe that he was still there, and were ready to vouch for his sickness at roll-call the following morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>But vain hope, when roll-call came, the intrepid <rs>Pierce</rs> was there to answer for himself, and there he remained until paroled with the others at the close of the war.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/>I having <num value="5">five</num> companies on picket at the <rs type="place">Crenshaw bridge</rs>, was ordered to take command at that point, while the other <num value="5">five</num> companies, under <persName n="Cowan,Major,,,," id="n0121.0016.00067.00665" reg="mostcommon:Cowan,Robert,H.,,:1"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Cowan</surname></persName>, would march with the brigade and cross the river at the <rs type="place">Telegraph bridge</rs> and move down the river, in order to drive the enemy from their position.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>My orders were that I should cross the river, with the <num value="5">five</num> companies, and make an attack in rear of the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>About <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time> on the <dateStruct value="--26"><day reg="2">26th</day></dateStruct>, I heard sharp skirmishing, and drew in my pickets in order to cross, and while doing so could see that the enemy were in full retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>While crossing the river, I received a dispatch from you, ordering me to join the command ; that you were in the road immediately opposite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>I joined the command, and from that point we marched to <placeName reg="Mechanicsville, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112976">Mechanicsville</placeName>, and reached that place tinder a most terrific fire of shot and shell.

<p>About <time value="12pm">12 o'clock P. M.</time>, the firing ceased, and we were ordered to lie in position upon our arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>Soon you, at the head of your brigade, filed to the right and moving <measure n="600yards" type="distance">six hundred yards</measure> in that direction, halted, faced to the front, formed a line of battle, and moved slowly through a skirt of woods until you reached an open field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>They seemed not to heed the falling of friends by their sides, but had the great duty of defeating the enemy foremost in their minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1391"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was the loft of the stable in which the horses of the officers of the fort were stalled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1392"/>The floor, which separated us from our neighing neighbors beneath us, was full of broad seams from the shrinkage of the rough boards of which it was composed, so that the hot, steamy air from below had full access to us, and during the oppressive days and sultry nights of <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>August</month></dateStruct>, with the thin roof of shingles between us and the sun, and the hot steam arising from the stalls beneath, our situation was anything but comfortable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/>Nor must you judge us too harshly if I assure you that there was a general feeling of relief when we found <num value="1">one</num> morning, to our surprise, that a process of summary ejectment had been served upon our <num value="4">four</num>-footed neighbors and a <num value="100">hundred</num> or more ragged and bare-foot Confederates were being marched in <hi rend="italics">sans ceremonies</hi> and quartered in their stalls.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1395"/>Our next hotel was a more airy <num value="1">one</num>, and, therefore, in good weather, a more comfortable <num value="1">one</num>--an old shed, originally built as a barracks for Federal troops, some <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure> wide by an <measure n="100feet" type="distance">hundred feet</measure> long, with dirt floor, weatherboarding of rough boards set upright and without strips to cover the seams, which were from <measure n="0.5inch" type="distance">a half inch</measure> to an inch in breadth, with roofing of the same rough boards, warped and shriveled by the sun so that the heavy <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> rains ran down in torrents upon us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1401"/>As to ablutions, they were performed during those hours of the day when we had access to the well by water drawn from the pump and poured from canteens into our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1402"/>Most of us were possessors of a pocket knife and a tin cup apiece.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1410"/>Let us draw near and inspect the prison fare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1411"/>The eager rush for the large camp kettle by all who are fortunate enough to possess a tin cup shows that it contains something to drink.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1412"/>What it is depends on the hour of the day. If it is morning or evening the camp kettle contains coffee (so-called). If the hour is noon, the immense cauldron contains bean soup.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1413"/>But as the same vessel brings coffee in the morning and soup at <time value="12pm">noon</time>, it would be no very easy matter to decide by the taste which is coffee and which is soup.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1417"/>The square box contained <quote>hard tack,</quote> a kind of ship biscuit that would have been nutritious and wholesome if in good condition, but which was always stale, often moulded, not unfrequently wormy and putrescent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1418"/>These articles of diet, with once a week perhaps some <name>Irish</name> potatoes and an occasional change to fresh beef, constituted our prison diet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1419"/>The rancid meat and the musted bread, which made the staple of it, were utterly destructive of health, and had we not been provided with better food through the generosity of friends in <placeName key="tgn,7013352" n="1.000 5" reg="baltimore, baltimore independent city, maryland">Baltimore</placeName>, without the knowledge of the officers of the fort, few of us would have survived even the brief time of our imprisonment.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1420"/>That it was the design of the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities to subject us to these hardships I seriously question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1421"/>I think that in both Confederate and Federal prisons it will be found that most of the discomforts and privations came through the negligence or malice or greed of those to whom the care of the prisoners was immediately entrusted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1422"/>The assistant steward, who brought our rations to us, acknowledged, when closely pressed, that the rations served to us were not those issued to us by the <rs>Government</rs>, but damaged commissary stores that had been condemned for army use and sold at auction in <placeName key="tgn,7013352" n="1.000 5" reg="baltimore, baltimore independent city, maryland">Baltimore</placeName>, and which were bought by the steward of the prison for a mere trifle and issued to us, whilst the rations assigned us by the <rs>Government</rs> were converted to their own use and disposed of at high rates of profit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1423"/>We did not live upon these rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1424"/>Kind friends in <placeName key="tgn,7013352" n="1.000 5" reg="baltimore, baltimore independent city, maryland">Baltimore</placeName> supplied us from time to time with money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1425"/>Cooked vegetables and fruits were brought every day into the barracks for sale, and we were thus enabled to purchase what was needful to our comfort and health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1426"/>Indeed, if the friends of the <rs>South</rs> in <placeName key="tgn,7013352" n="1.000 5" reg="baltimore, baltimore independent city, maryland">Baltimore</placeName> had been permitted to do for us all that their generous hearts prompted, our every want would have been supplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1427"/>Day after day we saw carriages enter the fort laden with blankets and clothing, while the white handkerchiefs waved to us as the carriages swept by showed us that these supplies were designed for us. They never reached us, however, and though many of our number were in threadbare clothing, and during the latter part of our stay shivering with cold, the only supplies of clothing they received were those which by secret channels of communication were conveyed to us by friends <pb id="p.114" n="114"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1428"/>With the daily routine of our prison life I will not weary the reader, for its only peculiarity was its dull and wearisome monotony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1429"/>With nothing to occupy us from morning until night; chafing under a sense of our own unjust imprisonment, and oppressed with a sense of the misfortunes that crowded thick and fast upon our beloved country; cut off from books and ordinary sources of recreation; forbidden the privilege of receiving visits from friends in <placeName key="tgn,7013352" n="1.000 5" reg="baltimore, baltimore independent city, maryland">Baltimore</placeName>; our only communications with home being through the doubtful and unsatisfactory medium of the flag of truce correspondence; our only news from the war coming through the fallacious bulletins of the <rs>Northern</rs> press, it required a constant struggle, as the prison discipline grew more harsh and the hope of release more distant, to ward off that prison melancholy which is so sure a precursor of debility and disease.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1430"/>The usual expedients were resorted to for the purpose of driving away dull care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1431"/>There was all manner of cunning artifice in wood, in gutta-percha, in ivory and in silver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1432"/>Rings, chains, breastpins, lockets, charms, &amp;c., were made and exchanged with the guard for rations or kept as mementoes for the loved ones at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1433"/>Then there was the writing and receiving of underground letters, the rehearsal of the stories of camp life, speculations upon the state of the country, discussion and criticism of military movements, the planning of imaginary campaigns, the achievement of imaginary victories, &amp;c. As these lost their novelty, and the spirits of the party began to flag, the more bouyant amongst us resorted to fresh and somewhat juvenile methods of diversion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1434"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> of all we organized ourselves into a regiment in burlesque of the splendidly equipped and caparisoned regiment which guarded the fort, and thus had the daily diversion, of guard-mounting and dress-parade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1435"/>The uniform of the regiment, it is needless to say, was not up to army regulations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1436"/>Most of us had come into the fort in badly damaged apparel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1437"/>Many had been supplied by the ladies of <placeName key="tgn,7013352" n="1.000 5" reg="baltimore, baltimore independent city, maryland">Baltimore</placeName> through <quote>underground</quote> channels of communication; but many were still somewhat threadbare, whilst of those who were supplied the fit of the uniform was not very exact, as our kind donors could not know the size of those whom they were to supply, and were obliged to send medium sizes of clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1438"/>And thus it occurred that when we were drawn up in line, here stood an officer of more than ordinary height of stature, his long arms protruding several inches through his coat sleeves, and by his side a small but ambitious little soldier, who looked for all the <pb id="p.115" n="115"/>world as if his coat had swallowed him. These fancy uniforms, capped with the far-famed Confederate hat, which assumed under exposure to the weather every hue of color and every possible transformation of shape, made up a regiment of which.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1440"/>The soldiers of the garrison had their guard mountings, and so had we. We were their prisoners &mdash; the rats were ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1441"/>Every morning our guard was duly mounted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1442"/>A sentinel was stationed at each hole where the rats were burrowing beneath our walls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1443"/>When the alarm was sounded and the enemy under chase, the <quote>Department of the <rs>Patapsco</rs></quote> expected every man to do his duty, and woe to the unfortunate sentinel who suffered the enemy to escape.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1444"/>The great event of the day in the <rs>Federal</rs> garrison was the brilliant dress parade, held every evening a little before sunset in full view of our barracks, and attended by many elegant people from the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1445"/>Our dress parade was our <hi rend="italics">chef d'ouvre</hi>, too, being held immediately after the other, just outside of our barracks and in view of a considerable portion of the garrison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1446"/>The Federal regiment prided itself on its band of music, the leader or drum-major of which was a handsome Pole, of almost giant stature, whose tall form was rendered still more imposing by his lofty <rs type="ship2">Cossack</rs> hat and plume, and by the immense mace which he balanced gracefully in his hand, marking time for his musicians as he led them along the line of flashing bayonets in the parade.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1447"/>We had a drum-major, too &mdash; a noble-hearted Virginian, whose hand I have recently had the pleasure of shaking at <placeName reg="Orange, Virginia" key="tgn,7014299">Orange Court-house</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1448"/>Nearly as tall as the <name>Pole</name>, we made up the additional height by stacking some of our old Confederate farmer-shaped hats <num value="1">one</num> upon another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1449"/>He had carved out of wood a fair counterpart of the mace of his <name>Yankee</name> rival, and, when thus equipped, he moved up and down along the line of the regiment, followed by his band, <num value="1">one</num> with <num value="0.5">a half</num> flour-barrel suspended from his neck for a drum, another with <num value="2">two</num> tin plates as cymbals, <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> with an old cracked flageolet which had been thrown away by some soldier of the fort, and the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> with a coarse comb, covered with a slip of paper, after the well-remembered mechanism of our childhood, the scene was striking beyond description, especially when, as was generally the case, the full power of the orchestra was exhausted upon Hail Columbia, <persName n="Doodle,,Yankee,,," id="n0121.0023.00115.01124" reg="default:Doodle,Yankee,,,"><foreName>Yankee</foreName> <surname>Doodle</surname></persName>, or some other favorite National <hi rend="italics">air</hi>. <pb id="p.116" n="116"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1450"/>Then again, for the entertainment of lonely evenings, we organized a <orgName n="Literary Society" type="society">literary society</orgName>, which held its meetings once or twice a week, immediately after supper, and which numbered some <num value="20">twenty</num> or more clever debaters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1451"/>Many and various were the subjects discussed; vast and heterogeneous the stores of original thought evolved by men who had no access to books, and amidst throes which attested the profoundness of that vasty deep from which the treasures were being drawn up. It is a matter of profound regret that no stenographer was present, and that thus all these purely original thoughts have been lost to the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1453"/>It would naturally be supposed, the debates which awakened most interest were those in which woman was in some way involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1454"/>On these occasions not only would every Rebel be in place to hear the discussion, but <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>, too, would crowd around us. Even Federal captains and lieutenants would swell the line of blue coats that formed a cordon about our quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1455"/>The usual taps for extinction of lights would be disregarded, and the discussion ran on towards the hour of midnight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1456"/>Then, alas for the speaker who was appointed to defend the side of the question which was unfavorable to woman, and thus go against the popular current!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1457"/>He might plead with the eloquence of a Demosthenes, or the smooth persuasion of a Tully; his logic might be irrefragable, his arguments conclusive, his positions impregnable; but no inspiring applause greeted his most masterly efforts, while his opponent was cheered at every point, and in the final vote the unlucky orator was sure to be in a lean and helpless minority.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1458"/>Well do I remember when it was made my duty to defend the negative in the question, <quote>Is love a safe guide in the formation of matrimonial alliances?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1459"/>I traversed, as far as I could in unaided memory, all history and literature to establish the proverbial blindness of love &mdash; then entered the domain of poetry and art, painting <persName n="Cupid,,,,," id="n0121.0023.00116.01125" reg="mostcommon:Cupid,nomatch:0"><surname>Cupid</surname></persName> the blind boy, as <placeName reg="Aurora, Kane, Illinois" key="tgn,2026429">Aurora</placeName> with her rosy fingers drew aside the curtains of the dawn, and <persName n="Apollo,,,,," id="n0121.0023.00116.01126" reg="mostcommon:Apollo,nomatch:0"><surname>Apollo</surname></persName>, <name n="God" type="God">god</name> of day, drove his fiery steeds up along the eastern sky, whilst the poor boy groped in his blindness and shot his arrows at random through the air. Then I entered the domain of Metaphysics, and with Kaut's marvellous trichotomy as my guide, showed how in that <num value="3">three</num>-fold adjustment of man's nature <name n="God" type="God">god</name>-like reason was designed to sit upon the <pb id="p.117" n="117"/>throne, love with all other passions to be in subjection to its wise control &mdash; how perilous in its subversion of the order of nature, therefore, to make love, a mere passion of the soul, our guide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1460"/>Thus, mingling sentiment with argument, and alternating between pathos and invective, I gave my best energies to the subject, and sat down at length amidst a feeble effort at applause, which, as I saw, came from my colleague appointed on the same side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1461"/>And when the final vote was taken, my voice was the only <num value="1">one</num> heard in the negative, even my colleague having ingloriously deserted me and whipped over to the other side.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1462"/>When our stock of available questions had run low and interest in our society began to flag, the expedient was resorted to of re-enacting the celebrated scene in the debating club so graphically described by <persName n="Longstreet,Judge,,,," id="n0121.0023.00117.01127" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,J.,,,:1"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> in the <title><placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> scenes.</title>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1463"/>Many of you remember the question in that famous debate, <quote>Whether, in popular elections, the vote of factions should predominate according to the bias of jurisprudence, or according to the force of internal suggestion.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1464"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> it was proposed to introduce the same question, but as it was found that <num value="1">one</num> of the proposed debaters was familiar with the debate in <title><placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> scenes,</title> it was found necessary to substitute another; and so, after considerable conference amongst those admitted to the secret, the following question was agreed upon and announced, <quote>Whether the foundations of wise legislation are to be sought in the inherent principles of social ethics, or in the philosophy of practical utility.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1465"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> speaker in the affirmative was a youthful chaplain, who had been until recently a private in the ranks, and for whom a chaplain's commission had been procured by way of promotion for gallantry in the ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1466"/>He was as modest and retiring as a woman, though brave and generous almost to a fault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1467"/>As his name was called and he took his place upon the floor, it was evident that he was not at allat ease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1468"/>He began by saying that the question was a new and difficult <num value="1">one</num>, that he undertook its discussion with great diffidence and hoped all due indulgence would be given him. He then proceeded to state as clearly as he could what he conceived to be the question for discussion, and had about gotten before the house a question which was susceptible of debate, when the president interrupted him by saying that whilst the question which he was discussing was a very interesting <num value="1">one</num>, he must remind him that it was not the question of the evening and he would please confine his remarks to the subject immediately under debate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1469"/>The <pb id="p.118" n="118"/>face of the speaker crimsoned, he stammered a little, but recovered his self-possession and with heroic courage returned to the question as originally propounded, and again attempted a definition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1470"/>Scarcely, however, had the question begun to assume tangible shape, when the president again called him to order, stating that he had manifestly wandered from the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1471"/>The situation was now not only critical but perilous for our young orator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1472"/>The great beads of perspiration were upon his brow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1473"/>His knees, unconsciously to himself, were smiting together; his fingers were nervously plying as if to catch the thin air by his side; a faint, half-choking <quote><rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs></quote> ; a somewhat more audible repetition after a long pause, <quote><rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs></quote> ; <num value="0.5">a half</num>-vacant stare around the room as if he would catch the lost thread of his argument in the look of some <num value="1">one</num> of his hearers; then the light play of a smile upon his features, as he began to realize the ludicrousness of the situation, a smile followed by a simultaneous outburst of laughter and shouts of huzzah from the audience, in the midst of which the discomfited orator retired, losing himself from view in the depths of the throng.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1474"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> speaker in the negative was then called, but was shrewd enough to baffle us by entering a plea, sustained by the president, that as no argument had been advanced on the affirmative side, he had the right to withhold his rejoinder until the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> affirmative had spoken.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1475"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> affirmative was therefore called for, and a surgeon responded, <num value="1">one</num> of those ready speakers whose boast it was that he was always ready to speak, and that the more abstruse the subject the better suited to his tastes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1476"/>He began by saying that he was exceedingly gratified that the subject now under consideration had been chosen for discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1477"/>It was <num value="1">one</num> to the study of which he had. devoted much attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1478"/>Indeed, its importance could not be overestimated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1479"/>It was the neglect of this great question on the part of our statesmen which had deluged the land in blood, dismembered a once prosperous and happy republic, arrayed brother against brother in fratricidal strife, &amp;c. After this telling introduction, he proceeded to state that there were <num value="2">two</num> great sources of knowledge &mdash; intuitive or <hi rend="italics">a priori</hi> convictions, and inductive or a <hi rend="italics">posteori</hi> conclusions &mdash; that from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these we derive the inherent principles of social ethics, and from the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> the philosophy of practical utility; that the question, therefore, resolves itself into this, whether we are to be governed by <hi rend="italics">a priori</hi> and intuitive convictions of conscience, or by <hi rend="italics">a posteori</hi> and inductive <pb id="p.119" n="119"/>experiences of reason?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1480"/>and was just proceeding to launch out upon this question when the president very blandly interposed with the statement that he had slightly wandered from the question, which had nothing to do with <hi rend="italics">a priori</hi> or <hi rend="italics">a posteori</hi>, but was a question as to the true basis of legislation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1481"/>The speaker bowed politely, though it was evident that he was very much disconcerted, and, being a passionate man, somewhat angered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1482"/>He said, however, pleasantly that if the president would bear with him for a moment he would convince him that his wandering from the question was only apparent and not real; that the president well remembered the <num value="2">two</num> great ethical schools of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> at the close of the last century, the <num value="1">one</num> having its highest exponent in <persName n="Paley,,,,," id="n0121.0023.00119.01128" reg="mostcommon:Paley,nomatch:0"><surname>Paley</surname></persName>, whose cardinal doctrine was that expediency was the sole ground of right; the other in <persName n="Reid,,,,," id="n0121.0023.00119.01129" reg="mostcommon:Reid,James,D.,,:1"><surname>Reid</surname></persName>, the great master of the intuitional or common sense school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1483"/>He was proceeding most eloquently to defend the intuitional school, when the president again called him to order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1484"/>This time the rising storm of anger was apparent, but he checked it, righted himself gallantly and made <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> sally and a <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>, only each time to be interrupted by the mild voice of the president, and to be provoked by a suppressed titter in the audience, until at length, when for the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> time the president had interfered, he turned with flushed face, his eyes fairly flashing fire, and exclaimed, <quote>But I say, sir, I <hi rend="italics">am</hi> in order.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1485"/><quote>But I say, sir,</quote> said the president, <quote>you are <hi rend="italics">not</hi> in order.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1486"/><quote>Then, sir,</quote> said he, advancing and bringing his clenched fist down in a menacing attitude, <quote>I would like to know what in the thunder you call being in order?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1487"/>The explosion that followed put an end to the discussion for the evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1488"/>The committee on questions felt it necessary for a little while to avoid the presence of the <quote><num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> affirmative,</quote> but his good nature soon got the better of him, and he laughed as heartily as any of us over the joke at his expense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1560"/>Into the house these ruffians came, searched every room, took mattresses and beds from their steads, searched trunks, boxes, wardrobes, bureaus and closets, appropriating whatever suited their fancy &mdash; the winter wrappings of <persName n="Randolph,Doctor,,,," id="n0121.0026.00124.01196" reg="nearbymention:Randolph,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Randolph</surname></persName> and my little son, coats, pantaloons (new black broadcloth), knives, candlesticks, &amp;c.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1561"/>For this I was called to account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1562"/>If every button were a shell, and the poor gray material so much gunpowder to which we intended applying a match in their presence, more indignation could not be expressed, than has ever been by them, at the criminality of any <num value="1">one</num> who should dare to have under his roof these instruments of so much evil.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1563"/>This set had hardly left before another, to whom they had showed their booty, returned and followed in the steps of their worthy predecessors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1564"/>At last roused from my feeling of helplessness, I determined to follow, and seeing <num value="1">one</num> more blind to the right and more determined to do the wrong, I asked his comrades, <quote>Do you know whether this man ever had a mother or sisters, or have any of you ever had them?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1568"/>Nevertheless the search was made, and you know not how contemptible it appears to see men in the garb of soldiers searching chambers, closets, garrets and cellars for those trophies which <hi rend="italics">brave</hi> men find elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1577"/>We were told by many that the determination of these ruffians was to burn our house on the following <rs>Friday</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1580"/>This was achieved; but I can give no idea of the malignity and threats of their leader, who had been appealed to. Until the following <name>Wednesday</name> week some of our neighbors shared these persecutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1581"/>On the evening of that day, as night closed in, a <num value="100">hundred</num> infantry and cavalry and <num value="4">four</num> wagons &mdash; loaded with <quote>contrabands</quote> --collected from the neighborhood arrived and remained <measure n="15hours" type="date">fifteen hours</measure>! <num value="6">Six</num> officers lodged in our house and eat at our table; immediately on rising from which, the captain, without even an <name>Indian</name>'s sense of honor, commenced the work of spoliation by appropriating a handsome pair of spurs, telling his host he would not protect his property, and giving his men permission to take <pb id="p.127" n="127"/>whatever they could lay their hands on. I will not attempt a description of the scene &mdash; their rudeness, their profanity, their entire want of principle, and our indescribable disgust while they were here, or relief when they departed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1582"/>It is disagreeable and irksome to recall these brutalities, but very right that officers having the feelings of gentlemen should be acquainted with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1587"/>This, sir, is a copy of a letter written to the officer then in command, but laid aside because, probably, our persecutions had ceased, and if so I was willing to <quote>forgive,</quote> if I could not forget, the past; but after numberless calls for food, <num value="60">sixty</num> of them came with great secrecy on the night of the <dateStruct value="-01-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1591"/>It was completely desolated when (just as the day was dawning) we went round to see the work of destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1592"/>You may judge how we (<num value="2">two</num> ladies and <num value="2">two</num> children) passed this night of terrors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1593"/>Several <pb id="p.128" n="128"/>of the soldiers, if not all, were intoxicated, and the officer could not be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1594"/>On the following <rs>Saturday</rs> a large body passed, and <num value="3">three</num> preceded them; examined the stables, and left before the others came up, who, much to our relief, were not permitted to come in.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1595"/>He told them there was no use in his resisting <num value="3">three</num> armed men, and they took it, of course &mdash; a handsome gold watch, with a hunting scene engraved on each side of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1596"/>After taking it, they refused to let him go in the direction of the officers and force approaching; and we hope this highway robbery would not be sanctioned by those in authority, though there are many proofs to the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1597"/>For the sake of civilization and humanity, I wish I could say my sketches are ended; but about dusk yesterday evening an alarm was given that Federal soldiers were approaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1598"/>Though not afraid, more nervous or disagreeable sensations could scarcely be felt had they been really savages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1599"/>As usual, every door and shutter were closed; but they again passed on, and we, hoping they would return another way, dismissed our uncomfortable anticipations, and after awhile my mother and my <num value="2">two</num> children began their employments, while I read aloud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1600"/>About <time value="8:30">half-past 8</time> heavy steps were heard approaching the house, and the clanking of swords aroused every slumbering nerve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1601"/>Down the porch they came, to the door near my chamber, where we were sitting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1602"/>Admittance was immediately demanded, and on asking who was there, the reply was, <quote>Soldiers!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1604"/>When it was opened, we were confronted by <num value="16">sixteen</num> or <num value="18">eighteen</num> armed men, their leader having as much audacity in his countenance as in his language and manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1605"/><quote>I want something for these men to eat, and I want it directly,</quote> with an effort to get in; but the entry was small, and we were all against the door, so that room for ingress could not be gained without actual force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1612"/>This was most cutting, and continued to be throughout the visit, though it evidently restrained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1615"/>was the response, and feeling the <pb id="p.129" n="129"/>inconsistency of such conduct with the character to which he aspired, he turned to the direction indicated; seemed glad to get to the dining-room fire, and called for ham, milk, tumblers, &amp;c.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1616"/>They left the impression, from all we could observe, that <persName n="Randolph,Doctor,,,," id="n0121.0026.00129.01205" reg="nearbymention:Randolph,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Randolph</surname></persName> was the object of pursuit, and we told them without hesitation that he had not returned; that he was visiting his children; and of this I had spoken in all my letters to my son on <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0121.0026.00129.01206" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,B.,R.,,:5"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s island &mdash; never supposing it punishable or criminal to gratify those yearnings natural to all &mdash; to behold the faces and enjoy the society of those we love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/>We reached the battlefield of <dateStruct value="-07-1"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="1">1st</day></dateStruct> toward evening of that day, and marching through a part of the town and along the <rs>Gettysburg</rs> and <orgName n="York Railroad" type="railroad">York railroad</orgName>, formed line of battle to the northeast, our front facing the south and our <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> in a skirt of woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1662"/>The <num value="4" type="ordinal">Fourth</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="2Brigade">Second brigades</orgName> were on our right, the <quote><persName n="Stonewall,,,,," id="n0121.0027.00132.01212" reg="mostcommon:Stonewall,nomatch:0"><surname>Stonewall</surname></persName></quote> on our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1663"/>We slept on our arms that night.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1664"/>At about <time value="3pm">3 o'clock P. M.</time> the following day the enemy's and our own batteries opened fire, and the shelling was very heavy for several hours; the brigade, however, suffered but little, being protected by the woods and behind rising ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1665"/>Our pickets, which had been stationed <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure> in front of our line the night previous, were relieved at about <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time> by <num value="4">four</num> companies of skirmishers from the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA23">Twenty-third Virginia</orgName>, and shortly afterward the brigade was formed in line of battle and moved forward.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1666"/>The hill where the enemy was strongly entrenched and from which we were ordered to drive him lay in a southwesterly direction from our position, and accordingly our <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> was obliged to swing around by a right half wheel, and the brigade thus formed front toward the west by south.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>The enemy's skirmishers fell back rapidly as we advanced <pb id="p.133" n="133"/>through the fields and across <placeName key="tgn,2623544" n="1.000 1" reg="rock creek, menard, illinois">Rock creek</placeName>, they suffering slightly and inflicting little or no injury.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>The <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> of the brigade crossed the creek considerably in advance of the centre and <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName>, owing to the fact that the order to move by a right half wheel was not immediately understood on the left, and also to the greater number of natural obstacles to be overcome by that part of the brigade.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1669"/>The slope of the hill above referred to, at the point where the brigade crossed the creek, commences about <measure n="50feet" type="distance">fifty feet</measure> from the bank, and being thickly wooded the charge of our <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> was made under great disadvantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1670"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="NC3">Third North Carolina</orgName> and <orgName type="regiment" key="MD1">First Maryland</orgName>, which were now entirely separated from the rest of the brigade, advanced up the hill, however, steadily towards the enemy's breastworks, the enemy falling slowly back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1671"/>Our loss was heavy, the fire being terrific and in part a cross fire.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>The order was now given by the <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs> Commanding to advance on our <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> as rapidly and as steadily as possible, which was done as soon as the regiments composing it could be hurried across the creek.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1673"/>The left of the brigade now rested very near <num value="1">one</num> line of the enemy's breastworks, which extended up the hill at right angles to the creek and then parallel with it on the summit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1674"/>The enemy's attention being called more especially to our right, this fortification was not occupied in force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="VA23">Twenty-third Virginia</orgName>, accordingly, under <persName n="Walton,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0121.0027.00133.01213" reg="mostcommon:Walton,J.,B.,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>Walton</surname></persName>, immediately charged the work and scattered the enemy which was behind it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1676"/>This regiment then filed to the right until it reached the portion of the breastworks which was at right angles to the part <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> captured.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1677"/>Forming in line on the flank and almost in rear of the enemy there stationed, it opened fire upon them, killing, wounding and capturing quite a number.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1678"/>The <num value="37" type="ordinal">Thirty-seventh</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="VA10">Tenth Virginia</orgName> and <orgName type="regiment" key="MD1">First Maryland</orgName> then came to the assistance of the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA23">Twenty-third Virginia</orgName> and fully occupied the works.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1679"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="NC3">Third North Carolina</orgName> still maintained its former exposed position, although its ammunition was nearly exhausted, notwithstanding the fact that the men had sought to replenish their cartridge-boxes from those of the wounded and dead.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1680"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="NC1">First North Carolina</orgName>, which had been kept in reserve, was at this crisis led by <persName n="McKim,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0121.0027.00133.01214" reg="nearbymention:McKim,R.,H.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>McKim</surname></persName> to its support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1681"/>The brigade, <pb id="p.134" n="134"/>with the exception of the <num value="2">two</num> <orgName type="mil" key="NCRegiment">North Carolina regiments</orgName>, was then formed in line of battle between the captured breastwork and a stone wall on the left of and parallel to it, from which position it was enabled to open a cross fire upon the enemy, doing considerable execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1682"/>More, however, might have been done had not the impression at this time prevailed that we were firing upon our friends, and the fire been discontinued at intervals.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1683"/>To ascertain the true state of the case, the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA10">Tenth Virginia</orgName>, under <persName n="Warren,Colonel,,,," id="n0121.0027.00134.01215" reg="mostcommon:Warren,E.,W.,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Warren</surname></persName> (which was on our extreme left and had formed a line at and perpendicular to the stone wall above referred to), changed front forward to the wall and then moved by the left flank along it, until it was supposed the regiment had gained the enemy's rear, when it opened fire and drove that part of the enemy's line back.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1684"/>Finding, however, the enemy in its own rear, as evinced by their fire, the regiment was compelled to change front to the rear and perpendicular to the wall, from behind which it repulsed a bayonet charge made by a regiment of the enemy, which emerged from a wood on the left of the stone wall.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1685"/>The enemy not renewing the attack, the brigade was ordered back to the works, where it was formed in line of battle, the <orgName type="regiment" key="MD1">First Maryland</orgName> on the right and <orgName type="regiment" key="VA10">Tenth Virginia</orgName> on the left; the <orgName type="mil" key="NCRegiment">North Carolina regiments</orgName> still remaining outside the breastworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1686"/>This reconnoissance, as well as the reports of scouts and the statements of prisoners, gave us the assurance that we had gained an admirable position.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1687"/>We had been but a short time behind the breastworks when at least <num value="2">two</num> regiments advanced from the wood to the left of the works and opened fire upon us, but they were soon driven back.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1688"/>The prisoners and wounded were sent a little to the rear, and our sufferers received such attention as could be given them by <persName n="Snowden,Doctor,,,," id="n0121.0027.00134.01216" reg="mostcommon:Snowden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Snowden</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Surgeon">Assistant Surgeon</rs> of the <rs>Maryland</rs> battalion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1689"/>The whole command rested from about <time value="11pm">11 P. M.</time> till about day-light, when the enemy opened a terrific fire of artillery and a very heavy fire of musketry upon us, occasioning no loss to the brigade, except to the <orgName type="regiment" key="MD1">First Maryland</orgName> and <orgName type="regiment" key="NC3">Third North Carolina</orgName>, which in part alternated positions behind the breastworks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1690"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="NC1">First North Carolina</orgName>, with the exception of <num value="4">four</num> companies, which had been stationed as a picket on the other side of the creek, was at this time formed to the left of the brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1691"/>At about <time value="10am">10 o'clock A. M.</time> the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA10">Tenth Virginia</orgName> was ordered to deploy as skirmishers <pb id="p.135" n="135"/>and clear the wood on our left of the enemy's skirmishers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1692"/>This was done, and the enemy was discovered in the woods, drawn up in line of battle, at not over <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure> from the west of the stone wall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1693"/>The brigade then formed in line of battle at right angles to the breastwork &mdash; in the following order: <orgName type="regiment" key="NC3">Third North Carolina</orgName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="MD1">First Maryland</orgName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="VA37">Thirty-seventh Virginia</orgName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="VA23">Twenty-third Virginia</orgName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="NC1">First North Carolina</orgName>--and charged towards the enemy's <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> breastworks, partly through an open field and partly through a wood, exposed to a very heavy fire of artillery and musketry, the latter in part a cross fire.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1694"/>The left of the brigade was the most exposed at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and did maintain its position in line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1695"/>The right thus in advance suffered very severely, and, being unsupported, wavered, and the whole line fell back, but in good order.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1696"/>The enemy's position was impregnable attacked by our small force, and any further effort to storm it would have been futile and attended with great disaster, if not total annihilation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1697"/>The brigade rallied quickly behind rocks and reformed behind the stone wall which ran parallel to the breastworks, where it remained about an hour exposed to a fire of artillery and infantry movie terrific than any experienced during the day, although less disastrous.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1698"/>Ultimately, in accordance with orders from the <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs> Commanding, the brigade fell back to the creek, where it remained the rest of the day, nearly half of it being deployed as skirmishers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1699"/>During the night the enemy advanced their line some distance beyond the breastworks, but were driven back to them again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1700"/>Toward midnight the brigade, with the rest of the division, recrossed the creek, and passing to the rear of the town, occupied and entrenched itself on the crest of the hill where the enemy had been posted on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of the engagement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1701"/>It affords me the greatest pleasure to say that the officers and men of the brigade, with a few exceptions of the latter, conducted themselves most gallantly, and bore the fatigue and privations of several days in a soldierlike manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1935"/>The question of a Confederate flag and seal has again begun to excite attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1936"/>It might perhaps be thought that while matters of absolutely vital importance to the <rs>Confederacy</rs> were forcing themselves upon the notice of Congress, the adoption of a flag and seal should be deferred until there was time for the indulgence of an asthetical taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1937"/>The currency, the life-blood of the country, is disordered; food, the staff of life of the people, is scarce, and until some remedy for the financial malady can be supplied, and some means for obtaining a larger supply of provisions can be hit upon, it might seem idle to be troubling ourselves with heraldic studies and the beauty of a banner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1938"/>Still the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs> must have a seal, and our people are tired of looking at the poor imitation of the stars and stripes which floats from our public buildings and military posts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1941"/>It may be recollected that this choice was made in consequence of the difficulty that had been seriously felt in the <rs n="First Battle of Manassas" type="battle">first battle of Manassas</rs> in distinguishing between the <rs>Yankee</rs> colors and our own, and at a time when the <num value="2">two</num> hostile armies were confronting each other on the plains of <placeName reg="Fairfax, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,7014159">Fairfax</placeName>, with the prospect of a renewal of the bloody fight at any moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1942"/>Haste was necessary in the preparation of the flags, and secresy was also desirable lest the enemy should discover our change of colors and provide themselves with counterfeits to be basely used for our destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1946"/>No great harm was done by the disclosure, however, and when next the brave troops of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> went into the fight those flags were seen dancing in the breeze, the symbol of hope to the defenders of our liberty, wherever the fire was deadliest over the crimsoned field, borne always aloft where follower and foe might behold it; ever the chosen perch of victory ere the fight was done.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1972"/>Gentlemen &mdash; I sympathize most heartily with you in the article in your last number relative to the <rs>Confederate</rs> battleflag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1973"/>A new flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1974"/>What, in the name of <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n0121.0032.00157.01446" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName>, do we want with a new flag?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1975"/>We have had new ones enough already.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1976"/>I was originally in favor of retaining the old flag &mdash; that <quote><orgName n="Star Spangled Banner" type="newspaper">Star spangled banner</orgName>,</quote> at whose very name our hearts were wont to thrill &mdash; over decks, where the haughty cross of <placeName key="tgn,2119878" n="1.000 4" reg="saint george, tucker, west virginia">Saint George</placeName> and the vaunted tri-color had been humbled &mdash; on fields, whose names will live forever in song and story, that flag had floated triumphantly; and who shall say that its victories were less the reward of Southern than Northern valor?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1977"/>The blood of our fathers had been shed for it &mdash; a Southerner had hymned it in a strain which had become a national anthem; we were as much the original government as the <rs>North</rs>, and as much entitled to retain the original flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1978"/>So I thought, but others thought differently, and before the infant Confederacy had yet a flag or a government, we belted on our weapons, and gave to the winds of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> the cross of <placeName reg="Carolina City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2222249">Carolina</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1980"/>It retained most of the distinctive features of the old flag, but was still thought to differ from it sufficiently; but the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> field of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> proved that it was a mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1981"/>The Union was the same, the colors were all the same; and when the flags drooped &lsquo;round the staff in that sultry <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> day, it was impossible to distinguish them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1982"/>There was no difficulty, however, when the flags were spread by the breeze, and I see no reason why the <quote>stars and bars</quote> should not still continue to float above all forts, ships and arsenals of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/>But we needed another battleflag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1984"/>Glorious <quote>Old Joe</quote> willed it, and the <rs>Southern</rs> cross rose brightly in the bloody field among the constellations of war. It fulfilled all the desiderata of a battleflag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1985"/>Its brilliant colors made it visible at a great distance, and there was no danger of mistaking it for the flag of any other nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1986"/>Since that time it has become historic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1987"/>Displayed on a <num value="100">hundred</num> stricken fields, it has never been dishonored.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2004"/>Allow me, General, to add a few words on the merits of the proposed alteration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2005"/>Under the present act of Congress the proportions of the flag are incorrect, the length being double the width, which is against all rule, and a flag so made will not float.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2006"/>The <num value="1">one</num> now used over the <placeName reg="Capitol, Salt Lake, Utah" key="tgn,2220712">capitol</placeName> is not according to law, but is correctly proportioned, having the width <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of the length, so that the proportions at least will have to be changed, and while under amendment it is proposed to improve the field of the flag also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2007"/>It has been ascertained by practical use in the army and navy that our flag is very easily soiled from its excessive whiteness, and it is especially liable to this objection on steam vessels, which are rapidly superceding all other ships of war. The portion of the flag proposed to be changed to a red bar is the part, too, most rapidly defaced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2008"/>It is strongly urged by naval officers of high standing that our flag is liable to be mistaken for a flag of truce, particularly in a calm, when it hangs dead against the mast and the union is obscured by the white bunting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2009"/>When seen at a distance, flags are generally displayed against the white clouds beyond, and hence want of distinctness is a great defect in the present flag, the <pb id="p.160" n="160"/>union being the only portion seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2010"/>It was hurriedly adopted at the very close of a session of the last Congress, as the best they could do under the multiplicity of plans submitted, and when the contest really was whether the battleflag should form a part of it. See accompanying letter from <persName n="Boteler,Colonel,A.,R.,," id="n0121.0032.00160.01471" reg="default:Boteler,A.,R.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Boteler</surname></persName>, chairman of the <rs>Committee</rs> on Flag and Seal of last Congress, in favor of this amendment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2011"/>I respectfully submit that the bill before the <name>Senate</name> removes all the objections urged against the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2012"/>It gives it correctness of proportion, distinctness and character, renders it fit for practical use and presents a beautiful standard, which, under no circumstances, can be mistaken for a flag of truce or for the flag of any other nation on earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2013"/>It relieves the flag of its pale-faced appearance and makes it look more martial.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2014"/>The battleflag selected by <persName n="Johhston,General,,,," id="n0121.0032.00160.01472" reg="mostcommon:Johhston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johhston</surname></persName>, and recommended by himself and <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0121.0032.00160.01473" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,G.,T.,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, under which so much blood has been spilled in our struggle for independence, is fully displayed as the union of the proposed flag, which can only be done by surrounding it with white, and the red bar, forming the outer half of the field from the union, is suggested as the best design for its improvement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2015"/>I am opposed to all stripes, many or few, <rs type="color">red</rs> or <rs type="color">blue</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2016"/>Instead of <quote>the <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName>,</quote> let us have <hi rend="italics">the <name>Stars</name> and Bars</hi>. The colors of the new flag would be chiefly <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">red</rs> with as little as possible of the <rs>Yankee</rs> blue.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2017"/>The heraldic significance of these colors is deemed especially appropriate for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>--the white (<hi rend="italics">argent</hi>) being emblematic of purity and innocence, and the red (<hi rend="italics">gules</hi>) of fortitude and courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2018"/>In the adoption of ensigns by various nations of the world, it is noticed by <persName n="Hamilton,Captain,,,," id="n0121.0032.00160.01474" reg="mostcommon:Hamilton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Hamilton</surname></persName>, in the history of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> flag, that they generally imitate the ensigns of the nations from which they sprung.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2019"/>This rule is complied with in the flag as proposed, for our people are chiefly descended from the <rs>British</rs> and <rs>French</rs>, and we get the union and cross of <placeName key="possibilities=11" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Saint Andrew</placeName> from the former and the red bar from the flag of the latter nation, while the idea of having stars to represent the <name>States</name> respectively is taken from the flag of the old Union, mainly founded by our forefathers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2020"/>The new flag is easily made and is without the complication of any painting, which, besides the difficulty of correct execution, soon rots the bunting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2021"/>The proportions, while most pleasing to the eye, possess the virtue of simplicity &mdash; the white below and on side of union being same width as the red bar. They have been approved by some of the best artists in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and after a careful examination have been pronounced correct by some of the most experienced officers of the navy, such as <persName n="Forrest,Commodore,,,," id="n0121.0032.00160.01475" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,N.,Bedford,,:4"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Forrest</surname></persName>, <persName n="Semmes,Captain,Raphael,,," id="n0121.0032.00160.01476" reg="default:Semmes,Raphael,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>Raphael</foreName> <surname>Semmes</surname></persName>, <persName n="Lee,Captain,S.,S.,," id="n0121.0032.00160.01477" reg="default:Lee,S.,S.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, <persName n="Mason,Captain,,,," id="n0121.0032.00160.01478" reg="mostcommon:Mason,Emily,V.,,:3"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Parker,Captain,W.,H.,," id="n0121.0032.00160.01479" reg="default:Parker,W.,H.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName>, the latter being at the head of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> <orgName n="Naval Academy" type="academy">Naval Academy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2022"/>Your committee has been furnished by the <rs type="role" reg="Quartermaster-General">Quartermaster General</rs> with a model flag, made in strict accordance therewith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2023"/>It may be proper to add that this improvement of the flag is advocated by almost the entire <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 21" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> <pb id="p.161" n="161"/>press.

<head>Paper <num value="3">no. 3</num>--conclusion.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2046"/>To <num value="1">one</num> other of our prison diversions I must briefly introduce you. I refer to the regimental courts-martial held as occasion required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2047"/><num value="1">One</num> of these will give an idea of the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2048"/>Among the petty annoyances to which we were subjected &mdash; for which, however, we could not blame our captors &mdash; was the custom on the part of some of the younger and less scrupulous portion of our number to circulate unfounded rumors of our prospective release, or <quote>grape-vine telegrams,</quote> as they were called.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2049"/>The graver and more credulous part of the body would accept them all as true, would each roll up carefully his blanket, fasten his tin cup and wooden fork to his haversack and swing them about his neck, and take his seat near the door, meekly and patiently but in vain waiting for the order to <quote>fall in for exchange.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2050"/>This practice became so great a nuisance that our <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> issued an order at length, at <num value="1">one</num> of our evening dress-parades, that the next member of his command who was guilty of circulating a false rumor of exchange should be subjected to court-martial.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2051"/>Now in the number of our chaplains was an old minister of the <orgName n="Baptist Church" type="church">Baptist Church</orgName>, a most estimable gentleman, and <num value="1">one</num> who contributed in many ways to our enjoyment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2052"/>He was withal of a mechanical turn of mind, and as our soup-coffee and coffee-soup were usually lukewarm before they reached us, he resolved to construct an apparatus for warming them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2053"/>The earth had been cut away at <num value="1">one</num> end of the barracks, leaving a steep embankment just outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2054"/>In this he constructed a flue of such a kind that a range of cups could be placed on it, and the shavings made by the prisoners in whittling rendered available for heating purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2055"/>The work was somewhat difficult with the tools he had. When completed and the fuel applied, it proved to be like the <rs>Irishman</rs>'s chimney, which, he said, <quote>drew finely if it was only bottom end up.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2056"/>He was greatly perplexed at its perversity, and when some <num value="1">one</num> inquired of him as he was half stifled with the smoke, when his cooking range would be ready, he replied that he expected we <quote>would all be exchanged and get home before <hi rend="italics">that thing</hi> would begin to draw.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2057"/>In a few minutes the <quote>thing</quote> was drawing <pb id="p.164" n="164"/>finely; and this, coupled with the previous remark, was made a subject of complaint to the <rs>Colonel</rs>, who ordered a court-martial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2058"/>The trial was held, contrary to military usage, in the presence of a vast assemblage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2059"/>The prisoner was ably defended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2060"/>The counsel <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> resolved to attempt the proof of an alibi, by showing that the prisoner was sick that day and could not have been present at the time and place specified; but the prosecution thwarted this by introducing a witness who testified that he had seen him on that very day with an immense wooden harpoon fishing in the great cauldron of soup for a piece of <quote>salt horse</quote> that had been left there, the judge-advocate pleading overwhelmingly that no man whose digestion was impaired by sickness could have borne the sight and smell of the nauseous mess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2061"/>As quite a number of the officers and soldiers of the fort were present, the effect of the vivid description of our prison fare by the judge-advocate may be well conceived.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2062"/>The counsel for the defence at length agreed to risk the prisoner's fate upon a plea of insanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2063"/>And a strong case they succeeded in making.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2064"/>They pointed to the strange under-ground tunnel as a clear evidence of mental aberration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2065"/>They reviewed his whole course since he had been in the fort; they attributed his insanity to the hard life and unwholesome fare, which they denounced in unmeasured terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2066"/>But the court found a verdict of guilty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2067"/>He was sentenced to be reprimanded publicly on dress-parade, and to be fed until further orders on <quote>hard tack</quote> and <quote>salt horse</quote> --our common prison fare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2068"/>That evening at dress-parade; the public reprimand was duly administered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2069"/><rs type="role2">Chaplain</rs> C. was called out in front of the command and listened meekly with uncovered head whilst the <rs>Colonel</rs> (a young <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Surgeon">Assistant Surgeon</rs>, somewhat given to wildness) delivered a homily to him on the impropriety of his conduct, so unbecoming to him and so dishonoring to the command.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2070"/>Thus the days and weeks rolled away in the midst of high-hearted resolve not to give way to despondency, and of constant and yet ever-varying expedients to rally the spirits of those who were becoming depressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2071"/>No <num value="1">one</num> who has not experienced it knows anything of the depressing influence of continued imprisonment, with the mind shut off from its ordinary lines of thought, and the heart from its customary channels of communion with those it loves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2072"/>He who has passed through the same experience will readily understand me when I say, that notwithstanding all <pb id="p.165" n="165"/>my resolve not to be disheartened, and the supports which came from an unshaken trust in the overruling providence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, I have often paced up and down through the long night, along the narrow beat allotted to us outside the barracks, with an eye as sleepless and a step as ceaseless as that of the sentinel whose eye was upon me and whose bayonet flashed in the moonlight as he watched me from the <quote>dead line,</quote> only a few paces away.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2073"/>Many, of course, were the efforts made to escape &mdash; some of them ingeniously planned, but all by <num value="1">one</num> contingency and another brought to nought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2074"/><num value="1">One</num> method of escape was always open to us &mdash; that of bribing the guards, there being very few sentinels over us whose virtue commanded a higher price than a <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollar</measure> greenback for each person desiring to escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2075"/>To this method most of us were conscientiously opposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2076"/>I would have remained there to the close of the war before I would have placed such a temptation in the way of an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2077"/>Others were not of such tender conscience; and at length, worn by long imprisonment and wearied by long delay, <num value="4">four</num> chaplains and <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> surgeons bribed the guard and made their escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2078"/>It cost me a great struggle not to join them, but I was thankful afterwards that I did not, for within a very days and before they had made their way through great hardships to <placeName reg="Fort Dixie">Dixie</placeName>, the order came for our release, and we were safely landed on Southern soil.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2079"/>Their departure, however, led to a denouement in connection with our release, to which I must, in closing, refer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2080"/>As the roll-call had for some time been dispensed with, the escape of the prisoners had not been detected, but now, as the chaplains were to be released, the roll would, of course, be called, and the escape of the <num value="4">four</num> would be detected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2081"/>This would lead to a roll-call of the surgeons (the order for whose release had not been been received), and when it was found that <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> surgeons had escaped, the remainder would be subjected to closer confinement and more stringent discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2082"/>To avoid this, <num value="4">four</num> surgeons determined to play the role of the missing chaplains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2083"/>It was a very hazardous experiment, as most of the chaplains were personally known to the officers of the fort, and a detection of the ruse would probably lead to the retention of the whole body of chaplains in prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2084"/>But bold as the expedient was, it was immediately put into execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2085"/>An old razor was brought into requisition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2086"/>The largest coats in the party were put at the disposal of the adventurous <num value="4">four</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2087"/>A very grave and reverend air was assumed, and they took their places in <pb id="p.166" n="166"/>line, and we were all marched to the wharf, where <persName n="Mulford,Colonel,,,," id="n0121.0033.00166.01507" reg="mostcommon:Mulford,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Mulford</surname></persName>'s flag-of-truce boat awaited us. As each chaplain's name was called, he was required to step to the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2088"/>The counting went on well until the last name was called &mdash; that of <rs type="role2">Chaplain</rs> B, when a tall, handsome surgeon, clerically shorn and dressed, stepped to the front, and a Federal soldier, recognizing him, whispered to the <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">Provost-Marshal</rs>: <quote>That is not <rs type="role2">Chaplain</rs> B.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2089"/><quote>Who is it, then?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2090"/><quote>It is <rs type="role2">Surgeon</rs> R----.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2091"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">Provost-Marshal</rs> looked confused for a moment, and said to his clerk: <quote>How many chaplains ought there to be?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2092"/>The clerk answered, <quote><num value="14">Fourteen</num>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2093"/><quote>Count the men, sir.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2094"/>We were duly counted and found to be exectly <num value="14">fourteen</num>, and without further ado, marched on board the vessel for <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>, where, in due time, we arrived, and after some preliminaries stood once more upon the soil and beneath the flag of our Confederacy, amidst the dearly welcomes and warm congratulations of friends.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2095"/>Here my narrative, properly speaking, ends, but there is <num value="1">one</num> incident which, even though it be by way of postscript, I must append.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2096"/>In <num value="1">one</num> of the hospitable homes of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 21" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, whose intimacies I was permitted to share, there was a comfortable chamber known as the <quote>Soldier-boys' room.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2097"/>Let us come by night or by day, we knew that this room was reserved for us; and many a long and weary march ended in sweet dreams of home, awakened by its soft couches of repose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2098"/>Towards this pleasant home I instinctively turned my footsteps to enjoy the luxury of the <quote>Soldier-boys' room.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2099"/>But when the hour for retiring came, my kind hostess, who had listened in tears to the story of prison trials, said: <quote>I cannot let you go to the <q direct="unspecified">Soldier-boys' room</q> to-night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2100"/>The special guest-chamber of the house has been fitted up for you to pay for those hard boards on which the <rs>Yankees</rs> have made you sleep so long.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2101"/>So I was duly ushered into the elegant chamber, and in due time was upon a luxurious bed, which seemed to me the most comfortable I had ever.enjoyed, but on which I found it impossible to sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2102"/>I had been so long upon the hard boards that the soft bed wearied me. I tossed from side to side, but in vain, until at length seizing my soldier blanket, which had been stowed in <num value="1">one</num> corner, I wrapped myself in it and threw myself upon the floor, sleeping sweetly and soundly until morning.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2103"/>When at the drawing-room my kind hostess met me with the question, <quote>How did you rest last night?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2104"/>and I answered, <quote>Splendidly,</quote> she replied with a smile, <quote>I knew you would, for I had that bed prepared expressly for you.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2105"/>That dear friend, whose <pb id="p.167" n="167"/>smile made the sunlight of the hospitable home, and whose heart was as pure as the escutcheon of the country she loved so well, has been called to the citizenship of a better country and the enjoyment of a happier home; but though years intervened, I could never find it in my heart to undeceive her, and it was her happiness always to remember how she had honored, with her best chamber and most luxurious bed, the returning soldier boy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2106"/>Having presented you with this inside view of life in a Federal prison, I feel that I cannot close without adding my testimony to that of others in reference to the comparative suffering under Federal and Confederate imprisonment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2107"/>The effort is being persistently made to represent the hardships as all on <num value="1">one</num> side, to throw upon the <rs>South</rs> the odium of having subjected her prisoners, taken in war, to unnecessary privations and wanton cruelties, and to claim for the <rs>North</rs> that her prison government and discipline were, with perhaps a few rare exceptions, of the most humane and kindly nature.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2108"/>Now I have no disposition to stir up feelings of bitterness between the <num value="2">two</num> sections of a common country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2109"/>I would speak only in the interests of peace and good-will; but I must also speak in the interests of truth and justice, and in vindication of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2110"/>I would call attention to the following points: <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num></hi>, It is not true that the prison discipline and the personal treatment of prisoners was either juster or more humane in Northern prisons than in those at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2111"/>When the facts of history are all brought out, and in that sufficient light the comparison is made between <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName> and <placeName reg="Point Lookout, Saint Marys, Maryland" key="tgn,1012121">Point Lookout</placeName>, it will be found that the contrast is overwhelmingly in favor of the former; that in point of diet, health regulations, hospital prescriptions, &amp;c., our men at <placeName reg="Point Lookout, Saint Marys, Maryland" key="tgn,1012121">Point Lookout</placeName> were subjected to far greater privations and hardships than were the <rs>Federal</rs> soldiers at <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2112"/>But to confine myself simply to what passed under my own personal observation, and of which consequently I am a competent witness, I may say that on our release from <placeName key="tgn,7018023" n="1.000 10" reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi">Fort McHenry</placeName> and return to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 21" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, a number of us asked and obtained permission to go through all the wards of that portion of the <rs type="place">Libby prison</rs> in which the <rs>Federal</rs> officers were confined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2113"/>We saw their arrangements for sleep, exercise and cleanliness; we inspected the food as it was prepared for them, and saw all the arrangements for cooking and serving it, and we came away with the impression that (although we had been constantly reminded at <placeName key="tgn,7018023" n="1.000 10" reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi">Fort McHenry</placeName> that our lot <pb id="p.168" n="168"/>was a favored <num value="1">one</num> compared with that of our fellow prisoners at <placeName reg="Fort Baltimore">Fort Baltimore</placeName>, <placeName reg="Point Lookout, Saint Marys, Maryland" key="tgn,1012121">Point Lookout</placeName> and <placeName reg="Johnson Island, Ottawa, Ohio" key="tgn,2424997">Johnson's Island</placeName>) these men in the <rs type="place">Libby prison</rs> were faring like princes as compared with the life we had been required to lead at <placeName key="tgn,7018023" n="1.000 10" reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi">Fort McHenry</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2114"/><hi rend="italics"><num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num></hi>. Even if it could be shown that there was as great or greater privation in Southern prisons than in Northern, this would not relieve the contrast which is so unfavorable to the humanity of the <rs>Northern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2115"/>We can demonstrate the fact that our prisoners of war were served with as good rations and as abundant as our soldiers in the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2116"/>Whatever privations they endured, therefore, were the privations of our own men, and were the result, not of wilful neglect or bitter hatred, but of that dearth of the necessaries of life under which our whole people were suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2117"/>With the <rs>North</rs> there was no dearth, no scarcity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2118"/>The granaries of the world were open to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2119"/>When they fed our men on scanty and unwholesome fare, it was not because they could not help it, but because they did not care.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2120"/><hi rend="italics"><num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num></hi>. For the sufferings of prisoners on both sides, the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>North</rs> alone is responsible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2121"/>We were always anxious for exchange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2122"/>It was to our interest, even if there had been no higher motives operating upon us. We could not supply the places of our men when captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2123"/>A single musket was far more to us than to the people of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2124"/>They had all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to recruit from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2125"/>They could supply the places of their men when captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2126"/>We could not. It was no great burden to them to guard and feed their prisoners, but it was a heavy tax on us to take care of ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2127"/>It was, therefore, to our interest to arrange a cartel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2128"/>It was to their interest to delay it; and an impartial examination of the case will show beyond all doubt that the failure to make exchange on honorable and equitable terms is chargeable upon them and not upon us. Every proposition that in the interests of humanity could be made was made by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, and was made only to be sullenly rejected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2129"/>The responsibility for all the suffering on both sides is with those who steadfastly refused either to propose or to accept an honorable cartel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2130"/>And as in all succeeding time, under the influence of heated imaginations, the spectres of <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.119 000000.2386	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.119 000000.2386	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName> and <placeName reg="Point Lookout, Saint Marys, Maryland" key="tgn,1012121">Point Lookout</placeName>, of <placeName reg="Libby prison">Libby prison</placeName> and <placeName reg="Johnson Island, Ottawa, Ohio" key="tgn,2424997">Johnson's Island</placeName> will be rising up to disturb the equanimity of the historian, the <rs>South</rs> will be able to say with truth to each <num value="1">one</num> as it rises--<quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2134"/>On the evening of the <dateStruct value="-07-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> the brigade, with the rest of the division, arrived at <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg, Pennsylvania</placeName>, and after nightfall took position on the southeast side of the town, near the <placeName reg="Hanover, York, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2089058">Hanover</placeName> road, and on the extreme left of our line, on Gulp's farm, and throwing forward skirmishers, we remained for the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2135"/>At dawn the next morning the enemy's skirmishers were seen in our front, and a brisk <hi rend="italics">fire</hi> was opened between them and my own which was kept up during the day at long range with but short intervals of quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2136"/>About <time value="6pm">6 o'clock P. M.</time> our line was advanced in a northerly direction and took position immediately on the north side of the <placeName reg="Hanover, York, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2089058">Hanover</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2137"/>In this position, our left flank being harassed by the enemy's sharpshooters posted in a wheat field and wood, I ordered <persName n="Nadenbousch,Colonel,,,," id="n0121.0034.00169.01510" reg="mostcommon:Nadenbousch,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Nadenbousch</surname></persName>, with his regiment (the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA2">Second Virginia</orgName>), to clear the field and advance into the wood and ascertain, if possible, what force the enemy had at that point, which he did at a single <hi rend="italics">dash</hi>, his men advancing with <name n="Great Spirit" type="divinity">great spirit</name>, driving the enemy's skirmishers out of the cleared ground and following them into the woods.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2138"/>When he had advanced some distance int the woods, the enemy opened on his line with <num value="2">two</num> pieces of artillery and he fell back into the cleared ground again, leaving skirmishers in the edge of the wood, and reported that the enemy had a large force of cavalry, supposed to be <num value="2">two</num> brigades, <num value="2">two</num> regiments of infantry and a battery of artillery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2139"/>This information I communicated through a staff officer to <persName n="Johnson,Major-General,,,," id="n0121.0034.00169.01511" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,B.,R.,,"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, and immediately thereafter received information from <persName n="Douglas,Major,,,," id="n0121.0034.00169.01512" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, of his staff, that the line was about to advance, with instructions from <persName n="Johnson,General,,,," id="n0121.0034.00169.01513" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,B.,R.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> to remain on the flank if I thought it necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2140"/>As our flank and rear would have been entirely uncovered and unprotected in the event of my moving with the rest of the division, and as our movement must have been made in full view of the enemy, I deemed it prudent to hold my position until after dark, which I did. <pb id="p.170" n="170"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2141"/>After dark I withdrew, and leaving a picket on the <placeName reg="Hanover, York, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2089058">Hanover</placeName> road, joined the rest of the division in rear of the enemy's breast-works, which they had driven them from the evening before.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2143"/>After <measure n="5hours" type="date">five hours</measure> incessant firing, being unable to drive the enemy from his strong position, and a <orgName>brigade of <persName n="Rodes,,,,," id="n0121.0034.00170.01516" reg="mostcommon:Rodes,R.,E.,,:1"><surname>Rodes</surname></persName></orgName>' <orgName n="division">division</orgName> coming to our assistance, I drew my command back under the hill out of the fire, to give them an opportunity to rest and clean their guns and fill up their cartridge boxes.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2145"/>An hour or <num value="2">two</num> later, I was again ordered to advance so as to keep the enemy in check, which I did, sheltering my men and keeping up a desultory fire until dark.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2146"/>About midnight we were drawn off with the rest of the division, and at daylight were again formed in line of battle on the heights south of <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 11" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName>, where we remained all day and until about <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time>, when we marched with the division in the direction of <placeName reg="Fairfield, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7016248">Fairfield</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2149"/>It may seem invidious to select any particular officer for commendation, but justice requires that I should especially notice the gallant and efficient conduct of <persName n="Terry,Major,William,,," id="n0121.0034.00170.01518" reg="default:Terry,William,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Terry</surname></persName>, commanding the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA4">Fourth Virginia</orgName>, who gallantly led his regiment almost to the breastworks of the enemy, and only retired after losing the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of his command.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2183"/>About dark I returned from extreme left to <address><street n="Corinth road">Corinth road</street></address>, rejoined you there, and we slept by slight camp-fire in the interval between <persName n="Gibson,,,,," id="n0121.0035.00173.01566" reg="mostcommon:Gibson,William,,,:1"><surname>Gibson</surname></persName>'s and <persName n="Anderson,,,,," id="n0121.0035.00173.01567" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Patton,,,"><surname>Anderson</surname></persName>'s (<persName n="Patton,,,,," id="n0121.0035.00173.01568" reg="mostcommon:Patton,John,M.,,:2"><surname>Patton</surname></persName>) brigades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2184"/>In the conversation <pb id="p.174" n="174"/>held with you then, I asked, as you were <num value="1">one</num> of the <orgName n="War Council" type="council">council of war</orgName>, what were the leading objective points to be considered, what the plan of action, &amp;c.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2185"/>I added that was contrary to the usual plan, which was to drive the <rs>Federal</rs> forces against the broad, deep river in their rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2186"/>You replied you had stated in the council your impression <quote>they would not swing that way</quote> --i. e., against <placeName reg="Owl Creek, Tennessee" key="tgn,2563364">Owl creek</placeName>-but would stubbornly fight with their gunboats at their back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2187"/>My opinion then and now is, that <persName n="Johnston,General,Sidney,,," id="n0121.0035.00174.01570" reg="default:Johnston,Sidney,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Sidney</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> lost his life in a vain effort to force the <rs>Federal</rs> retreat &mdash; an army of <num value="45000">forty-five thousand</num>, with his <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> less &mdash; in a direction arbitrarily selected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2188"/>Here I notice the point that <persName n="Gibson,,,,," id="n0121.0035.00174.01571" reg="mostcommon:Gibson,William,,,:1"><surname>Gibson</surname></persName> was ignorant of the movements <quote>above indicated placing the army in position</quote> --a singular statement contrasted with the fact that I slept in the same apartment with him at his headquarters at <persName n="Mickey,,,,," id="n0121.0035.00174.01572" reg="mostcommon:Mickey,nomatch:0"><surname>Mickey</surname></persName>'s the preceding night; that the brigade and staff moved at daylight next morning in conjunction with your other troops, and in the utmost good order took position indicated, his left resting on <address><street n="Corinth road">Corinth road</street></address>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2189"/>At <time>daylight</time> <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> the battle began &mdash; <persName n="Chalmers,,,,," id="n0121.0035.00174.01573" reg="mostcommon:Chalmers,Alexander,H.,,:1"><surname>Chalmers</surname></persName>' skirmishers on the extreme right, in accordance with what I understood to be the plan of battle, opening fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2190"/>Instantly we were in the saddle, and you gave the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and last command I recollect your giving as a command, often repeated, and always responded to by your division: <quote>Forward</quote> We rode rapidly down the division line, more than a mile long, through a densely wooded, hilly country, relieved here and there only by small cultivated fields, to see that the forward movement was continuous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2191"/>Before we had ridden the length of <num value="2">two</num> brigades &mdash; the line moving forward all the while &mdash; after a hurried consultation with the staff, you had a gun moved in advance and threw a few shells into the heights beyond, where some of the <rs>Federals</rs> were seen moving towards <persName n="Hardee,,,,," id="n0121.0035.00174.01574" reg="mostcommon:Hardee,William,J.,,:3"><surname>Hardee</surname></persName>'s flank, to develop their design, <persName n="Hardee,,,,," id="n0121.0035.00174.01575" reg="mostcommon:Hardee,William,J.,,:3"><surname>Hardee</surname></persName> inquiring at once into the cause of the firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2192"/>You and remaining staff continued your forward progress, while I kept down the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2193"/>By the time I returned to the right &mdash; I had ridden rapidly too &mdash; I saw the following state of affairs: <persName n="Hardee,,,,," id="n0121.0035.00174.01576" reg="mostcommon:Hardee,William,J.,,:3"><surname>Hardee</surname></persName> withdrawn from our front, for he had in his advance gained ground <pb id="p.175" n="175"/>to the right so rapidly, supporting the main attack on the <rs>Federal</rs> extreme left, that very early in the morning, instead of being in <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line, our division was in <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line confronting Federal right-centre, not <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards distant</measure>, holding elevated ground with artillery and dense masses of infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2194"/>In my brief absence &mdash; it was not then <time value="8am">8 A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2195"/>I told you you could not carry the position without more force, and inquired for your <orgName type="regiment" key="1Brigade">first brigade</orgName> (<persName n="Gibson,,,,," id="n0121.0035.00175.01578" reg="mostcommon:Gibson,William,,,:1"><surname>Gibson</surname></persName>'s).

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2196"/>I then tried to bring you forward a battalion of cavalry (<persName n="Brewer,,,,," id="n0121.0035.00175.01583" reg="mostcommon:Brewer,nomatch:0"><surname>Brewer</surname></persName>'s) to make a diversion obliquely from the right, proffering to lead the cavalry in person, while you were making an artillery combination to support a renewed attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2197"/>But before engaging, the cavalry made such a wide detour to the right under cover of <persName n="Hardee,,,,," id="n0121.0035.00175.01584" reg="mostcommon:Hardee,William,J.,,:3"><surname>Hardee</surname></persName>, they were useless to us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2198"/>In the meantime, the left of our line was still moving forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2199"/>On going to the rear a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure>, I met the head of a Tennessee regiment marching by the flank &mdash; the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">first regiment</orgName> of <persName n="Johnson,,B.,R.,," id="n0121.0035.00175.01587" reg="default:Johnson,B.,R.,,"><foreName>B.</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="brigade">brigade</orgName>, <orgName n="command"><persName n="Polk,,,,," id="n0121.0035.00175.01588" reg="mostcommon:Polk,Leonidas,,,:3"><surname>Polk</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2201"/>His brigade <hi rend="italics">here fired</hi> the <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num></hi> gun &mdash; say <time value="10am">10 A.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2202"/>As soon as the head of the columns of the troops above mentioned appeared on our right, you, superintending the artillery firing (<orgName n="Washington Artillery" type="artillery">Washington artillery</orgName>, &amp;c.), again ordered <quote>Forward I</quote> and the indomitable <persName n="Anderson,,,,," id="n0121.0035.00175.01591" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Patton,,,"><surname>Anderson</surname></persName> <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> time moved through the fire, sword in hand, and his attack, combined with the movement and attack of <persName n="Johnson,,B.,R.,," id="n0121.0035.00175.01592" reg="default:Johnson,B.,R.,,"><foreName>B.</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, finally drove the <rs>Federals--Anderson</rs> sweeping over the ground, capturing their artillery, &amp;c.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2203"/>In a word, the <rs>Federals</rs> declined to drive <hi rend="italics">from</hi> the river at all, as you predicted in the council.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2204"/>The Federals, though driven from our front, moved rearward very slowly, contesting every inch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2205"/>After we got them started, I again rode down the left of our line, directing our left brigade forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2206"/>The Federal right about this time began to swing rearward much faster than his right-centre, and it was evident they were falling back to concentrate on and strengthen the <rs>Federal</rs> centre and left, so heavily assaulted all the morning by the main effort to cut them off from the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2207"/>On my return to the extreme right of our division line, about noon, I found you had continued to drive the <rs>Federal</rs> right-centre to a certain point in an old field, where they were making a determined stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2208"/>I noticed here a long gap between our line and where I supposed <persName n="Withers,,,,," id="n0121.0035.00176.01593" reg="nearbymention:Withers,R.,W.,,"><surname>Withers</surname></persName>' left ought to be, and called your attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2209"/>We then thought it dangerous to leave it open, as a failure on our right and a furious effort on the part of the <rs>Federals</rs> in our front, if we failed to check, would imperil our rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2210"/>You directed me to fill up the interval with any detached infantry I could find, and at once bring forward all the artillery I could get to move, and have them open fire at once on the <rs>Federals</rs> in front, to prevent their making any movement endangering our position, and keep them moving in retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2211"/>It was here that we finally, in a few hours, got between <num value="50">fifty</num> and <num value="60">sixty</num> field guns in position, and under this heavy fire you succeeded in moving again the <rs>Federals</rs> in our front, who had held their position so long and obstinately that when they started they found troops of <persName n="Hardee,,,,," id="n0121.0035.00176.01594" reg="mostcommon:Hardee,William,J.,,:3"><surname>Hardee</surname></persName> and <persName n="Withers,,,,," id="n0121.0035.00176.01595" reg="nearbymention:Withers,R.,W.,,"><surname>Withers</surname></persName> on their left and rear, and our left brigade and the head of <orgName n="reserves"><persName n="Polk,,,,," id="n0121.0035.00176.01596" reg="mostcommon:Polk,Leonidas,,,:3"><surname>Polk</surname></persName>'s reserves</orgName> on their right and rear, intercepting their march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2900"/>In a short time, <persName n="Gordon,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n0121.0046.00230.02329" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,John,B.,,:3"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Gordon</surname></persName> having encountered the enemy in force, I received an order to advance in support, <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Hoke,,,,," id="n0121.0046.00230.02330" reg="mostcommon:Hoke,R.,F.,,:1"><surname>Hoke</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> moving forward at the same time on my left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2901"/>Pressing steadily on I met with no other opposition than that presented by the enemy's skirmishers, and the firing of his artillery, until I came up to the line of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n0121.0046.00230.02331" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,John,B.,,:3"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2902"/>Here I found the enemy in considerable strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2903"/>I still continued to move, however, succeeding in driving before me all the forces opposed, until I arrived at the railroad, which here runs from east to west, just skirting the edge of the city of <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2904"/>In my progress to this position the fire to which my command was subjected from the enemy's batteries, posted upon well selected rises of the ground, was unusually galling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2905"/>But so rapid and impetuous was the movement of my troops in this advance, that my skirmishers, keeping well to the front, <measure n="2" type="captured">captured two</measure> pieces of artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2906"/>I had barely time to pause at the railroad referred to, when I discovered a heavy column of the enemy's troops, who had been engaged with <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n0121.0046.00230.02332" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,John,B.,,:3"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> and the <orgName>division of <persName n="Rodes,Major-General,,,," id="n0121.0046.00230.02333" reg="mostcommon:Rodes,R.,E.,,:1"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Rodes</surname></persName></orgName>, advancing <pb id="p.231" n="231"/>rapidly, threatening my right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2907"/>Perceiving that a forward movement on my part would expose my flank to an attack from this force, exceeding in number that under my command, I immediately changed front forward on the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Company">first company</orgName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="1Battalion">first battalion</orgName>, of a portion of my brigade, the <num value="5" type="ordinal">Fifth</num>, <num value="6" type="ordinal">Sixth</num> and the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 9">Ninth regiments</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2908"/>With this line, after several well directed volleys, I succeeded in breaking this column on my right, dispersing its men in full flight through the streets of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2909"/>But for this movement on my flank, I should have captured several pieces of artillery opposite the left of my line, upon which the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 7">Seventh regiment</orgName> was advancing in front and the <num value="8" type="ordinal">Eighth</num> by a side street at the time I halted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2910"/>After reforming my line of battle, I advanced through the city of <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, clearing it of the enemy and taking prisoners at every turn.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2911"/>During this time, as well as in my progress to the city, a great number of prisoners were captured by my command, but unwilling to decrease my force by detailing a guard, I simply ordered them to the rear as they were taken.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2912"/>Many of these following the road to the left, fell into the possession of <persName n="Rodes,Major-General,,,," id="n0121.0046.00231.02334" reg="mostcommon:Rodes,R.,E.,,:1"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Rodes</surname></persName>' troops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2913"/>I am satisfied the prisoners taken in the above mentioned movements by my brigade exceeded in numbers the force under my command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2914"/>My loss this day was small--<num value="1">one</num> officer and <num value="6">six</num> men killed, <num value="4">four</num> officers and <num value="37">thirty-seven</num> men wounded and <num value="15">fifteen</num> men missing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2915"/>The loss of the enemy cannot be known with exactness, but it was apparent, from an inspection of the field, that his loss exceeded ours by at least <num value="6">six</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2916"/>Having driven the enemy entirely out of the city, I rested my line on <num value="1">one</num> of the upper (southern) streets &mdash; <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Hoke,,,,," id="n0121.0046.00231.02335" reg="mostcommon:Hoke,R.,F.,,:1"><surname>Hoke</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, on my left, extending beyond the eastern suburbs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2917"/>In this position I remained until <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time> that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2918"/>At that hour I received an order from <persName n="Early,Major-General,,,," id="n0121.0046.00231.02336" reg="mostcommon:Early,J.,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> to make a reconnoissance of the ground between my situation and that of the enemy, who, after abandoning the city, had entrenched himself on <placeName reg="Cemetery Hill, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2230256">Cemetery hill</placeName>, a commanding height, <num value="1">one</num> of a series or chain of hills belting <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 11" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName> on the south.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2919"/>After a careful examination of the locality indicated, about <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> in the morning (<dateStruct value="-07-2"><day reg="2">2d</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>) I moved my troops into an open field between the city and the base of a hill intervening between us and <placeName reg="Cemetery Hill, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2230256">Cemetery hill</placeName>, throwing out skirmishers to the front.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2920"/>In this field we remained the entire day of the <dateStruct value="-07-2"><day reg="2">2d</day> <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, prominently <pb id="p.232" n="232"/>exposed to the fire of the enemy's skirmishers and sharp-shooters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2921"/>During the afternoon of this day I was directed by <persName n="Early,Major-General,,,," id="n0121.0046.00232.02337" reg="mostcommon:Early,J.,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> to hold my brigade in readiness at a given signal to charge the enemy in the works on the summit of the hill before me, with the information that a general advance of our entire line would be made at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2922"/>A little before <time value="8pm">8 o'clock P. M.</time> I was ordered to advance with my own and <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Hoke,,,,," id="n0121.0046.00232.02338" reg="mostcommon:Hoke,R.,F.,,:1"><surname>Hoke</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> on my left, which had been placed for the time being under my command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2923"/>I immediately moved forward, and had gone but a short distance, when my whole line became exposed to a most terrific fire from the enemy's batteries from the entire range of hills in front and to the right and left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2924"/>Still both brigades advanced steadily up and over the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> hill and into a bottom at the foot of <placeName reg="Cemetery Hill, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2230256">Cemetery hill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2925"/>Here we came upon a considerable body of the enemy, and a brisk musketry fire ensued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2926"/>At the same time his artillery, of which we were now within canister range, opened upon us. But owing to the darkness of the evening now verging into night, and the deep obscurity afforded by the smoke of the firing, our exact locality could not be discovered by the enemy's gunners, and we thus escaped what, in the full light of day, could have been nothing else but horrible slaughter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2927"/>Taking advantage of this, we continued to move forward until we reached the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line, behind a stone wall at the foot of a fortified hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2928"/>We passed such of the enemy who had not fled and who were still clinging for shelter to the wall to the rear as prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2929"/>Still advancing, we came upon an abatis of fallen timber and the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> line disposed in rifle pits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2930"/>This line we broke, and, as before found, many of the enemy who had not fled, hiding in the pits for protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2931"/>These I ordered to the rear as prisoners, and continued my progress to the crest of the hill.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2932"/>Arriving at the summit, by a simultaneous rush from my whole line, I captured several pieces of artillery, <num value="4">four</num> stands of colors and a number of prisoners.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2933"/>At that time every piece of artillery which had been firing upon us was silenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2934"/>A quiet of several minutes now ensued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2935"/>Their heavy masses of infantry were heard and perfectly discerned through the increasing darkness, advancing in the direction of my position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2936"/>Approaching within a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure>, a line was discovered before us, from the whole length of which a simultaneous fire was delivered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2937"/>I reserved my fire from the uncertainty of this being a force of the enemy or of our men, as I had been <pb id="p.233" n="233"/>cautioned to expect friends both in front, to the right and to the left--<persName n="Longstreet,Lieutenant-General,,,," id="n0121.0046.00233.02339" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,J.,,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>, <persName n="Rodes,Major-General,,,," id="n0121.0046.00233.02340" reg="mostcommon:Rodes,R.,E.,,:1"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Rodes</surname></persName> and <persName n="Johnson,Major-General,,,," id="n0121.0046.00233.02341" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,B.,R.,,:5"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> respectively having been assigned to these relative positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2938"/>But after the delivery of a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> volley, the flashing of the musketry disclosed the still advancing line to be <num value="1">one</num> of enemies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2939"/>I then gave the order to fire; the enemy was checked for a time, but discovering another line moving up in the rear of this <num value="1">one</num>, and still another force in rear of that, and being beyond the reach of support, I gave the order to retire to the stone wall at the foot of the hill, which was quietly and orderly effected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2940"/>From this position I subsequently fell back to a fence some <measure n="75yards" type="distance">seventy-five yards distant</measure> from the wall and awaited the further movements of the enemy; only contemplating, however, to effect an orderly and controlled retreat before a force which I was convinced I could not hope to withstand, at all events where I then was. I was on the point of retreating to a better position, when <persName n="Campbell,Captain,,,," id="n0121.0046.00233.02342" reg="mostcommon:Campbell,Reuben,P.,,:3"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Campbell</surname></persName>, the <rs>Brigade Quartermaster</rs>, informed me that <persName n="Gordon,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n0121.0046.00233.02343" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,John,B.,,:3"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Gordon</surname></persName> was coming to my support.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2941"/>I immediately dispatched an officer to hasten <persName n="Gordon,General,,,," id="n0121.0046.00233.02344" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,John,B.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gordon</surname></persName> with all possible speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2942"/>But this officer returning without seeing <persName n="Gordon,General,,,," id="n0121.0046.00233.02345" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,John,B.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gordon</surname></persName>, I went back myself, and finding <persName n="Gordon,General,,,," id="n0121.0046.00233.02346" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,John,B.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gordon</surname></persName> occupying the precise position in the field occupied by me when I received the order to charge the enemy on <placeName reg="Cemetery Hill, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2230256">Cemetery hill</placeName>, and not advancing, I concluded that any assistance from him would be too late, and my only course was to withdraw my command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2943"/>I therefore moved my brigade by the right flank leading it around the hill so as to escape the observation of the enemy, and conduct it to the right of my original position, then occupied, as above stated, by <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Gordon,General,,,," id="n0121.0046.00233.02347" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,John,B.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gordon</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2944"/>This was about <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time>. I remained in this position for the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3228"/>This produced an estrangement between your father and myself, which continued unhealed until a common-service and a common danger brought us once more together.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3231"/>I state these facts for the purpose of showing you how I happen to know what I do about the authorship of the lines in question; for your father, besides being a modest man, was never quick to give either his hand or confidence to a stranger.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3232"/>We had just returned from Falls' church, near <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, to <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3241"/>He read the lines without unusual feeling until he came to the picture of the little trundle-bed, when his voice trembled and his eyes filled with tears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3242"/>That <quote>touch of nature</quote> was contagious, and I felt the big drops trickling down my own cheeks; and even to this day, when I recall the scene, now that he is dead and gone, I feel again something of the old emotion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3243"/>I begged him at once for a copy, but he resolutely refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3244"/>Shortly after, however, I left <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> for <placeName key="tgn,7007248" n="1.000 21" reg="georgia">Georgia</placeName> and took command of a company in a regiment there being organized for the <rs>Confederate</rs> service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3245"/>The day before my departure I prevailed on him to comply with my request, <quote>upon my honor as soldier</quote> that <pb id="p.258" n="258"/>I would neither read it in the regiment, have it published, nor mention his name in connection with its authorship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3246"/>This promise, I am sorry to say, I only partially fulfilled; for I read the poem to <persName n="Bostick,Doctor,Charles,,," id="n0121.0052.00258.02650" reg="default:Bostick,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Bostick</surname></persName>, now of this county: <persName n="Hudson,,John,H.,," id="n0121.0052.00258.02651" reg="default:Hudson,John,H.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Hudson</surname></persName>, late of <placeName reg="Jefferson county, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002269">Jefferson county</placeName>, but now deceased, and to my brother, <persName n="Ashton,Doctor,William,W.,," id="n0121.0052.00258.02652" reg="default:Ashton,William,W.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName n="William">Wm.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Ashton</surname></persName>, now of <placeName reg="Shreveport, Caddo, Louisiana" key="tgn,7014504">Shreveport, Louisiana</placeName>, who were my messmates before leaving the regiment, and, on my return to <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, to my wife, and told her who wrote it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3247"/>Though professional critics may perhaps smile, or ridicule the idea, I submit that the poem itself furnishes almost positive internal evidence of having been written by a married man upon whom the sacred memories of home, and wife, and children were crowding as he wrote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3350"/>As I had but a small force of sharpshooters, I thought it best to send a brigade in addition, as a smaller force would be liable to be cut off and captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3892"/>I immediately charged upon the enemy's line, and drove him in great confusion upon his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line, which was formed behind a stone fence, some <num value="100">hundred</num> or more yards in rear of the <rs type="place">Emmettsburg turnpike</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3893"/>At this point we captured several pieces of artillery, which the enemy, in his haste and confusion, was unable to take off the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3895"/>Here the enemy made considerable resistance to our further progress, but was finally forced to retire by the impetuous charge of my command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3897"/>My men, by a well directed fire, soon drove the cannoniers from their guns, and leaping over the fence charged up to the top of the crest and drove the enemy's infantry into a rocky gorge on the eastern slope of the height, and some <num value="80">eighty</num> or a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> in rear of the enemy's batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3898"/>We were now complete masters of the field, having gained the key, as it were, to the enemy's whole line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3899"/>Unfortunately, just as we had carried the enemy's last and strongest position, it was discovered that the brigade on our right had not only not advanced across the turnpike, but had actually given way, and was rapidly falling back to the rear, while on our left we were entirely unprotected &mdash; the brigade ordered to our support having failed to advance.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3900"/>It was now evident, with my ranks so seriously thinned as they had been by this terrible charge, I should not be able to hold my position unless speedily and strongly reinforced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3901"/>My advanced position, and the unprotected condition of my flanks, invited an attack, which the enemy were speedy to discover, and immediately passed a strong body of infantry (under cover of a high ledge of rocks, thickly covered with stinted undergrowth), which fell away from the gorge, in rear of their batteries before mentioned, in a southeasterly direction, and emerging on the western slope of the ridge, came upon my right and rear at a point equidistant from the <rs type="place">Emmettsburg turnpike</rs> and the stone fence, while a large brigade advanced from the point of woods on my left, which extended nearly down to the turnpike, and gaining the turnpike, moved Rapidly to meet the party which had passed around upon our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3902"/>We were now in a critical condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3903"/>The enemy's converging line was rapidly closing upon our rear &mdash; a few moments more and we would be completely surrounded &mdash; still no support could be seen coming to our assistance, and with painful hearts we abandoned our, captured guns, faced about, and prepared to cut our way through the closing lines in our rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3904"/>This was effected in tolerable order, but with immense loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3905"/>The enemy rushed to his abandoned guns as soon as we began to retire, and poured a severe <pb id="p.318" n="318"/>fire of grape and cannister into our thinned ranks as we retired slowly down the slope into the valley below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3906"/>I continued to fall back, until reaching a slight depression a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> in advance of our skirmish line in the morning, when I halted, reformed my brigade, and awaited the further pursuit of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3907"/>Finding the enemy not disposed to continue his advance, a line of skirmishers was thrown out in my front, and a little after dark my command moved to the position which we had occupied before the attack was made.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4702"/>My object in the conference, and that for which I visited the army, was to learn its condition, and what might be expected from it in active operations against the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4703"/>At this day, so remote from the event, I cannot claim to remember any conversation upon incidental points which may have occurred, but I can say with certainty that <persName n="Hardee,General,,,," id="n0121.0063.00377.04038" reg="nearbymention:Hardee,W.,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hardee</surname></persName> was not relieved because of any depreciation of his capacity, his zeal or fidelity.

My assent to his persistent request to be relieved was finally given because of irreconcilable difference between himself and the officer commanding-in-chief.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4705"/>Among the motives which induced me to make that visit to the <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Army of Tennessee</orgName>, it is hardly supposable that <num value="1">one</num> of them was to make enquiries about <persName n="Hardee,General,,,," id="n0121.0063.00377.04040" reg="nearbymention:Hardee,W.,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hardee</surname></persName>'s fitness for command, as there was probably no <num value="1">one</num> in that army who knew him as well as I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4706"/>He had <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attracted my attention by his good conduct and cool courage, when, in the early part of the war against <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, he, as junior captain of a squadron of dragoons, extricated the portion of the command more immediately under him from an ambuscade into which it had fallen, and saved them from impending massacre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4707"/>At a later day, because of his professional accomplishments, I, as <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, selected him to prepare the system of tactics which bears his name, and for a long time we daily worked together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4708"/>In his appointment as Commandant of Cadets, and in his selection for promotion in a new regiment of cavalry, was manifested my appreciation of him as a gentleman and a soldier.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4709"/>In his various high commands during the war between the <name>States</name>, my estimate of him was confirmed and increased, but never diminished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4710"/>By reference to his letters from me received during the war, you will find the frequent expression of my confidence and regard, <pb id="p.378" n="378"/>especially in those relating to the appointment of <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n0121.0063.00378.04041" reg="mostcommon:Hood,J.,B.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName> to the command of the <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Army of Tennessee</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4711"/>By these it is shown that <persName n="Hardee,General,,,," id="n0121.0063.00378.04042" reg="nearbymention:Hardee,W.,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hardee</surname></persName> was not passed over from any want of appreciation, but because he had previously declined the position of <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> of that army for reasons which were still in force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4712"/>His modesty put a lower estimate upon his ability than I did.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4713"/>Upon reaching the army, after the battles around <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, I learned from <persName n="Hardee,General,,,," id="n0121.0063.00378.04043" reg="nearbymention:Hardee,W.,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hardee</surname></persName> that he still wished to be transferred to some other field of duty.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4715"/>The assignment of <persName n="Hardee,General,,,," id="n0121.0063.00378.04046" reg="nearbymention:Hardee,W.,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hardee</surname></persName> to an independent and important command, which was simultaneous with his being relieved from duty with the <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Army of Tennessee</orgName>, sufficiently evinces that my confidence in him had not been impaired; and his conduct in that separate command fully justified the opinion I continued to entertain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4716"/>In this connection, it may be appropriate to furnish you with an extract from a letter written by me to <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0121.0063.00378.04047" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,G.,T.,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> on the <dateStruct value="1865-02-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>--a period late in the course of the campaign through <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Georgia</placeName> and <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, and long after the events to which you refer: <quote>You will assume command of all the forces in the district as defined before your departure to the west; and should you deem it advisable, will direct <persName n="Hardee,General,,,," id="n0121.0063.00378.04048" reg="nearbymention:Hardee,W.,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hardee</surname></persName> to assume the command of his old corps when it arrives, and add to it any other forces which may be advantageously associated with it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5618"/>He was by no means devoid of personal ambition, and proper self-assertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5619"/>He ardently desired the applause of his superiors and of his country, and was keenly alive to adverse criticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5620"/>The gay side of his character gave to some envious minds the opportunity to point at him the shaft of slander; but, while deeply wounded, he suffered in silence, and left his vindication to his country and his own true record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5621"/>He possessed <num value="1">one</num> fault, which appears in many of his earlier reports of battles; a fault at which an enemy may sneer, but which will readily be forgiven by a friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5622"/>He could never see or acknowledge that he was worsted in an engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5623"/>It was the enemy who <hi rend="italics">ought</hi> to be whipped, and <hi rend="italics">must be</hi> whipped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5624"/>Defeat he could never confess &mdash; no!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5630"/>His devotion to the society of ladies was <num value="1">one</num> of the noblest and purest instincts of his nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5631"/>Towards them he was as <hi rend="italics">naive</hi> and unsuspecting as a child, and as pure in thought and action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5632"/>He paid a ready homage not alone to youth and beauty, but to sterling qualities of mind and heart; and he accepted the admiration and friendship bestowed upon him in the true spirit of chivalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5633"/>A request from a lady, even though she were a stranger, laid him under an obligation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5634"/>Of this a touching illustration occurred in his last moments.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5635"/>Having given directions for the disposition of his personal effects and official papers, he said to me: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5639"/>I was at loss how to interpret the directions concerning the flag; for I had never seen any such decoration upon his hat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5640"/>Probably from the time of its reception the matter had passed from his attention, and yet upon his death-bed he could remember and provide for the granting of this request.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6090"/>Your esteemed favor to hand, as also <num value="3">three</num> copies of the <orgName n="Southern Historical Society" type="society">Southern Historical Society</orgName> Papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6091"/>I have read the papers, and now remail them to you. Thanks for the loan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6092"/>It is truly sad to think how history may be perverted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6093"/>I have thought that if there was any <num value="1">one</num> battle of the war in which there could be no doubt as who the participants were, on the <rs>Confederate</rs> side, it was the defense of <placeName reg="Fort Gregg">Fort Gregg</placeName>, and it does affect me to think that the men who voluntarily offered themselves a holocaust on that holy Sabbath day to save the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> from capture in the trenches at <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> should, after the lapse of <measure n="13years" type="date">thirteen years</measure>, have to come before the public to vindicate their rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6094"/>I have no fear, however, but that posterity will know the true history of the defense of <placeName reg="Fort Gregg">Fort Gregg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6095"/>The events of the war have mellowed down with time, and many scenes have slipped away from memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6096"/>I have looked over a memorandum book I kept during the last campaign, which has greatly freshened my memory concerning the stirring and exciting events of the defence of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6097"/>I find that on the <dateStruct value="1865-04-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> day of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year>1865</year>,</dateStruct> my company, <quote>G and K</quote> consolidated, including <persName n="Glasscock,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0121.0074.00482.05464" reg="mostcommon:Glasscock,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Glasscock</surname></persName> and myself, was <num value="35">thirty-five</num> strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6098"/>When we left camp at <placeName reg="Bermuda Hundreds">Bermuda Hundreds</placeName> at <time value="3am">3 A. M.</time>, <dateStruct value="-04-2"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="2">2d</day></dateStruct>, I left <num value="7">seven</num> men of my company on picket; <pb id="p.483" n="483"/><num value="3">three</num> others were lost by straggling, leaving <num value="25">twenty-five</num> men of my company who were present and participated in the defence of <placeName reg="Fort Gregg">Fort Gregg</placeName>; that about <time value="9am">9 o'clock A. M.</time> the bombardment of the fort began, lasting perhaps an hour, a section of the <orgName n="Washington Artillery" type="artillery">Washington Artillery</orgName> of <num value="2">two</num> guns replying until both were disabled and several gunners killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6099"/>When the artillery fire ceased the infantry hastily approached for the assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6100"/>The fort was carried about <time value="1pm">1 o'clock P. M.</time> We had ample time and opportunity to see the result of our defence, for when the guns in <placeName reg="Fort Whitworth">Fort Whitworth</placeName> were opened on <persName n="Gregg,,,,," id="n0121.0074.00483.05465" reg="mostcommon:Gregg,John,,,:1"><surname>Gregg</surname></persName>, after its capture, the prisoners were marched to that side of the fort, and afterwards taken to the front of the fort to be counted off and made ready for the march to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6101"/>The slaughter was appalling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6102"/>I saw the field at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, Chancelloreville, the <rs>Wilderness</rs>, and <dateStruct value="1864-05-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year>1864</year>,</dateStruct> at <placeName reg="Spotsylvania Court-house">Spotsylvania Court-house</placeName>, and at neither place were the dead half so thickly strewn as at <persName n="Gregg,,,,," id="n0121.0074.00483.05466" reg="mostcommon:Gregg,John,,,:1"><surname>Gregg</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6103"/>The dead were lying <num value="200">two hundred</num> and <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure> in front of the fort, and increased in numbers as the fort was neared, until immediately at the fort it was simply fearful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6104"/>Men shot off the parapet fell back into the ditch, were pitched out behind, and actually lay in heaps.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6105"/>On comparing notes that night (<dateStruct value="-04-2"><day reg="2">2d</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>) at <placeName reg="Canaanville, Athens, Ohio" key="tgn,2078718">Warren Station</placeName>, U. S. M. R. R., we estimated that we had lost about <num value="30">thirty</num> men in our <num value="2">two</num> regiments killed, and that the enemy had suffered not less than <measure n="1000" type="killed">one thousand killed</measure>. In my <orgName type="company" n="Company I">company I</orgName> had <measure n="1" type="killed">one killed</measure> and <measure n="4" type="wounded">four wounded</measure>; <num value="1">one</num> of the wounded has never been heard of since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6106"/>Only <num value="1">one</num> man was wounded during the fight, the other <num value="3">three</num> were wounded and <measure n="1" type="killed">one killed</measure> after the fort was carried and we had thrown down our arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6107"/>There were no bayonets used at <placeName reg="Fort Gregg">Fort Gregg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6108"/>Small arms were in the greatest abundance &mdash; averaging at least <num value="2">two</num> for each man who assisted in the defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6109"/>The parapet was <num value="8">eight</num> or <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure> broad, and as no dead men remained on it, none, in consequence, were bayoneted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6110"/>The fact is, that when an assaulting column reached the fort and made an effort or <num value="2">two</num> to scale the parapet they kept pretty quiet until a new force reached them, and during this seeming lull it gave us ample time to reload all the extra guns.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6111"/>The account of <persName n="Snow,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0121.0074.00483.05467" reg="nearbymention:Snow,George,H.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Snow</surname></persName> is quite a romance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6112"/>I exceedingly doubt, if he were present, of his participating in the defence of <placeName reg="Fort Gregg">Fort Gregg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6113"/>There were no rocks or stones in <placeName reg="Fort Gregg">Fort Gregg</placeName>; our winter quarters, if we had any, were immediately in the rear of the fort, and I do not recollect of seeing any in that vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6114"/>Nor was it possible for any <num value="1">one</num> to leave the fort at any time after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> assault much less to leave just at the last assault, with a battle-flag flaunting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6115"/>I speak positively, having had ocular demonstration that the entire ditch surrounding the fort was filled with the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6116"/>There was, however, a stand of colors belonging to a <orgName type="mil" key="NCRegiment">North Carolina regiment</orgName> taken out of the fort; and in fact small groups of men were continually leaving up to a short while before the cannonading began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6117"/>Just before <persName n="Wilcox,General,,,," id="n0121.0074.00483.05468" reg="nearbymention:Wilcox,C.,M.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Wilcox</surname></persName> left the fort I was told that he wished to speak to me (I was senior <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> present of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 12">Twelfth regiment</orgName>). On approaching him I was asked if I were in command of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6118"/>I replied <pb id="p.484" n="484"/>that I was not, and called to <persName n="Duncan,Colonel,,,," id="n0121.0074.00484.05469" reg="nearbymention:Duncan,James,H.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Duncan</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="16MSRegiment">Sixteenth Mississippi regiment</orgName>, who was near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6119"/><persName n="Wilcox,General,,,," id="n0121.0074.00484.05470" reg="nearbymention:Wilcox,C.,M.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Wilcox</surname></persName> said to him, speaking loudly so that many might hear, I presume, <quote>If you will hold the fort <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n0121.0074.00484.05471" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,J.,,,:1"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> will be up, and all will be well.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6120"/>As I said before men were continually leaving, remarking that they were separated from their commands and would be considered deserters, and if hurt away from their friends would not receive proper attention, &amp;c. As soon as <persName n="Wilcox,General,,,," id="n0121.0074.00484.05472" reg="nearbymention:Wilcox,C.,M.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Wilcox</surname></persName> rode away, at my suggestion no more men were permitted to leave, no matter what the excuse.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6121"/>The enemy were massing their artillery, and their assaulting columns were well up, and it was known by every man present that when <placeName reg="Fort Gregg">Forts Gregg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Fort Whitworth">Whitworth</placeName> were out of the way that <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> lay in full view, without any other works of defence in that direction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6122"/>There is no questioning the fact, that brave, gallant men assisted in the defence of <placeName reg="Fort Gregg">Fort Gregg</placeName>, who were not of our brigade, but to say that they were in an organized state, or were in respectable proportion to us, would falsify facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6123"/>We formed our regiments, the <num value="16" type="ordinal">Sixteenth</num> on the right, beginning at the entrance <quote>on the right by file into line,</quote> so that when in position, my company, which held the left of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 12">Twelfth regiment</orgName>, was on the left of the entrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6124"/>The loose men (without organization), including the artillerymen, held no distinct position, but were scattered all through our regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6125"/><persName n="Wilcox,General,,,," id="n0121.0074.00484.05473" reg="nearbymention:Wilcox,C.,M.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Wilcox</surname></persName> is wrongfully informed when he says the enemy <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> got into the works from the rear, or from the parapet of the trench which connected the <num value="2">two</num> forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6126"/>The last assaulting column was twice driven off the parapet, but the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> time the whole front was carried simultaneously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6127"/>No enemy entered the works from the rear until we had thrown down our unloaded guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6128"/>I have the names of the men of my company who were in <placeName reg="Fort Gregg">Fort Gregg</placeName>--that is, of companies <quote>G</quote> and <quote>K.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6129"/>I am truly glad to know that you intend to reply to <persName n="Lane,General,,,," id="n0121.0074.00484.05474" reg="nearbymention:Lane,J.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lane</surname></persName>'s article, for I know that you are competent to vindicate and make memorable the deeds of your old brigade.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6359"/>After giving all the information in my power, I ventured to remark to him that, in my opinion, the enemy had a large force at the point upon which we intended to move, and that <num value="1">one</num> division was insufficient for the accomplishment of the end in view; that a failure would be the result, and that the troops engaged in it would be seriously injured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6393"/>About the same time <persName n="Robertson,General,,,," id="n0121.0078.00505.05726" reg="mostcommon:Robertson,B.,H.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName>, who was watching the extreme right, reported that a strong force of the enemy was moving over the adjoining hill on our right, the head of the column having made its appearance on the edge of the triangular opening in my rear, which I have already described, and near the river bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6394"/>My videttes also reported the same thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6395"/>In the meantime the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> attack had commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6396"/>When the firing had almost ceased, I gave orders for the whole line to retire to the hill on which it had <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> formed, thence into the hollow behind it, and thence by flanking to the left, into the road and across the bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6397"/>To cover this movement, I held the road with a strong force of skirmishers, and directed <persName n="Robertson,General,,,," id="n0121.0078.00505.05727" reg="mostcommon:Robertson,B.,H.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName> to place the <orgName type="regiment" key="1TXRegiment">First Texas regiment</orgName>, together with part of the <orgName type="regiment" key="TX5">Fifth Texas</orgName>, already there, on an open hill between the bridge and the point from which the enemy was moving, on our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6398"/>The movement was executed in a quiet and leisurely manner, the enemy in front making no effort to follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6399"/>During the engagement of <persName n="Bratton,Colonel,,,," id="n0121.0078.00505.05728" reg="nearbymention:Bratton,J.,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Bratton</surname></persName> with the enemy no troops passed from the right <hi rend="italics">along the road or in sight of it</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6400"/>When the order for my command to retire was given I had already received information that <persName n="Bratton,Colonel,,,," id="n0121.0078.00505.05729" reg="nearbymention:Bratton,J.,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Bratton</surname></persName> had been withdrawn, that he was actually at the bridge, and the firing on the left had ceased for nearly, if not quite, half an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6401"/>Believing that the object for which my position was occupied had been accomplished, I withdrew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6402"/>The movement of the enemy on my right would in a few minutes more have necessitated a change of position, and the intelligence of this movement had its influence in determining the <hi rend="italics">precise</hi> moment of withdrawal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6403"/>But, independent of this, the order was based on my understanding of the plan of operations and the conviction that it was in accordance with that plan.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6409"/>About <time value="7pm">7 o'clock P. M.</time> I received orders to put my regiment (<orgName type="regiment" key="AL48">48th Alabama</orgName>) under arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6410"/>In half an hour I received orders to move across the bridge across <placeName key="possibilities=29" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Lookout creek</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6411"/>After crossing the creek we had not advanced very far before the pickets captured a prisoner, apparently very drunk, who reported he belonged to <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Howard,,,,," id="n0121.0078.00506.05736" reg="mostcommon:Howard,A.,B.,,:1"><surname>Howard</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6412"/>After moving up the road a short distance I was ordered to file my regiment to the right in an open field, at the base of a ridge in my front, and form line of battle in <num value="1">one</num> rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6413"/>I then sent pickets in front, under <persName n="Eubanks,Captain,,,," id="n0121.0078.00506.05737" reg="mostcommon:Eubanks,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Eubanks</surname></persName>, who soon reported no enemy on the ridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6414"/>I then advanced rapidly, taking possession of the ridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6415"/>The object in obtaining the ridge was, I suppose, to command the road leading down the valley from <placeName reg="Trenton, Gibson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101856">Trenton</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kelly's Ferry">Kelly's Ferry</placeName> to <placeName reg="Brown's Ferry">Brown's Ferry</placeName>, on the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6416"/>It was very soon ascertained that there was another and higher ridge in our front, beyond which the road ran. The General commanding (Law) informed me of these facts and ordered me to advance and obtain possession of the ridge in front at all hazards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6417"/>I had sent <persName n="Eubanks,Captain,,,," id="n0121.0078.00506.05738" reg="mostcommon:Eubanks,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Eubanks</surname></persName> forward with <num value="5">five</num> men, who soon sent <num value="1">one</num> of the men back, reported no enemy on the ridge, but a large encampment of Federal troops about half mile from the point of the ridge where my left was to rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6418"/>He (<persName n="Eubanks,Captain,,,," id="n0121.0078.00506.05739" reg="mostcommon:Eubanks,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Eubanks</surname></persName>) with <num value="4">four</num> men crossed the ridge, came up the valley road to where the <placeName reg="Chatanooga">Chatanooga</placeName> road intersected the same, and reported the above facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6419"/>While reporting to me, the pickets near the forks of the road captured a prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6420"/>I had given orders to my lietenant-colonel to move the regiment forward; about this time I was informed that a line of <num value="20">twenty</num> or <num value="30">thirty</num> <name>Yankee</name> skirmishers was deployed on the right and left of the <placeName reg="Chatanooga">Chatanooga</placeName> road, (who had evidently come down the <placeName reg="Kelly's Ferry">Kelly's Ferry</placeName> road,) I ordered <persName n="McDuffee,Captain,,,," id="n0121.0078.00506.05740" reg="mostcommon:McDuffee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>McDuffee</surname></persName>, with his company, to the left, with instructions to get in the rear of the skirmishers if possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6421"/>The regiment had not advanced but a short distance, till a fire was opened upon the <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName>, <pb id="p.507" n="507"/>(from the skirmishers I suppose,) but a few shots from <orgName n="company"><persName n="McDuffee,Captain,,,," id="n0121.0078.00507.05741" reg="mostcommon:McDuffee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>McDuffee</surname></persName>'s company</orgName> soon scattered them, he capturing <measure n="8" type="prisoners">eight prisoners</measure>. The regiment continued to advance, and soon had possession of the ridge, meeting with no resistance except a slight skirmish on the left, here it was the brave and gallant <persName n="Eubanks,Captain,,,," id="n0121.0078.00507.05742" reg="mostcommon:Eubanks,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Eubanks</surname></persName> fell mortally wounded, and <num value="3">three</num> privates severely wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6422"/>I put my regiment in position, with its left resting on the <placeName reg="Chatanooga">Chatanooga</placeName> road, and some <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="40">forty</num> paces from the valley road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6423"/>I was at this time notified to take command of the brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6424"/>As each regiment arrived it was put in position; on the right, the <orgName type="regiment" key="AL47">Forty-seventh Alabama</orgName>, the <orgName type="regiment" key="AL4">Fourth Alabama</orgName> in the center, the <orgName type="regiment" key="AL44">Forty-fourth Alabama</orgName> on its right, and the <orgName type="regiment" key="AL15">Fifteenth Alabama</orgName> on the right of the brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6425"/>I immediately put out videttes in front of each regiment, along the valley road, and <num value="1">one</num> company from the <orgName type="regiment" key="AL15">Fifteenth Alabama</orgName> on the right across the ridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6426"/>I then ordered commanders of regiments to have their men put up breast-works of rails, logs, &amp;c., which was promptly done; here we remained perfectly quiet about <num value="1">one</num> hour, when the videttes in front reported a column of <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName> advancing up the <placeName key="possibilities=20" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Valley</placeName> road, from the direction of <placeName reg="Brown's Ferry">Brown's Ferry</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6427"/>Orders were given to let them advance till the head of the column was opposite the left of my line, which was done, when a well directed fire drove them back in confusion; in a short time he rallied, returned, and made an effort to charge the works on the ridge, when they were handsomely repulsed, and gave back in confusion; he must have suffered severely in this charge from the cries and groans of the wounded in our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6428"/>Being driven back he rallied and left the road, crossing a field in our front; the <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="AL48">Forty-eighth Alabama</orgName>, and an Arkansas regiment on my left, opened fire upon him, and caused some confusion in his ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6429"/>In a short time an attack was made on my right, (which rested some <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> from the valley road, with thick undergrowth between our works and the road,) which was handsomely repulsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6430"/>In a few minutes another and more vigorous attack was made upon the right, meeting the same fate as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6431"/>Being fearful of a flank attack I now strengthened the company on the right with <num value="2">two</num> other companies, <num value="1">one</num> from the <num value="15" type="ordinal">Fifteenth</num>, and <num value="1">one</num> from the <orgName type="regiment" key="AL44">Forty-fourth Alabama</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6432"/>Shortly afterwards I was notified by <num value="1">one</num> of the pickets on the right, that a column of <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName> had passed around my right near the river; I notified General Law of the fact, and he sent forward the <orgName type="regiment" key="4TXRegiment">Fourth Texas regiment</orgName>, which was promptly placed in position on my right, by <persName n="Terrell,Captain,,,," id="n0121.0078.00507.05743" reg="nearbymention:Terrell,L.,R.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Terrell</surname></persName>, A. A. G. In a few minutes after placing this regiment in position a vigorous attack was made upon the front of the <num value="4" type="ordinal">Fourth</num>, <num value="44" type="ordinal">Forty-fourth</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="AL15">Fifteenth Alabama</orgName>, some <num value="2">two</num> or <pb id="p.508" n="508"/><num value="3">three</num> columns deep; the enemy was repulsed, but returned in a short time more vigorously, and strengthened by several columns, who broke through my lines over our works, the left of the <orgName type="regiment" key="AL44">Forty-fourth Alabama</orgName> having given way. I here ordered <persName n="Scruggs,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0121.0078.00508.05744" reg="mostcommon:Scruggs,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>Scruggs</surname></persName>, commanding <orgName type="regiment" key="AL4">Fourth Alabama</orgName>, to swing his regiment across the ridge and to hold his position at any sacrifice, which was promptly done, the men and officers acting promptly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6433"/>Here I ordered <persName n="Perry,Colonel,,,," id="n0121.0078.00508.05745" reg="mostcommon:Perry,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Perry</surname></persName>, commanding the <orgName type="regiment" key="AL44">Forty fourth Alabama</orgName>, to rally his men and to take his position at all hazards; the <orgName type="regiment" key="AL4">Fourth Alabama</orgName> co-operating with him, soon drove the enemy from and beyond the breast-works; he soon returned, but was driven back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6434"/>About this time I received orders from General Law to fall back to the tall hill near the bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6435"/>When I received this order the firing had ceased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6436"/>I gave the order to fall back in order and in line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6437"/>I fell back to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ridge, remained there a few minutes, and then fell back to where I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> formed line of battle, when I received orders to recross the bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6438"/>In leaving the ridge where I had engaged the enemy, I was notified of a column of the enemy advancing down the valley from the river, between the <num value="2">two</num> ridges; at the same time I saw a heavy column marching by the flank on my left, which was evidently the column which passed through the fields in my front in the direction where <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Jenkins,General,,,," id="n0121.0078.00508.05746" reg="mostcommon:Jenkins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jenkins</surname></persName>' brigade</orgName> was engaged; we had been in our position on the ridge, I suppose, <num value="1">one</num> hour or more, before the firing commenced on our left by <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Jenkins,General,,,," id="n0121.0078.00508.05747" reg="mostcommon:Jenkins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jenkins</surname></persName>' brigade</orgName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6635"/>It is impossible to say whether this estimated number is correct, as the several accounts vary, and are not deemed altogether reliable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6636"/>But the estimate, making due allowances for errors, is quite near enough to satisfy even the most incredulous that the enemy is in the vicinity in sufficient force in cavalry, artillery and infantry, to do much harm, whether his purpose be to make a demonstration on <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 21" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, or to confine himself to raids in breaking up your communication and devastating the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7033"/>Our picket line was finally driven in, pretty badly mutilated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7042"/>While this was going on on the left the enemy assaulted my line near the <rs type="place">Libby house</rs>, but were easily repulsed by the picket line, aided by the artillery on the heights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7046"/>They unquestionably behaved badly &mdash; ran away from their posts, and could not give any intelligible report of what had occurred when they were found, which was not until some time after dark.

To give my promised support, and carry out my part in the arrangement, it was necessary for my brigade to file out at the double quick, and without halting, or even moderating to quick time, to move by the right flank in line against the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7073"/>I deplored this, and felt that my men were not having a fair chance, but it was too late to give new orders and instructions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7074"/>All that was left me to do, I thought, under the circumstances, was to try to carry out the agreed upon arrangement, and this done, my brigade was ordered to follow about <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure> in rear of <persName n="Anderson,,,,," id="n0121.0088.00555.06287" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,R.,H.,,:4"><surname>Anderson</surname></persName>'s, and if they stopped to pass over them, and charge the enemy's works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7077"/>This I halted for an instant, closed its ranks, and put it in on the left against a little redan on the line a short distance in front of the enemy's retrenchments, and it was carried, and much consternation produced among the enemy, who left <num value="1">one</num> face of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName>, that looking toward B. <placeName reg="Aiken's house">Aiken's house</placeName>, and did not occupy it again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7084"/>They failed to take the fort, but it was because the difficulties, from beginning to end of the attack, were too much for human valor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7093"/>I succeeded in driving them out of the works in my front, and turned upon the flank and rear of those in <persName n="Anderson,,,,," id="n0121.0088.00556.06294" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,R.,H.,,:4"><surname>Anderson</surname></persName>'s front and drove them from a part of it &mdash; indeed, from all of it finally, but was temporarily checked by a flank work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7094"/>They had no artillery on the line, but a battery was playing on us from a position some <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards</measure> in rear of their line, and in an extension of the line of this flank work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7095"/>This embarrassed our attack, and being concealed by a slight ridge from view, I was unable see what was there, I therefore directed <num value="1">one</num> regiment against the battery, which threw it entirely in rear of the line, and as it rose the ridge, advanced the brigade, and carried the works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7096"/>With scarce a halt at the works I pressed on at the enemy and artillery, now seen running across the field, for near a mile, when I halted and adjusted my ranks, now somewhat deranged by the succession of charges; the enemy were completely routed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7098"/>This was done in due time but with great difficulty through dense thickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7099"/>The whole, advancing in line, struck the enemy near the <placeName reg="New Market, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,7016287">New Market</placeName> road in heavy force and behind log breastworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7100"/>My brigade advanced to from <num value="50">fifty</num> to <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure> of the works (my line was not parallel to that of the enemy, my right was nearer to them than the left), and I thought at <num value="1">one</num> time that the enemy were leaving my front &mdash; I could not see, but their fire slackened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7101"/>The brigade on my right, however, did not come up, and the enemy in its front poured its fire into me. The brigade on my left fell back and retired entirely from the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7102"/>This somewhat disturbed my left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7104"/>I ordered them to fall back to the crest from which we started.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7105"/>The fire on the right was most terrific, but fortunately the balls ranged high and my loss was less than I feared it would be.
