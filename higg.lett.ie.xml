On further inquiry it appeared that my letter, naming the day, was awaiting the <rs>Secretary</rs>'s return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>What to do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>Not ride back in the cold, unrefreshed, so down we went to <placeName reg="Abbott's Hotel">Abbott's Hotel</placeName> to order tea. A lumbering hostler took our horse; a great wood fire was blazing in the old bar-room, hung round with pictures of horses and dogs; a room like those in <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n0195.0002.00057.00276" reg="mostcommon:Porter,Squire,,,:1"><surname>Porter</surname></persName>'s old hotel at <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, suggesting traditions of many winters, bright with flaming flip irons [irons used to warm drink]. But tea must be ordered, and nobody appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>So forth I went into a great dark hall, fireless and voiceless; <num value="7">seven</num> doors opened out of it, and I opened <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>--no fire, no light, no person; it became a nightmare, and I thought I should go on all night and forever, penetrating into remote silent rooms in the great old dark house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>Perhaps some dejected <placeName reg="La Puente, Rio Arriba, New Mexico" key="tgn,2067106">Mariana</placeName> I should find at last &mdash; or some Sleeping Beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>At last I opened the remotest door and there she was &mdash; in such a room If I had been wandering about the <rs>George</rs> and <rs>Vulture</rs>, or some storied <name>English</name> inn, and had come to such a kitchen, I should have said <quote>enough; I have found Old England; let me sit down here and all <persName n="Weller,,Sam,,," id="n0195.0002.00057.00277" reg="default:Weller,Sam,,,"><foreName>Sam</foreName> <surname>Weller</surname></persName> is a reality.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>Such a kitchen, long, immeasurably long and narrow, with rafters in the ceiling running the whole length, so low as to graze my head, and <hi rend="italics">black</hi>, polished black with time and good cheer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>Old tables and chests of drawers; <num value="2">two</num> <pb id="p.58" n="58"/> great fireplaces-<num value="1">one</num> altered to contain the most enormous <rs n="cooking stove" type="product">cooking stove</rs> ever beheld; the other legs altered, and with <num value="6">six</num> great legs of bacon hanging in its wide embrace.

A nice tea at last appeared, we meanwhile lingering in the bar-room with the hostler, who turned out a wag and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> queer old people who still cluster round the fire and mourn for the desolation wrought by railroads and the <rs>Maine Law</rs>. On my remarking the fitness of the large hall for dancing purposes, the lumbering hostess said, with a sort of sigh, <quote>Folks don't dance now,</quote> and declared their only patronage to be when <quote>once in a while a fellar comes and knocks at the door and wants to know if we'll tell him <hi rend="italics">how far it is to <persName n="Worcester,,,,," id="n0195.0002.00058.00278" reg="mostcommon:Worcester,nomatch:0"><surname>Worcester</surname></persName></hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>We rode <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> over a road among rocky hills till we reached a high little farmhouse, round which the misty sky shut closely down, revealing only rocks and barns and cattle, small children at the back door, and little <persName><foreName>Lucy</foreName></persName> beaming at the front door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>She ushered us in; the children turned out to belong to the married brother, and his wife appeared also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>We had provided a box of greenhouse flowers, but no orange blossoms, being unattainable; but we found that <persName n="Parsons,,Anna,,," id="n0195.0002.00060.00289" reg="default:Parsons,Anna,,,"><foreName>Anna</foreName> <surname>Parsons</surname></persName> had supplied that deficiency, and <pb id="p.61" n="61"/> we had everything else, including cloth-of-gold roses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>A handful of fallen blossoms she distributed among them....</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>It was a large, low old room with an open wood fire; the children sat in little armchairs before its glow; and <persName n="Burleigh,,Charles,,," id="n0195.0002.00061.00290" reg="default:Burleigh,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Burleigh</surname></persName>'s long hair looked like the locks of an ancient bard.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>We went in to tea at a great table; <persName><foreName>Lucy</foreName></persName> presided and cared for everybody; <persName n="Blackwell,Mister,,,," id="n0195.0002.00061.00291" reg="nearbymention:Blackwell,Elizabeth,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Blackwell</surname></persName> sat opposite, in quite a domestic manner, the gentlemen of the family not having appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>After tea they came in from the farm or elsewhere; the elderly father as sturdy as the mother, with a keen face, but saying little; the brother looked like <persName><foreName>Lucy</foreName></persName>, a plain likeness, an ex-semi-Orthodox-minister, now farmer; he has her low, sweet voice and we liked him very much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>They seemed perfectly happy together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>So the evening passed happily away, and we went at last up the steep stairs, <persName><foreName>Lucy</foreName></persName> piloting us, and looking to see that fire and water and all were right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>She took such care of everybody that I felt as if some <num value="1">one</num> else in the family were to be married, and she was the <name>Cinderella</name>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/><quote>Yes, indeed,</quote> nodded the brother knowingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>Meanwhile the queer old father had his dry chuckle on the other side of the room: <quote>Our <persName><foreName>Lucy</foreName></persName> thought there was n't anybody in these parts good enough to marry her, so she had to fetch somebody from <placeName reg="Worcester, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014647">Worcester</placeName> for it, hey.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>The quiet old mother meanwhile sat silent, though she had something to say afterwards.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>Presently in came the small lady and with her the bridegroom; he in the proper white waistcoat, she in a beautiful silk <hi rend="italics">ashes.of-roses</hi> color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>They stood up together and they read their <hi rend="italics">protest</hi>, which I enclose, and then my usual form of service proceeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>She had had some scruples about the form, but she seemed to think a great deal of what her mother would wish, and after all our views agreed pretty well: and so she expressed her purpose to <quote>love and honor</quote> (not obey) very clearly and sweetly, and he as bridegroom should; and I have to add with secret satisfaction that, after this, <persName><foreName>Lucy</foreName></persName>, the heroic <rs>Lucy</rs>, <hi rend="italics">cried</hi> like any village bride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>And <hi rend="italics">I</hi> could hardly help it when, after I had ended, <persName n="Burleigh,,Charles,,," id="n0195.0002.00062.00297" reg="default:Burleigh,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Burleigh</surname></persName> came forward and addressed them so nobly and sweetly that I have felt, since, as if <pb id="p.63" n="63"/> it were he and not I who united them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>This over, there was some little kissing; . . . and then the speedy necessity of breakfast effected an easy transition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/><persName><foreName>Lucy</foreName></persName> soon swallowed her tears and gave others tea to swallow and we plunged into a hasty breakfast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>Whereupon we all discovered that though we had not sentiment enough to fast ourselves, we had enough to neglect her, which was soon remedied, in moderation.
