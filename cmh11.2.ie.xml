<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>We are told by the historian of an earlier age that whenever the renowned men of the <rs>Roman</rs> commonwealth looked upon the statues of their ancestry, they felt their minds vehemently excited to virtue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>It could not have been the bronze or marble that possessed this power, but the recollection of great actions which kindled a generous flame in their souls, not to be quelled until they also, by virtue and heroic deeds, had acquired equal fame and glory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>When a call to arms resounds throughout the land and a people relinquish the pleasant scenes of tranquil life and rally to their country's call, such action is the result of an honest conviction that the act is commendable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>In recalling such an epoch, the wish that a true record of the deeds done should be transmitted to posterity must dominate every patriot heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Loyalty to brave men, who for <num value="4">four</num> long years of desolating war&mdash;years of undimmed glory&mdash;stood by each other and fought to the bitter end with the indomitable heroism which characterized the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldier, demands from posterity a preservation of the memories of the great struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>We cannot find in all the annals of history a grander record or prouder roll of honor, nor more just fame for bravery, patient endurance of hardships, and sacrifices.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Whatever may be said of the contention between the <num value="2">two</num> great <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> sections of the <rs>Union</rs>, whether by arbitration of council every issue might have been settled and a fratricidal war averted, there will be but <num value="1">one</num> unalterable decree of history respecting the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>His deeds of heroism <q direct="unspecified">are wreathed around with glory,</q> and he will be ever honored, because he was not only brave and honorable, but true to his convictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The sacrifices made by our loyal defenders and their glorious deeds shall not perish; but the pen of the historian shall hand them down through the ages&mdash;a proud heritage to our race and to all mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Now that the people who so grandly illustrated their loyalty to the <rs>Confederacy</rs> are passing away, the <rs>South</rs> claims from them a truthful, dispassionate history of the causes leading to their withdrawal from the <rs>Union</rs>, and the subsequent events when the tocsin of war sounded throughout the land.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Religion and patriotism should dominate every human life, and as love of country comes next to our love and allegiance to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, it must follow that a people panoplied with righteousness must be a highly patriotic people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The memories of the heroic sufferings and sacrifices of the noble men and women throughout the land make a history that will shine with imperishable luster, <q direct="unspecified">idealizing principle, strengthening character and intensifying love of country,</q> proving to the world that <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The grandest vindication of the <rs>South</rs> will come when Truth, no longer crushed to earth through narrowmindedness and sectional prejudice, will write in golden characters a just tribute to every American soldier who fell on either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Let the record be: <q direct="unspecified">Here lies an American Hero, a Martyr to the <name>Right</name> as his Conscience conceived it.</q>

<p>Gentlemen, I feel very sensibly the honor you have done me in calling me to preside over your deliberations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Such a manifestation of confidence and respect by the assembled sovereignty of my State, called together in such a crisis to consult together for the general safety, deeply affects my feelings, and in return I offer all that is in my power to give&mdash;the homage of a grateful heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The occasion on which we are called together is <num value="1">one</num> of the most solemn and important that ever assembled a people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Our government, the inheritance from a noble ancestry&mdash;the greatest achievement of human wisdom, made to secure to their posterity the rights and liberties purchased with their blood, is crumbling into ruins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Every day and almost every hour brings intelligence confirming the opinion that its dissolution is at hand.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/><num value="1">One</num> State, <num value="1">one</num> of the time-honored <num value="13">thirteen</num>, has withdrawn the powers granted in the <rs>Constitution</rs> which constituted her a member of the <rs>Union</rs>, under the political power of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>All our sister States immediately adjacent to us are at this moment moving in the same direction, under circumstances that render their action as certain as anything in the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>And as we look farther and beyond we see the same swell of public sentiment that a sense of wrong always inspires, agitating <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> the great heart of the more distant States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>And no reasonable doubt can be entertained by the most hopeful and sanguine that this excitement in public sentiment will extend and increase and intensify until all the <name>States</name> that are now known as the slaveholding States will withdraw their political connection from the non-slaveholding States, unite themselves in a common destiny and establish another constitution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Why all this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The story is soon told.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>In the formation of the government of our fathers, the <rs>Constitution</rs> of <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>, the institution of domestic slavery is recognized and the right of property in slaves is expressly guaranteed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The people of a portion of the <name>States</name> who were parties in the government were early opposed to the institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The feeling of opposition to it has been cherished and fostered and inflamed until it has taken possession of the public mind at the <rs>North</rs> to such an extent that it overwhelms every other influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It has seized the political power, and now threatens annihilation to slavery throughout the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>At the <rs>South</rs> and with our people, of course, slavery is the element of all value, and a destruction of that destroys all that is property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>This party, now soon to take possession of the powers of government, is sectional, irresponsible to us, and, driven on by an infuriated, fanatical madness that defies all opposition, must inevitably destroy every vestige of right growing out of property in slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">State of Florida</placeName> is now a member of the <rs>Union</rs>, under the power of the government soon to go into the hands of this party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>As we stand, our doom is decreed; and realizing an imperative necessity thus forced upon them to take measures for their safety, the people of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> have clothed you with supreme power and sent you here with the high and solemn duty to devise the best possible means to insure their safety, and have given you the charge to see that their commonwealth suffers no detriment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Your presence at this capitol is the highest proof that <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> your people fear to remain under their government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>With poignant regret no doubt they leave it, but they have no ground or hope of safety in it. What are we to do in fulfillment of our duty in this crisis?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>I will not presume to indicate your course&mdash;your superior and collected wisdom must decide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>I cannot doubt, though, that our people are safe in your hands, and that you will, in a manner becoming the dignity of the high position you hold, and worthy of the trust confided to you, promptly place them in a position of safety above the power and beyond the reach of their enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>As <num value="1">one</num> of you, representing a noble and confiding constituency, I pledge to you and to them the entire devotion of the powers of my mind in the discharge of this duty; and with my full heart, I ask you, each of you, to forget all former differences of opinion, all past party prejudices, and make now and here, on the altar of your State, your country, for the sake of your people, a sacrifice, an offering of all feeling, prepossession or prejudice that may stand in the way of perfect harmony and concord; and may the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of nations watch over us and bless our labors and guide us into the haven of safety.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1886"/>From any point on the upper <rs>St. John</rs>'s he can make raids into <placeName reg="Marion, Alabama, United States" key="tgn,2000046">Marion</placeName>, <placeName reg="Sumter, South Carolina, United States" key="tgn,2001767">Sumter</placeName> and <placeName reg="Alachua, Florida, United States" key="tgn,2000256">Alachua counties</placeName> at pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1887"/>A large negro population and an exaggerated estimate of the supplies in those counties are the inducements for him to visit them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1888"/>The injury he can inflict by breaking up the operations of our commissary agents in supplying beef cattle from <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240"><rs type="direction">south</rs> Florida</placeName>, will be a serious <num value="1">one</num> and <num value="1">one</num> that should not be overlooked by the government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1889"/>I would respectfully call the attention of the majorgen-eral commanding to this matter in particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1890"/>From the language of the dispatch from the adjutant and inspector-general at <placeName reg="Richmond, Madison, Kentucky" key="tgn,7014337">Richmond</placeName>, ordering the infantry out of this district, I think it is evident there must be some misapprehension there as to the available force in <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1891"/>It will be seen that to protect <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240"><rs type="direction">south</rs> Florida</placeName> it is absolutely necessary to prevent the enemy from reaching <placeName reg="Baldwin, Duval, Florida" key="tgn,2018514">Baldwin</placeName>, which is only <placeName><distance reg="20miles">20 miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Jacksonville, Duval, Florida" key="tgn,7013804">Jacksonville</placeName></placeName>, where he now has over <num value="3000">3,000</num> troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/>It is also necessary to prevent him crossing over from <placeName key="tgn,7014435" n="1.000 5" reg="saint augustine, saint johns, florida">St. Augustine</placeName>, where he has about <num value="1000">1,000</num> troops, to points above the mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,2555239" n="1.000 10" reg="Ocklawaha River, Florida, United States">Ocklawaha river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>Having the advantage of river navigation he can reach any point on the upper <rs>St. John</rs>'s before a force at this point could proceed in the direction to meet him. Therefore it is absolutely necessary to have a force here to protect <placeName reg="Baldwin, Duval, Florida" key="tgn,2018514">Baldwin</placeName> and also a force on the upper <rs>St. John</rs>'s to prevent these raids.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/>Such a force is not now at my command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1895"/>Indeed, any day when he chooses to do so, the enemy can move out to <placeName reg="Baldwin, Duval, Florida" key="tgn,2018514">Baldwin</placeName> and occupy the place.
