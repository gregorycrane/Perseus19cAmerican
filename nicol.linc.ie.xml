<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>He took quick aim through a loop-hole, shot, and killed the savage, at which the little boy also ran to the house, and from this citadel <persName n="Mordecai,,,,," id="n0029.0001.00004.00014" reg="mostcommon:Mordecai,nomatch:0"><surname>Mordecai</surname></persName> continued firing at the <name>Indians</name> until <persName><foreName>Josiah</foreName></persName> brought help from the fort. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>It was doubtless this misfortune which rapidly changed the circumstances of the family.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> 
<p>By the law of primogeniture, which at that date was still unrepealed in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, the family estate went to <persName n="Mordecai,,,,," id="n0029.0001.00004.00015" reg="mostcommon:Mordecai,nomatch:0"><surname>Mordecai</surname></persName>, the eldest son.</p></note> <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> was yet a wild, new country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>As compared with later periods of emigration, settlement was slow and pioneer life a hard struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>So it was probably under the stress of poverty, as well as by the marriage of the older children, that the home was gradually broken up, and <persName n="Lincoln,,Thomas,,," id="n0029.0001.00004.00016" reg="default:Lincoln,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> became <quote>even in childhood <gap/> a wandering laboring boy, and grew up literally <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> without education <gap/> Before he was grown he passed <num value="1">one</num> year as a hired hand with his <persName><roleName n="Uncle">uncle</roleName> <foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> on <placeName reg="Watauga River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2752758">Watauga</placeName>, a branch of the <placeName key="tgn,1124664" n="1.000 3" reg="holston, tennessee, united states">Holston River</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Later, he seems to have undertaken to learn the trade of carpenter in the shop of <persName n="Hanks,,Joseph,,," id="n0029.0001.00005.00017" reg="default:Hanks,Joseph,,,"><foreName>Joseph</foreName> <surname>Hanks</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="Elizabethtown, Hardin, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038674">Elizabethtown</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>When <persName n="Lincoln,,Thomas,,," id="n0029.0001.00005.00018" reg="default:Lincoln,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was about <measure n="28years" type="date">twenty-eight years</measure> old he married <persName n="Hanks,,Nancy,,," id="n0029.0001.00005.00019" reg="default:Hanks,Nancy,,,"><foreName>Nancy</foreName> <surname>Hanks</surname></persName>, a niece of his employer, near Beechland, in <placeName reg="Washington, Georgia, United States" key="tgn,2000441">Washington County</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>She was a good-looking young woman of <num value="23">twenty-three</num>, also from <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and so far superior to her husband in education that she could read and write, and taught him how to sign his name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Neither <num value="1">one</num> of the young couple had any money or property; but in those days living was not expensive, and they doubtless considered his trade a sufficient provision for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>He brought her to a little house in <placeName reg="Elizabethtown, Hardin, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038674">Elizabethtown</placeName>, where a daughter was born to them the following year. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>During the next twelvemonth <persName n="Lincoln,,Thomas,,," id="n0029.0001.00005.00020" reg="default:Lincoln,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> either grew tired of his carpenter work, or found the wages he was able to earn insufficient to meet his growing household expenses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>He therefore bought a little farm on the <rs type="place">Big South Fork</rs> of <placeName reg="North Twin Creek, Teton, Wyoming" key="tgn,2549854">Nolin Creek</placeName>, in what was then <persName n="Hardin,,,,," id="n0029.0001.00005.00021" reg="mostcommon:Hardin,nomatch:0"><surname>Hardin</surname></persName> and is now <placeName reg="La Rue County">La Rue County</placeName>, <placeName><distance reg="3miles">three miles</distance> from Hodgensville</placeName>, and <placeName><distance reg="13miles">thirteen miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Elizabethtown, Hardin, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038674">Elizabethtown</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Having no means, he of course bought the place on credit, a transaction not so difficult when we remember that in that early day there was plenty of land to be bought for mere promises to pay; under the disadvantage, however, that farms to be had on these terms were usually of a very poor quality, on which energetic or forehanded men did not care to waste their labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It was a kind of land generally known in the <rs>West</rs> as <quote>barrens</quote> --rolling upland, with very thin, unproductive soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Its momentary usefulness was <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> that it was partly cleared and cultivated, that an indifferent cabin stood on it ready to be occupied, and that it had <num value="1">one</num> specially attractive as well as useful feature &mdash; a fine spring of water, prettily situated amid a graceful clump of foliage, because of which the place was called <placeName reg="Rock Spring Farm">Rock Spring Farm</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The change of abode was perhaps in some respects an improvement upon <placeName reg="Elizabethtown, Hardin, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038674">Elizabethtown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>To pioneer families in deep poverty, a little farm offered many more resources than a town lot-space, wood, water, greens in the spring, berries in the summer, nuts in the autumn, small game everywhere-and they were fully accustomed to the loss of companionship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>On this farm, and in this cabin, the future <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was born, on the <dateStruct value="1809-02-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year>1809</year>,</dateStruct> and here the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of his childhood were spent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>When <persName><foreName>Abraham</foreName></persName> was about <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> old the <rs>Lincoln</rs> home was changed to a much better farm of <measure n="238acres" type="area">two hundred and thirty-eight acres</measure> on <placeName key="tgn,2440897;tgn,2440894" n="0.144 000000.2871	placename;tgn,2440897;Knob Creek, Lawrence, Tennessee,Lawrence,Tennessee,United States,North and Central America;0.144 000000.2871	placename;tgn,2440894;Knob Creek, Bedford, Tennessee,Bedford,Tennessee,United States,North and Central America" reg="Knob Creek, Lawrence, Tennessee,Lawrence,Tennessee,United States,North and Central America;Knob Creek, Bedford, Tennessee,Bedford,Tennessee,United States,North and Central America">Knob Creek</placeName>, <placeName><distance reg="6miles">six miles</distance> from Hodgensville</placeName>, bought by <persName n="Lincoln,,Thomas,,," id="n0029.0001.00006.00022" reg="default:Lincoln,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, again on credit, for the promise to pay <measure n="118l." type="pounds"><num value="118">one hundred and eighteen</num> pounds</measure>. A year later he conveyed <measure n="200acres" type="area">two hundred acres</measure> of it by deed to a new purchaser.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>In this new home the family spent <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> more, and while here <persName><foreName>Abraham</foreName></persName> and his <persName><roleName n="Sister">sister</roleName> <foreName>Sarah</foreName></persName> began going to A B C schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> teacher was <persName n="Riney,,Zachariah,,," id="n0029.0001.00006.00023" reg="default:Riney,Zachariah,,,"><foreName>Zachariah</foreName> <surname>Riney</surname></persName>, who taught near the <rs>Lincoln</rs> cabin; the next, <persName n="Hazel,,Caleb,,," id="n0029.0001.00006.00024" reg="default:Hazel,Caleb,,,"><foreName>Caleb</foreName> <surname>Hazel</surname></persName>, at a distance of about <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/><persName n="Lincoln,,Thomas,,," id="n0029.0001.00006.00025" reg="default:Lincoln,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was evidently <num value="1">one</num> of those easygoing, good-natured men who carry the virtue of contentment to an extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>He appears never to have exerted himself much beyond the attainment of a necessary subsistence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>By a little farming and occasional jobs at his trade, he seems to have supplied his family with food and clothes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>There is no record that <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> he made any payment on either of his farms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The fever of westward emigration was in the air, and, listening to glowing accounts of rich lands and newer settlements in <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>, he had neither valuable possessions nor cheerful associations to restrain the natural impulse of every frontiersman to <quote>move.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>In this determination his carpenter's skill served him a good purpose, and made the enterprise not only feasible, but reasonably cheap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>In the fall of <dateStruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></dateStruct> he built himself a small flatboat, which he launched at the mouth of <placeName key="tgn,2440897;tgn,2440894" n="0.144 000000.2871	placename;tgn,2440897;Knob Creek, Lawrence, Tennessee,Lawrence,Tennessee,United States,North and Central America;0.144 000000.2871	placename;tgn,2440894;Knob Creek, Bedford, Tennessee,Bedford,Tennessee,United States,North and Central America" reg="Knob Creek, Lawrence, Tennessee,Lawrence,Tennessee,United States,North and Central America;Knob Creek, Bedford, Tennessee,Bedford,Tennessee,United States,North and Central America">Knob Creek</placeName>, half a mile from his cabin, on the waters of the <rs type="place">Rolling Fork</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>This stream would float him to <placeName reg="Champ, Multnomah, Oregon" key="tgn,2231981">Salt River</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Champ, Multnomah, Oregon" key="tgn,2231981">Salt River</placeName> to the <rs>Ohio</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>He also thought to combine a little speculation with his undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Part of his personal property he traded for <num value="400">four hundred</num> gallons of whisky; then, loading the rest on his boat with his carpenter's tools and the whisky, he made the voyage, with the help of the current, down the <rs type="place">Rolling Fork</rs> to <placeName reg="Salt, Kentucky, United States" key="tgn,1129481">Salt River</placeName>, down <placeName reg="Champ, Multnomah, Oregon" key="tgn,2231981">Salt River</placeName> to the <rs>Ohio</rs>, and down the <rs>Ohio</rs> to <placeName reg="Thompson's Ferry">Thompson's Ferry</placeName>, in <placeName reg="Perry, Kentucky, United States" key="tgn,2000836">Perry County</placeName>, on the <rs>Indiana</rs> shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The boat capsized once on the way, but he saved most of the cargo. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/><measure n="16miles" type="distance">Sixteen miles</measure> out from the river he found a location in the forest which suited him. Since his boat would not float up-stream, he sold it, left his property with a settler, and trudged back home to <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, all the way on foot, to bring his wife and the <num value="2">two</num> children-Sarah, <measure n="9years" type="date">nine years</measure> old, and <persName><foreName>Abraham</foreName></persName>, <num value="7">seven</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Another son had been born to them some years before, but had died when only <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> old. This time the trip to <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName> was made with the aid of <num value="2">two</num> horses, used by the wife and children for riding and to carry their little equipage for camping at night by the way. In a straight line, the distance is about <measure n="50miles" type="distance">fifty miles</measure>; but <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> it was probably doubled by the very few roads it was possible to follow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Having reached the <rs>Ohio</rs> and crossed to where he had left his goods on the <rs>Indiana</rs> side, he hired a wagon, which carried them and his family the remaining <measure n="16miles" type="distance">sixteen miles</measure> through the forest to the spot he had chosen, which in due time became the <rs type="place">Lincoln farm</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>It was a piece of heavily timbered land, <measure n="1.5miles" type="distance">one and a half miles</measure> east of what has since become the village of <placeName reg="Gentryville, Spencer, Indiana" key="tgn,2031964">Gentryville, in Spencer County</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The lateness of the autumn compelled him to provide a shelter as quickly as possible, and he built what is known on the frontier as <num value="0.5">a half</num>-faced camp, about <measure n="14feet" type="distance">fourteen feet</measure> square.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>This structure differed from a cabin in that it was closed on only <num value="3">three</num> sides, and open to the weather on the <dateStruct value="--4"><day reg="2">fourth</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>It was usual to build the fire in front of the open side, and the necessity of providing a chimney was thus avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>He doubtless intended it for a mere temporary shelter, and as such it would have sufficed for good weather in the summer season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>But it was a rude provision for the winds and snows of an Indiana winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>It illustrates <persName n="Lincoln,,Thomas,,," id="n0029.0001.00008.00026" reg="default:Lincoln,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s want of energy, that the family remained housed in this primitive camp for nearly a whole year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>He must, however, not be too hastily blamed for his dilatory improvement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>It is not likely that he remained altogether idle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>A more substantial cabin was probably begun, and, besides, there was the heavy work of clearing away the timber &mdash; that is, cutting down the large trees, chopping them into suitable lengths, and rolling them together/into great log-heaps to be burned, or splitting them into rails to fence the small field upon which he managed to raise a patch of corn and other things during the ensuing summer. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>That same winter <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName> was admitted to the <rs>Union</rs> as a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>There were as yet no roads worthy of the name to or from the settlement formed by himself and <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> neighbors at various distances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>There was in the neighborhood of the <rs>Lincoln</rs> home what was known in the <rs>West</rs> as a deer-lick --that is, there existed a feeble salt-spring, which impregnated the soil in its vicinity or created little pools of brackish water-and various kinds of animals, particularly deer, resorted there to satisfy their natural craving for salt by drinking from these or licking the moist earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>Hunters took advantage of this habit, and <num value="1">one</num> of their common customs was to watch in the dusk or at night, and secure their approaching prey by an easy shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Skill with the rifle and success in the chase were points of friendly emulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>In many localities the boy or youth who shot a squirrel in any part of the animal except its head became the butt of the jests of his companions and elders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>Yet, under such conditions and opportunities <persName><foreName>Abraham</foreName></persName> was neither a hunter nor a marksman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>The hours which other boys spent in roaming the woods or lying in ambush at the deer-lick, he preferred to devote to his effort at mental improvement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>It can hardly be claimed that he did this from calculating ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>It was a native intellectual thirst, the significance of which he did not himself yet understand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>Such exceptional characteristics manifested themselves only in a few matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>In most particulars he grew up as the ordinary backwoods boy develops into the youth and man. As he was subjected to their usual labors, so also he was limited to their usual pastimes and enjoyments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>The varied amusements common to our day were not within their reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>The period of the circus, the political speech, and the itinerant show had not yet come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Schools, as we have seen, and probably meetings or church services, were irregular, to be had only at long intervals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Primitive athletic games and commonplace talk, enlivened by frontier jests and stories, formed the sum of social intercourse when half a dozen or a score of settlers of various ages came together at a house-raising or corn-husking, or when mere chance brought them at the same time to the <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName> or the country store.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>On these occasions, however, <persName><foreName>Abraham</foreName></persName> was, according to his age, always able to contribute his full share or more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>Most of his natural aptitudes equipped him especially to play his part well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>He had quick intelligence, ready sympathy, a cheerful temperament, a kindling humor, a generous and helpful spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>He was both a ready talker and appreciative listener.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>By virtue of his tall stature and unusual strength of sinew and muscle, he was from the beginning a leader in all athletic games; by reason of his <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> studious habits and his extraordinarily retentive memory, he quickly became the best story-teller among his companions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>Even the slight training he gained from his studies greatly quickened his perceptions and broadened and steadied the strong reasoning faculty with which nature had endowed him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>As the years of his youth passed by, his less gifted comrades learned to accept his judgments and to welcome his power to entertain and instruct them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>On his own part, he gradually learned to write not merely with the hand, but also with the mind &mdash; to think.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>It was an easy transition for him from remembering the jingle of a commonplace rhyme to the constructing of a doggerel verse, and he did not neglect the opportunity of practising his penmanship in such impromptus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>Tradition also relates that he added to his list of stories and jokes humorous imitations from the sermons of eccentric preachers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>But tradition has very likely both magnified and distorted these alleged exploits of his satire and mimicry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>All that can be said of them is that his youth was marked by intellectual activity far beyond that of his companions. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>The only answer is that he was prompted by that intuition of genius, that consciousness of powers which justify their claims by their achievements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>When we scan <pb id="p.31" n="31"/> the circumstances more closely, we find distinct evidence of some reason for his confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Relatively speaking, he was neither uneducated nor friendless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>His acquirements were already far beyond the simple elements of reading, writing, and ciphering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>He wrote a good, clear, serviceable hand; he could talk well and reason cogently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>The simple, manly style of his printed address fully equals in literary ability that of the average collegian in the twenties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>This, however, could be only a secondary reason for announcing himself as a candidate, for the election was not to occur till <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, and even if he were elected there would be neither service nor salary till the coming winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>His venture into politics must therefore be ascribed to the feeling which he so frankly announced in his letter, his ambition to become useful to his fellow-men &mdash; the impulse that throughout history has singled out the great leaders of mankind. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>In the early <rs>West</rs>, law and politics were parallel roads to usefulness as well as distinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>Newspapers had not then reached any considerable circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>There existed neither fast presses to print them, mail routes to carry them, nor subscribers to read them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>Since even the laws had to be newly framed for those new communities, the lawyer became the inevitable political instructor and guide as far as ability and fame extended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>As already said, these swift changes required a plentiful supply of new laws, to frame which lawyers were in a large proportion sent to the legislature every <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>By a natural connection, this also involved a discussion of national and party issues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>While the <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">State of Illinois</placeName> was strongly Democratic, <placeName reg="Sangamon, Illinois, United States" key="tgn,1002866">Sangamon County</placeName> was as distinctly Whig, and the local party disputes were hot and aggressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>It is a marked peculiarity of the <rs>American</rs> character that the bitterest foes in party warfare generally meet each other on terms of perfect social courtesy in the drawing-rooms of society; and future presidential candidates, cabinet members, senators, congressmen, jurists, orators, and battle heroes lent the little social reunions of <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532">Springfield</placeName> a zest and exaltation never found-perhaps impossible-amid the heavy, oppressive surroundings of conventional ceremony, gorgeous upholstery, and magnificent decorations. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>Much to the surprise of <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532">Springfield</placeName> society, however, the courtship took a sudden turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>Whether it was caprice or jealousy, a new attachment, or mature reflection will always remain a mystery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>Very few men are fortunate enough to gain distinction during their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> term in Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>The reason is obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>Legally, a term extends over <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>; practically, a session of <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> during the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> year ordinarily reduce their opportunities more than <num value="0.5">one half</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>In those <num value="2">two</num> sessions, even if we presuppose some knowledge of parliamentary law, they must learn the daily routine of business, make the acquaintance of their fellow-members, who already, in the <num value="30" type="ordinal">Thirtieth</num> Congress, numbered something over <num value="200">two hundred</num>, study the past and prospective legislation on a multitude of minor national questions entirely new to the new members, and perform the drudgery of haunting the departments in the character of unpaid agent and attorney to attend to the private interests of constituents &mdash; a physical task of no small proportions in <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0029.0006.00076.00403" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s day, when there was neither street-car nor omnibus in the <quote>city of magnificent distances,</quote> as <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="district of columbia">Washington</placeName> was nicknamed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>Add to this that the principal <pb id="p.77" n="77"/> work of preparing legislation is done by the various committees in their committee-rooms, of which the public hears nothing, and that members cannot choose their own time for making speeches; still further, that the management of debate on prepared legislation must necessarily be intrusted to members of long experience as well as talent, and it will be seen that the novice need not expect immediate fame. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>It is therefore not to be wondered at that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0029.0006.00077.00404" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s single term in the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="district of columbia">Washington</placeName> added practically nothing to his reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>He did not attempt to shine forth in debate by either a stinging retort or a witty epigram, or by a sudden burst of inspired eloquence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>On the contrary, he took up his task as a quiet but earnest and patient apprentice in the great workshop of national legislation, and performed his share of duty with industry and intelligence, as well as with a modest and appreciative respect for the ability and experience of his seniors. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>His name appears on only <num value="1">one</num> other committee,--that on Expenditures of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>,--and he seems to have interested himself in certain amendments of the law relating to bounty lands for soldiers and such minor military topics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>He looked carefully after the interests of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> in certain grants of land to that State for railroads, but expressed his desire that the government price of the reserved sections should not be increased to actual settlers. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>The speech is not a mere party diatribe, but a terse historical and legal examination of the origin of the <rs>Mexican War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>The former were clearly wasting their time in discussing an abstract question of international law upon conditions existing <measure n="20months" type="date">twenty months</measure> before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>During those <measure n="20months" type="date">twenty months</measure> the <rs>American</rs> arms had won victory after victory, and planted the <rs>American</rs> flag on the <quote>halls of the <name>Montezumas</name>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>Could even successful argument undo those victories or call back to life the brave American soldiers who had shed their blood to win them? </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>It may be assumed as an axiom that <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> has <pb id="p.79" n="79"/> never gifted any <orgName n="Political Party" type="party">political party</orgName> with all of political wisdom or blinded it with all of political folly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>Upon the foregoing point of controversy the <rs>Whigs</rs> were sadly thrown on the defensive, and labored heavily under their already discounted declamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>But instinct rather than sagacity led them to turn their eyes to the future, and successfully upon other points to retrieve their mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>Within <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure> after <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0029.0006.00079.00409" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s speech <persName n="Polk,President,,,," id="n0029.0006.00079.00410" reg="nearbymention:Polk,James,K.,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName> sent to the <name>Senate</name> a treaty of peace, under which <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> ceded to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> an extent of territory equal in area to <placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> combined, and thereafter the origin of the war was an obsolete question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>Upon another point he and the other Whigs were equally wise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>Repelling the <rs>Democratic</rs> charge that they were unpatriotic in denouncing the war, they voted in favor of every measure to sustain, supply, and encourage the soldiers in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/>This was followed by the <rs>Border Ruffian</rs> invasions, in which <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> voters elected a bogus <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">territorial legislature</orgName>, and the bogus legislature enacted a code of bogus laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>In turn, the more rapid emigration from free States filled the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> with a majority of free-State voters, who quickly organized a compact free-State party, which sent a free-State constitution, known as the <rs>Topeka Constitution</rs>, to Congress, and applied for admission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>This movement proved barren, because the <num value="2">two</num> houses of Congress were divided in sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>The whole finally culminated in a chronic border war between <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> raiders on <num value="1">one</num> hand, and free- State guerrillas on the other; and it became necessary to send Federal troops to check the disorder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1389"/>These slight preliminaries, duly embellished in the newspapers, gave the key to the <rs>Republican</rs> campaign, which designated <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0029.0011.00155.00828" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> as the Rail-splitter Candidate, and, added to his common <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> sobriquet of <quote>Honest old <persName><foreName>Abe</foreName></persName>,</quote> furnished both country and city campaign orators a powerfully sympathetic appeal to the rural and laboring element of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p>

<p>gentlemen: I have, as you are aware, thought a great deal about the relation of this war to slavery; and you all remember that, several weeks ago, I read to you an order I had prepared on this subject, which, on account of objections made by some of you, was not issued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2933"/>Ever since then my mind has been much occupied with this subject, and I have thought, all along, that the time for acting on it might probably come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2934"/>I think the time has come now. I wish it was a better time.
