<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>The composition of the convention assembled in <placeName>Richmond</placeName> in the spring of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, to consider the question of secession, proved that the people of <placeName>Virginia</placeName> did not regard <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0070.0001.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s election as a sufficient cause for that measure, for at least <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of its members were elected as <quote>Union men.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>And they and their constituents continued to be so, until the determination to <quote>coerce</quote> the seceded States was proclaimed by the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> required to furnish her quota of the troops to be organized for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>War being then inevitable, and the convention compelled to decide whether the <rs>State</rs> should aid in the subjugation <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> of the other Southern States, or join them in the defense of principles it had professed since <dateStruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></dateStruct> --belong to the invading party, or to that standing on the defensive &mdash; it chose the latter, and passed its ordinance of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>The people confirmed that choice by an overwhelming vote. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>The passage of that ordinance, in secret session on the <dateStruct value="-04-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, was not known in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, where, as <rs type="role" reg="Quartermaster-General">Quartermaster-General</rs> of the <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">United States Army</orgName>, I was then stationed, until the <num value="19" type="ordinal">19th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>I believed, like most others, that the division of the country would be permanent; and that, apart from any right of secession, the revolution begun was justified by the maxims so often repeated by <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0070.0001.00010.00010" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>, that free government is founded on the consent of the governed, and that every community strong enough to establish and maintain its independence has a right to assert it. Having been educated in such opinions, I naturally determined to return to the <rs>State</rs> of which I was a native, join the people among whom I was born, and live with my kindred, and, if necessary, fight in their defense. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Accordingly, the resignation of my commission, written on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, was offered to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>. That gentleman was requested, at the same time, to instruct the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</rs>, who had kindly accompanied me, to write the order announcing its acceptance, immediately. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>No other officer of the <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">United States Army</orgName> of equal rank, that of brigadier-general, relinquished his position in it to join the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Many officers of that army, of Southern birth, had previously resigned their commissions, to return <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> to the <name>States</name> of which they were citizens, and many others did so later.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Their objects in quitting the <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">United States Army</orgName>, and their intentions to enter the service of the seceded States, were well known in the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Yet no evidence of disapproval of these intentions was given by the <rs>Federal Administration</rs>, nor efforts made by it to prevent their execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>This seems to me strong proof that they were not then considered criminal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Northern editors and political speakers accuse those who thus left the service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> for that of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, of perjury, in breaking their oaths of allegiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It is impossible that the inventors and propagators of this charge can be ignorant that it is false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The acceptance of an officer's resignation absolves him from the obligations of his military oath as completely as it releases the government from that of giving him the pay of the grade he held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>An officer is bound by that oath to allegiance to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and obedience to the officers they may set over him. When the contract between the government and himself is dissolved by mutual consent, as in the cases in question, he is no more bound, <hi rend="italics">under his oath</hi>, to allegiance to the government, than to obedience to his former commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>These <num value="2">two</num> obligations are in force only during tenure of office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The individual who was an officer has, when he becomes a citizen, exactly the same obligations to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> as other citizens. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>This principle was always acted upon by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Whenever a military officer received a new appointment, either of a higher grade, or of an equal <num value="1">one</num> in another corps, he was required to <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> repeat the oath of office, because the previous <num value="1">one</num>, including of course that of allegiance, was held to have expired with the previous office, although the individual had not ceased to be an officer of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>When he left the army, as well as a particular office in it, the case was certainly stronger. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Leaving all my property but personal arms and clothing, I set off to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> with my family, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>In consequence of railroad accidents, however, we did not reach that place until daybreak, <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0070.0001.00012.00011" reg="mostcommon:Lee,R.,E.,,:6"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> had been appointed commander-in-chief, with the rank of major-general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>There were, however, several other officers of that grade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>A few hours after my arrival, <persName n="Letcher,Governor,,,," id="n0070.0001.00012.00012" reg="mostcommon:Letcher,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Letcher</surname></persName> gave me the appointment of major-general. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The commander-in-chief assigned me to the service of organizing and instructing the volunteers then just beginning to assemble at the call of the <rs>Governor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>He himself was then selecting the points to be occupied by these troops for the protection of the <rs>State</rs>, and determining the number to be assigned to each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/><placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>, a point near <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, another in front of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, <placeName reg="Manassas, Manassas, Virginia" key="tgn,2112877">Manassas Junction</placeName>, <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, and <persName n="Grafton,,,,," id="n0070.0001.00012.00013" reg="mostcommon:Grafton,nomatch:0"><surname>Grafton</surname></persName>, seemed to be regarded by him as the most important positions, for they were to be occupied in greatest force. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>I was assisted in my duties by <persName n="Pemberton,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0070.0001.00012.00014" reg="mostcommon:Pemberton,J.,C.,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>Pemberton</surname></persName>, <persName n="Jackson,Major,,,," id="n0070.0001.00012.00015" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,W.,H.,,:6"><roleName n="Major">Majors</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Gilham,Major,,,," id="n0070.0001.00012.00016" reg="mostcommon:Gilham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major"></roleName><surname>Gilham</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Preston,Captain,T.,L.,," id="n0070.0001.00012.00017" reg="default:Preston,T.,L.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Preston</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Near the end of <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, however, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> named was promoted to a colonelcy and assigned to the command of <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, held until then by <persName n="Harper,Colonel,Kenton,,," id="n0070.0001.00012.00018" reg="default:Harper,Kenton,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Kenton</foreName> <surname>Harper</surname></persName>. <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>I was employed in this way about <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure>. Then, <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 17" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> having acceded to the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, the government of which assumed the direction of military affairs, I accepted a brigadier-generalcy offered me by telegraph by the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It was then the highest grade in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The offer had been made in <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> previous telegrams sent to <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0070.0001.00013.00019" reg="mostcommon:Lee,R.,E.,,:6"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, for me, but not delivered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The <orgName n="Virginia Convention" type="convention">Virginia Convention</orgName> had abolished my office in the <rs>State</rs> service, and offered me the next lower.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>But, as it was certain that the war would be conducted by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, and its officers had precedence of those having like State grades, I preferred the <rs>Confederate</rs> commission. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> had me called to <persName n="Montgomery,,,,," id="n0070.0001.00013.00020" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,nomatch:0"><surname>Montgomery</surname></persName> to receive instructions, and there assigned me to the command of <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>In my journeys from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to <persName n="Montgomery,,,,," id="n0070.0001.00013.00021" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,nomatch:0"><surname>Montgomery</surname></persName>, and thence to <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, I saw in the crowds assembled at all the railroad-stations the appearance of great enthusiasm for the war against subjugation-so much as to give me the impression that all of the population fit for military service might have been brought into the field, if the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> could have furnished them with arms and ammunition-which, unfortunately, it had not provided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>Either from defects in the law itself, or faults in the manner in which it was administered, it had the effect of weakening the army by its immediate operation, without adding to its strength subsequently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>Its numbers were greatly reduced before the end of the month by furloughs under the recent law, given directly by the <rs type="role" reg="acting-Secretary of War">acting Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>That officer was in the habit of granting leaves of absence, furloughs, and discharges, accepting resignations, and detailing soldiers to labor for contractors, or on nominal service, taking them out of the army upon applications made directly to himself, without the knowledge of the officers whose duty it was to look to the interests of the <rs>Government</rs> in such cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>It is, however, indispensable to the success of the undertaking, that you should remove certain difficulties which not only embarrass the execution of these particular orders, but are also causing great confusion and an approach to demoralization in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>They result from a practice of giving orders to the army in matters of military detail which should only <pb id="p.92" n="92"/> come from the commanding officers present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>It is impossible to specify in detail all these orders, as many of them are brought incidentally to my knowledge by the difficulties attending their execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>I allude especially to those granting furloughs, leaves of absence, discharges, and acceptances of resignations, made directly by yourself, without giving the officers concerned a hearing; detailing mechanics and other soldiers to labor for contractors; ordering troops into this department and from it without consulting me, or even informing me of the fact; and removing companies from point to point within it. <num value="2">Two</num> of these companies were at Manassas-having been selected to man some heavy batteries there; they had become well instructed in that service, and, of course, were unpractised as infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>The companies that take their places will for weeks be worthless as artillery, as they are as infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>Our organization being incomplete, I am compelled thus to select troops for special service; and, if, as general, I cannot control such matters, our heavy guns are useless expense. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>I have been informed that you have already granted furloughs to <num value="4">four</num> entire companies, but have received only <num value="1">one</num> of the orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>This increases the difficulty of inducing reenlistment of infantry as such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>You will perceive readily that, while you are granting furloughs on such a scale at <pb id="p.93" n="93"/> <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, I cannot safely grant them at all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>This proposition is intended to be general-to embrace not merely the prisoners of war taken by armies near the <rs>Potomac</rs>, but to apply to those captured by all the forces of either belligerent. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>The terms of exchange, which seem to me appropriate, are those which have been established in modern war-equal exchange of those having similar rank; equivalent values when there is not equality of rank. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>I arrived in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="--20"><day reg="2">20th</day></dateStruct>, early enough to reach the <rs>President</rs>'s office <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> before <time value="12pm">noon</time>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> explained that he had sent for me to discuss the question of withdrawing the army to a less exposed position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>I replied that, although the withdrawal of the army from <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName> would be necessary before <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0070.0004.00096.00534" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,G.,B.,,:1"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s invasion, which might be expected as soon as the country should be in condition for the marching of armies, it was impossible then, without much suffering by the troops, and great sacrifice of military property, including baggage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>On that account, I thought the measure should be postponed until the end of the winter, and represented that the artillery-horses could not then draw field-pieces with their ammunition-chests, nor loaded caissons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>This brought on a long discussion of the best mode of bringing off the guns of the <placeName reg="Evansport, Defiance, Ohio" key="tgn,2079480">Evansport</placeName> batteries, which prolonged the conference until near sunset.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>This extraordinary proof of the indiscretion of the members of the cabinet, or of some <num value="1">one</num> of them, might have taught the danger of intrusting to that body any design the success of which depended upon secrecy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2363"/>Of course but a general outline is necessary, as matters of detail must be left to your judgment and discretion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2364"/>It is not deemed advisable to attempt the capture of the enemy's fortified positions by direct attack, but to draw out, and then, if practicable, force him to battle in the open field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2365"/>To accomplish this object, we should so move as to concentrate our means between the scattered forces of the enemy, and, failing to draw him out for battle, to move upon his lines of communication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2366"/>The force in <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName> depends in a great measure on its connection with <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> for support, and both are entirely dependent on regular and rapid communication with <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2367"/>To separate these <num value="2">two</num> by interposing our main force, and then strike and destroy the railroad from <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> to <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, fulfills both conditions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2368"/>To accomplish this, it is proposed that you move as soon as your means and force can be collected, <pb id="p.292" n="292"/> so as to reach the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee River</placeName> near <placeName reg="Kingston, Bartow, Georgia" key="tgn,2023318">Kingston</placeName>, where a crossing can be effected; that <persName n="Longstreet,Lieutenant-General,,,," id="n0070.0010.00292.01908" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,J.,,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> move simultaneously by a route <name>east</name> and <name>south</name> of <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>, so as to form a junction with you near this crossing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2369"/>As soon as you come within supporting distance, <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName> is isolated, and <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> threatened, with barely a possibility for the enemy to unite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2370"/>Should he not then offer you battle outside of his intrenched lines, a rapid move across the mountains from <placeName reg="Kingston, Bartow, Georgia" key="tgn,2023318">Kingston</placeName> to <placeName reg="Sparta, White, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101606">Sparta</placeName> (a very practicable and easy route) would place you, with a formidable army, in a country full of resources, where it is supposed, with a good supply of ammunition, you may be entirely self-sustaining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2371"/>And it is confidently believed that such a move would necessitate the withdrawal of the enemy to the line of the <rs>Cumberland</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2372"/>At the same time when this move is made, it is proposed to throw a heavy column of cavalry, as a diversion, into <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">West</rs> Tennessee</placeName>; and thence, if practicable, into <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Middle</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, to operate on the enemy's lines of communication and distract his attention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2373"/>If by a rapid movement, after crossing the mountains, you can precipitate your main force upon <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, and capture that place before the enemy can fall back for its defense, you place him in a most precarious position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2374"/>But in any event, by a movement in rear of <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> while the <rs>Cumberland</rs> is low, similar to the <num value="1">one</num> in passing <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, you isolate that position and compel a retrograde movement of the enemy's main force. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2391"/>Permit me to suggest that the troops intended for the operations you explain should be assembled in this vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2392"/>The enemy could, without particular effort, prevent their junction near <placeName reg="Kingston, Roane, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099865">Kingston</placeName> by attacking <num value="1">one</num> of our armies with his united forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2393"/>His interior positions make it easy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2394"/>There is another reason: <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0070.0010.00295.01920" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s return to <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> indicates that he will retain that command, for the present at least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2395"/>He certainly will not do so to stand on the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2396"/>I therefore believe that he will advance as soon as he can, with the greatest force he can raise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2397"/>We cannot estimate the time he will require for preparation, and should, consequently, put ourselves in condition for successful resistance as soon as possible, by assembling here the troops you enumerate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2398"/>I am doing all I can in other preparations, and do not doubt that abundance of ammunition, food, and forage, will be collected long before we can be supplied with field-transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2399"/>My department is destitute of mules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2405"/>Would it not be easier to march into <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Middle</rs> Tennessee</placeName> through <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659"><rs type="direction">North</rs> Alabama</placeName> I believe fully, however, that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0070.0010.00296.01921" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> will be ready to act before we can be; and that, if we are ready to fight him on our own ground, we shall have a very plain course, with every chance of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2406"/>For that, we should make exactly such preparations as you indicate for the forward movement, except that I would have the troops assembled here without delay, to repel <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0070.0010.00296.01922" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s attack, and then make our own; or, should the enemy not take the initiative, do it ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2410"/>Even <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of that force might injure the railroads enough to compel the evacuation of <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2411"/>Certainly it could make a powerful diversion. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3449"/>This class, in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> as in all other countries, formed the body of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3450"/>In all the earlier part of the war, when the <rs>Confederate</rs> money was not much below that of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in value, our troops were paid with some regularity, and the soldiers of the laboring class who had families, fed and clothed them with their pay, as they had formerly done with the wages of their labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3451"/>And so long as that state of things continued, the strength of the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> was little impaired; and those armies were maintained on such a footing as to justify the hope, which was general in the <rs>South</rs> until the fall of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, that we were to win <pb id="p.424" n="424"/> in the contest.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3454"/>The wretched impressment laws deprived the army of many valuable men of a class less poor than that just referred to. Those laws required the impressment of all articles of military necessity that could not be purchased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3455"/>The Government had the power of regulating the prices to be paid by it for all such commodities; and its commissioners appointed for the purpose fixed them much below the market values.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3457"/>No rules for their guidance were prescribed; none at least that were observed by them or known to the public, and they were subjected to no supervision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3458"/>All the property of Confederate citizens applicable to military purposes was, therefore, under their absolute control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3459"/>The bad and indifferent officers impressed what they were called upon to furnish, in the manner least inconvenient to themselves, usually on the nearest plantations or farms, or those where opposition was not to be apprehended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3460"/><pb id="p.425" n="425"/> The farms of soldiers were generally under the management of women, and therefore were, not unusually, drawn upon for much more than their proportion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3461"/>Hence it was not uncommon for a soldier to be written to by his wife, that so much of the food he had provided for herself and his children had been impressed, that it was necessary that he should return to save them from suffering or starvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3462"/>Such a summons, it may well be supposed, was never unheeded. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3463"/>The sufferings of the soldiers themselves, produced by the want of proper clothing, drove many of the least hardy out of the ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3464"/>Want of food also is said to have had the same effect, especially in the army before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, in the last winter of the war. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3465"/>It was by such causes, all due to an empty treasury, that our armies were so reduced in the last months of the war. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3466"/>As to the charge of want of loyalty, or zeal in the war, I assert, from as much opportunity for observation as any individual had, that no people ever displayed so much, under such circumstances, and with so little flagging, for so long a time continuously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3467"/>This was proved by the long service of the troops without pay, and under exposure to such hardships, from the causes above mentioned, as modern troops have rarely endured; by the voluntary contributions of food and clothing sent to the armies from every district that furnished a regiment; by the general and continued submission of the people to the tyranny of the impressment system as practised-such a tyranny, I believe, as no other high-spirited people ever endured-and by the sympathy <pb id="p.426" n="426"/> and aid given in every house to all professing to belong to the army, or to be on the way to join it. And this spirit continued not only after all hope of success had died, but after the final confession of defeat by their military commanders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3468"/>But, even if the men of the <rs>South</rs> had not been zealous in the cause, the patriotism of their mothers and wives and sisters would have inspired them with zeal or shamed them into its manifestation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3469"/>The women of the <rs>South</rs> exhibited that feeling wherever it could be exercised: in the armies, by distributing clothing made with their own hands; at the railroad-stations and their own homes, by feeding the marching soldiers; and, above all, in the hospitals, where they rivaled Sisters of Charity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3470"/>I am happy in the belief that their devoted patriotism and gentle charity are to be richly rewarded. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3473"/>This belief was produced by the most malignant and industriously circulated slanders by which the reputation of any public man of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> ever suffered &mdash; the accusation against <persName n="Floyd,,John,B.,," id="n0070.0013.00426.02837" reg="default:Floyd,John,B.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, that while <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> he had all the public arms removed from Northern to Southern arsenals; to disarm the <rs>North</rs> and arm the <rs>South</rs> for the impending war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3476"/>Yet it continued to be circulated and believed-while the refutation, although by such a body, was unnoticed-and, I believe, is now forgotten. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3477"/>The facts that were distorted into that calumny are clearly stated in the report of the committee, and must be well known by the principal officers of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <orgName n="Ordnance Bureau" type="bureau">Ordnance Bureau</orgName>, and recorded in that Bureau; for the orders in question were given through that, the proper channel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3478"/>They are briefly these: Previous to the year <dateStruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></dateStruct>, the infantry arms manufactured under the direction of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> had been accumulating in the <rs type="place">Springfield Armory</rs>, in consequence of the neglect of an old rule of the <rs>Government</rs> which required the distribution of these arms in arsenals constructed for the purpose, in the different sections of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3479"/>In the beginning of that year, the accumulation had filled the places of deposit at <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532">Springfield</placeName>, where the newly-adopted improved arms were made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4787"/>I deem that to have made the movement to <placeName reg="Clinton, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056180">Clinton</placeName> by <hi rend="italics">any</hi> route, but more especially the <quote>most direct or nearest route,</quote> would have been hazardous in the extreme-yes, suicidal; for in that case would my flank and rear have been entirely unprotected, and a large portion of the enemy's force, of whose position <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0070.0015.00549.03713" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> seemed to be entirely ignorant, could have interposed itself between my army and its base of operations, <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, and have taken that stronghold almost without a struggle, so small was the garrison after I had withdrawn all my available force for the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4788"/><pb id="p.550" n="550"/> </p> 
<p>The object, no doubt, of the order was, that the detachment of the enemy at <placeName reg="Clinton, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056180">Clinton</placeName> should be promptly assailed, <quote>while separate and beyond support.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4789"/>But was it beyond supporting distance of the other columns?
