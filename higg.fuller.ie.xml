<head>Chapter <num type="roman" value="1" n="I"><num value="1">1</num></num>: <persName n="Ossoli,,Margaret,Fuller,," id="n0182.0001.00001.00001" reg="default:Ossoli,Margaret,Fuller,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <foreName>Fuller</foreName> <surname>Ossoli</surname></persName> &mdash; Introductory.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>It has long been my desire to write a new memoir of <persName n="Ossoli,,Margaret,Fuller,," id="n0182.0001.00001.00002" reg="default:Ossoli,Margaret,Fuller,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <foreName>Fuller</foreName> <surname>Ossoli</surname></persName>, a person whose career is more interesting, as it seems to me, than that of any other American of her sex; a woman whose aims were high and whose services great; <num value="1">one</num> whose intellect was uncommon, whose activity incessant, whose life varied, and whose death dramatic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/><measure n="30years" type="date">Thirty years</measure> having passed since the publication of her <quote>Memoirs,</quote> it has seemed possible that a biography might now be written almost wholly from new or unused material, thus affording a positive addition to what was before known of her, and not a mere restatement of what was already before the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>In this aspect, at least, the effort has been successful, nearly every citation in the book being from manuscript sources; and the study of these materials having in all respects controlled the delineation here given of her life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Recognizing the great value of the portraiture <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> already drawn of her character by the authors of the <quote>Memoirs,</quote> and the excellence of <persName n="Howe,Mrs.,,,," id="n0182.0001.00002.00003" reg="mostcommon:Howe,Julia,Ward,,:1"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Howe</surname></persName>'s more condensed biography, I have sometimes ventured to vary from their estimate, and to rely on my own.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>It so happened that <persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0182.0001.00002.00004" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName> was associated with me, not closely but definitely, by various personal ties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>She was born and bred in the same town, though more than <measure n="13years" type="date">thirteen years</measure> older; she was the friend of my older sisters, and I was the playmate of her younger brothers; her only sister was afterwards closely connected with me by marriage, and came for especial reasons, with her children, peculiarly under my charge; and, though this was after <persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0182.0001.00002.00005" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName>'s death, it yet contributed with all the other circumstances to make the <name>Fuller</name> family seem like kindred of my own. It moreover happened that <persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0182.0001.00002.00006" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName> had upon me, through her writings, a more immediate intellectual influence than any <num value="1">one</num> except <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0182.0001.00002.00007" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,:6"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName>, and possibly <persName n="Parker,,,,," id="n0182.0001.00002.00008" reg="nearbymention:Parker,Theodore,,,"><surname>Parker</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>All this guarantees that warm feeling of personal interest, without which no memoir can be well written, while there was yet too little of intimacy to give place for the glamour of affection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>This biography may therefore serve as an intermediate step between the original <quote>Memoirs</quote> --which gave the estimate offered by personal friendship &mdash; and that remoter verdict which will be the judgment of an impartial posterity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The sources on which I have chiefly relied are <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> (<num value="1">1</num>) the <num value="5">five</num> bulky volumes in possession of the <name>Fuller</name> family, into which a great variety of written material was transcribed by <persName n="Fuller,Reverend,A.,B.,," id="n0182.0001.00003.00009" reg="expanded:Fuller,Arthur,B.,,"><roleName n="Reverend">Rev.</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName>, after the publication of the <quote>Memoirs,</quote> --and to which I have referred always as the <quote>Fuller Mss.</quote> ; (<num value="2">2</num>) <persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0182.0001.00003.00010" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName>'s letters to <persName n="Emerson,Mister,,,," id="n0182.0001.00003.00011" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,:6"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Emerson</surname></persName>, kindly lent me by <persName n="Emerson,Mister,,,," id="n0182.0001.00003.00012" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,:6"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Emerson</surname></persName>'s executors; (<num value="3">3</num>) her letters to <persName n="Hedge,Doctor,F.,H.,," id="n0182.0001.00003.00013" reg="expanded:Hedge,Frederick,Henry,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Hedge</surname></persName>, lent me by himself; (<num value="4">4</num>) those to <persName n="Greene,the Honorable,A.,G.,," id="n0182.0001.00003.00014" reg="expanded:Greene,Albert,G.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">the Hon.</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <surname>Greene</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence, R.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>In the cases where I have used the same written material with the editors of the <quote>Memoirs,</quote> the selections employed have been wholly different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>A few printed books, issued since the publication of the <quote>Memoirs,</quote> have given some aid, especially <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0182.0001.00003.00025" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>'s <quote>Recollections of a busy life,</quote> <persName n="Weiss,,,,," id="n0182.0001.00003.00026" reg="mostcommon:Weiss,John,,,:1"><surname>Weiss</surname></persName>'s <quote>Life of <persName n="Parker,,Theodore,,," id="n0182.0001.00003.00027" reg="default:Parker,Theodore,,,"><foreName>Theodore</foreName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName>,</quote> <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> and the <quote><persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0182.0001.00004.00028" reg="mostcommon:Carlyle,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>-<persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0182.0001.00004.00029" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,:6"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> correspondence;</quote> but the main reliance has necessarily been placed on material not hitherto made public; and to all the friends who have helped me to this I am profoundly grateful.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>If my view of <persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0182.0001.00004.00030" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName> differs a little from that of previous biographers, it is due to the study of these original sources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>With every disposition to defer to the authors of the <quote>Memoirs,</quote> all of whom have been in <num value="1">one</num> way or another my friends and teachers, I am compelled in some cases to go with what seems the preponderance of written evidence against their view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/><persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0182.0001.00004.00031" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName> was indeed, as <num value="1">one</num> of them has lately said to me, many women in <num value="1">one</num>, and there is room for a difference of opinion even in assigning a keynote to her life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>In their analysis, these biographers seem to me to have given an inevitable prominence to her desire for self-culture, perhaps because it was on this side that she encountered them; but I think that any <num value="1">one</num> who will patiently study her in her own unreserved moments will now admit that what she always most desired was not merely self-culture, but a career of mingled thought and action, such as she finally found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>She who, at the age of <num value="13">thirteen</num>, met young scholars returned from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> with enthusiastic vindications of <orgName n="American Society" type="society">American society</orgName> against their attacks; she who, a few years after, read with delight all <placeName reg="Jefferson City, Cole, Missouri" key="tgn,7013811">Jefferson</placeName>'s correspondence, was not framed by nature for a mystic, a dreamer, or a book-worm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>She longed, <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> as she herself said, to be a Pericles rather than an Anaxagoras; and she occupied her time with omnivorous study, with writing, with talking, with mysticism, while waiting for her career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>In view of all this, I cannot resist the opinion that the prevalent tone of the <quote>Memoirs</quote> leaves her a little too much in the clouds, and gives us too little of that vigorous executive side which was always prominent in her aspirations for herself, and which was visible to all after she reached <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>I am the more led to say this because it is essential to the plan of the present series that I should dwell chiefly on her literary life, while knowing that this life was only preliminary, and that she would not have wished to be judged by it after she had once entered on the life of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The following pages will, I hope, be a more adequate record than has before been given of what she did for our dawning literature; but they yet leave room for a book by some other hand that shall fully delineate the <rs>Margaret Fuller Ossoli</rs> who stood by the side of <persName n="Mazzini,,,,," id="n0182.0001.00005.00032" reg="mostcommon:Mazzini,Joseph,,,:1"><surname>Mazzini</surname></persName> in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, and whose hands the young patriots clasped in the hospital crying, <quote lang="it"><placeName key="tgn,2745875" n="1.000 10" reg="Viva, Pointe Coupee, Louisiana">Viva</placeName> l'italia</quote> as they died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>At the very moment when <persName n="Lowell,,,,," id="n0182.0001.00005.00033" reg="mostcommon:Lowell,J.,R.,,:2"><surname>Lowell</surname></persName> was satirizing her in his <quote>Fable for critics,</quote> she was leading such a life as no American woman had led in this century before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Still, as I said, <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> I must now make that part of her record secondary and dwell chiefly on its intellectual side; only keeping before my readers the fact that the best part of intellect is action, and that this was always her especial creed. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>Longing for expression, she yet finds her thoughts, she says, too slight or inadequate to be written down; and therefore likes to speak them, though conscious that even this amount of expression may not always be an advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>My dear friend,--I feel it more difficult to give on paper a complete outline of my plan for the proposed conversations than I expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>I find so much to say that I cannot make any statement satisfactory to myself, within such limits as would be convenient for your purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>As no <num value="1">one</num> will wish to take the trouble of reading a long manuscript, I shall rather suggest than tell what I propose to do, and defer a full explanation till the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>The advantages of a weekly meeting for conversation might be great enough to <pb id="p.113" n="113"/> repay attendance, if they consisted only in supplying a point of union to well-educated and thinking women, in a city which, with great pretensions to mental refinement, boasts at present nothing of the kind; and where I have heard many of mature age wish for some such place of stimulus and cheer; and those younger, for a place where they could state their doubts and difficulties, with a hope of gaining aid from the experience or aspirations of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>And if my office were only to suggest topics, which would lead to conversation of a better order than is usual at social meetings, and to turn back the current when digressing into personalities or commonplaces, so that what is most valuable in the experience of each might be brought to bear upon all, I should think the object not unworthy of the effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>But my ambition goes much farther.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>It is to pass in review the departments of thought and knowledge, and endeavor to place them in due relation to <num value="1">one</num> another in our mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>As a substitute for this she proposed to try the uses of conversation, to be conducted in a somewhat systematic way, under efficient leadership.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>Accordingly these meetings, although taking a wide range, were always concentrated, and with a good deal of effect, on certain specified subjects ; the most prominent of these being, perhaps, that of Mythology, or the reappearance of religious ideas under varying forms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>It is a theme which has since assumed great importance and commanded a literature of its own; but it was then new, and had to be studied at great disadvantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>This done, she invited questions or criticisms: if these lagged, she put questions herself, using persuasion for the <pb id="p.116" n="116"/> timid, kindly raillery for the indifferent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>On some of these subjects she had, in her circle, undoubted experts, who knew on certain particular points more than she did. Of these she availed herself, but kept the reins in her own hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>We all know that the best-planned talk is a lottery; to-day blanks, to-morrow prizes; and there were times when the leader could bring out no cooperation, and had to fall back on monologue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>But this was not common, and even the imperfect fragments in the way of report given by <persName n="Emerson,Mister,,,," id="n0182.0008.00116.00478" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,:6"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Emerson</surname></persName> in the <quote>Memoirs</quote> <note anchored="yes">

After this we never saw them; some letters have which tell a tale of deep maternal happiness and satisfaction-of the tenderness of her husband, and of serene days such as her life had known but few. I look back upon those days in <placeName reg="Firenze, Firenze, Toscana" key="tgn,7000457">Florence</placeName> as the peacefullest she had ever known; in them she had sweet communion with nature, love, and a tender mother's joy.

<p>I have heard it suggested by some <num value="1">one</num> that <persName n="Ossoli,,,,," id="n0182.0015.00242.01252" reg="nearbymention:Ossoli,Margaret,Fuller,,"><surname>Ossoli</surname></persName> had married <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> under the impression of her having a large fortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2226"/>That this is utterly false I can declare, since to my own knowledge he was in the habit, even from their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> acquaintance, of making for her what the <name>Italians</name> term little economies, and was in <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s unreserved confidence as to the feeble state of her purse.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2227"/>Again, I have heard it said that he was a person entirely without education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2228"/>I can only say that his education was equal to that of most <name>Roman</name> gentlemen, not thorough, but such as suited him for his rank and position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2229"/>He had from his youth been under the care of a priest, who taught him as a tutor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2230"/>He knew not much of foreign languages, read French a little, and was a good deal interested in <placeName reg="Italian">Italian</placeName> history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2231"/>Many of our countrymen who saw him could discover little in him, but that was rather because he was not quickly interested in others, than that he lacked interesting points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2232"/>He was always reserved, and, when with <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, preferred always to hear her talk, even <pb id="p.243" n="243"/> when she spoke a language he did not know, than to talk himself or hear any <num value="1">one</num> else.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2233"/>His manner towards <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> was devoted and lover-like to a striking degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2234"/>He cared not how trivial was the service if he might perform it for her. I remember to have seen him <num value="1">one</num> morning, after they had been married nearly <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, set off on an errand to get the handle of her parasol mended, with as much genuine knightly zeal as if the charge had been a much weightier <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2235"/>As he took it, he said, <q direct="unspecified"> How sweet it is to do little things for you; never attend to such yourself, always leave them to me for my pleasure.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2236"/>When she was ill he nursed and watched over her with the tenderness of woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2237"/>When she said to him, <q direct="unspecified">How have you learned to be so good a nurse,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">My father was ill, and I tended upon him.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2238"/>No service was too trivial, no sacrifice too great for him. He never wished her to give up any pleasure because he could not share it, but if she were interested, he would go with her to any house, leave her, and call again to take her home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2239"/>Such tender, unselfish love I have rarely before seen; it made green her days, and gave her an expression of peace and serenity which before was a stranger to her. <q direct="unspecified"> No companion in nature was ever so much to me as is <persName n="Ossoli,,,,," id="n0182.0015.00243.01253" reg="nearbymention:Ossoli,Margaret,Fuller,,"><surname>Ossoli</surname></persName>;</q> does not this show that his soul was deep and full of emotion; for who that knew <persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0182.0015.00243.01254" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName> would believe that any other companion would have been agreeable to her in her communion with nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2247"/>So much we saw ourselves, for we often went to his post and found him exhausted and faint for want of food and rest, but always firm and resolute to remain to the end. He was a captain of the <orgName n="Civic Guard" type="newspaper">Civic Guard</orgName>, and in many respects conspicuous for his adherence to <persName n="Mazzini,,,,," id="n0182.0015.00244.01261" reg="mostcommon:Mazzini,Joseph,,,:1"><surname>Mazzini</surname></persName>'s views, so that now they cannot remain in <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, and were obliged to leave at once <pb id="p.245" n="245"/> upon the entrance of the <rs>French</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2249"/>His radicalism causes him to be looked upon as the black sheep in the family, and it was on account of family difficulties that the marriage was not sooner made known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2250"/>If people were not always the best judges for themselves, it would seem better that it should have been made known at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; but I know enough of their affairs to say that they were prevented solely by family matters from declaring it at the time it occurred.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2635"/>The simple fact that the little <rs>Angelo</rs> was drowned in the arms of the steward is sufficient refutation of the charge that his mother refused to intrust him to anybody; and it remains only a question of judgment whether the attempt to save him should have been made sooner.

It is hard enough to be perfectly sure of the facts in case of a runaway accident which takes place in broad daylight opposite our own windows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2640"/>It is difficult to this day to get a thoroughly correct account of the most insignificant skirmish during our civil war; and of a wreck that happens at daybreak in a howling storm, on a lee shore, the longest cross-examination of the survivors hardly avails.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2709"/>This statement belongs upon the same plane with that made by <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0182.0018.00286.01396" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,:6"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> in his essay on the <quote>Over-soul,</quote> that <quote>In all conversation between <num value="2">two</num> persons, tacit reference is made to <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> party, to a common nature;</quote> but <persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0182.0018.00286.01397" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName>'s proposition is a somewhat different thing, and is even more suggestive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2710"/>Scattered through her letters and journals everywhere there are passages of which this is an example; and it is such as these to which <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0182.0018.00286.01398" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,:6"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> refers when he speaks of her <quote>lyric glimpses.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2711"/>But in her published writings she rarely attempted more than she felt herself able to state clearly; though her standard of clearness was not just that which now prevails.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2712"/>Even in her printed essays, however, she suffered from an exuberance of mental activity, which she had not yet learned to control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2713"/>Trained early to be methodical in her use of time, she had neither the leisure nor the health nor perhaps the impulse to be methodical in thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2714"/>In that teeming period when she lived, method was not <pb id="p.287" n="287"/> the strong point, nor did her friend <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0182.0018.00287.01399" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,:6"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> set her, in this respect, a controlling example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2715"/>The habit of conversation was perhaps bad for her, in this way, and may have tended, as does all extemporaneous speaking, toward a desultory habit of mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2716"/>Journalism, which was her next resource, leads in the same way; that is, the single editorial demands concentration, but <num value="2">two</num> successive editorials are rarely linked together, and still more rarely give room for what she calls <quote>the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> thought.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2717"/>Accordingly her <quote>Tribune</quote> articles had more symmetry than her previous writings, but it was symmetry within the restricted field of the newspaper column, which often unfits the best journalist for a more sustained flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2718"/>How far the maturer experience of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> may have remedied this, in her case, we never shall know, since her book was lost with her; and her record as a writer remains therefore unfinished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2719"/>Still it is something to know that on the whole she tended more and more to completeness of form, and to the proper control of her own abundant thoughts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2720"/>The evidence of this is not to be found in her <quote>Woman in the <num value="19" type="ordinal">Nineteenth</num> Century,</quote> --which, while full of thoughts and suggestions, is yet discursive and unmethodical,--but in her <quote>t Papers on Literature and Art.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2723"/>He stood to her in a clear light, as the man who by the consent of all contemporaries was best equipped for great deeds, yet never accomplished them; who must be judged by his results as against his promise; <foreign lang="la">omnium consensu capax imperii, nisi imperasset.</foreign> This has often since been pointed out, but no <num value="1">one</num> stated it so early, or at least so clearly as <persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0182.0018.00288.01401" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2808"/>With ready recognition of my own inferiority to them as respects personal knowledge, I find myself, after long and patient study of her writings, forming conclusions sometimes different from theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2809"/>I do not think that <persName n="Emerson,Mister,,,," id="n0182.0019.00300.01484" reg="nearbymention:Emerson,R.,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Emerson</surname></persName>, with his cool and tranquil temperament, always did quite justice to the ardent nature that flung itself against him; and it seems to me that her other biographers have sometimes been too much influenced by their own point of contact with her to see that the self-culture which brought her to them was by no means the whole of her aim. Let me, therefore, consider her character rather more minutely.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2810"/>It is to be remembered, in the first place, that her life was always saddened by the feeling that she had been defrauded of her childhood by too forced a precocity and deprived of her rightful health through mismanagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2811"/>Under this disadvantage she led thenceforward a life of constant checking and restriction, not as to pleasures, for which she rarely sighs in her diaries, but as to doing her appointed work in the world and employing the talents given her. Rising in the morning, as <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0182.0019.00300.01485" reg="nearbymention:Emerson,R.,W.,,"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> says of all of us, <quote>with an appetite that could eat the solar system like a cake,</quote> she soon finds herself restricted as to food <pb id="p.301" n="301"/> and wholly wanting in digestion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2812"/>With the largest views as to the aims and destiny of her nation, she was obliged to see the timid and the pessimists work on while she was fettered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2813"/>There are many who, because they cannot do the great things, refuse to do the little ones; she was ready to lavish herself on the smallest; no <num value="1">one</num> ever saw a more devoted daughter, sister, friend; and only her diary and a very few intimates knew how much this cost her or how she yearned for something more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2814"/>With inexorable frankness she saw that even her resignation was often a kind of despair, even the alms she gave were only a miserable substitute for the larger work she longed to do; and thus much she often expressed, not only to herself but to others.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2815"/>She thought that we human beings ought not, as she wrote to <persName n="Emerson,Mister,,,," id="n0182.0019.00301.01486" reg="nearbymention:Emerson,R.,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Emerson</surname></persName> (in <dateStruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></dateStruct>), <quote>to suppress the worst or select the best of ourselves,</quote> but to be <quote><hi rend="italics">altogether</hi> better.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2816"/>Even her own good deeds thoroughly dissatisfied her, and she often points out in her diaries that what passes for virtue in her is only the resigned acceptance of what seems to her subordinate and unsatisfactory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2817"/>Her life, so far from being selfish, overflowed with constant acts of private kindness; she was incessantly bearing burdens for others, but she was haunted, as many other strong natures have been, by the spirit of <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0182.0019.00301.01487" reg="nearbymention:Emerson,R.,W.,,"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName>'s couplet,--<quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2818"/></p><l>He who feeds men serveth few,</l> <l>He serves all who dares be true.</l></quote> <pb id="p.302" n="302"/> She demanded to serve all. When ill-health, domestic care, unsatisfied longings after life and action combined to depress her, she found, as so many others have found, that even self-devotion was only a palliative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2819"/>She writes in her diary:--<quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2820"/><cit><quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2821"/>When I have not joyous energy in myself, I can do these little things for others; very many of my attentions are of this spurious sort; they are my consolations; the givers [of gratitude] who thank me are deceived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2822"/>But what can I do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2823"/>I cannot always upbear my life all alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2824"/>The heart sinks and then I must help it by persuasions that it is better for others I should be here and theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2825"/>It is mere palliative, I know.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2826"/>In earliest days how many night-hours have found me thus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2827"/>I was always so lonely.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2838"/>These extracts are quite inconsistent, I think, with the charge most commonly made against <persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0182.0019.00303.01489" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName>,--that of vanity and undue self-absorption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2839"/>It must always be remembered that some previous descriptions of her have been in a manner warped by the fact that they proceeded from the most gifted and intellectual persons whom she knew; all these persons being almost always men whom she met under a certain amount of intellectual excitement, to whom she showed her brightest aspirations, her deepest solicitudes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2840"/>It was in the very nature of such a description that the every-day aspects should be left out; that we should see chiefly the seeress, the dreamer, the student.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2841"/>She writes reproachfully to a cultivated friend after an interview, <quote>You seemed to consider me as some <foreign lang="fr">tete exaltee,</foreign> at the hour when I was making bitter sacrifices to duty.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2842"/>Could a memoir have been made up out of her letters to her mother, full of suggestions about flower bulbs, plans as to the larder, and visions of a renovated silk dress; or could we have before us a long series of the sensible, warm-hearted, motherly letters she wrote every week to her absent younger brothers, the whole effect produced would have been <pb id="p.304" n="304"/> very different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2843"/>The complaint is constantly made that all her attainments and her self-culture did not bring her happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2844"/>It is asking a great deal of any single woman to be positively happy in the presence of tormenting ill-health, poverty, and a self-sacrificing habit that keeps her always on the strain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2845"/>It is even something to ask of a person, under such circumstances, that she should be habitually cheerful and hopeful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2846"/>That this last was the predominant tone of <persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0182.0019.00304.01490" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName>'s daily life is proved by all her more familiar letters and by the general testimony of those who knew her best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2847"/>No doubt, in her diaries, there are passages which record depression and sometimes almost morbid periods of self-inspection and self-reproach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2848"/>That is what diaries are made for; they exist in order that imaginative and passionate natures may relieve themselves by expressing these moods, and may then forget them and proceed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2849"/>The trouble comes when sympathetic biographers elevate these heights and depths into too great importance and find the table-lands of life uninteresting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2850"/>There never was a year of <persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0182.0019.00304.01491" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName>'s life, after her precocious maturity, when the greater part of it was not given to daily, practical, commonsense labor, and this usually for other people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2851"/>All periods have their fashions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2852"/>It does not mar our impression of the admirable capacity and self-devotion of <persName n="Adams,,Abigail,,," id="n0182.0019.00304.01492" reg="default:Adams,Abigail,,,"><foreName>Abigail</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> that she signed her early letters to her husband, <persName n="Adams,,John,,," id="n0182.0019.00304.01493" reg="default:Adams,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName>, as <quote>Portia.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2853"/>It was the fashion of the time; and <pb id="p.305" n="305"/> when <persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0182.0019.00305.01494" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName> afterwards tried to write out her imaginative and mystical side under the name of <quote><persName><foreName>Leila</foreName></persName>,</quote> it belonged to that period also; a period when <name>German</name> romance was just beginning to be translated, and <placeName reg="Oriental, Okfuskee, Oklahoma" key="tgn,2560760">Oriental</placeName> poetry to be read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2854"/>These were her dreams, her idealities; but when it was a question how to provide schoolbooks and an overcoat for her little brother, no other of <num value="10">ten</num> children ever set about the business with less of haziness or indefniteness of mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2855"/>If I have seemed in this book to bring my heroine down from the clouds a little; it is simply because I have used the materials at my command, and have tried to paint her as she was; a being not fed on nectar and ambrosia, after all, but on human nature's daily food.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2856"/>It may be asked why, with this daily and noble self-devotion she was not universally beloved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2857"/>It can be very briefly told: she wanted tact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2858"/>As some essentially selfish persons go through the world winning all hearts by merely possessing that quality, so others are always underrated for want of it. There is a story told of her, that at a party given expressly for her in <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> she took a piece of cake from a plate offered, and then impulsively replaced it with the remark, <quote>I fear there will not be enough to go round,</quote> thereby giving more offense than if she had personally appropriated the whole plateful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2859"/>It was this simple and not always judicious honesty of purpose which accounted for her frequent failure to attract at <pb id="p.306" n="306"/> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sight, while there have been few women &mdash; I at least have never known any woman &mdash; who left behind an affection so deep and strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2860"/>It is now <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> since her death, and there is scarcely a friend of hers who does not speak of her with as warm a devotion as if she had died yesterday.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2861"/>If <persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0182.0019.00306.01495" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName> was strict and unflinching in her judgments of other people, it was because she was so, above all, in dealing with herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2862"/>This is seen on every page of her diaries, which record the very heights and depths of a nature as yet uncontrolled and passionately aspiring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2863"/>Feeling her own powers and capacities, she also recognized her limitations; but her statements of these <num value="2">two</num> sides of the question might be wholly detached, and so gave the appearance of more moodiness than really existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2864"/>At any rate, moody or not, they were sincere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2865"/>A lady once said to me of the <name>Fuller</name> family: <quote>Their only peculiarity was that they said openly about themselves the good and bad things which we commonly suppress about ourselves and express only about other people.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2866"/>This was true, as has been said, about the elder Fullers, even in public; it was true of <persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0182.0019.00306.01496" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName> in her diaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2867"/>She was an acute analyst of character, and again and again in her various diaries we come upon sketches delineating the traits of each person in the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2868"/>Some of these are printed in the <title>Dial</title>.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2869"/><bibl><title>Dial</title>, i. <num value="136">136</num>, etc.</bibl></note> She always includes herself, and is usually more unflattering <pb id="p.307" n="307"/> to herself than to anybody else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2870"/>This may be called self-consciousness, but it certainly does not imply vanity; it quite as often takes the form of an almost excessive humility.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2871"/>It would be easy to illustrate all this at great length from her unpublished papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2872"/>The most presumptuous passage about herself that I have been able to find is this, which bears no date.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2873"/>In speaking of <persName n="Shelley,,,,," id="n0182.0019.00307.01497" reg="mostcommon:Shelley,P.,B.,,:1"><surname>Shelley</surname></persName>'s <quote>Defense of Poesie,</quote> just read, she expresses her joy at finding that he had taken the matter up very much from the point of view she had been presenting in her conversations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2881"/>How many authors, surrounded by a circle of admiring friends, are found to have descended, in their secret diaries, to quite such depths of humility as appear in these extracts?</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2882"/>Another point where I should diverge strongly from the current estimate of <persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0182.0019.00308.01504" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName> is in the prevailing assumption that her chief aim at any period of her life was self-culture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2883"/>The <name>Roman</name> thread in her was too strong, the practical inheritance from her parentage too profound, for her to have ever contented herself with a life of abstraction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2884"/>The strong training that came from her father, the early influence of <placeName reg="Jefferson City, Cole, Missouri" key="tgn,7013811">Jefferson</placeName>'s letters, all precluded this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2924"/>Coming from the most cultivated American woman of her day, it meant that there was something worth more than culture &mdash; namely, original thoughts and free action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2927"/>And this is said after reading many <num value="100">hundred</num> pages of her letters and journals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2928"/>They are clearly written, in a hand quite peculiar, not a little formal, and as it were jointed rather than flowing, and not greatly varying throughout her whole life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2929"/>She is always clear in style where she takes pains to be clear, is even business-like where she aims at that, and knows how to make herself emphatic without the aid of underscoring; indeed she abstains from this to an extent which would quite amaze <persName n="Howells,Mister,,,," id="n0182.0019.00312.01525" reg="mostcommon:Howells,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Howells</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2930"/>To be sure, she was not at all <num value="1">one</num> of those charming, helpless, inconsequent creatures whom he so exquisitely depicts; she demanded a great deal from life, but generally knew what she wanted, stated it effectively, and at last obtained it. It was indeed fortunate for her younger brothers and sisters that she was of this constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2931"/>She lived at a time when life in <placeName reg="America, McCurtain, Oklahoma" key="tgn,2131961">America</placeName> was hard for all literary people, from the absence of remuneration, the small supply of books, the habit of jealousy among authors, and <pb id="p.313" n="313"/> the lingering prevalence of the colonial spirit, which she battled stoutly to banish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2932"/>It was especially hard for women in that profession because there were few of them, their early education was won at great disadvantage, and much was conceded reluctantly that now comes as a matter of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2933"/>Were she living to-day her life would be far smoother; she would find plenty of remunerative work, fair recognition, and kindly sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2934"/>On the other hand, she would have to adapt herself to a somewhat different world, for she would not be surrounded by that ardent and effusive social atmosphere which prevailed throughout the limited world of Transcendentalism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2935"/>It was a fresh, glowing, youthful, hopeful, courageous period, and those who were its children must always rejoice that they were born before it faded away.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2936"/>My friend <persName n="Frothingham,Mister,O.,B.,," id="n0182.0019.00313.01526" reg="default:Frothingham,O.,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>O.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Frothingham</surname></persName>, the only direct historian of the <name>Transcendental</name> period, has failed, in my judgment, to give more than the husk and outside of it, although for this his book is valuable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2937"/>The trouble was that he was neither a part of that great impulse nor immediately its child; in the day of Transcendentalism he was looking in a different direction and had no sympathy for its aims; and yet he was not quite far enough away to view it in perspective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2938"/>To its immediate offspring, even if of a younger race, it bequeathed a glow and a joy that have been of life-long permanence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2939"/>I have noticed that most of those who, <pb id="p.314" n="314"/> were nurtured under that influence have had the good fortune to grow old slowly; their world is still poetic; the material achievements, the utilitarian philosophy of later years may come or go, leaving their ideal, their confidence, their immortal hope unchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2940"/>And now that much which Transcendentalism sought is fulfilled, and that which was ecstasy has &mdash; as <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0182.0019.00314.01527" reg="nearbymention:Emerson,R.,W.,,"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> predictedbecome daily bread, its reminiscences mingle with all youth's enchantments, and belong to a period when we too <quote>toiled, feasted, despaired, were happy.</quote></p>
