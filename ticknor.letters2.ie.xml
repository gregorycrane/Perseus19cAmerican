<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>In doing this I drove a good deal about the city, and was surprised to find how clean it is, how rich, solid, substantial, and even fresh, everything looks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Pavement can hardly be better than it is made in the streets here, the whole being of hewn, square blocks of granite, almost as nicely fitted to each other as if the work were masonry; but there are no <hi rend="italics">trottoirs</hi>, so that, though everybody walks cleanly and comfortably, nobody is protected against the carriages. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>In the afternoon we drove out to the <name>Prater</name>,&mdash;the famous <rs>Prater</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>It is a great public garden and drive, intersected with many pleasant walks and roads, ornamented with fine old trees, and parts of it enlivened with large numbers of deer, while other parts are rendered still more lively with coffee-houses, puppet-shows, and shows of animals. . . . . But we enjoyed very much the drive into the more picturesque parts, where the deer were browsing undisturbed, and oaks a <measure n="1000years" type="date">thousand years</measure> old cast their shade upon us, as they had, perchance, in their youth upon the <rs type="place">Court of Charlemagne</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>In some <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> places they were making hay, in others there were preserves of wild birds; and, though it is nowhere more beautiful and nowhere so well kept as the <rs>Grosse Garten</rs>, near <placeName key="tgn,2098870;tgn,7004455;tgn,1014721" n="0.106 000000.9548	placename;tgn,2098870;dresden, weakley, tennessee,Weakley,Tennessee,United States,North and Central America;0.015 000000.1364	placename;tgn,7004455;dresden,dresden,sachsen,deutschland,europe,Dresden,Sachsen,Deutschland,Europe;0.006 000000.0568	placename;tgn,1014721;dresden,ontario,canada,north and central america,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America" reg="dresden, weakley, tennessee,Weakley,Tennessee,United States,North and Central America;dresden,dresden,sachsen,deutschland,europe,Dresden,Sachsen,Deutschland,Europe;dresden,ontario,canada,north and central america,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America">Dresden</placeName>, it is, by its extent, much grander and finer. . . . .</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The garden is not pretty, and the house is not very spacious, but <num value="3">three</num> parlors and the court-yard were lighted; tea, fruit, ices, and refreshments were handed round, . . . . and there was much pleasant talk in <name>English</name>, <name>French</name>, <persName n="Italian,,,,," id="n0231.0001.00002.00010" reg="mostcommon:Italian,nomatch:0"><surname>Italian</surname></persName>, and <persName n="German,,,,," id="n0231.0001.00002.00011" reg="mostcommon:German,nomatch:0"><surname>German</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>He is a great amateur in this department, and I found much to interest and occupy me, though almost nothing of value that was <hi rend="italics">quite</hi> new.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>When I had finished this, . . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>This morning I received a note from him, saying he would be glad to see me at the <name>Chancery</name> between <time value="2">two</time> and <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time>. I went, and found it an enormous building, or rather pile of buildings, containing not only offices, but dwellings for a large number of the officers in his department, among the rest the offices of <persName n="Jarcke,,,,," id="n0231.0001.00003.00020" reg="mostcommon:Jarcke,nomatch:0"><surname>Jarcke</surname></persName> and Von Hammer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Over the portal is a Latin inscription, calling it&mdash;I know not why&mdash;a <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Praetorium">Praetorium</placeName>,</q> and signifying that it received its present external form and arrangement from <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Kaunitz</foreName></persName>, who so long held the place now held by the more powerful <persName><foreName>Metternich</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>I passed up by a fine staircase, and going through an antechamber with <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> servants in it, and another where was a doorkeeper with <num value="2">two</num> persons who looked as if they were something a little more, I was shown into <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> large room, where <num value="4">four</num> persons were waiting to have the great man accessible, a number which was speedily increased to <num value="7">seven</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>I sat down to wait with them, and waited, I suppose, <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure>. Meanwhile, secretaries came out with papers in their hands, as if they had been carried in for signature; <num value="2">two</num> of the ministers came and went; and everything had the air of a premier's antechamber, those who were present talking together only in whispers, if they talked at all, and even the servants, further out, not speaking above their breath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>I knew nobody, and said nothing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>At last the <num value="4">four</num> who were there when I arrived were admitted; they were, as I understood afterwards, a deputation from <placeName key="tgn,2059733" n="1.000 4" reg="milan, sullivan, missouri">Milan</placeName> on affairs of state, but they were soon despatched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>My turn came next, and, as soon as I had passed a double door, I found myself in a large and handsome library, across which the <rs>Prince</rs> was advancing to meet me. He received me very kindly, but with much dignity, and leading me at once through the library, carried me into his cabinet, another very large room, with books in different parts of it, tables covered with papers, pictures on the walls, and much massive furniture, the whole looking very rich and comfortable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>He seated me in an easy-chair on <num value="1">one</num> side of a small table, which still had some of the morning's work upon it, and placed himself in a smaller chair on the opposite side, evidently his accustomed seat and his wonted arrangement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>When we were both seated, he fastened his eyes upon me, and hardly took them off for an instant while I remained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>He asked me how I had left <persName n="Humboldt,,M.,,,de" id="n0231.0001.00003.00021" reg="expanded:Humboldt,Mad,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Humboldt</surname></persName>, said that <persName n="Humboldt,,M.,,,de" id="n0231.0001.00003.00022" reg="expanded:Humboldt,Mad,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Humboldt</surname></persName> spoke of me as an <hi rend="italics">old</hi> friend, but that he thought he had the advantage <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> of me there, as he had known <persName n="Humboldt,,M.,,,de" id="n0231.0001.00004.00023" reg="expanded:Humboldt,Mad,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Humboldt</surname></persName> for <num value="3">three</num>-and-<measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>, which by my looks could hardly be my case, etc., etc. He then inquired by what road I had come to <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName>, and on my telling him that it was by way of <placeName key="tgn,7006464" n="1.000 1" reg="praha,stredocesky,ceska republika,europe">Prague</placeName>, he did what everybody had told me he would do, took a subject and talked consecutively about it. The subject he chose was Bohemia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>He said no part of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> had gained more in the course of the last <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> than Bohemia; that good roads had been built all over the country, the comfort of the villages improved, trades and manufactures more than doubled, the condition of the peasantry ameliorated, and the great landlords, if not always made riches, yet living much more as becomes their position in society.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>He said he had a large estate in Bohemia himself, and showed me how he had found it for his personal interest to build a road, which cost him <num value="70000">seventy thousand</num> Spanish dollars, merely to open a market for his woods, the money he had expended being thus put out at an interest of <num value="0.08">eight per cent.</num></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/><address><street n="different Road 4">Four different roads</street></address>, he said, now come from <placeName key="tgn,7006464" n="1.000 1" reg="praha,stredocesky,ceska republika,europe">Prague</placeName> to <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName>, all good, whereas <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> ago there was but <num value="1">one</num> poor <num value="1">one</num>; while also the value of property in Bohemia, generally, is so much increased that the government is constantly obliged to refuse offers of individuals to build roads at their own expense, if the state will afterwards maintain them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>In this way he talked on, a little formally, but very sensibly and clearly, until I began to think the people waiting in the antechamber would wish me anywhere else, and seizing the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opportunity I rose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>He did not offer to detain me, but inviting me to come and see him at <placeName reg="Schonbrunn, Suhl, Thuringen" key="tgn,1037651">Schonbrunn</placeName>, any evening and every evening, while I should be in <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName>, he accompanied me through the library to the antechamber, and there took leave of me with much grace of manner.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/><persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Metternich</foreName></persName> is now just <measure n="63years" type="date">sixty-three years</measure> old, a little above the middle height, well preserved in all respects, and rather stout, but not corpulent, with a good and genuinely <name>German</name> face, light blue eyes that are not very expressive, and a fine <name>Roman</name> nose . . . . . His hair is nearly white, and his whole appearance, especially when he moves, is dignified and imposing; but his whole manner is winning.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>His conversation left no other impression upon me than that his mind must be full of matter-of-fact knowledge, well arranged and ready to be produced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Whatever he said was clear and pertinent, and well and concisely said.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>In the evening we went to hear music at <num value="2">two</num> widely different <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was the <name>Synagogue</name> of the <rs>German Jews</rs>, where service commences on <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>, on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> appearance of the evening star for the <name>Sabbath</name>, for it is <q direct="unspecified">the evening and the morning</q> that make their holy day. Their temple outside cannot be distinguished from any other building; within it had very crowded seats on the lower floor, filled with men who wore their hats; a rather neat gallery supported by Ionic pillars and closed by a gilded lattice for the women; and an enclosure something like a chancel for the priest and choir, who stood with their backs to the audience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>A table was before them, and above the table a large black velvet hanging covered with Hebrew inscriptions, towards which the faces of the priest and assembly were alike turned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The room was an oval, and, on the whole, of good architecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>All the congregation had Hebrew books in their hands; the priest, dressed in black robes and a black cap, sang in Hebrew, and had <num value="1">one</num> of the finest and richest voices I ever heard, which poured forth the <name>Hebrew</name> vowels in the grandest melody, to which the choir and congregation responded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>There was something very picturesque in the whole, though, of course, everything was unintelligible to us. After listening to it, therefore, a little while, we drove to a public garden in <num value="1">one</num> of the suburbs, where <persName n="Strauss,,,,," id="n0231.0001.00005.00024" reg="mostcommon:Strauss,J.,,,:1"><surname>Strauss</surname></persName>&mdash;whose waltzes are danced alike in <placeName key="tgn,7001523" n="1.000 1" reg="calcutta,west bengal,bharat,asia">Calcutta</placeName>, <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName>&mdash;plays <num value="2">two</num> evenings in the week, to the great delight of the multitudes who go to hear him and his perfectly drilled band.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>It was a beautifully warm, still, moonlight evening; and when we reached the garden, which was brilliantly lighted, we found about <num value="400">four hundred</num> people, chiefly seated at small tables under the trees, taking supper or some other refreshment, and listening to the music.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It was extremely pretty, and the whole had a fanciful, fairy-like look.</p>

He is, I find, a very important person here, filling the place that was formerly filled by the famous <rs>Gentz</rs>, and is, therefore, since the death of that distinguished person, a sort of right-hand man to <persName><foreName>Metternich</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>He is, however, a Prussian by birth, and was for some years <rs type="role2">Professor</rs> of History at <placeName reg="Berlin, Berlin, Deutschland" key="tgn,7003712">Berlin</placeName>; but he became a Catholic, and that rendered him a little uncomfortable at home and very valuable here, so he was brought, nothing loath, and established in <persName><foreName>Metternich</foreName></persName>'s Chancery with a great salary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>In a corner of the large outer saloon we found the <rs>Prince</rs>, talking, apparently on business, to somebody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>He rose to receive us, said a few words of graceful compliment, and then asked the <name>Bavarian</name> to take me into the inner saloon and present me to the <rs>Princess</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>She was sitting in an easy-chair, dressed simply in half-mourning, and at work diligently on what I believe the ladies call <q direct="unspecified">rug-work.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>She is rather pretty, <measure n="31years" type="date">thirty-one years</measure> old, and the <rs>Prince</rs>'s <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> wife; but she seemed sad, and obviously plied her needle for occupation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Her reception of me was not at all courtly, but very kind.

<p><persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Metternich</foreName></persName> was frequently called out on business, and frequently taken up into corners of the saloon in a mysterious way. The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time he came in after I arrived, he came to me and spoke to me with a rather formal courtesy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Afterwards he came again, and, inquiring of me what I had seen in <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName>, took for his subject the <orgName n="Polytechnic Institute" type="institute">Polytechnic Institute</orgName>, and talked extremely well about it for <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of an hour; said its <hi rend="italics">&eacute;leves</hi> were already at the head of the principal manufactories in the empire, that the manufactures were not only improving, but that there is an increasing demand for improved fabrics, so that the manufacturers are now constantly urging the reduction of the tariff, on the ground that they can better enter into competition with foreign nations than with smugglers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>He said the <name>Austrian</name> government maintained a tariff, not at all as a fiscal measure, but merely to protect and encourage manufactures; that the system had been introduced in the time of <persName><foreName>Joseph</foreName> <genName n="2">II</genName></persName>.; that if he had been minister at the time he should have advised against it, but that it is not to be denied that it has effected its purpose and made <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> a manufacturing country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>He added that the government has already abolished that part of the laws which excludes entirely any article whatever,&mdash;a fact which <persName n="Lerchenfeld,Baron,,,," id="n0231.0001.00007.00031" reg="mostcommon:Lerchenfeld,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Baron">Baron</roleName> <surname>Lerchenfeld</surname></persName> afterwards told me he was glad to hear, as it had not before been made known,&mdash;and that in general an anti-tariff policy is now pursued by <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>It was the only time in the evening when the <rs>Prince</rs> talked to any <num value="1">one</num> without having the air of talking on business; and the consequence was, that as soon as the conversation was fairly begun he had an audience to listen to him, and before it was over half the room was round us.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/><rs type="role" reg="Princess">The Princess</rs> made tea about <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time>. . . . . At <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> past <num value="12">twelve</num> I was at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>His purpose in using cedar is to keep out the worms and all other vermin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>I visited, too, Kaltenbaeck, the editor of the <name>Austrian</name> periodical for History and Statistics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>He was immersed in papers and books, and complained bitterly of the trouble given him by the merely mechanical restraints imposed by the censorship, which take up, it seems, a great deal of his time to no purpose, as he is careful never to print, or propose to print, anything that could offend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>I talked with him a good deal about it, and as the censorship of the press is more truly an effective part of the system of things in <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> than it ever was anywhere else, I have been curious to inquire into it and understand it a little.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Great complaints are made of delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Kaltenbaeck said to-day, it is often intolerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/><num value="1">One</num> day the last <rs>Emperor</rs> asked <persName n="Grillparzer,,,,," id="n0231.0001.00008.00042" reg="mostcommon:Grillparzer,Franz,,,:1"><surname>Grillparzer</surname></persName> why they had had nothing new from him for so long a time, and the poet had the good sense to tell him the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/><rs type="role" reg="Emperor">The Emperor</rs> replied, <q direct="unspecified">Well, send me the manuscript, and I will read it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>He did so, and the piece was ordered to be represented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>But he seldom thus interfered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>I remember in <placeName reg="Dresden, Dresden, Sachsen" key="tgn,7004455">Dresden</placeName>, <persName n="Forbes,,,,," id="n0231.0001.00008.00043" reg="mostcommon:Forbes,Francis,,,:3"><surname>Forbes</surname></persName>, who was Charge in <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName> for some time, and who is perfectly good authority for a story of the sort, told me that the <rs>Emperor</rs> went <num value="1">one</num> night to see a new piece which pleased him very much, and when it was over, said, <q direct="unspecified">Well, now I am glad I have heard it, for I am sure <persName><foreName>Metternich</foreName></persName> will stop it, there is so much liberalism in it</q>; which accordingly happened.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Von Hammer told me that a good many years ago he wrote, during some travels there, a volume of poems about <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 5" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, which he was aware contained passages somewhat too free for the meridian of <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName>, but which yet passed the censorship and was printed anonymously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/><pb id="p.9" n="9"/> It came out, however, while he was absent from <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName>, and the bookseller was so indiscreet as to announce it, in some way publicly, as the work of <persName n="Hammer,Mister,,,,Von" id="n0231.0001.00009.00044" reg="nearbymention:Hammer,M.,,,Von"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <nameLink>Von</nameLink> <surname>Hammer</surname></persName>, in consequence of which he hastened back to <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName>, avowed himself as the writer, but, to prevent being ruined by it, went directly to the censors, and had a <hi rend="italics">damnatur</hi> put upon the book, which excluded it entirely from circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>He gave me a copy of it, but I have not had time to look for the obnoxious passages.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/><persName n="Auersperg,Comte,,,," id="n0231.0001.00009.00045" reg="mostcommon:Auersperg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Comte">Count</roleName> <surname>Auersperg</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the best of their poets, who seems to be about <measure n="35years" type="date">thirty-five years</measure> old, published, about <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> ago, a volume called <hi rend="italics">Spaziergange eines Wiener Poeten</hi>,&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">Promenades of a Vienna Poet,</q>&mdash;which contained some liberalisms, but was printed, and much admired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Von Hammer told me that, though unacquainted with the poet, he at that time immediately commended him to <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Metternich</foreName></persName> as a person to be noticed, that is, as a person to receive some place, and so be secured to the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/><rs type="role" reg="Prince">The Prince</rs>, however, who has very little respect for anything poetical, took no heed of Von Hammer's recommendation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Meantime, <persName n="Auersperg,Comte,,,," id="n0231.0001.00009.00046" reg="mostcommon:Auersperg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Comte">Count</roleName> <surname>Auersperg</surname></persName> went on, printing books that could not be published in <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>, and among the rest sundry attacks on <persName><foreName>Metternich</foreName></persName> himself, all under the name he originally assumed of Anastasius Grun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>On being asked whether he were the author of some of them, he denied it,&mdash;a proceeding which Von Hammer thinks altogether mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Quite lately he has printed a poem called <hi rend="italics">Schutt</hi>,&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">Rubbish,</q>&mdash;which is more liberal than ever, expressing the opinions of a captain of an American frigate, anchored just before the <hi rend="italics">schutt</hi>, or scoria, of <placeName reg="Pompeii, Napoli, Campania" key="tgn,7004658">Pompeii</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>This poem he has dedicated to Von Hammer, who has been for some years his acquaintance and friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>A short time since Von Hammer received a letter from <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Metternich</foreName></persName>, asking who Anastasius Grun was, who had dedicated the poem of <hi rend="italics">Schutt</hi> to him,&mdash;a question which the <name>Premier</name> could have answered as well as Von Hammer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Von Hammer immediately replied, that <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> ago he had had the honor of commending Anastasius Grun to the <rs>Minister</rs> as a person worthy the notice of the government; that somewhat later he had published a sonnet in honor of Anastasius Grun; that after both these circumstances had occurred, he had become personally acquainted with him; and that the recent poem had been dedicated to him without his knowledge, probably as a return for the complimentary sonnet.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>To this letter, which did not mention Anastasius Grun's true name, Von Hammer has received no answer, and will probably receive none; <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> the object of the whole being to control and alarm <persName n="Auersperg,Comte,,,," id="n0231.0001.00010.00047" reg="mostcommon:Auersperg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Comte">Count</roleName> <surname>Auersperg</surname></persName>, as Von Hammer thinks, who told me the entire story.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>What <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Metternich</foreName></persName>&mdash;who is a wise statesman&mdash;can hope to do with such means, it is not easy to tell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>It is a pretty comparison, but that, I fear, is all; though perhaps I ought to add, that I believe welledu-cated persons can get such books as they want in <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>, almost, perhaps quite, as easily as elsewhere in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 6" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>, and that men of learning and of studious habits receive a <hi rend="italics">carte blanche</hi> from the censors to have even the books that have received the sentence of <hi rend="italics">damnatur</hi>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>This is very bad for a country like <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/><placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName>, too, acts badly upon <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>; and, indeed, <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> have always <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> acted badly upon each other, exciting each other to violent corresponding changes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>The influence of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName> on <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> since <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct> has been very bad. The affair of <dateStruct value="1830-07-"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct>, is called a revolution: it was no such thing; it was a lucky rebellion, which changed those at the head of the government, nothing else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>But when <persName n="Philippe,,Louis,,," id="n0231.0001.00016.00077" reg="default:Philippe,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Philippe</surname></persName> said, at the famous arrangement of the <rs type="place">Hotel</rs> de Ville, <quote>La Charte deviendra une verite,</quote> he uttered a falsehood,&mdash;<hi rend="italics">il dit un mensonge;</hi> there existed no Charter at the moment when he spoke, for that of <dateStruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></dateStruct> was destroyed, and what might become the <rs>Charter</rs> afterwards he knew as little as anybody in such a moment of uncertainty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>The elements of things in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName> are very bad; there is a great deal of <hi rend="italics">soi-disant</hi> republicanism, which some of them think they have taken from your country, but which is nothing like yours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>And there is a good deal of our <name>German</name> idealism and theorizing which is entirely at war with the <rs>French</rs> character, which is very practical and very selfish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>And there is a great deal of talk about a constitutional government like the <rs>English</rs>, which they can comprehend as little as they can our <name>German</name> theories or your practical democracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>Altogether it is a bad <hi rend="italics">melange</hi>. I think I see it as it is. <hi rend="italics">J'ai beaucoup de calme, je ne mets de passion &agrave; rien.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>J'aime la verite, et je la cherche.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>Je hais le mensonge</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>I do not like my business,&mdash;<hi rend="italics">Je n'aime pas mon metier</hi>. If I liked it, I should not be able to preserve the quietness of spirit&mdash; <hi rend="italics">le calme</hi>&mdash;necessary to it. Besides this, the present state of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> disgusts me; I am tired of it. When I was <num value="5">five</num>-and-<measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> old, I foresaw nothing but change and trouble in my time; and I sometimes thought then that I would leave <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> and go to <placeName reg="America, McCurtain, Oklahoma" key="tgn,2131961">America</placeName>, or somewhere else, out of the reach of it. But my place was here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>I belonged, as it were, to an entail,&mdash;<hi rend="italics">&agrave; un majorat</hi>,&mdash;and I could not remove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>Even my private fortune was fastened to the soil, and would not have been permitted to follow me. And so I have gone on, and have been here at the head of affairs since <dateStruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>I did not make the peace of <dateStruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></dateStruct>, for I did not choose to make it. When a minister begins, under such circumstances as I began under then, he must have a clear ground,&mdash;<hi rend="italics">un terrain net</hi>,&mdash;or he will not be able to move at all. But since I have been here I have always been the same,&mdash;<hi rend="italics">j'ai &eacute;te toujours le mene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>Je n'ai trompe personne, et c'est par cette raison que je n'ai pas un ennemi personnel au monde</hi>. I have had many colleagues, I have been obliged to remove many of them,--<hi rend="italics">j'ai &eacute;te oblige d'en frapper beaucoup</hi>,&mdash;but I never deceived them, and not <num value="1">one</num> of them is now my personal enemy, <hi rend="italics">pas un</hi> <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> <hi rend="italics">seul</hi>. I have been consulted at different times by many heads of parties in other countries, who wanted to make great changes or revolutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>I have always talked with them, as I now talk with you, directly, frankly, truly,&mdash;<hi rend="italics">directement, franchement, avec verite;</hi> very often afterwards I have crushed them,&mdash;<hi rend="italics">je les ai &eacute;crases,&mdash;</hi> but I have never deceived them, and they are not now my personal enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>I am less exposed, too, to make personal enemies than most persons in my situation would be, for another reason: I labor chiefly, almost entirely, to <hi rend="italics">prevent</hi> troubles, to <hi rend="italics">prevent</hi> evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>In a democracy you cannot do this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>There you must begin by the evil, and endure it, till it has been felt and acknowledged, and then, perhaps, you can apply the remedy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>This is another reason why democracies do not suit me,&mdash;<hi rend="italics">ne me conviennent pas</hi>. I care nothing about the past, except as a warning for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>The present day has no value for me, except as the eve of to-morrow,&mdash;<hi rend="italics">Le jour qui court n'a aucune valeur pour moi, excepte comme la veille du lendemain</hi>. I labor for to-morrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>I do not venture even to think much of the day following, but to-morrow, it is with <hi rend="italics">to-morrow</hi> that my spirit wrestles,&mdash;<hi rend="italics">mon esprit lutte</hi>,&mdash;and I am but too happy if I can do something to prevent the evil it may threaten, or add something to the good of which it is capable,</p></quote> etc., etc.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/><hi rend="italics">C'est toujours avec le lendemain que mon esprit lutte</hi>, is a fine phrase, and he pronounced it with great force, perhaps with emotion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>He spoke with great earnestness, especially in the latter part of the conversation; was eloquent in many parts of it, gesticulated frequently, and occasionally struck forcibly the little table between us; but he was always dignified, winning, and easy in his whole air and manner.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>The conversation lasted above an hour and an half, and I am accurate in what I have given of it; but I have given only the thread of it, and its more striking parts, omitting almost all of what I interposed, and all I do not distinctly remember.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Soon after <num value="4">four</num> a servant came in and announced dinner; but the <rs>Prince</rs> did not notice him at all. About <time value="4:30">half past 4</time> another came, an old man with powdered hair and in full dress, to whom the <rs>Prince</rs> merely said, <q direct="unspecified">Very well,</q> and went on as earnestly as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>Soon after <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> entered, and said, <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role" reg="Princess">The Princess</rs> orders me to let your Highness know it wants only <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> to <num value="5">five</num>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/><q direct="unspecified">Well,</q> said he to me, laughing, <q direct="unspecified">since my wife sends for us, we must go</q>; though still he talked a little longer, and during the whole time, from beginning to end, did not seem to take his eyes off my countenance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/><pb id="p.18" n="18"/></p> 
<p>At last he rose, and, showing me to the door by which I had entered, said, <q direct="unspecified">If you will go to my wife in the saloon I will join you in a moment.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>I passed through the rich and beautiful library, containing, I understand, <num value="20">twenty</num> or <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> volumes, but of which, by the by, not a syllable had been said in the conversation, though I had been invited expressly to come and visit it. I passed, too, through the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> vast antechamber, which was empty, and through the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, where the dinner-table was waiting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>After this began a suite of very richly furnished rooms, through which I advanced until their number had become so considerable that I began to think I had made some mistake; but a servant, seeing me hesitate, came to me and showed me through <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> more, until I came to the saloon where the <rs>Princess</rs> was sitting, with <num value="3">three</num> old ladies and <num value="2">two</num> gentlemen, <num value="1">one</num> of whom I had seen before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>It was a splendid room, most magnificently furnished, and so large that <num value="5">five</num> <hi rend="italics">ormoulu</hi> chandeliers of great size and beauty were suspended from its ceiling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>I have seen few saloons in palaces so rich, and still fewer in such good taste.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>As soon as I entered it, <q direct="unspecified">Well,</q> said the <rs>Princess</rs>, <q direct="unspecified">I hope you have had an agreeable conference with my husband, for it has been a long <num value="1">one</num>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/><q direct="unspecified">So long,</q> said <num value="1">one</num> of the old ladies,&mdash;who was also a princess, but I know not from where,&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">so long that it has made me very hungry.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>They all laughed heartily, and we had some lively talk for a few moments, till the <name>Premier</name> came in, and, apologizing slightly for his tardiness, took the hungry old <rs type="role2">Princess</rs> and led the way to dinner.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/><persName><roleName n="Princess">The Princess</roleName> <foreName>Metternich</foreName></persName> took my arm, and after a journey through the suite of apartments where I had nearly lost myself just before, we reached the dinner-table, which was round and had <num value="8">eight</num> covers, and the same number of attendants, only <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of whom were in livery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The dinner was as delicious, I suppose, as the science of cookery could make it, and extended through from <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="14">fourteen</num> courses, with many kinds of wines, and among the rest <rs>Tokay</rs>; but nothing could be easier or more <hi rend="italics">degage</hi> than the tone at table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the conversation was mere commonplace gossip.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>We had good Johannisberg, of course, and the <rs>Princess</rs> made some jokes about <hi rend="italics">her</hi> selling it to the <rs>Americans</rs>, to which the <rs>Prince</rs> added, that <hi rend="italics">he</hi> had an agent in New York for the purpose, and that we could buy there as good wine as he gives to his friends in <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>In the midst of this, a secretary came in and delivered a despatch, that moment received, he said, by express from <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>The news of <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> the attempt to assassinate <persName n="Philippe,,Louis,,," id="n0231.0001.00019.00078" reg="default:Philippe,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Philippe</surname></persName>, as he was going to Neuilly, had been received by telegraph a couple of days before, but as nothing had come since, everybody was curious to know the details.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/><rs type="role" reg="Prince">The Prince</rs> opened his packet at once, but found little news in it, as it was sent off immediately after the event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>It contained, however, the name of the assassin, <persName n="Alibaud,,,,," id="n0231.0001.00019.00079" reg="mostcommon:Alibaud,nomatch:0"><surname>Alibaud</surname></persName>, and the fact that he was a native of <placeName key="tgn,7008371" n="1.000 1" reg="nimes,gard,languedoc-roussillon,france,europe">Nismes</placeName>, and <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure> old; this being all M. d'appony had been able to cater in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> moments of the arrest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>But there was a newspaper in the parcel, which the <rs>Prince</rs> sent immediately round to the <rs>Princess</rs>, and desired her to read aloud from it what was marked in pencil with red.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>She turned to it and read the acquittal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>The Premier made no remark about it, nor did anybody else, though I knew he was very anxious to have another result; but he turned to me, and asked if our laws in <placeName reg="America, McCurtain, Oklahoma" key="tgn,2131961">America</placeName> on such matters resembled the <rs>English</rs> laws, and continued the conversation on this subject till the dinner was over.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>His dislike of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Melbourne</foreName></persName>'s administration is very great and notorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>If <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Melbourne</foreName></persName> had been convicted he must have gone out, and perhaps the <name>Ministry</name> would have been entirely dissolved,&mdash;an event which would have diminished, I am sure, the <rs>Prince</rs>'s disgust at the present state of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>But when the <rs>Princess</rs> announced the acquittal, he received it as a thing perfectly indifferent.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>We drove directly through the <num value="2">two</num> spacious courts, round which their monastery is built, and, passing under a noble archway, stopped at the bottom of a flight of marble stairs, which would have done honor to a palace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>A servant appeared instantly and showed us to a suite of very large, richly furnished rooms, where the old <q direct="unspecified">guest-master</q> appeared immediately afterwards,&mdash;a venerable, gentle old man of <num value="76">seventy-six</num>,&mdash;and begged us to make ourselves entirely comfortable, and to command whatever we wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>There were <num value="30">thirty</num> fine rooms, with a chapel, where he says his private masses daily, a concert-room, etc., all richly furnished, and in the nicest order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Then we went through the guest-chambers, or a part of them, for there were no less than <num value="60">sixty</num> in all; many of them, like those we occupied, opening into a beautiful cloister, paved with marble, and <measure n="900feet" type="distance">nine hundred feet</measure> long, and all of them comfortably furnished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>We went to the library, a grand room almost entirely of marble, about <measure n="60feet" type="distance">sixty feet</measure> high, with <num value="20000">20,000</num> volumes, where the librarian was ready to receive us most civilly; and to the church, a fine piece of architecture entirely of marble, and capable of holding <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6000">six thousand</num> persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>The order is Benedictine, and there was no ceremony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>As we approached the table, all stopped to ask silently a blessing, each for himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>We then sat down to a simple, good dinner of <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> courses, with a bottle of wine for each person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>After it was over and we rose, all paused an instant to return thanks, the monks crossed themselves, and we bowed and courtesied all round.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>The monks were pleasant at dinner, and intelligent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Keiblinger, the librarian, a young man of <num value="35">thirty-five</num>, and professor in the <rs>Theological Institution</rs> connected with the monastery, seemed to have a good deal of acuteness and learning; but in general they did not appear to me like scholars.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>There are <num value="84">eighty-four</num> of them in all. <num value="40">Forty</num> priests dine in a hall by themselves: the <num value="12">twelve</num> who hold office dine where we were today; the rest are employed as priests, in parishes connected with the monastery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>They have a gymnasium, where a considerable number of young men are instructed without pay, and <num value="48">forty-eight</num> are supported entirely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>About <num value="300">three hundred</num> persons sleep and are nourished under their roof, and in the autumn their <num value="60">sixty</num> guest-chambers are often filled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>The whole establishment, therefore, belongs to that magnificent class of which few now remain in any country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>After dinner I went again to the library, and saw many rich and curious manuscripts, and books of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> age of printing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>There was no want, either, of modern works nor of Protestant books; and yet the library was not like the library of a living, active, efficient institution, but seemed, like the monastery itself, to belong to another state of society.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>We went, too, to see their pictures, which were little worth the trouble, and their collections in natural history, which were small; but their garden is fine, and, like the front of the monastery, commands grand views up and down the <rs>Danube</rs>, which spreads out beneath in all its beauty and power, and over to the other shore, where are the picturesque ruins of the old castle of Waideneck, churches, villages, and monasteries, scattered frequent through a fertile land, the castles of Lubereck and Schonbichl still proudly preserved, and a range of solemn mountains swelling up to the horizon and bounding the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>But the monks of old always chose well the sites for their <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> monasteries, and the preservation of an establishment of this sort in all its stateliness and wealth shows how little their power is broken down as yet in <q direct="unspecified">old <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>,</q> as <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Metternich</foreName></persName> calls it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>They have documents that go back to <num value="819">819</num>, and claim to have been founded in <num value="455">455</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>It is to this period, when the influence of the monks was so valuable and beneficent, when they protected the poor peasantry from the lords of the numberless castles and robber's-nests,&mdash;whose picturesque ruins we find everywhere,&mdash;and when they introduced agriculture and the arts of civilized life, that they trace their great possessions and the main elements of the influence they have ever since exercised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>I speak exclusively of <placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084"><rs type="direction">South</rs> Germany</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>It is less than an hour's drive to the westward of Enns, and the beautiful cultivation through which we passed spoke well both of the influence and the example of the monks as agriculturists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>We saw, too, an imposing castle with <num value="4">four</num> massive towers, which we afterwards learnt had been built by the nephew of <persName n="Tilly,,,,," id="n0231.0002.00024.00093" reg="mostcommon:Tilly,nomatch:0"><surname>Tilly</surname></persName>, the great general of the <measure n="30Years" type="date">Thirty Years</measure> War; but which, since <dateStruct value="1763--"><year reg="1763">1763</year></dateStruct>, has been owned by the monks, who obtained it by purchase.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>The monastery itself is larger even than the <num value="1">one</num> at <placeName key="tgn,7003193" n="1.000 10" reg="Melk,Niederosterreich,Osterreich,Europe">Molk</placeName>, and more regularly built by the same architect, having been finished in <dateStruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>It stands on a hillside with a village below it, and commands a view of <num value="1">one</num> of the most fertile and beautiful valleys I ever beheld, closed up by mountains beyond; itself a most grand and imposing pile of architecture in the <rs>Italian</rs> style of the <num value="18" type="ordinal">eighteenth</num> century, which makes the neighboring castle look like a structure of very moderate size.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>We were received, as we were at <placeName key="tgn,7003193" n="1.000 10" reg="Melk,Niederosterreich,Osterreich,Europe">Molk</placeName>, at the bottom of the grand marble staircase,&mdash;to the foot of which we drove under a massive portal,&mdash;by a servant who showed us at once to a suite of <num value="4">four</num> rooms, which we were desired to regard as our own, and to order such refreshments as we might need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The Prelate, <persName n="Arneth,,,,," id="n0231.0002.00024.00094" reg="mostcommon:Arneth,nomatch:0"><surname>Arneth</surname></persName>, to whom we had letters, was absent, . . . . but would be back in the evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/><pb id="p.25" n="25"/> Meanwhile, the next in office, the <name>Abbot</name>,&mdash;a round easy person, nearly <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure> old, who seemed to think everything in his monastery admirable and wonderful,&mdash;with another monk about <num value="40">forty</num>,&mdash;who seemed to be the wit of the brotherhood, and to be willing to make us merry even with the <name>Abbot</name> and his excessive fancy for all that belonged to them,&mdash;made their appearance and offered to do the honors of the establishment to us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>We went <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to their collection of pictures, which filled <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> rooms, but where only a few had any merit at all, and then to a collection of engravings hung round the walls of several more rooms, which were very good, and among which I noticed an engraving of the <rs n="Battle of Bunker Hill" type="battle">battle of Bunker Hill</rs>, where, to the great astonishment of the monks, I pointed out the commander on our side dressed like a farmer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>But the distances are so great in these enormous convents, and the walks through their unending cloisters, over polished marble, so hard, that we were glad to retire to our rooms and rest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Supper, I found, had been ordered for us in the <rs>Prelate</rs>'s apartments, . . . . but I begged the <name>Abbot</name> to let <persName n="Sparmann,Mister,,,," id="n0231.0002.00025.00095" reg="mostcommon:Sparmann,Herr,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sparmann</surname></persName> and myself join them <hi rend="italics">in convent</hi>, to which he readily agreed, the witty brother adding that it would be merrier there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>So in a few moments we went to supper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>I thought we should never get there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>We passed from <num value="1">one</num> grand arched cloister to another, until, notwithstanding interruptions from talking with the monks, I counted above <num value="1100">eleven hundred</num> steps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>I suppose, in fact, we went half a mile, at least.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>At last we found a lofty marble hall, at the upper end of which was a <rs n="billiard table" type="product">billiard-table</rs>, where <persName n="Sparmann,Mister,,,," id="n0231.0002.00025.00096" reg="mostcommon:Sparmann,Herr,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sparmann</surname></persName> was playing with <num value="1">one</num> of the monks, while down the middle was the supper-table.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/><num value="18">Eighteen</num> monks were soon gathered round it, the whole number that inhabits this wide pile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>There are <num value="89">eighty-nine</num> in all, but many serve in parishes, and the rest are employed as teachers in a large gymnasium, which is supported by the monastery, in Linz.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/><num value="2">Two</num> of the monks I saw to-night are interesting men,&mdash;Stiltz, the librarian, a young man who seems full of zeal for knowledge; and <persName n="Kurtz,,,,," id="n0231.0002.00025.00097" reg="mostcommon:Kurtz,nomatch:0"><surname>Kurtz</surname></persName>, an old, very modest man, whose works on the history of <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>, amounting to <num value="16">sixteen</num> or <num value="18">eighteen</num> octavos, are valued throughout <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 6" reg="germany">Germany</placeName> as the best on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>I talked a good deal with him, . . . . walked with him in the garden, and went with him to his room, which was large, every way comfortable, rather nicely furnished, and hung round with good engravings . . . . . They have about an <num value="100">hundred</num> rooms for guests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/><pb id="p.26" n="26"/></p> 
<p><hi rend="italics"><dateStruct value="-07-5"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="5">5</day></dateStruct></hi>.&mdash;We breakfasted in our own rooms. . . . . As the monks are priests, who must say their masses every morning, . . . . they all breakfast separately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>When it was over with us, <persName n="Kurtz,,,,," id="n0231.0002.00026.00098" reg="mostcommon:Kurtz,nomatch:0"><surname>Kurtz</surname></persName>, Stiltz, and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> other monks came and showed us the library.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>It consists of about <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> volumes, and is very respectable from its composition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>In literary history it is quite remarkable, and there is an admirable room full of <hi rend="italics">incunabula</hi>. I saw, too, a great deal, both of elegant literature and of Protestant learning, which could hardly be expected in a convent; and there was a tone in the conversation of the monks much freer than would seem to be appropriate to their condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>The political atmosphere, both here and at <placeName key="tgn,7003193" n="1.000 10" reg="Melk,Niederosterreich,Osterreich,Europe">Molk</placeName>, was quite liberal, at least round some of the monks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>We saw their collections in natural history, mineralogy, etc., which were of moderate value, but <num value="2">two</num> parts of the establishment surprised me very much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/><num value="1">One</num> was a suite of rooms, about <num value="20">twenty</num> or <num value="25">twenty-five</num> in number, called the <name>Kaiser</name>-<persName n="Zimmer,,,,," id="n0231.0002.00026.00099" reg="mostcommon:Zimmer,nomatch:0"><surname>Zimmer</surname></persName>,&mdash;Imperial Rooms,&mdash;which were prepared for the <rs>Emperor</rs>, <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName> <genName n="6">VI</genName></persName>., who sent the monks word, when their convent was building, a century ago, that he would come and see them every year, and hunt in their woods, if they would fit up apartments worthy of him. They did so, of course; for, as <num value="1">one</num> of the monks said, such imperial hints were like <q direct="unspecified">requests in full armor,</q> and the <rs>Emperor</rs> and <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Eugene</foreName></persName> used to come, and live upon the monks several weeks every autumn, which they found a very burdensome honor for their revenues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>The rooms are now, of course, neglected, but they are still princely and grand; and the convent might, in all respects, easily be put in order to receive an emperor and his court, as in a vast palace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>The other part of the monastery that surprised me was the church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Its size, its marbles, its rich but not overburdened ornaments, and its free, unincumbered architecture, reminded me of the magnificent churches at <placeName key="tgn,7018159" n="1.000 1" reg="venezia,venezia,veneto,italia,europe">Venice</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>It will hold <num value="8000">eight thousand</num> people, and the whole country round so throng here, at the feast of St. Florian and several other great festivals, that it is filled.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>As we came back from the church I met a messenger from the <name>Prelate</name>, who sent his compliments, to say he would make me a visit, if I were disengaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>It seemed more suitable for me to go to him, and I went at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>I found him living in a suite of <num value="20">twenty</num> or <num value="30">thirty</num> rooms . . . . There was some state about him, a doorkeeper and <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> monks in attendance, the rooms very noble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>He himself seemed about <num value="50">fifty</num>, with the air and manners of the world, and agreeable and rather courtly conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>He regretted that he was <pb id="p.27" n="27"/> not at home last evening to receive us, hoped we had been comfortable, and so on; and it was plain he did not wish to be thought a mere monk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>When I left him, the carriage was already announced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>We went down the magnificent marble staircase; . . . . the venerable <rs>Kurtz</rs>, Stiltz, and <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> other monks followed us to the bottom; we found several more waiting, who had brought flowers for <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> T. and the children; and we drove away with their hearty good wishes following us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Our journey during the forenoon was only <num value="12">twelve</num> or <measure n="14miles" type="distance">fourteen miles</measure>, to Steyer, through most agreeable by-roads and a country not only much broken and diversified, but with extensive prospects, closed up by the <rs type="place">Styrian Mountains</rs>. . . . . We remained there only long enough to dine, and then, through an uncommonly rich, well-cultivated country, we came to Kremsmunster, another grand Benedictine monastery, larger even than either of the others we had seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>We found it standing on a hillside, with its little village, as usual, gathered under its protection, the pretty, rapid stream of the <name>Krems</name> brawling below, and a wide, rich valley running up beyond, until it is grandly closed up by snow-clad mountains, grouped together in very picturesque forms.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>We drove through a part of the irregular buildings that compose the wide extent of the monastery, and crossing <num value="2">two</num> large courts,&mdash; where we found on all sides proofs that it was a gymnasium as well as a convent,&mdash;were brought to the part inhabited by the <name>Prelate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>We were carried at once to his apartments, and found him an old man, nearly <num value="70">seventy</num>, or quite <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure> old, broken with age, and talking so imperfectly, from want of teeth, that he could not be readily understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>He received us very kindly, and the proper officer having made his appearance, we were asked how many rooms we needed, and were immediately shown to a suite of <num value="5">five</num> excellent ones, large enough to make a dozen such as are used and built nowadays.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>After we had refreshed ourselves, we were invited to see the establishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>It dates from <num value="770">770</num>, but the buildings have been erected at different times, chiefly between <dateStruct value="1300--"><year reg="1300">1300</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1690--"><year reg="1690">1690</year></dateStruct>, and are spread very irregularly over a wide space of ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>The number of monks is <num value="84">eighty-four</num>, <num value="40">forty</num> of whom reside in the house, and the rest are priests in parishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>He has a sensitive, retiring spirit, and what he has achieved amidst almost unbroken applause is said to be no compensation to himself for the occasional murmurs of critical censure that reach even those who least need or deserve them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>In conversation he showed some of this character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>He seemed, so to speak, to be strong through his fears; and talked with the most energy where he felt the most misgiving.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>Thus, for instance, he was positively eloquent when he urged his fears that the attempts to introduce liberal institutions into <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> would end in fastening the chains of a heavier despotism on the people, and that the irreligious tendencies of the age would but arm the priesthood with new and more dangerous power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>In the question of slavery in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> he was much interested, and said he wished the northern portion of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> were separated from the southern, that <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> and the other free States might be entirely relieved from this odious taint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>He talked well, too, upon other subjects, especially literary subjects; but he is more thoroughly interested, I should think, in what relates to religion and government than anything else, though his fears and anxieties will probably <pb id="p.45" n="45"/> prevent him from ever fully publishing all he thinks and feels on either of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>But he is a man of wisely liberal views in politics, I should think, and a sincere Catholic in his faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>His temperament leads him to live much and quietly in the country, where he occupies himself with agriculture and botany, with poetry and literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>He is rich already, and on the death of his aged uncle, the present <persName><roleName n="marquis">Marquis</roleName> <foreName>Beccaria</foreName></persName>, he will be master of a large fortune; though I think this will hardly much affect his habits or his modes of life, which will always be determined by his original character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>He is of middling size, and his hair is quite gray, so that he looks older than he is; he stutters a very little, and he takes snuff freely.

I went, however, to see my friend <persName n="Bellocq,,,,," id="n0231.0003.00048.00223" reg="mostcommon:Bellocq,L.,,,:1"><surname>Bellocq</surname></persName>, whom I knew in <placeName key="tgn,7010413" n="1.000 2" reg="madrid,madrid,madrid,espana,europe">Madrid</placeName> as <rs type="role" reg="Secretary">Secretary</rs> of the <rs>French Embassy</rs> there, and who is here Charge d'affaires from <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName>, a bachelor, grown old, and somewhat <hi rend="italics">delabre</hi>, but apparently with as much <hi rend="italics">bonhomie</hi> as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>I drove, too, to <placeName reg="Greenough's house">Greenough's house</placeName>, but found he had gone to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>;<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/> 
<p><persName n="Greenough,,Horatio,,," id="n0231.0003.00048.00224" reg="default:Greenough,Horatio,,,"><foreName>Horatio</foreName> <surname>Greenough</surname></persName>, the <rs>American</rs> sculptor.</p></note> . . . . but I did little else except make inquiries about the cholera at <placeName key="tgn,7004474" n="1.000 3" reg="napoli,napoli,campania,italia,europe">Naples</placeName>, which threatens to interfere with our plans.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>In the evening I went to a regular <placeName reg="Italian">Italian</placeName> <hi rend="italics">conversazione</hi>, which occurs twice a week at the house of the <rs>Marchioness Lenzoni</rs>, the last descendant of <num value="1">one</num> branch of the <name>Medici</name> family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>Her house is beautifully fitted up with works of art, and is in all respects redolent of the genius of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 5" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, and. . . . she receives more intellectual society than anybody in <placeName reg="Florence, Florence, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013766">Florence</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>She is, I suppose, about <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> old, and, like all well-bred <persName n="Italian,,,,," id="n0231.0003.00048.00225" reg="mostcommon:Italian,nomatch:0"><surname>Italian</surname></persName> women of her class, entirely without affectation or pretension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>I found there <persName n="Micali,,,,," id="n0231.0003.00048.00226" reg="mostcommon:Micali,Giuseppe,,,:1"><surname>Micali</surname></persName>, the author of <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Italia, Nassau, Florida" key="tgn,2415657">Italia</placeName> avanti il Dominio dei Romani,</q>&mdash;an old man, but very full of life and spirit; Forti, who is distinguishing himself as a political economist; a professor of mathematics, and <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> other agreeable people. . . . I was particularly glad to make the acquaintance of <persName n="Micali,,,,," id="n0231.0003.00048.00227" reg="mostcommon:Micali,Giuseppe,,,:1"><surname>Micali</surname></persName>, whose book, which I have valued these <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>, has, I find, passed through <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> editions, notwithstanding its severe and learned character.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/><hi rend="italics"><dateStruct value="-11-7"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="7">7</day></dateStruct></hi>.&mdash;This morning I went to the gallery . . . . . The Tribune I found&mdash;as far as I can recollect&mdash;just as I left it <num value="18">eighteen</num> <pb id="p.49" n="49"/> years ago, and I cannot express how much pleasure it gave me. . . . . It is, indeed, a sort of holy place in the arts, and even the least interested visitors speak under their breath, and tread lightly, as they glide about from the monument of <num value="1">one</num> great man's genius to that of another, consecrated already by the testimony of ages.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/><hi rend="italics"><dateStruct value="-11-9"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="9">9</day></dateStruct></hi>.&mdash;I made a visit to <persName n="Niccolini,,,,," id="n0231.0003.00049.00228" reg="mostcommon:Niccolini,Giov,,,:1"><surname>Niccolini</surname></persName>, the tragic writer and general scholar, who now, I suppose, ranks the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of his class in <placeName reg="Florence, Florence, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013766">Florence</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>He is about <measure n="55years" type="date">fifty-five years</measure> old, with a fine head, but little beauty or dignity of person, and with manners always awkward and sometimes, as I hear, a little savage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>I found him disposed to be agreeable, partly, perhaps, because I came from a republic, and he is a republican, or high liberal. . . . . He is engaged now in writing a history of the <name>Suabian</name> power in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 5" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>; but I should think his want of all knowledge of German would be a grave impediment to his success, and that he must rely chiefly on the good proportions and finish of his book as a work of art. He is, however, much in earnest about it, and as he gives up the theatre because, as he says, he believes the opera is to prevail over it more and more, I suppose he will make it all he can.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/><hi rend="italics"><dateStruct value="-11-10"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="10">10</day></dateStruct></hi>.&mdash;. . . . In the evening I had a long visit from <persName n="Niccolini,,,,," id="n0231.0003.00049.00229" reg="mostcommon:Niccolini,Giov,,,:1"><surname>Niccolini</surname></persName>, who, I suppose, fancies himself to have inherited the genuine spirit of the old Florentine Republic, and who is, perhaps, as much of a republican as an Italian of the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century knows how to be. His <q direct="unspecified">John of Procida,</q> the tragedy on the <rs>Sicilian Vespers</rs>, shows this plainly enough, and when I alluded to it this evening he told me a curious story about it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>The French Minister here, he said, was so much annoyed by the bitterness with which the <rs>French</rs> are treated in it, that he complained to the <rs type="role" reg="Grand Duke">Grand Duke</rs>, and had its representation stopped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>The severe allusions to <name>French</name> tyranny were, however, no doubt all intended by <persName n="Niccolini,,,,," id="n0231.0003.00049.00230" reg="mostcommon:Niccolini,Giov,,,:1"><surname>Niccolini</surname></persName> for the <name>Austrians</name>; and <persName n="Bombelles,Comte,,,," id="n0231.0003.00049.00231" reg="mostcommon:Bombelles,Henri,,,:1"><roleName n="Comte">Count</roleName> <surname>Bombelles</surname></persName>&mdash;the same I knew at <placeName key="tgn,7007557;tgn,2068056" n="0.103 000000.6200	placename;tgn,7007557;bern,bern,schweiz,europe,Bern,Schweiz,Europe;0.025 000000.1488	placename;tgn,2068056;berne, albany, new york,Albany,New York,United States,North and Central America" reg="bern,bern,schweiz,europe,Bern,Schweiz,Europe;berne, albany, new york,Albany,New York,United States,North and Central America">Berne</placeName>&mdash;was so well aware of this, that, with his characteristic good-humor and plainness, he told his <name>French</name> colleague, <q direct="unspecified">I wonder you took so much trouble about <persName n="Niccolini,,,,," id="n0231.0003.00049.00232" reg="mostcommon:Niccolini,Giov,,,:1"><surname>Niccolini</surname></persName>'s tragedy; the letter, to be sure, was <hi rend="italics">addressed</hi> to you, but the contents of it were all meant for me.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/></p> 
<p><hi rend="italics"><dateStruct value="-11-14"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="14">14</day></dateStruct></hi>.&mdash;I brought a letter from <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName></persName>, of <placeName key="tgn,7003685" n="1.000 11" reg="saxony">Saxony</placeName>, to the <rs type="role" reg="Grand Duke">Grand Duke</rs>, . . . . in consequence of which I received yesterday, from <persName n="Fossombroni,Comte,,,," id="n0231.0003.00049.00233" reg="mostcommon:Fossombroni,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Comte">Count</roleName> <surname>Fossombroni</surname></persName>, the <rs>Prime Minister</rs>, a formal despatch, saying that the <rs type="role" reg="Grand Duke">Grand Duke</rs> would receive me to-day, at <num value="12">twelve</num>, in his cabinet . . . . So to-day I went to the <rs>Pitti Palace</rs>, and after passing <pb id="p.50" n="50"/> through the regular antechambers and by the noble guards on service, was conducted through a labyrinth of passages,&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> of which passed near the kitchens,&mdash;until at last I reached a small room where was <num value="1">one</num> ordinary-looking old servant in attendance, out of livery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>In <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3minutes" type="date">three minutes</measure> he told me the <rs type="role" reg="Grand Duke">Grand Duke</rs> was ready to receive me, and I passed into his cabinet, which I found a large room, excessively encumbered with rich furniture, and containing several tables covered with papers, and a desk, or working-table,. . . . before which was a beautiful bust of the <rs>Grand Duchess</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Grand Duke">Grand Duke</rs> was standing just by the door to receive me, and carried me at once to a sofa, where we sat down together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>He is <measure n="39years" type="date">thirty-nine years</measure> old, rather tall, thin, pale, and awkward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>He talks French fluently and correctly, but with a strong <placeName reg="Italian">Italian</placeName> accent, and a little thickness of voice, which, added to a little real embarrassment, made it somewhat difficult to understand him, until he was <hi rend="italics">en train</hi>. The subjects were chosen chiefly by himself, but after talking a little about <placeName key="tgn,7003685" n="1.000 11" reg="saxony">Saxony</placeName>, and the princes there, and a little more about <placeName reg="Florence, Florence, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013766">Florence</placeName> and the objects of my visit, he fastened upon the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and asked me a great many questions about our manners, and modes of life, our luxury, the amount of the incomes of our rich men, the way in which they are spent, etc. He was generally well enough informed to put his questions well, and always very curious and eager.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>Indeed, I do not know when I have seen anybody so greedy of matter-of-fact knowledge; and whenever I said anything that struck him he took out his tablets, and made a note of it, as if he meant to seize every occasion to pick up a fact.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>At last, as the conversation grew more interesting to him, he kept his tablets constantly in his hand, and wrote as diligently as a German student at a lecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>On his part, he spoke of the decay of the great fortunes of the nobility in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 5" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> with some tone of regret, though, he said, it would probably at last lead to good; and when we talked about domestic life and the purity of its relations in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, he expressed the bitterest pain at the corruption of the married state in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 5" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, and added, <q direct="unspecified">If we could have in this respect your foundation to build upon, we could still have a great state in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 5" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>But it is too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>We are quite corrupt in all our domestic relations, and it comes chiefly, I think, from the fact that the infidelity of a husband is not thought to be at all a ground of censure.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/></p> 
<p>He asked me where I thought it the greatest good fortune for a man to be born.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>I told him in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>He asked why. And when I replied, that the mass of the community there, by being occupied <pb id="p.51" n="51"/> about the affairs of the state, instead of being confined, as they are elsewhere, to the mere drudgery of earning their own subsistence, are more truly men, and that it is more agreeable and elevating to live among them, he blushed a little, but made no answer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>Just at this moment the <rs>Archbishop</rs> was announced, and the <rs>Prince</rs>, saying he should like to talk with me still further, but that he had indispensable business with the <rs>Archbishop</rs>, asked me if I would go for an instant into an adjoining room and then return to him. I did so, the <rs>Archbishop</rs> not stopping above <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3minutes" type="date">three minutes</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>When I went back he took out his tablets again, and plied me with questions about <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> till nearly <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time>, which is his dinnerhour; when, rising and going with me to the door, he thanked me for the information I had given him, and dismissed me. He struck me, on the whole, to have the character often attributed to him, of being an honest, well-meaning man, anxious to get the knowledge that will make him a faithful governor of his people; but, though with a fair and intelligent mind, so greatly wanting in firmness and energy, that it is hardly possible he should not be led and governed by designing men. This is said to be the case now, and he is growing unpopular very fast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>When he came to the sovereignty, in <dateStruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></dateStruct>, and for <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> afterwards, he was greatly loved; but since that time, and especially since the troubles in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 5" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">32</year></dateStruct>, that grew out of the <rs>French</rs> changes of <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct>, he has fallen more and more into the hands of those who desire the progress of absolutism, and has become less and less welcome to his people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>Where it is all to end, it is not perhaps easy to foresee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>His private and domestic character is admitted by all to be good; he lives entirely with his family, and devotes himself most laboriously to the work of government; but after all, if he does not know how to govern, and if his system is opposed to the whole spirit of his time, his good qualities will avail him nothing, and his zealous and voluntary personal labors, by making him responsible for a great deal of what he might otherwise well leave to his ministers, will only run up a heavier account with his people, and <num value="1">one</num> that, in the end, may be the harder to settle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>I look upon him, therefore, to be in an unhappy position, and his whole air and manner to-day seemed to me to show that he feels it to be an anxious <num value="1">one</num>. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/><hi rend="italics"><dateStruct value="-11-15"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="15">15</day></dateStruct></hi>.&mdash;I passed some time this morning with the <rs>Cavaliere Micali</rs>, a very lively and courtly little old gentleman, who is as full of knowledge of all sorts, from his <placeName reg="Etruscan">Etruscan</placeName> antiquities down to the commonest gossip of the day, as a man well can be. He carried me from his own house to see the <rs>Riccardi Palace</rs>. . . . . <pb id="p.52" n="52"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>On my return home I had a visit from the <rs>Marquis</rs> dea <persName n="Torrigiani,,,,," id="n0231.0003.00052.00234" reg="mostcommon:Torrigiani,Marchese,Carlo,de,:1"><surname>Torrigiani</surname></persName>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> son of the head of the family, a very respectable, modest young man, who travelled a few years ago in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>Since he came back he has interested himself in reviving and giving efficiency to some old schools for popular instruction, in which he has partly succeeded, but in which the spirit of the government is substantially against him. Even his own family give him no hearty support, I am told, though they are pleased with it, as a sort of feather in the cap of <num value="1">one</num> of their number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>He talks English very well, and has a quiet, gentle manner, which, with his apparent good sense, makes me augur well for his success. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/><hi rend="italics"><dateStruct value="-11-16"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="16">16</day></dateStruct></hi>.&mdash;I went this morning with <persName n="Micali,,,,," id="n0231.0003.00052.00235" reg="mostcommon:Micali,Giuseppe,,,:1"><surname>Micali</surname></persName> to see the <rs>Marquis Gaetano Capponi</rs>, a member of <num value="1">one</num> of those old Florentine families whose titles have survived their fortunes, but who still relish of the old stock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>He is a retired, modest man, remarkable chiefly for his love of <persName n="Tasso,,,,," id="n0231.0003.00052.00236" reg="mostcommon:Tasso,Bernardo,,,:1"><surname>Tasso</surname></persName>, and for his collection of books relative to <persName n="Tasso,,,,," id="n0231.0003.00052.00237" reg="mostcommon:Tasso,Bernardo,,,:1"><surname>Tasso</surname></persName>, which, in fact, induced me to visit him. It is a very remarkable collection, comprising every edition of the poet himself of any note whatsoever, and nearly every other <num value="1">one</num>, however inconsiderable; together with whatever has been written and published separately about him. The <rs>Marquis</rs> is now just about to enter into a discussion concerning the <rs>Alberti Manuscripts</rs>, as they are called, on which he means to print a pamphlet.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>It is a curious subject, and if he will give an historical and plain account of the matter, he will render a very acceptable service to <persName n="Italian,,,,," id="n0231.0003.00052.00238" reg="mostcommon:Italian,nomatch:0"><surname>Italian</surname></persName> literature . . . . . The facts in the case are, I believe, as follows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>On the other hand, the belief at <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> in favor of their genuineness is as strong as the belief at <placeName reg="Florence, Florence, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013766">Florence</placeName> is against it. <persName n="Bunsen,,,,," id="n0231.0004.00079.00493" reg="mostcommon:Bunsen,Carl,Josias,,:1"><surname>Bunsen</surname></persName>, <persName n="Hare,Mister,,,," id="n0231.0004.00079.00494" reg="nearbymention:Hare,Julius,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hare</surname></persName>, <persName n="Ludolf,Comte,,,," id="n0231.0004.00079.00495" reg="mostcommon:Ludolf,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Comte">Count</roleName> <surname>Ludolf</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Gaetano,,Marquis,,," id="n0231.0004.00079.00496" reg="default:Gaetano,Marquis,,,"><foreName>Marquis</foreName> <surname>Gaetano</surname></persName> have expressed themselves to me strongly on the subject, but there has been no examination here, and some of them did not seem to know there had been <num value="1">one</num> anywhere.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1691"/>The tone is decidedly lower, more immoral, worse than it was <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> ago; and when it is recollected how much influence the drama exercises in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName> on public opinion, it becomes an important fact in regard to the moral state of the capital and country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1692"/>The old <name>French</name> drama, and especially the comedy, from <persName n="Moliere,,,,," id="n0231.0007.00140.01179" reg="mostcommon:Moliere,nomatch:0"><surname>Moliere</surname></persName>'s time downwards, contained often gross and indelicate phrases and allusions, but the tone of the pieces, as a whole, was generally respectable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1695"/>I have not yet seen <num value="1">one</num> piece that is to be considered an exception to this remark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1698"/>How is this to be explained?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2242"/>A visit to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, especially <num value="1">one</num> of so long duration, was still a rare event, and the return of such a man, after such an absence, was a matter of no common interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2243"/>Almost as soon as he entered the rooms provided for him at the <rs type="place">Tremont House</rs>, the parlor was entirely filled by friends and acquaintances&mdash;some of whom had met him at the station&mdash;eager to welcome him; and while he remained there, many hours of each day were occupied by these cordial greetings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2244"/>His love of home, his pride in his country, and his preference for a regular, domestic life, always&mdash;as has already been said&mdash;made him regard his absences as periods taken out of his legitimate life; and he now resumed, as quickly as possible, his share in the interests of his native sphere.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2245"/>For a year or more after his return, he and his family still lived somewhat like travellers, visiting various relatives and friends during the <num value="2">two</num> summers, and in the <rs type="season">winter</rs> and <rs type="season">spring</rs>, while in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, passing a few weeks at a hotel, and <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure> under the hospitable roof of their friend, <persName n="Gray,,F.,C.,," id="n0231.0010.00184.01791" reg="expanded:Gray,Francis,Calley,,"><foreName>F.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Gray</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2248"/>It shows the strong feeling he had for the progress of his country, and his desire to have it better understood abroad; and it is always full of a warm-hearted interest in whatever concerned those to whom he was personally attached.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2249"/>The frequent reference to political subjects in his letters, especially at a later period, will be observed, not only as somewhat unexpected from a man devoted to scholarly and literary pursuits, but as opposed to the impression entertained by those who knew him only slightly, that he was indifferent to matters of government and politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2250"/>That he had strong convictions and intelligent opinions on all the political movements of his time in his own country, that he observed carefully, and watched with interest what may be called comparative politics, historical and contemporaneous, will readily be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2251"/>The formation of his views was the result of influences, some of which were peculiar in his case.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2252"/><num value="1">One</num> of his marked characteristics was loyalty to truth; and he always felt that this virtue could be maintained in politics, as in everything else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2253"/>He thought that in our written Constitution we had a standard of political truth and integrity to which it was always safe and patriotic to conform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2254"/>He therefore belonged to whatever party in the country gave the most trustworthy assurance of adhering to the <rs>Constitution</rs> and preserving the <rs>Union</rs>, with least variation from the principles of its founders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2255"/>He belonged to a generation which began life while yet the discussions connected with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> creation of the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States government</orgName> were fresh in men's minds; when the opinions of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0231.0010.00185.01793" reg="mostcommon:Washington,Columbia,,,:1"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, <persName n="Hamilton,,,,," id="n0231.0010.00185.01794" reg="mostcommon:Hamilton,William,,,:4"><surname>Hamilton</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Adams,,,,," id="n0231.0010.00185.01795" reg="mostcommon:Adams,John,,,:4"><surname>Adams</surname></persName> were familiarly known; and he lived through a period when the progress of the nation was remarkably rapid, well-balanced in material, moral, and intellectual growth, and guided by men of worth as well as of ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2256"/>As his generation began to pass away, an enormous material development, immense immigration, and eager divergence into sectional parties, <pb id="p.186" n="186"/> changed the character of the country in several important respects.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2257"/>His intercourse in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> with men distinguished both as leading statesmen and as political thinkers; his pursuit, even at <placeName reg="Gottingen, Braunschweig, Niedersachsen" key="tgn,7005246">Gottingen</placeName>, of studies calculated to make him a competent observer of the public life, the statesmen, and the governments of different lands,&mdash;all trained his judgment and quickened his insight into similar subjects at home.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2258"/>In consequence of this, he took, for more than <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>, as keen an interest in all the active political thought of his time, as if he himself had been concerned in its creation or its control His ability and his sagacity will be differently estimated by different readers; but his interest, and the breadth, wisdom, and elevation of his desires for his country, will be apparent to all. He loved his native land, and always fulfilled the duties imposed on private citizens with the privileges of a free government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2259"/>That he was thought sometimes desponding about the success of our institutions grew, probably, out of the eagerness and emphasis which he, often put into the expression of that consciousness of our dangers, from which no man, with his antecedents and his point of view, could escape; but which to younger men, of a generation marked by a spirit of <hi rend="italics">laissez-faire</hi> and sanguine confidence, seemed exaggerated and depressing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2260"/>His conversation showed his sense of the responsibility which rests on every man of thought and integrity to transmit to others the great truths and traditions he has received as an inheritance from those before him; to discountenance opinions which he is satisfied are dangerous to civilization and to healthy progress (a duty, as he once wrote, especially important where the government rests on public opinion); and to promote, so far as in him lies, the sovereignty of law and justice.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2269"/>And yet, during those years, we have passed through the severest commercial embarrassments we have ever experienced, and have sustained losses which almost anywhere else would have left deep, if not dangerous traces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2270"/>But the truth is, the condition of the lowest classes of the people is so truly comfortable, there is so much thrift and prosperity among them, and, above all, so much education, intelligence, and domestic <pb id="p.188" n="188"/> happiness and purity, that the changes which affect the condition of the rich reach them always very slowly, and generally not at all . . . .

Indeed, if we can keep the relations of domestic life as true and as pure as they now are, and continue the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and intelligence through the whole people, I know not that we can ask anything more for the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2344"/>Indeed, I doubt whether we should, at any period of our history, have been metaphysically inclined, if our popular theology had not long been of a character so peculiar . . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2347"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most practically wise statesmen now alive has often told me, that we never should have had our Revolution, if all the people had not been, for a century, in the habit of discussing the <orgName n="Westminster Assembly" type="assembly">Westminster Assembly's</orgName> Catechism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2348"/>And there is more truth in the odd jest than at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> appears . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2349"/>However, as I said before, we are a practical people,&mdash;eminently so,&mdash;and it was not possible metaphysics should become part of our constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2350"/>Since, therefore, our revolutionary condition has passed away,&mdash;revolutionary, I mean, in intellectual movement as well as political,&mdash;and has given place to a more settled state of things, we have shown little tendency to metaphysical discussions or controversies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2351"/>Even Calvinism, where it exists, has lost much of its theoretical, philosophical character and severity; and the other religious sects, seeing to what absurdities the <name>Calvinists</name> were so long carried, by their perverse intellectual philosophy, have been&mdash;especially for the last <num value="5">five</num>-and-<measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>&mdash;even more afraid than was reasonable of the logical deductions to which their systems may lead them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2352"/>Still, there is, at this moment, a tendency in a few persons among us to a wild sort of metaphysics, if their publications deserve so dignified a name . . . . But such discussions come from a source totally different from that of the hard metaphysics of the <orgName n="Old School" type="school">old school</orgName>, and are going in quite an opposite direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2353"/>They are of <name>German</name> origin, and within the last few years have been modified and rendered grotesque by a free infusion from the school of <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0231.0010.00194.01851" reg="mostcommon:Carlyle,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>, whose follies of form and style they have adopted, without finding any of his power. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2354"/>I do not mean, however, by what I have said, that we are careless of what is valuable in <hi rend="italics">practical</hi> metaphysics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2355"/>On the contrary, in relation to this really important portion of the science, we were never so much in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2356"/>In proof, I send you the account, given in <num value="2">two</num> successive reports of the <rs>Blind Asylum</rs>, in this city, partly on the education of a child, who, at the age of <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, wholly lost her eyes <pb id="p.195" n="195"/> and hearing, who has a very imperfect taste, and no smell at all; in short, a child who . . . . has no idea of the external world, and no means of communicating with it but through the sense of touch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2357"/>The great question, of course, was how to educate her, how to give her any ideas, and open a communication between her and the outer world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2358"/>It was a question hard for any ingenuity of intellectual philosophy or practical metaphysics to solve. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2359"/>After being in the <rs>Institution</rs> a little more than <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, she has been brought to the incredible point of writing-quite alone a letter to her mother, of which a facsimile is given in the <name>Report</name> for <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct>. . . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2360"/>Now, this I call practical metaphysics, and rejoice in it; and when the book is printed about her,&mdash;that will be printed when her education is further advanced,&mdash;it will, if I mistake not, awaken the attention of the wiser sort of intellectual philosophers throughout the world; such philosophers, I mean, as you and I, who care to make people happy, and not to make them crazy or quarrelsome. . . .</p></body></text>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2361"/>The great political question which you were in doubt about . . . . has been triumphantly settled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2362"/>Yesterday the flag on the top of our <placeName reg="State House">State House</placeName> showed what was going on below, and I could not help thinking what a beautiful and provident arrangement it was, that made it necessary to cast the <name>Electoral</name> vote on the same day, and at nearly the same hour, through all the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2363"/>And this brought me to think of the convention that made the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and the <rs>Madison</rs> papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2364"/>Have you looked them over?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2365"/>I say looked over, for it is not likely many people will read them through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2366"/>I have done as much, I suppose, as I ever shall with them, and was struck with the moderate amount of talent, knowledge, and practical skill in government that was shown in the whole body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2367"/>Nor was I displeased to see that it was so; for it gave so much the more prominence and value to their honesty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2368"/>I do not believe that so honest a body of men was ever collected, for a similar purpose, since the world was made; and it was their honesty, their sincere desire to fulfil the great duty for which they were appointed, which, under <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, saved us,&mdash;not their talent or their wisdom,&mdash;and gave us the best form of government that was ever made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2369"/><pb id="p.196" n="196"/></p> 
<p>And this I regard as a fact in the history of nations, and in the development of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> providence in political affairs, of almost unrivalled importance, and full of benefits to the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2370"/>It seems from it, as if honesty could do almost anything; and when we see what has been doing the past years, and a long way back, it seems almost to prove the converse of the proposition, and show that talents alone can do nothing,&mdash;can bring nothing to pass that will last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2494"/>To individuals, the <rs>Bankrupt Law</rs> is bringing appropriate relief; but to the <name>States</name>, the process must be more slow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2495"/>Some of them, like <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> and <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>, never will pay. They have not the means, and cannot get the means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2496"/>They are honest and hopeless bankrupts, and will do what they can, but it will not be much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2497"/>Others, like <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>,&mdash;which repudiated its obligations so shamelessly,&mdash;will be compelled to pay by the force of public opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2501"/>At the <rs>South</rs>, and in the slave States, they are poor and growing poorer, even where they are not in debt. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2502"/>Now at this moment the country is in debt, perhaps to the amount of <num value="25000000">twenty-five millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2503"/>The sum is trifling, no doubt, but it is wholly odious to the people to be in debt at all.

We could, without injury, bear taxation to thrice the amount that would be needful to put the finances of the general government into the best possible condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2504"/>But this subject can be approached only through a discussion and adjustment of the whole tariff; and the tariff is a name that, more than any other, rouses up the sectional feelings and interests, and disturbs the passions of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2505"/>It must, however, be discussed and settled, and that, too, in the course of the months of <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2506"/>The country requires it, and it must be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2507"/>That a really wise and judicious tariff will be made, I do not venture to hope; but no doubt, as it seems to me, a tariff equal to the wants of the government will be passed, and after that there will be no more talk of financial difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2508"/>It is quite ridiculous that they have ever existed, and has been wholly owing to the state of parties; but the mass of the people, who have been forgotten in the strife for office and power, are the real masters, and they have plainly determined that their interests shall no longer be sacrificed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2519"/>The little affair of <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName> has tended, I think, to strengthen our institutions, by settling the principle that the people of a State have no right to change their Constitutions, except in the forms provided by law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2520"/>The Constitution, or Charter, of <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName> was <num value="1">one</num> sufficiently absurd, which had been given by <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName> <genName n="2">II</genName></persName>., and had long since ceased to be suited to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2521"/>But the landholders, who had all the power, refused to give it up until lately, when the mass of the people became so exasperated that, without observing the forms prescribed by law, they made a Constitution for themselves, and undertook to carry it into practical operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2522"/>Everything <hi rend="italics">but</hi> bloodshed followed; but the popular party was completely put down, and now a suitable Constitution will be legally formed and peaceably carried into execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2523"/>It constitutes a strong case, because the people were originally right, and only erred in the forms, and in the passions they indulged.

<p>He here gives a summary of the history of slavery in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> from colonial times.</p></note> . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2665"/>The last important discussion on involuntary servitude at the <rs>South</rs> was in the <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Virginia Legislature</orgName>, in <dateStruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">32</year></dateStruct>, soon after a formidable insurrection had occurred near <placeName reg="Southampton, Hampshire, England" key="tgn,7011385">Southampton</placeName>, in that State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2666"/>No question was taken; but, from the whole tone of the debate, all men apprehended the near abolition of slavery in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, and, so far as I know, all men rejoiced at it. Certainly all the <rs>North</rs> did.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2667"/>But we were disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2668"/>Political and sectional abolitionism had appeared already.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2669"/>The South soon became alarmed and excited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2670"/>They put themselves on the defensive <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and then on the offensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2671"/>Instead of regarding slavery as a great moral and political evil, as it had always before been admitted to be among the mass of the slaveholders, and as it was openly proclaimed to be in the <rs>Virginia</rs> debates of <dateStruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">32</year></dateStruct>, it has been, since <dateStruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></dateStruct>, maintained by <persName n="McDuffie,,,,," id="n0231.0011.00217.02001" reg="mostcommon:McDuffie,nomatch:0"><surname>McDuffie</surname></persName>, <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n0231.0011.00217.02002" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,John,C.,,:1"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>, and perhaps a majority of the leading men of the <rs>South</rs>, to be a great good in itself, and defensible in all its consequences . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2672"/>Meantime, at the <rs>North</rs> we grow rigorous with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2673"/>We say, and say truly, that it was not a thought in the minds of men, when the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> was made in <dateStruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></dateStruct>, that slavery was to be regarded as anything but a temporary calamity, which was to be removed with the assent of all, as soon as fit means could be found for it. <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, a slaveholder, acted so. <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0231.0011.00217.02003" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, a slaveholder, wrote so. All men felt so.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2674"/>But we at the <rs>North</rs> do not enough remember that we made, by that same Constitution, a special bargain with the <rs>Southern States</rs>, by which we left it entirely to them to remove, by their own means, and in their own time, the curse which was their own private mischief only, reserving to the whole nation the power of abolishing the slave-trade, which was promptly done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2675"/>We further promised to permit them to retake their slaves escaping into our States, and to do other things, which we at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> did cheerfully, and in a spirit of honor, but which we now do grudgingly, or not at all . . . . . So deep, so fatal, indeed, is the vice of the whole system, that nothing but mischief can come from it, whichever way you turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2676"/><pb id="p.218" n="218"/></p> 
<p>What, then, you will say,&mdash;nay, you do say it in your letter,what is to be done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2677"/>I answer, wait.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2678"/>For, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, it is right in itself to. do so. Slave labor can never, in the long run, come into successful competition with free labor, and in time slaves, therefore, will everywhere cease to be valuable as property. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2679"/>In the next place I would <hi rend="italics">wait</hi>, because I cannot help myself, I <hi rend="italics">can</hi> do nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2680"/>Legislation, I fear, can do nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2681"/>It is an affair of <num value="2000000.5">two millions and a half</num> of human beings, all slaves, and all in a most remarkable state of equality of condition in other respects It is beyond the reach of legislation; too big for it. It will be disposed of by its own gravity, not by any instruments of human invention.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2682"/>Finally, I would <hi rend="italics">wait, as a Northern man</hi>, because it is for my interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2683"/>The South is growing weak, we are growing strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2684"/>The Southern States are not only losing their <hi rend="italics">relative</hi> consequence in the <rs>Union</rs>, but, from the inherent and manifold mischiefs of slavery, they are positively growing poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2685"/>They are falling back in refinement, civilization, and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2686"/>Every year puts the advantage more on our side, and prepares us better to meet the contest, which will be gentler and more humane the longer it is postponed, but which can never be other than formidable and disastrous.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2687"/>I do not, however, deprecate the struggle as doubting the result, or fearing inconvenience or suffering for the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2688"/>There can be but <num value="1">one</num> result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2689"/>Slavery will be abolished; if soon, probably with much blood; if later, I hope with none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2690"/>But in either event, what is to become of the <num value="1000000">millions</num> of poor slaves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2691"/>I foresee no milder fate for them than that of the <name>Indians</name>, and I fear <num value="1">one</num> much more cruel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2692"/>The eager, active, encroaching race, to which we belong, will never endure those gentle, inefficient tribes to cumber the earth about them, after they themselves begin to feel that they want it and can profitably use it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2693"/>But do not misunderstand me; indeed, I know you will not. Foreseeing all these consequences, I am still for keeping on in the straightforward course, to abolish all slavery throughout the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2694"/>Great mischiefs, I know, will come of it. Let them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2695"/>The thing is right, and will succeed;, and greater good will at last result from it. But let us do it by the wisest, which in such cases are always the gentlest means; that so humanity may least suffer from what is, after all, too old a disease to be eradicated without the use of remedies that may sometimes make us, in our short-sightedness, grieve to have it back again.

Only think for a moment what a resemblance there is between that <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName> question, about which you did me the honor to read the long story I wrote to <persName n="Lyell,Mister,,,," id="n0231.0011.00219.02007" reg="nearbymention:Lyell,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lyell</surname></persName>, and your <name>Irish</name> question; what counterparts your <persName n="O'Connell,,Daniel,,," id="n0231.0011.00219.02008" reg="default:O'Connell,Daniel,,,"><foreName>Daniel</foreName> <surname>O'Connell</surname></persName> and our <persName n="Dorr,Governor,,,," id="n0231.0011.00219.02009" reg="mostcommon:Dorr,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Dorr</surname></persName> are, both in the motives that govern them and in the ends they pursue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2701"/>Why, <q direct="unspecified">half the platform just reflects the other,</q> though here I must needs be permitted to say, that I think we have a little the advantage of you,&mdash;a thing that comes rarely enough, to be sure,&mdash;but I really think we have a <hi rend="italics">little</hi> the advantage of you.

And there, I think, he will have to remain, till he is willing to come out and take the oath of allegiance to the government he has endeavored to overturn. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2702"/>But to leave politics,&mdash;though these questions are much deeper than mere party politics, which are always odious,&mdash;to leave politics and come to another of your exciting topics,&mdash;Puseyism,&mdash;we have, in proportion to the number of persons in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> who belong to the <rs>Episcopal</rs> or <orgName n="Anglican Church" type="church">Anglican church</orgName>, just as much Puseyism, and just as bitter quarrels about it, as you have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2703"/>In <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>&mdash;thanks to the wisdom, I believe, of the <name>Anglican</name> clergy&mdash;we have not been much infected either way; but New York is full of the matter, and its newspapers too. Then, too, our tariff question, which is annually shaking the nation, is exactly your corn-law question turned upsidedown; <pb id="p.220" n="220"/> the manufacturers here being the party complained of, while with you it is the land-owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2704"/>So, you see, we are still children of Old England; and if we were not, we should be still doing substantially the same things, for we are all of us children of <num value="1">one</num> family; connected by original qualities that will never permit us to get very far apart, even if we try.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2705"/>These, however, are great matters, and I might have added to them the <name>Repeal</name> movement; for, though that has been almost as exclusively an Irish affair, in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, as it has been in <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>, it may still serve to show how intimate are the bonds that connect the <num value="2">two</num> sides of the world together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2706"/>But perhaps small matters will show this even more plainly, and show at the same time how much we are alike; for, as they are not themselves the vast stream of public interests, which, like the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> Stream, strike of their own great impulse from <num value="1">one</num> continent over to the other, but rather the feathers and straws that float on its surface, we can, perhaps, after all, measure the movement itself by them, better than we can by the flood that bears us along, as if we were only a part of it. For instance, there is mesmerism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2707"/>You are all astir with that in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and I dare say in <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2708"/>Well, we reprint <persName n="Martineau,Miss,,,," id="n0231.0011.00220.02011" reg="mostcommon:Martineau,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Martineau</surname></persName>'s <hi rend="italics">brochures</hi>, and read them, perhaps, as much as you do. We have, too, our great mesmerizers, and our great phreno-mesmerizers, some of them like Katterfelto,&mdash;if that is the way <rs>Cowper</rs> spells his name,&mdash;with their hair on end at their own wonders, wondering for their bread; and others, mere gross, immoral mountebanks, not at all deluded by the odious tricks they perform . . . . There is, no doubt, something true at the bottom of it; and, as in many other cases, the small portion of truth preserves the large mass of error, into which it is infused, from becoming obvious and odious to all men. That there is such a thing as a mesmeric sleep can hardly now be questioned; but my faith can go no further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2709"/><num value="1">One</num> of the curious circumstances about the whole matter is, that the believers should consent to be called by the name of a man whom they themselves must regard as an impostor, and who, by common consent, survived his own honor above <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a century.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2711"/>If you will draw fro m all these facts the inference that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>&mdash;notwithstanding we have just chosen <persName n="Polk,Mister,,,," id="n0231.0011.00220.02013" reg="mostcommon:Polk,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName> to be <rs type="role2">President</rs>, and are in great danger of annexing <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> to our already too large territory&mdash;will still go on, and work out the original Anglo-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0231.0011.00220.02014" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> materials of the national character to some good result, I shall <pb id="p.221" n="221"/> certainly be contented with it. We have made a great many mistakes, by most of which we have profited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2712"/>We shall make a great many more, as other nations have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2713"/>But the aggregate of the whole will not be half so large as was anticipated by the wisest and best among us, when we began the world as an independent people about <measure n="60years" type="date">sixty years</measure> ago. The people here&mdash;I mean the mass, the whole &mdash; is more truly sovereign than it ever was before. . . . . All great questions, therefore, must be argued out before this sovereign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2714"/>Repudiation was <num value="1">one</num> of them, and was involved in a good deal of difficulty. . . . . But the question has been argued out,&mdash;or is now arguing out,&mdash;and the result is, that the sovereign has decided, and will continue to decide rightly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2715"/>. . . . Just so it will be with slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2716"/>It is a more difficult question than the last, but it must be argued out before the sovereign, and there is but <num value="1">one</num> way in which it can be decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2717"/>Only think where you, in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, were, within the memory of a man like <persName n="Grenville,Mister,Thomas,,," id="n0231.0011.00221.02015" reg="default:Grenville,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Grenville</surname></persName>, when, as somebody says, the pious <rs>John Newton</rs> went regularly twice a year to <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 7" reg="africa">Guinea</placeName>, with a cargo of hymn-books and handcuffs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2718"/>We are now nearer to emancipation than you then seemed, and are quite as sure to come to it; if for no other reason, for the plain <num value="1">one</num>, that slavery will impoverish, and degrade morally and intellectually, every State in the <rs>Union</rs> that persists in maintaining it. I take these <num value="2">two</num> great questions, of repudiation and slavery, as instances of what I mean, because they are the only questions of a political nature in which I have ever felt a deep personal interest; and because, if the popular sovereign is wise and honest enough to decide such questions as these rightly, he may be trusted, in the long run, with all the attributes of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2749"/>It is inevitable, I conceive, in the nature of things, that slaves should become unprofitable, at some time or other, in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>,&mdash;probably as soon as it is for the interest of the slaves themselves that emancipation should take place,&mdash;and by the slow and gentle process which will alone permit the emancipation of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3000000">three millions</num> of human beings to be a benefit to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2750"/>The great difficulty is, to make all interested in the matter willing to <hi rend="italics">wait</hi>. <num value="10">Ten</num> or a dozen years ago the <rs>South</rs> became very much alarmed, by the conduct of the unwise abolitionists of the free States, and finding themselves growing weak, have now contrived, or are likely to contrive, by unjustifiable means, to add <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> to their end of the confederacy, not perceiving that slavery is their weakness; and that to <pb id="p.224" n="224"/> add further to it is only to increase that weakness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2751"/>The breaking of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, too, on this vital point, is breaking the old bargain and the compromise between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>, which is becoming every day more important to them than it is to us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2752"/>For to them there is no source of hope and ultimate benefit, except in the influence, the kindly, peaceful influence, of the <rs>North</rs>, and its spirit of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2853"/>my dear <persName><foreName>George</foreName></persName>,&mdash;. . . . We think and talk of little here except the <rs>French</rs> and foreign affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2854"/>There are so many steamers nowadays, <pb id="p.232" n="232"/> and magnetic wires are so successful, that we get revolutions by driblets, and have something&mdash;at least the overthrow of a single monarchy&mdash;every day or <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2855"/>But never was speculation more at fault. . . . . The truth is, we have no precedents to go by. History gives us military revolutions and political revolutions enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2856"/>But this is neither.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2857"/>It is a social revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2858"/>The hordes that broke down the decaying civilization of the Old World, in the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> and <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> centuries, did it by violence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2859"/>The decaying civilization of our times is assailed by social theories, which, it is possible, the masses may introduce, by the mere fear of their numbers,&mdash;though this seems highly improbable,&mdash;but which, if introduced, would lay waste the world as much as is consistent with its present advancement, and, at any rate, create an incredible amount of human misery, and reduce, materially, the population of Christendom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2860"/>But it seems to me much more likely that the old order will be maintained; and if it is, it can only be by reconstructing society through some strict despotism, either military or civil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2861"/><num value="1">One</num> more strict or severe than now exists in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName> can hardly be imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2864"/>Power has been wholly in the hands of an irresponsible mob, to whom the world had not been friends, nor the world's law, and who do not feel that they have any interest or business but to overturn everything that is established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2865"/>The only question, therefore, is, how far things are to go on in this direction before a reaction takes place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2866"/>The further they go, the severer must be the power that is to reconstruct society.

Its views are discouraging enough, but not more so, I fear, than are true, though I do not agree to all its conclusions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2889"/>As to the present <rs>French</rs> and Continental convulsions, which some persons regard with favorable eyes, I can only say, that during a life of <num value="7">seven</num> or <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, I never was in any country where I should have thought it wise, or <persName n="Christian,,,,," id="n0231.0011.00234.02071" reg="mostcommon:Christian,nomatch:0"><surname>Christian</surname></persName>, to join in any such movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2890"/>The reason is obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2891"/>Whenever the institutions of society are so far destroyed as they were in last <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>March</month></dateStruct> in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName>, I take it to be certain that they can be reconstructed only on a military basis, and&mdash;whatever may be the nominal form of government&mdash;that the power for this reconstruction must be wielded by the will of <num value="1">one</num> strong man, to whom the mass of the people will submit gladly, in order to secure their property and lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2892"/>But republics, I much fear, cannot grow on the soil of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>; at least, not republics in the sense we give to that word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2893"/>There is no nourishment for them in the present condition or past history of the nations there, and if such struggles as we have witnessed for the last <measure n="60years" type="date">sixty years</measure> are <pb id="p.235" n="235"/> to go on, with the vain hope of obtaining free governments, in which universal suffrage shall make the whole body of the people a practical sovereign, nothing but a decay of civilization will be the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2894"/>Christianity, almost powerless with the multitudes of a large part of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and the press abused to mislead them, will not have conservative energy enough to save the most enlightened parts of the modern world, from the fate which befell the most enlightened parts of the ancient, from struggles not dissimilar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2895"/><placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName>, in the course of a <measure n="1000years" type="date">thousand years</measure>, or in some other of the great periods which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> appoints to the history of nations, as he does to the building and decay of the globe, may well become what <placeName reg="Turkiye" key="tgn,1000144">Asia Minor</placeName> and <placeName reg="Misr" key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> are now. At any rate, I think the steps she is taking at the present moment are in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2896"/>We, too, are no doubt going on like the buried nations of antiquity, through the changes of youth and age.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2901"/>My dear <rs type="role2">Prince</rs>,&mdash;Your kind and interesting letter of the <dateStruct value="-05-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, with <num value="1">one</num> from <persName n="Circourt,Comte,,,," id="n0231.0011.00235.02072" reg="mostcommon:Circourt,Adolphe,,,:3"><roleName n="Comte">Count</roleName> <surname>Circourt</surname></persName>, written after he had been at <placeName reg="Dresden, Weakley, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098870">Dresden</placeName>, have kept you almost constantly in our thoughts of late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2902"/>Indeed, it is difficult to think of anything else but the changes that are now going on, like a solemn drama, in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>; not only because the fate and fortunes of so many of our personal friends are put at <pb id="p.236" n="236"/> hazard by them, but because they involve so deeply the cause of <name>Christian</name> civilization and the paramount interests of our common humanity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2903"/>We feel, to be sure, comparatively safe ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2904"/>Our people are young; we have room enough and bread enough for all; free institutions are the only ones that, even in colonial days, took root here; we have been gradually and thoroughly educated to them, and every year manage them with a more practised skill; in short, from our vast local advantages, and from the whole course of our history as a nation, a republic is a <hi rend="italics">truth</hi> here; but what is it in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName>, or what <hi rend="italics">can</hi> it be either there or in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 6" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2905"/>You will not be surprised to hear that wise men in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> saw, from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that no good was to come&mdash;except as <name n="God" type="God">God</name> brings good out of evil&mdash;from the violent changes that began in the <rs>South</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> and in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName> last winter, because they saw plainly that, if the institutions of society are once destroyed,&mdash;as they were in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> in <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>, <dateStruct><month>March</month></dateStruct>, and <dateStruct><month>April</month></dateStruct>,&mdash;they can be reconstructed only on the basis of a military despotism, and in the presence and by the authority of the bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2906"/>But you will, perhaps, be somewhat surprised to learn that the great mass of our people at the <rs>North</rs> felt no confidence in the <rs>French</rs> movement from its outset; no more confidence, I may say, than did the wiser.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2907"/>They are accustomed every day to the workings of a truly popular government, and they saw little in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName> that reminded them of their own experience, and nothing to justify the belief that a wise republic would be founded, in which the people, by severe organic laws, would limit its own powers; in which labor and capital would rest on the same foundations; and in which the rights of the minority would be protected by the same principles that give the majority all its control of the state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2908"/>They knew that a people who not only are without knowledge enough to be able to read and write, but without the more important political education which enables them to judge the measures of the government they have created,&mdash;they knew that such a people can never make a wise, practical sovereign.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2909"/>All men, therefore, with few exceptions, in this part of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, have judged the changes in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName> rigorously, but rightly, from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; predicting events from time to time as they have occurred, and looking now to no more favorable results than they anticipated <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> ago. . . . .</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2912"/>dear Sir,&mdash;I have received some time ago your long and interesting letter of the <dateStruct value="-07-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2913"/>It is very curious to hear the impression which our great political convulsions make on an impartial spectator, placed at a distance, on a secure ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2914"/>Yet perhaps it may be likewise interesting to you to hear the description of <num value="1">one</num> who is in the midst of the tempest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2915"/>In general, I must say that since I wrote you last the public spirit is become better, yet we are not at the end of the crisis; and I fear the last decision will be that of the sword.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2916"/><num value="1">One</num> can distinguish, in general, <num value="5">five</num> great divisions of opinion in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2917"/><num value="1">1</num>. The anarchical party, or party of the red republicans, composed of a great part of the <hi rend="italics">proletaires</hi>, of some men of broken fortunes, who like revolutions for revolution's sake, and of the disciples of communism and socialism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2918"/><num value="2">2</num>. The republicans, who wish a legal introduction of a republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2919"/>The number of this party I think comparatively small, yet it is to be feared that on some occasion it may lend its forces to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2920"/><num value="3">3</num>. The men for monarchy, with the broadest democratical basis, who will have monarchy without any power in the monarch, and without the necessary condition of it. This party, which is very numerous, rejects all census of eligibility and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2921"/><num value="4">4</num>. The conservative <orgName n="Liberal party" type="party">liberal party</orgName>, composed of the ancient liberal opposition, not so numerous, yet weightier with respect to intelligence than the last, but partly overwhelmed by the consequences of its own system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2922"/><num value="5">5</num>. The ancient aristocratical party, overawed for the moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2923"/>The most intelligent men in it feel that they cannot oppose the torrent, and make common cause with the liberal <orgName n="Conservative party" type="party">conservative party</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2924"/>Since the late events in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName> and at <placeName key="tgn,7006464" n="1.000 1" reg="praha,stredocesky,ceska republika,europe">Prague</placeName>, and the victories of <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 5" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, the conservative parties have gained in courage and activity, and this is the best symptom of our present situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2925"/>But if a union of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>-named party with the <num value="2">two</num> republican fractions should take place, the position would be very dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2926"/>As for the particular countries, the conservative <orgName n="Liberal party" type="party">liberal party</orgName>, which is there not so much separated from what I called the party of democratical monarchy, has been for the moment victorious in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2927"/>In that country, liberty is not so much what men desire, as equality and order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2928"/>This is the reason why <persName n="Cavaignac,,,,," id="n0231.0011.00237.02074" reg="mostcommon:Cavaignac,nomatch:0"><surname>Cavaignac</surname></persName> can take many measures against the press and associations, which no <name>German</name> government could venture <pb id="p.238" n="238"/> to propose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2929"/>The parties now at the head of the government know not what to do with their republic, which was given to them by the republican and anarchical parties against their wishes; and I am persuaded that monarchy&mdash;perhaps a rather despotic monarchy&mdash; will in time be re-established in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2930"/>In <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 5" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> the movement was more the work of a faction than of the people; of a faction composed of the nobility, the higher classes of the <hi rend="italics">bourgeoisie</hi>, and a part of the clergy, and influenced more by national than by political ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2931"/>Since the victories of <persName n="Radetsky,,,,," id="n0231.0011.00238.02075" reg="mostcommon:Radetsky,nomatch:0"><surname>Radetsky</surname></persName>,&mdash;a marvellous old man of <num value="83">eighty-three</num>,&mdash;the enthusiasm seems extinguishing; the people, over all the people of the open country, have received everywhere the <name>Austrians</name> as deliverers, and if <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName> does not mingle itself in the contest, things will be re-established in the ancient limits, yet with popular institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2932"/>Yet this is the point where the danger of a general war is the most threatening.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2933"/>As for us in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 6" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>, the situation is more complicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2934"/>It is not only the constitutions of the particular states that have been shaken, but the whole confederation is to be re-established on a new basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2935"/>The <num value="2">two</num> constitutional monarchical parties are disputing the ground with that acrimony which characterizes our <name>German</name> theoretical disputes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2936"/>But with respect to the whole of <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 6" reg="germany">Germany</placeName> there is another question dividing the opinions,&mdash;the question of centralization and of particularism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2937"/>As for my opinion, a constitution like that of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would, in this point of view, be the best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2938"/>Selfgovern-ment of the particular States as the rule, and centralization of all that is necessary for preserving unity, as foreign affairs, the army, the fleet, and the general commercial regulations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2939"/>I think this is likewise the opinion of the majority at Frankfurt; but, nevertheless, I fear that we take there, in many respects, a false way. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2940"/>With us in <placeName key="tgn,7003685" n="1.000 11" reg="saxony">Saxony</placeName>, things are relatively better, and have even made a progress since last spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2941"/>The loyal and benevolent character of the <rs>King</rs> is generally estimated, and there is yet a fund of true attachment for his person. . . . . The <rs>King</rs> was lately at <placeName key="tgn,7012329" n="1.000 1" reg="leipzig,leipzig,sachsen,deutschland,europe">Leipzig</placeName>, and was received there with the greatest demonstration of loyalty. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2942"/>You ask me some news of the <rs>King</rs> and my family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2943"/>We are all tolerably well, after these great convulsions, the <rs>King</rs> much better since last spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2944"/>My family is growing up, my <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> daughter promised to the <rs>Duke</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7008546" n="1.000 5" reg="genova,genova,liguria,italia,europe">Genoa</placeName>, son of the <rs>King</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7003121" n="1.000 19" reg="sardegna">Sardinia</placeName>, but the political circumstances have retarded the marriage. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2945"/>The notices you gave me about the question of prison reform are very interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2946"/>I am sorry that <persName n="Gray,,,,," id="n0231.0011.00238.02076" reg="nearbymention:Gray,F.,C.,,"><surname>Gray</surname></persName>'s book is so little known <pb id="p.239" n="239"/> in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2947"/>I will endeavor to render it more public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2954"/>But, now and then, somebody comes to me wandering over the morning dew,&mdash;as the shepherds did to <persName n="Parnell,,,,," id="n0231.0011.00239.02079" reg="mostcommon:Parnell,nomatch:0"><surname>Parnell</surname></persName>'s Hermit,&mdash;and I hear in this way of the bustle of the great world of our little city, without being incommoded by its stir.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2955"/>From what I hear I suspect the <hi rend="italics">early</hi> Taylorites in my neighborhood do not feel so easy as they did when I saw them last . . . . .

<p>This refers to the <q direct="unspecified"><address><street n="Astor Place">Astor Place</street></address></q> riots in New York, when <persName n="Macready,Mister,,,," id="n0231.0011.00240.02088" reg="mostcommon:Macready,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Macready</surname></persName> was attacked by a mob, in consequence of the course taken by <persName n="Forrest,Mister,Edwin,,," id="n0231.0011.00240.02089" reg="default:Forrest,Edwin,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Edwin</foreName> <surname>Forrest</surname></persName>, who attempted to put down the <rs>English</rs> actor.</p></note> . . . . <num value="1">One</num> or <num value="2">two</num> moral reflections I must make.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2962"/>The people here about <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> ago <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> began to feel that a mob impaired the popular sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2963"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> proper firing of the people on a mob was at <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, where a mob undertook to pull down some houses of ill-fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2964"/>Since then it has been frequently done; as, for instance, at <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, in the case of the <rs>Catholic</rs> riots, the attack, I mean, on the <name>Catholics</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2965"/>But this at New York is the most decisive of all. The work was thoroughly done, both by the police and the militia; and it has been sustained by an unanimous cry from the whole country, as far as heard from; but the farther from New York the louder, even from the lowest and most vulgar of the penny papers in New York and <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2966"/>I think it settles the question, that the sovereign people will defend its sovereignty against the mob at all hazards, and I am not sure that this feeling will not make government among us as strong as it is anywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2967"/>The difficulty is, that we must work by cure, not by prevention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2968"/>But then such cures are like certain diseases, that disinfect the constitution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2989"/>He devoted himself to this labor, as was his wont, with noiseless but unflagging industry, building his edifice, from the foundation, with solidity and precision; and while, of course, it was founded on the studies of <num value="20">twenty</num> previous years, he threw aside, without hesitation, all that he had composed, during that period, in the form of lectures.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2990"/>For a long time no trace appears in his correspondence, of this his principal occupation, and, until very shortly before the publication of the book, it is mentioned only in those letters through which he sought materials and information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2991"/>The friends on whom he had no demands to make for this object were not required to share in an interest which did not naturally coincide with their habits of mind, and in his correspondence, as in his daily life, he kept the even tenor of his way, meeting the claims of others on his time and thoughts, without exacting the sympathy which did not flow from a common enthusiasm.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2992"/>The subject he had chosen attracted him wonderfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2993"/>Indeed, it must be said, as preface to all else on this theme, that rarely has a man of letters fallen upon a subject which more entirely <pb id="p.244" n="244"/> or more increasingly satisfied and interested him. Instead of growing eager to complete this, and take up some other work; instead of becoming impatient to bring his favorite matter, or himself, before the public,&mdash;having the brilliant success of his friend <persName n="Prescott,,,,," id="n0231.0012.00244.02107" reg="nearbymention:Prescott,William,H.,,"><surname>Prescott</surname></persName> to stimulate him in that direction,&mdash;he lingered over his preparations with affection, acknowledging that he disliked to part with the work after <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> devotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2994"/>From time to time, his nephew, <persName n="Curtis,Mister,George,T.,," id="n0231.0012.00244.02108" reg="expanded:Curtis,George,Ticknor,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Curtis</surname></persName>, asked him how soon he intended to stop collecting, and to begin printing, and he would only answer, <q direct="unspecified">When I have done.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2998"/>His love of exactness, of thoroughness, of finding the nearest possible approach to absolute truth, was a very prevailing element in his character, cultivated into a habit, which affected all his thoughts and utterances; and this had its influence in the prolongation of his labors on the book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2999"/>It also had much to do with the success of the <name>History</name>; for the thoroughness of his investigations, and the exceeding care shown, in all particulars, to arrive at facts, and to express them accurately, has always been generally acknowledged.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3000"/>Meanwhile, this absorbing occupation did not separate him, or induce him to seclude himself, from the current of social and domestic life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3001"/>His library door always stood open,&mdash;not figuratively only, but literally,&mdash;and no orders excluded visitors of any degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3002"/>He had, also, after his return home, in <dateStruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></dateStruct>, resumed his hospitable habits, as well as his connection with the more important societies and charities to which he had been attached; but his powers of concentration and methodical regulation of mind made him master of his time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3003"/>When he left town for the summer he always carried a mass of books with him, selected with reference to some division of his work, to which he intended devoting himself during his absence; and his <pb id="p.245" n="245"/> writing-table was arranged and became as much his natural resort at a hotel, where he was to stay a short time, as was his library table at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3004"/>An old Spanish book seemed to take him out of the world around him, wherever he might be; yet if any person, high or low, interrupted his studies, having a reasonable cause for doing so, he was habitually prompt and courteous in turning to the new subject brought before him. He was rarely absent-minded, and scarcely ever visibly impatient of interruption.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3005"/>The growth of the <name>History</name> is intimately connected with the growth of his Spanish library, for his books were his necessary tools, and the library took its character from the literary purpose for which it was collected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3093"/>I need not say that I have received a constant gratification from the perusal, for the subject is <num value="1">one</num> of great interest to me. But I have no hesitation in saying that the work is done in a manner, both as respects its scientific results and its execution as a work of art, that must secure it an important and permanent place in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3094"/>Not only the foreign, but the <rs>Spanish</rs> student must turn to its pages for the best, the only complete record of the national mind, as developed in the various walks of elegant letters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3095"/>The foreign reader will have ample evidence of the unfounded nature of the satire <q direct="unspecified">that the <name>Spaniards</name> have but <num value="1">one</num> good book, the object of which is to laugh at all the rest.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3096"/>Even those superficially acquainted, as I am, with the <rs>Castilian</rs> literature, must be astonished to see how prolific the <name>Spaniards</name> have been in all kinds of composition known in civilized <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and in some kinds exclusively their own. The few more learned critics, in the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs> and out of it, will find you have boldly entered the darkest corners of their literature, and dragged into light much that has hitherto been unknown, or but very imperfectly apprehended; while there is not a vexed question in the whole circle of the national literature which you have shrunk from discussing, and, as far as possible, deciding.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3097"/>The plan of the book seems to me very judicious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3098"/>By distributing the subject into the great periods determined by its prevalent characteristics at the time, you make a distinct impression on the mind of the reader, and connect the intellectual movement of the nation with the political and moral changes that have exercised an influence over it. You have clearly developed the dominant national spirit, which is the peculiar and fascinating feature of the <rs>Castilian</rs>; and you have shown how completely this literature vindicates a place for itself apart from all other literatures of Christendom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3099"/>For it was the product of influences to which they have never been subjected.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3100"/>The most interesting parts of the work to the general reader will, I suppose, be those which relate to topics of widest celebrity,&mdash;as the <name>Ballads</name>, for example, the great dramatic writers, <persName><foreName>Lope</foreName></persName>, <persName n="Calderon,,,,," id="n0231.0012.00252.02179" reg="mostcommon:Calderon,nomatch:0"><surname>Calderon</surname></persName>, <pb id="p.253" n="253"/> etc.,&mdash;above all <persName n="Cervantes,,,,," id="n0231.0012.00253.02180" reg="mostcommon:Cervantes,nomatch:0"><surname>Cervantes</surname></persName>, and scarcely less Quevedo. . . . . The portions least interesting to the vulgar reader will be the details in relation to the more obscure writers. . . . If you are bent on abridging the work, it is in these portions . . . . that you might exercise your shears. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3101"/>I believe every scholar will concede to you the merits of having had a most extraordinary body of materials at your command,&mdash; where such materials are rare,&mdash;of having studied them with diligence, and, finally, of having analyzed and discussed them in a manner perfectly original.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3141"/>My dear Sir,&mdash;At the risk of appearing somewhat impolite, I have delayed expressing my thanks to you for your kindness in sending me a copy of your <q direct="unspecified">History of <persName n="Literature,,Spanish,,," id="n0231.0012.00256.02220" reg="default:Literature,Spanish,,,"><foreName>Spanish</foreName> <surname>Literature</surname></persName>,</q> until I had read the whole work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3142"/>This I have now done very carefully, and parts of it several times, and I am happy to express to you my sincere congratulations at the eminent success which you have attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3143"/>Your book is an honor to yourself and to American literature.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3144"/>I felt sure, before reading it, that it would be thorough, accurate, learned, and that the subject would be entirely exhausted by your labors; but as histories of literature, with a few exceptions, have generally been rather arid and lifeless productions, occupying rather a place upon the library shelf as books of reference than upon the table as sources of entertainment and instruction at the same time, I must confess that I was not prepared for <num value="3">three</num> volumes of so exceedingly interesting and picturesque a character as these which you have given to the world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3145"/>In this result, I think you may take the most credit to yourself for <pb id="p.257" n="257"/> the artistic manner with which you have handled your materials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3146"/>The subject is, to be sure,&mdash;as it now appears after your book is finished,&mdash; a brilliant and romantic <num value="1">one</num>; but I have read enough of literary histories to know that they are too apt to furnish a kind of Barmecide's feast, in which the reader has to play the part of Shacabac, and <hi rend="italics">believe</hi> in the excellence of the lamb, stuffed with pistachio nuts, the flavor of the wines, and the perfume of the roses, upon the assertion of the entertainer, and without assistance from his own perceptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3147"/>This is not the case with your history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3148"/>While reading it, <num value="1">one</num> feels and recognizes the peculiar qualities of Spanish poetry and romance, which are so singularly in union with the chivalrous and romantic nation which produced them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3149"/>You have given extracts enough from each prominent work to allow the reader to feel its character, and to produce upon his mind the agreeable illusion that he himself knows something of the literature to which you introduce him. You analyze enough to instruct, without wearying the reader with too elaborate details.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3150"/>This I take to be the great art in composing literary history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3151"/>The reader should be able to take, and to remember, a general view of the whole, and while looking down the long vista of the gallery, he should be allowed to pause at each remarkable picture long enough to study and comprehend its beauties and its individual character. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3152"/>I cannot doubt that the work will always be the standard work upon the subject, and that it will turn the attention of many to a literature which has of late years been, I should think, comparatively neglected. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3153"/>Spanish literature is not only an important subject in itself, but it furnishes a complete and separate episode in the history of the progress and development of the <rs>European</rs> mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3154"/>Nowhere else have poets exhibited themselves in such picturesque and startling attitude and costume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3160"/>The delay, however, has given me time to read them through, and I can congratulate you on having brought your long labors to a close with so much honor to yourself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3161"/>The book has evidently taken a position in which it both supersedes, for its chief purpose, all others, and will never be itself superseded, certainly not out of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>; and, unless <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> become very different from what it is, not within its confines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3162"/>Your reach of knowledge is really marvellous in a foreigner; and I particularly admire the candor and good sense with which you have escaped the ordinary fault of exaggerating the writers whom you have occasion to bring before the public, while you have done ample justice to their real deserts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3163"/>Your style is clear, firm, and well-sustained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3164"/>Perhaps you will excuse a very trifling criticism; a few words seem to recur too often, such as <hi rend="italics">lady-love</hi>, which I hold hardly fit for prose, and <hi rend="italics">genial</hi>, which is better, and not objectionable, except that I think you have it too often.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3166"/>It is greatly to the credit of the country that a subject so merely library, and not relating to transient literature, has attracted a number of purchasers&mdash;at least according to the calculation of your publisher&mdash;very far beyond what any book, except <num value="1">one</num> of a popular character, could reach at once in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3167"/>This shows that <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> is fast taking a high position as a literary country; the next half-century will be abundantly productive of good authors in your Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3239"/>The times there are very stirring, the passions of men much excited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3240"/>But no permanent mischief will come from it. The people of the <rs>North</rs> have neither been frightened nor made angry, and are not likely to be. . . . . The result will be, that after much more angry discussion a ground of compromise and adjustment will be found which will settle the controversy once and forever, as we hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3241"/>This will be mainly owing to the conciliatory tone taken by <persName n="Webster,Mister,,,," id="n0231.0013.00265.02304" reg="nearbymention:Webster,D.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName>, which has much quieted the popular feeling at the <rs>North</rs>; for if he had assumed the opposite tone, the whole <rs>North</rs> would have gone with him, and the breach would have been much widened, if not made irreparable. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3242"/>Meantime the country advances with gigantic strides, and as the new States get on and take their permanent places in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, they feel a new power coming upon them, which is destined to have a preponderating authority to keep the peace in all conflicts that may hereafter arise between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3252"/>my dear <rs type="role2">Prince</rs>,&mdash;I have desired to write to you for some time, and acknowledge the receipt of a very interesting and instructive letter which you sent me in the spring, and a note of <dateStruct value="-05-9"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="9">9</day></dateStruct>, in which you speak with your accustomed kindness of my <q direct="unspecified">History of <persName n="Literature,,Spanish,,," id="n0231.0013.00266.02314" reg="default:Literature,Spanish,,,"><foreName>Spanish</foreName> <surname>Literature</surname></persName>,</q> of which I had early ventured to send you a copy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3253"/>But the state of our public affairs, on which I wished to say something, seemed every week to be likely to take a decisive turn . . . . I have waited, however, in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3254"/>The debates are still going on, the decision is still somewhat uncertain, and the disturbed and excited state of public opinion and feeling is still unappeased.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3255"/>But in the midst of this angry discussion has come a melancholy event, of which you have already heard,&mdash;I mean the very sudden death of the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; an event which, perhaps, will not exercise a great influence on the course of public affairs, but is worth particular notice, from the circumstance that what has accompanied and followed it throws a strong light on the nature and operation of the free institutions of this country. . . . . . The shock was very great; and, in a despotism, the loss of the head of the government, under circumstances of such national embarrassment, would have undoubtedly, I think, brought on a period of confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3256"/>But here, the course of things was not in the least shaken.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3258"/>Nor was the effect on the country different from what it was in the <placeName reg="Capitol, Salt Lake, Utah" key="tgn,2220712">Capitol</placeName> Men were everywhere shocked by it, as a warning of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> power, and felt grieved for the loss of <num value="1">one</num> in whose faithfulness, moderation, and wisdom even those originally opposed to his election had come very generally to place great confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3259"/>But there was no convulsion, no alarm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3260"/>Neither private nor public credit was affected to the amount of a penny, nor did any man in the country feel as if his personal happiness and security, or those of his children, were to be any way involved in this sudden death of the political head of the nation . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3261"/>Nor has there been any ground for alarm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3262"/>The popular will, which gives the main impulse to all governmental action in free institutions like ours, will be as efficient in carrying on the state under <persName n="Fillmore,Mister,,,," id="n0231.0013.00267.02315" reg="mostcommon:Fillmore,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Fillmore</surname></persName> as it was under <persName n="Taylor,General,,,," id="n0231.0013.00267.02316" reg="mostcommon:Taylor,Abbe,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3393"/>On the rights of the author you will find a discussion worth looking at, by <persName n="Johnson,Doctor,,,," id="n0231.0013.00278.02402" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,Samuel,,,:1"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, in <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Boswell,,,,," id="n0231.0013.00278.02403" reg="mostcommon:Boswell,James,,,:1"><surname>Boswell</surname></persName>,</q>&mdash;somewhere, I think, in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> half of the book,&mdash;and a more ample, but a more prejudiced examination of it, in a little volume by <persName n="Talfourd,,,,," id="n0231.0013.00278.02404" reg="mostcommon:Talfourd,T.,N.,,:1"><surname>Talfourd</surname></persName>. . . . . This, however, relates only to the rights of the author in his book, within the limits of his own country, or, in other words, the common question of copyright; but this, it should be observed, is the foundation of the whole matter so far as the author is concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3394"/>It is his right of property in the book he has written, the thing he has created.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3395"/>Now, it does not seem to me clear, why this author is not, in the nature of things, entitled to a protection of his property in his book, as far as a merchant may rightfully claim it in his bale of goods; for, after all, a book is peculiarly its author's work, since without him it would not exist, and nothing, therefore, as it seems to me, should control or limit his right of property in it, except that high public expediency which, like the right of eminent domain, overrides other rights and takes the property of <num value="1">one</num> for the benefit of all; not, however, in any case without compensation, which compensation, in the case of authorship, is to be found in the copyright law, whose peculiar provisions are regarded as a remuneration to the author for the right of property, which he loses when that law no longer protects him. The author, therefore, it seems to me, is entitled to the privilege of following his book&mdash;his property&mdash;into a country not his own, and claiming a part of his compensation wherever this property is used; <num value="1">one</num> reason in favor of it being that nowhere, either at home or abroad, can he receive compensation except exactly in proportion as he confers benefit, for where his book is not sold he can receive nothing from it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3396"/>This I take to be the moral view of the case, and I think it is a strong <num value="1">one</num> for the author, especially when you consider that <num value="9">nine</num> authors out of <num value="10">ten</num> fail utterly, and sacrifice their lives to the public and the world for nothing; so that the few prizes open to their class <pb id="p.279" n="279"/> ought to be made as good as possible, to induce them to adventure in a lottery so beneficial to society, but so dangerous to themselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3397"/>As to the interests of the bookseller, the case is not so clear; though it is quite clear that if the author have an absolute right of property in his book, it ought to control the interest of the bookseller, who, in that case, should acquire no right but such as he may obtain from the author.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3398"/>Still, I think the booksellers and publishers would be quite as well off with an international copyright as they are now. What they should publish would be their own protected property, just as much if the book were the work of a foreign author as if it were the work of a citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3399"/>No man could publish it in competition with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3400"/>Now it is well known that the profits of the <rs>American</rs> publisher are greater on a book protected to him by copyright, than they are on the books he reprints without such protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3401"/>His great enemies are rival publishers, who compel him, by the fear of competition, or by the actual competition itself, to print his books in most cases poorly, and to sell them at very small profit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3402"/>I think, therefore, the <rs>American</rs> publisher would lose nothing by an international copyright, certainly nothing to which he has so good a right as the foreign author upon whom he feeds or starves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3403"/>But how is it in the third place, with the interests of the public, which often seem to rise to the dignity of rights by their mere weight and importance, with little or no regard to their moral qualities?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3404"/><num value="2">Two</num> circumstances, I think, will tend to show that the interests of the public&mdash;the book consumers&mdash;will be served by a becoming international copyright treaty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3405"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, such a treaty would prevent, to a great degree, the republication here of trashy <name>English</name> books, now so common.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3406"/>Few of them would bear to have even a small amount of copyright money added to the price of manufacturing the books here, and a right to reprint without it would rarely be asked of the <rs>English</rs> owner by the <rs>American</rs> publisher, and still more rarely granted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3407"/>I cannot doubt, therefore, that the circulation of worthless or mischievous <name>English</name> books would be materially diminished by an international copyright.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3408"/>And, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, I think it would greatly increase the number of American authors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3409"/>We can now make as good books upon all subjects as the <rs>English</rs>,&mdash;upon some, such as school-books and children's books generally, we make better,&mdash;and, with proper encouragement, we should do nearly the whole of our own work of writing books for the mass of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3410"/>In this respect, I conceive, the question stands on the same ground with that of a proper tariff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3411"/>We already exclude <pb id="p.280" n="280"/> <name>English</name> school-books from our market, just as we do the coarser cottons, and for the same reason, and by the same process.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3412"/>With the encouragement of an international copyright, we should soon supply our market entirely, and supply it with books more wisely adapted to our wants generally, but never by any possibility excluding the better sort of <name>English</name> books, because we can reprint them so much cheaper than the <rs>English</rs> publishers can furnish them to us. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3413"/><num value="1">One</num> thing more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3414"/><placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName> has made an international copyright treaty with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and the cases of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in this particular are so nearly parallel, that, if it is for her interest to have such a treaty, it can hardly fail to be for ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3415"/>For <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName> prints great numbers of <name>English</name> books; <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> prints hardly any <rs n="french books" type="product">French books</rs>; nothing so many as she prints of American.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3416"/>If reciprocity be desirable, therefore, it is much more nearly to be attained between <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, than between <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3417"/>Moreover, this principle of reciprocity between us and <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> tends every year more towards an even balance, for the <rs>English</rs> print <num value="10">ten</num> of our books now, to where they printed <num value="1">one</num> a dozen years ago. True, our books are now protected in copyright, by a recent decision of their courts of law; but true it is also that if we do not give equal protection to their books, we shall lose it for our own, by act of Parliament, very speedily; and this protection is constantly growing more important to us. It may in time be more important to us than it is to them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3418"/>Half a century ago I was fitted for college in none but grammars, etc., printed in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, for no others were to be had. It is vastly more probable now that, half a century hence, <name>English</name> boys will be using manuals printed in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> for this purpose,&mdash;indeed, some are using them now,&mdash;than it was, in <dateStruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></dateStruct>, that we should, in <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>, be printing what we now print.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3419"/>The argument of future benefit is, therefore, I conceive, much stronger on our side than it is on the <rs>English</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3420"/>But so, I think, is the argument of present benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3421"/>Through the means of a wise international copyright treaty, I think we could, by the exclusion of worthless and injurious <name>English</name> books, and by the encouragement of American authors and publishers, fill the country with useful, interesting, healthy reading, to a degree never known before, and with beneficial consequences, all of which cannot now be foreseen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3422"/>We could, in fact, adapt our reading to our real wants and best interests much more than we do now, and so do much more by it for the general improvement and elevation of the national character.</p></body></text> <pb id="p.281" n="281"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3463"/>I will give an instance of what I mean; the strongest, but by no means the only <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3464"/>The slavery question&mdash;as we do not fail to let all the world know &mdash;is our great <hi rend="italics">crux;</hi> the rock on which not only our Union may split, but our well-being and civilization may be endangered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3465"/>All our ablest, wisest, and best men occupy themselves with it, and have long done so; and if we cannot work out a remedy for it among ourselves, we are well satisfied that nobody else can do it for us. Now in this state of the case, when the sensibilities of our whole people are excited on the subject as they never were before, popular meetings have for some years been holding in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> about it; American clergymen have been deemed fit or otherwise to preach in <name>English</name> pulpits, according to their opinions on this text; and, finally, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ladies in the kingdom&mdash;to be followed, of course, by a multitude of the rest&mdash; are about to interfere, and give us their advice, all well meant, certainly, but all as certainly a great mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3466"/>At least, so it seems to us at the cool <rs>North</rs>, where no single person, so far as I know, defends the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, or would fail to do anything practicable, within his power, to mitigate its evils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3467"/>The ladies of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, it seems to us, have as little to do with slavery in the <name>Carolinas</name> as they have with polygamy in <placeName key="tgn,7016752" n="1.000 6" reg="algeria">Algeria</placeName>, and know less about it; the men of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> have, as we think, no more to do with it than they have with our injustice to our <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0231.0014.00285.02441" reg="mostcommon:Indians,nomatch:0"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, or with the serfdom of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, and its evils and abominations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3468"/>We feel this all over the country, and you will not be surprised if <pb id="p.286" n="286"/> we soon show that we feel it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3476"/>I began, intending to write a letter about <q direct="unspecified"><persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>'s Cabin,</q> and I have talked about everything else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3477"/>However, I must still say a word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3478"/>I have read it with great interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3479"/>It is a book of much talent, especially dramatic talent, . . . . but it is quite without the epic attributes that alone can make a romance classical, and settle it as a part of the literature of any country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3480"/>As an exhibition of manners it is much more exaggerated than it should have been, for neither its good slaveholders nor its bad slaveholders can be taken as examples of even a moderate number of either class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3481"/>As a political book it greatly exasperates the slaveholders, and perhaps most seriously offends those among them who most feel the evils of slavery, and who most conscientiously endeavor to fulfil the hard duties it imposes on them, the very class whom <persName n="Stowe,Mrs.,,,," id="n0231.0014.00286.02446" reg="mostcommon:Stowe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Stowe</surname></persName> should, both as a Christian woman and a politician, have sustained and conciliated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3482"/>Elsewhere &mdash;I mean everywhere but in our slaveholding States&mdash;it will produce an effect exactly in proportion to the distance of its readers from the scenes it describes, and their previous ignorance of the state and condition of the questions it discusses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3483"/>Thus, in New England, where we have learned to distinguish between our political relations to the <rs>South</rs> and our moral relations to slavery, it deepens the horror of servitude, but it does not affect a single vote . . . . . But of <num value="1">one</num> thing <pb id="p.287" n="287"/> you may be sure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3484"/>It will neither benefit the slaves nor advance the slave question <num value="1">one</num> iota towards its solution. . . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3485"/>I can hardly say I have read it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3486"/>The rest, which is foreign to the subject, seemed to me curious,&mdash;the maxims high <persName n="German,,,,," id="n0231.0014.00287.02452" reg="mostcommon:German,nomatch:0"><surname>German</surname></persName>, and often very little intelligible; the apology interesting to your Episcopacy, but not to my <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName>; and the <rs>Latin</rs> excursus on the old liturgies, or their fragments, most learned and irrelevant to everything else in the book. . . . .</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3579"/>The early chapters about the abdication of <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName>, etc., he is disposed to think are a little too sketchy, a little too much in the style of memoirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3580"/>I differ from him entirely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3581"/>The manner is suited to the subject, and is attractive and conciliating to a remarkable degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3582"/>He will grow grave enough before he gets through, without making any effort for it. Moreover, the last half of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volume is already such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3603"/>Sire,&mdash;I received duly your Majesty's last letter, full of wise philosophy and sound sense both on <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> and American affairs; but I have not earlier answered it, because there is so little to send from this side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs> that can be interesting on the other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3604"/>We think and talk about your great war between the eastern and western divisions of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, almost as much as you do, and look with the same sort&mdash;if not the same degree&mdash;of eagerness for telegraphic despatches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3605"/>For we feel that all Christendom rests on <num value="1">one</num> basis of civilization, and that whatever shakes its foundations in <num value="1">one</num> part does <pb id="p.295" n="295"/> mischief to the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3606"/>No doubt, a revolution in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> would not be felt here, at once, as a calamity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3607"/>It might even, for a time, add to our prosperity, already as great as we can bear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3608"/>But it would come to us at last, as surely as the great Gulf Stream goes from our shores to yours, and then turns back to begin its course anew from the point whence it started.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3609"/>And steam is every day bringing us nearer together, and making us more dependent on each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3610"/>Notwithstanding all you may hear in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, there is no prospect that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> will involve themselves in the present troubles of your part of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3611"/>The apprehension of it that was felt in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, in the latter part of <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, was very absurd; and I am happy to be able to add that the indiscreet bullying of the <q direct="unspecified">Times</q> newspaper produced no effect at all on our population, which has often been so very sensitive to such things . . . . The <placeName key="tgn,7005562" n="1.000 9" reg="nicaragua">Nicaragua</placeName> matter&mdash;the claim of the <rs>British</rs> government to certain rights in the <rs type="place">Bay of Honduras</rs>&mdash;is a matter which may be much complicated by diplomacy, and draw long consequences after it. But the obvious trouble, and the <num value="1">one</num> that can be most easily turned to account, is the attempt made by the <rs>British</rs> government last summer, in our principal cities, to enlist persons for their military service against <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>; breaking or evading our very stringent laws upon the duties of neutrals. . . . . This is a very disagreeable affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3612"/>The people can easily be made angry by it, because it was done in a secret, underhand manner. . . . . The <q direct="unspecified">Know Nothings</q> have come in contact with the slavery question, and have been much injured by it in their resources and organization, for it is very difficult now to organize a new party, all whose principles shall be acceptable in the free States and in the slaveholding States; and it was always foreseen by intelligent men that this <orgName n="Know Nothing party" type="party">Know Nothing party</orgName> contained, in its secrecy and in its intolerance, the elements of its own destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3613"/>But it is still strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3614"/>The principle, that none but persons born in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, bred in its peculiar institutions, and attached to them by habit as well as choice, shall govern America, is&mdash;with reasonable limitations&mdash;so just and wise, that the party founded on it will surely leave its impress on a government as popular as ours is. They may not elect the next <rs>President</rs>,&mdash;although even this is possible,&mdash;but they will succeed in making a better naturalization law than we have now, and see that it is executed with justice, and even with rigor . . . . Your short crops in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> are filling the great <placeName reg="Mississippi Valley">valley of the Mississippi</placeName> with population and wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3616"/>Indeed, your <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> wars are not only making the <name>States</name> in the <rs type="place">valley of the Mississippi</rs> the preponderating power in the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>, but you are making them the granary of the world, more than ever <placeName reg="Misr" key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> or <placeName reg="Sicilia" key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> was to <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3617"/>So interchangeably are the different parts of Christendom connected, and so certainly are the fates and fortunes of each, in <num value="1">one</num> way or another, dependent on the condition of the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3629"/>At the present moment everything in the <rs>Atlantic States</rs> is in the hands of the <name>Disunionists</name>, at the <num value="2">two</num> ends of the <rs>Union</rs>; <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n0231.0014.00297.02525" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>, <persName n="Toombs,,,,," id="n0231.0014.00297.02526" reg="mostcommon:Toombs,nomatch:0"><surname>Toombs</surname></persName>, and the other fireeaters at the <rs>South</rs>, seeking by their violence to create as much abolitionism at the <rs>North</rs> as they can, so that it may react in favor of their long-cherished project for a separation of the <name>States</name>; and <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0231.0014.00297.02527" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,nomatch:0"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, <persName n="Phillips,,Wendell,,," id="n0231.0014.00297.02528" reg="default:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><foreName>Wendell</foreName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, and their coadjutors here striving to excite hatred towards the <rs>South</rs>, for the same end.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3630"/>But the majority of the people, even at the <num value="2">two</num> ends of the <rs>Union</rs>, are still sound on the great question, and will, I think, make their power felt at last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3631"/><num value="1">One</num> favorable sign is, that wise men are become anxious everywhere, and are ready to act, and take responsibility. . . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3632"/>Its people feel every year, more and more, how they are wasting away under the blighting curse of slavery, and struggle like drowning men to recover some foothold on solid ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3664"/>Such, at least, I understand to be your plan; and I have thought, more than once, that I would talk with you about it, but accident has prevented it. However, perhaps a letter is as good on all accounts, and better as a distinct memorandum of what I mean.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3665"/>It has seemed to me, for many years, that such a free public library, if adapted to the wants of our people, would be the crowning glory of our public schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3666"/>But I think it important that it should be adapted to our peculiar character; that is, that it should come in at the end of our system of free instruction, and be fitted to continue and increase the effects of that system by the self-culture that results from reading.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3667"/>The great obstacle to this with us is not&mdash;as it is in <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName> and elsewhere&mdash;a low condition of the mass of the people, condemning them, as soon as they escape from school, and often before it, to such severe labor, in order to procure the coarsest means of physical subsistence, that they have no leisure for intellectual culture, and soon lose all taste for it. Our difficulty is, to furnish means specially fitted to encourage a love for reading, to create an appetite for it, which the schools often fail to do, and then to adapt these means to its gratification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3668"/>That an appetite for reading can be very widely excited is plain, from what the cheap publications of the last <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> have accomplished, gradually raising the taste from such poor trash as the novels with which they began, up to the excellent and valuable works of all sorts which now flood the country, and are read by the middling classes everywhere, and in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, I think, even by a majority of the people.<note anchored="yes">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3670"/>Now what seems to me to be wanted in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> is, an apparatus that shall carry this taste for reading as deep as possible into society, assuming, what I believe to be true, that it can be carried deeper in our society than in any other in the world, because we are better fitted for it. To do this I would establish a library which, in its <hi rend="italics">main</hi> department and purpose, should differ from all free libraries yet attempted; I mean <num value="1">one</num> in which any popular books, tending to moral <pb id="p.302" n="302"/> and intellectual improvement, should be furnished in such numbers of copies that many persons, if they desired it, could be reading the same work at the same time; in short, that not only the best books of all sorts, but the pleasant literature of the day, should be made accessible to the whole people at the only time when they care for it, i e. when it is fresh and new. I would, therefore, continue to buy additional copies of any book of this class, almost as long as they should continue to be asked for, and thus, by following the popular taste,&mdash;unless it should demand something injurious,&mdash;create a real appetite for healthy general reading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3671"/>This appetite, once formed, will take care of itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3672"/>It will, in the great majority of cases, demand better and better books; and can, I believe, by a little judicious help, rather than by any direct control or restraint, be carried much higher than is generally thought possible.</p></body></text></p></quote> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3674"/>Nor would I, on this plan, neglect the establishment of a department for consultation, and for all the common purposes of public libraries, some of whose books, like encyclopedias and dictionaries, should never be lent out, while others could be permitted to circulate; all on the shelves being accessible for reference as many hours in the day as possible, and always in the evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3675"/>This part of the library, I should hope, would be much increased by donations from public-spirited individuals, and individuals interested in the progress of knowledge, while, I think, the public treasury should provide for the more popular department. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3676"/>Intimations of the want of such public facilities for reading are, I think, beginning to be given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3677"/>In <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> I notice advertisements of some of the larger circulating libraries, that they purchase <num value="1">one</num> and <num value="200">two hundred</num> copies of all new and popular works; and in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, I am told, some of our own circulating libraries will purchase almost any new book, if the person asking for it will agree to pay double the usual fee for reading it; while in all, I think, several, and sometimes many copies of new and popular works are kept on hand for a time, and then sold, as the demand for them dies away.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4040"/>I need not tell you that we are all well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4043"/>But in general terms, I can say that we have had a much better time than I expected, and enjoyed much more than I thought we should.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4044"/>The travelling servants are much more accomplished, and better fitted to their business than they used to be . . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4047"/>How much such a state of things alleviates the troubles of travelling I need not tell you; but even this improvement is little, compared with the improvement in the hotels, and the hotel service, and the facilities and comforts offered by the railroads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4101"/><pb id="p.339" n="339"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4118"/>He is more changed than almost anybody I have yet seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4119"/>He stoops, and is very gray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4120"/>But this can be easily accounted for.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4281"/>I was surprised to find him so young, only <num value="47">forty-seven</num>, and not looking above <num value="40">forty</num>; a round, pleasant-faced gentleman, who, to judge from his countenance and manner, has not a care in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4282"/>His conversation is such as you might expect from his appearance, lively and agreeable; his views of everything on which he talked strikingly broad, but not, I think, always very exactly defined; and his general air natural but not impressive.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4287"/>In the evening I went to a palazzo from which power has departed,&mdash;that, I mean, of the <name>Balbos</name>,&mdash;in order to pay my due respects to the widow of <persName n="Cesare,Comte,,,," id="n0231.0017.00353.02979" reg="mostcommon:Cesare,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Comte">Count</roleName> <surname>Cesare</surname></persName>, who was among my friends in both my other visits to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and at <num value="1">one</num> time filled the place now filled by <persName n="Cavour,,,,," id="n0231.0017.00353.02980" reg="mostcommon:Cavour,nomatch:0"><surname>Cavour</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4919"/>My own opinion is of little value, to be sure; but it is at least formed coolly at a distance, and I am sorry to say that it is not brighter than yours. . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4920"/>This condition of things is at last coming to be perceived in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>; but the opinions formed on it by intelligent men, as I have gradually learnt them, are seldom wise, and often tinctured with the national interests, or personal character of the individuals who express them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4921"/>We are no doubt felt to be a power in Christendom as we were never felt to be before; for we are, so to speak, visibly and tangibly grown great and rich, and are fast growing greater and richer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4922"/>The <num value="2">two</num> parties&mdash;liberal and conservative&mdash;into which <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> has long been separated, look upon us in this respect alike, and intelligently enough; but when they go a little further and come <pb id="p.403" n="403"/> to our present position and contests, they divide, and both fall into grave errors according to their respective parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4923"/>The liberals demand the abolition of slavery, much in the same sense in which <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0231.0020.00403.03520" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,nomatch:0"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> demands it, and if this cannot be effected, would gladly see the <rs>North</rs> separated from the <rs>South</rs>, not at all comprehending the consequences of disunion to the whole country, or its fatal effects on the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4924"/>Their philanthropy, from the days of the <rs>French Republic</rs>, has been an important part of their political judgments and systems at home, though not always a wise or consistent part of them, and they carry it now vehemently into their opinions of us, whom they have been accustomed to look up to with more admiration, perhaps, than we have deserved, as regards our form of government and our institutions as desirable and practicable to introduce throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4925"/>But our slavery is a great trouble to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4926"/>They have always felt it to be such; but since the immense success of <q direct="unspecified"><persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>,</q>&mdash;which is still acted, I am told, in the popular theatres in many parts of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and was certainly acted in <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> last winter when I was there, --and since the bearing of slavery on our union and destinies has been discussed in Congress, and by our <rs type="role2">Presidents</rs> in their messages, the <orgName n="Liberal party" type="party">liberal party</orgName>, throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, have everywhere taken it up in earnest . . . .</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4928"/>They acknowledge our power, but they do not like it and never have, and they wish to see it diminished, which they know it would be, inevitably, by disunion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4929"/>They can, as they see plainly, manage their affairs better with <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> divided, and weak by division, than with <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> united, already strong and growing stronger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4930"/>They can, too, better oppose liberal and disorganizing opinions at home, when they can appeal to such a failure as disunion would be of our grand experiment of a free government in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, which has always been a main support of those opinions in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4931"/>You will find abundant traces of this feeling, even in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4932"/>The <rs>English</rs> like our growing rich so far as it leads us to buy their fabrics, but they do not like to have us growing very strong, lest we should claim a high place among the nations, and make trouble in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4933"/>Multitudes among them cry out very honestly against our slavery, and take part with the <rs>North</rs>, to help put it down by force of the world's opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4934"/>But, when once we are separated, they will make the best treaties they can for their own interests with both parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4935"/>In doing this, philanthropy <pb id="p.404" n="404"/> will have as little to do with their diplomacy as it has had in <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 120" reg="zhonghua">China</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4936"/>Their manufactures will be admitted free at the <rs>South</rs>, and they will receive free the great staples they need in return;but we at the <rs>North</rs> cannot make such treaties with them; and though we may possibly, but not probably, get <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> and <placeName reg="Nova Scotia" key="tgn,7013046">Nova Scotia</placeName>, about which they will care little, we can, if separated, never have profitable or really satisfactory relations with these provinces, or with the mother country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4937"/>The same is the case, though in an inferior degree, with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName> and the other governments of the <name>Continent</name>, except, as I before said, with <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, who would be glad to have us for a mighty counterpoise against all the other powers of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, with no <num value="1">one</num> of whom can they have any really common interests or, at bottom, friendly relations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4938"/>All the rest of the great aristocracies have been long predicting that we should prove to be like fruit imperfectly formed and nourished, which rots without ripening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4939"/>They show us up now as cheats, filibusters who go for lawless conquests of foreign territory, who repudiate our honest debts, and as hypocrites who boast of universal suffrage and boundless liberty, while we hold <num value="3000000">three million</num> of our fellow creatures in slavery; insinuating always that these are the natural results of democracy, and of intrusting power to ignorant hands to use. And their opinions are beginning to be accepted by the intelligent classes, who have heretofore been little inclined to them, but who, after <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure> of sufferings that have followed the <name>Revolution</name>, begin to fear that society must be preserved, and that the liberty they have hoped, and often struggled for, is to be given up, at least for a time, to do it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4940"/>I do not know whether, in writing so learnedly, I have made plain my purpose, and so I will explain it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4941"/>The question will be understood by few, and of these few many will be glad to have our country divided, for the sake of the benefits that, as they believe, will accrue to their own institutions, while the great majority will regard it as merely a commercial or political question, to be determined by the interests of their respective countries, which will generally be found opposed to our greatness and to the success of our principles of freedom and confederacy.</p></body></text></p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4947"/>This, I trust, for your sake as well as mine, is now the case.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4948"/>We a all well,&mdash;daughter that was so ill, grandchild, and all,&mdash; and all still living together in <address><street n="Park Street">Park Street</street></address>, after the fashion of the patriarchs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4949"/>But the young folks will soon go away to a new home, which they are now fitting up with all the eagerness of inexperience; and we shall have a heavy miss of them, and a heavier <num value="1">one</num> of the baby, who is now the plaything of the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4950"/>It is, however, all right.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4951"/>But nothing else seems to be so just now. I need not tell you what a hurricane we have had in our commercial and monetary affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4952"/>It has blown somewhat in <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, I think, and even <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> and <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n0231.0020.00405.03524" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName> have not been unconscious of it. But here it has been tremendous . . . . . A great deal has, no doubt, been owing to a mad panic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4953"/>But there have been deep causes at work for years to produce it. The people of this country have been spendthrifts, to a degree that, I think, no people in all its classes ever were before; and as for the great merchants and manufacturers, the bank directors and railroad managers, they have been gamblers,&mdash;gamblers more adventurous than any at the <name>Bourse</name> in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> or in the <rs>Credit Mobilier</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4954"/>We shall, however, get over it, and, I suppose, take nothing by our experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4955"/>The country was never more really prosperous,&mdash;never richer in all that goes to make up national wealth than it is now,&mdash; and as soon as this <hi rend="italics">bourrasque</hi> is over, we shall go to spending, speculating, and gambling, just as if nothing had ever happened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4956"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most curious things about it, and perhaps <num value="1">one</num> of those most worth considering, is the way in which people accept it and submit to it, as if it were the work of an irresistible fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4957"/>Debtors <hi rend="italics">claim</hi>, as if it were a right, an extension of time for paying their notes, and creditors <pb id="p.406" n="406"/> everywhere grant it as a matter of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4958"/>It seems as if we had become used to such catastrophes, and had learnt to take them easy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4959"/>The very bank circulation seems to have grown insensible; for there is hardly a perceptible difference between gold and inconvertible paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4960"/>It was never so before under the same circumstances, and ought not to be so now.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4965"/>You left me, as you say, in the custody of the police.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4966"/>I escaped, on the whole, as well as could be expected, though, no doubt, if my real deserts had been before the court, I might have been more severely dealt with.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4967"/>We had a stormy passage out; but I was glad that we took the <name>Quebec</name> route, for the last <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> <num value="1">one</num> is pretty sure to have smooth water, which is something gained on the passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4968"/>We left <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> all green, and found icicles a yard long on the cliffs of Belleisle. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4969"/>Our banks have held their ground pretty well, but some of our land speculators have suffered, and will continue to suffer, from the pressure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4970"/>I agree with you that the equal value of gold and inconvertible paper at <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> is a strange phenomenon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4971"/>I suppose, however, it marks confidence in the ultimate ability of the issuers to meet all engagements, and it also seems to show that there is none of that irrational fear which tends to the hoarding of specie in less enlightened <pb id="p.407" n="407"/> communities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4972"/>I can easily understand that your suspension of cash payments was welcome on the other side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4973"/>So far as it had any effect, its tendency was to check the export of bullion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4974"/>But I conceive that the consequences will last long after the resumption of specie payments, and will be felt in the pecuniary relations of New York and <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4975"/>The readiness with which such a step can be resorted to will diminish confidence in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4976"/>Nor do I see how the <name>Legislature</name> in New York is to help the banks by legalizing such a course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4977"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="5Section">fifth section</orgName> of the <num value="8" type="ordinal">eighth</num> article of their Constitution is explicit, in depriving the <name>Legislature</name> of the power to authorize a suspension of specie payments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4978"/>(I do not think that in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> you have any such clause, but I am not sure.) This will be a notable example of the difficulty caused by the absence of any living <hi rend="italics">sovereign body</hi>, for the people of the <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">State of New York</placeName> can only speak when called into life for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4979"/>Until they have so spoken, <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="2">two</num> things must be the case,&mdash;either the banks must openly and professedly violate the law, or the <name>Legislature</name> must deliberately set aside the <rs>Constitution</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4980"/>I cannot enter on the slavery question, for I confess I do not see my way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4986"/>His chief trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4987"/>and it is <num value="1">one</num> that he begins to feel already, will be the giving up his habits <pb id="p.408" n="408"/> of exact industry, getting out of those iron grooves in which his life has so long run, and becoming comparatively an idle man. . . . . But he must do it, and he has made up his mind to it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4988"/>Our financial troubles here, of which you speak, have been much like yours in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and have come from the same causes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4989"/>The suffering has been great, and will be long felt; but whether anybody will learn anything by the bitter experience is very doubtful . . . . Our banking system is <num value="1">one</num> cause of our troubles, but by no means the chief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4990"/>The universal extravagance, the spendthrift character of the mass of the people, goes deeper than all their moneyed institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4995"/>The reason is that the old parties are breaking up, and the new ones are not yet sufficiently formed and organized to be intelligible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4996"/>The great contest, as you know, is about <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5109"/>The field for his peculiar labors is new and wide, and he is not only able, from his fine physical nature, to go over a large part of it himself, but he is forming a school which will carry on what he may leave unfinished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5111"/>I gave him at once so much of your letter to me as related to him personally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5287"/><rs type="role" reg="Prince">The Prince</rs>'s visit went off as well as possible . . . . . <num value="2">Two</num> things strike me in the whole affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5288"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is, the deep ground of the cordiality on the part of the masses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5289"/>It is, I believe, that they felt they could show their good-will, without any fear of its being misconstrued into flattery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5290"/>When we were young and weak, our pride made us sensitive, and we were not disposed to such exhibitions of feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5291"/>The ill &mdash; will of the <rs>War</rs> of Independence continued long; continued, indeed, until lately; and there has been a strong sense&mdash;produced by the ignorance and indiscretion of reviews and newspapers&mdash;that we were undervalued by your nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5292"/>But the coming of your <rs type="role2">Prince</rs> among us was a compliment not to be misinterpreted or misunderstood, and showed a confidence in our good feelings, which a people, <pb id="p.428" n="428"/> with much less generosity in their natures than I believe my countrymen to possess, could not fail to accept, in the spirit in which it was offered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5293"/>And they have certainly done it. I have no more doubt of it than I have of any fact in history.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5294"/> 
<p>In answering this letter <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Edmund</foreName></persName> says: <quote>The views which you express with reference to the effect of the <rs>Prince</rs>'s visit are, I believe, quite correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5295"/>I have taken measures for letting the <rs>Queen</rs> see such portions of your letter as bear directly on the benefits likely to accrue to both countries, and I hope you will not think me indiscreet in doing so.. . . .</quote></p></note> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5296"/>The other thing is, that the open cordiality of the people here has rebuked and silenced anything that remained, in newspaper editors and reporters, of the old feelings of ill &mdash; will toward your country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5297"/>I have watched the tone of our papers ever since the <rs>Prince</rs> touched at <placeName reg="Newfoundland" key="tgn,7005807">Newfoundland</placeName>, and have observed how their tone has gradually changed, from occasional touches of ill manners to such as are unexceptionable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5298"/>This is especially true of the old democratic papers; those, I mean, that have always taken sides against <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, from the time of the <rs>French Revolution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5299"/>It is most desirable, and important, that this tone in our newspapers should be kept up, and that it should be met in a similar spirit by yours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5300"/>On this point, both sides have heretofore behaved badly enough, and done more, I suspect, than all other causes, to keep up an ill &mdash; will between the <num value="2">two</num> countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5301"/>Formerly, we were most in fault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5302"/>Latterly,&mdash;allow me to say it,&mdash;you have been most in fault, especially the <q direct="unspecified">Times,</q> the <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Review,,Saturday,,," id="n0231.0021.00428.03690" reg="default:Review,Saturday,,,"><foreName>Saturday</foreName> <surname>Review</surname></persName>,</q> and. the <q direct="unspecified">Quarterly</q>; whose occasional blunders about the most obvious things only vex us the more, that men, so ignorant of what they discuss, should undertake to pass judgment upon our character and doings.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5303"/>Now is the time to change all this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5304"/>We are in the best possible temper for it, and are likely to continue so, if nothing comes from your side to cross and disturb us. . . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5332"/>Nearly all have now come to this persuasion.<note anchored="yes">

<p>The passages omitted consist of amplifications and citations of facts, which seem needless now, and occupy much space.</p></note> . . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5334"/>But property everywhere is the great bond of society; and in our slave-holding States the negroes constitute an extraordinary proportion of the wealth of the people. . . . . This property, which, at the time when the <rs>Constitution</rs> was formed, existed in nearly all the <name>States</name>, we all promised should be secured to the <rs>South</rs> by the return of their fugitive slaves, and without this promise the <rs>Constitution</rs> could not have been formed at all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5335"/>This is the main, <hi rend="italics">substantial</hi> ground of their complaints.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5336"/>But it is not the only or chief ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5338"/>All this, as you at once perceive, is neither legal nor logical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5339"/>The <pb id="p.431" n="431"/> laws they complain of have nowhere prevented the return of their fugitive slaves. . . . . Moreover, they can be in no <hi rend="italics">immediate</hi> danger. . . . . But all this avails nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5340"/>The cry is, that the <rs>South</rs> is <hi rend="italics">in danger</hi>, because the <rs>South</rs> is in the minority, and is weak; and they had better go out of the <rs>Union</rs> before they become weaker and more feeble by the constantly increasing power of the free States. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5341"/>Meanwhile, the very suggestion has thrown the finances of the country into confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5342"/>There was a panic last week, worse in many respects than the formidable <num value="1">one</num> of <dateStruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct> . . . . It was foreseen by nobody, and is a proof not only of the importance of the political questions at issue, but of the peculiar sensitiveness of men in a government which is so purely a matter of opinion, and which has so few traditions and precedents to rest upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5343"/>Where it will end, no man can tell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5345"/>But if we are going to quarrel at home, we have an element in our reckoning that was never there before, and the value and import of which none are wise enough to estimate. . . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5383"/>But there are other things to talk about now. The heather is on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5385"/>Indeed, here at the <rs>North</rs>, at least, there never was anything like it; for if the feeling were as deep and stern in <dateStruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></dateStruct>, it was by no means so intelligent or unanimous; and then the masses to be moved were as a handful compared to our dense population now.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5386"/>The whole people, in fact, has come to a perception that the question is, whether we shall have anarchy or no. The sovereign&mdash;for the people is the only sovereign in this country&mdash;has begun to exercise his sovereign functions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5387"/>Business is substantially suspended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5388"/>Men <pb id="p.434" n="434"/> think, wisely or unwisely, of the state of affairs, and not of much else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5389"/>The whole population, men, women, and children, seem to be in the streets with Union favors and flags; walking about uneasily, because their anxiety and nervous excitement will not permit them to stay at home, where all ordinary occupation has become unsavory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5390"/>Public meetings are held everywhere, in the small towns and villages as much as in the cities; considerable sums of money are voted to sustain the movement and take care of the families of those who are mustered into service; and still larger sums are given by individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5391"/>Nobody holds back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5392"/>Civil war is freely accepted everywhere; by some with alacrity, as the only means of settling a controversy based on long-cherished hatreds; by others as something sent as a judgment from Heaven, like a flood or an earthquake; by all as inevitable, by all as the least of the evils among which we are permitted to choose, anarchy being the obvious, and perhaps the only alternative.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5405"/>We drifted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5406"/>Now the rudder is felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5407"/><placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> must yield, or become a battle-ground over which the opposing forces will roll their floods alternately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5408"/><placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> must open her gates, or the city will be all but razed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5409"/>At least, so far we seem to see ahead.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5410"/>But the people, the sovereign, came to the rescue at the last moment. . . . .

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5550"/>You know how I have always thought and felt about the slavery question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5551"/>I was never an Abolitionist, in the <rs>American</rs> sense of the word, because I never have believed that any form of emancipation that has been proposed could reach the enormous difficulties of the case, and I am of the same mind now. Slavery is too monstrous an evil, as it exists in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, to be reached by the resources of legislation . . . . . I have, therefore, always desired to treat the <rs>South</rs> with the greatest forbearance, not only because the present generation is not responsible for the curse that is laid upon it, but because I have felt that the longer the contest could be postponed, the better for us. I have hoped, too, that in the inevitable conflict with free labor, slavery would go to the wall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5552"/>I remember writing to you in this sense, more than <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> ago, and the results thus far have confirmed the hopes I then entertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5554"/>The free labor of the <rs>North</rs> has made us rich and strong.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5555"/>But all such hopes and thoughts were changed by the violent and unjustifiable secession, a year ago; and, since the firing of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun on <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, we have had, in fact, no choice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5560"/>Our prosperity has entered largely into the prosperity of the world, and especially into that of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5561"/>You feel it to have been so. And some persons have been unwise enough to think that your interference in our domestic quarrel can do good to yourselves, and perhaps to us, by attempting to stop this cruel and wicked war. It is, I conceive, a great mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5562"/>I have believed, since last <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, that <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName> was urging your government to some sort of intervention, &mdash;to break the blockade or to enforce a peace,&mdash;but the general opinion here has been that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> has been the real mover in the matter, thus engendering a bitter hatred of your people, which the unjustifiable tone of your papers and ours increases and exasperates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5563"/>All this is wrong, and so far as you are excited by it to intervention, it is most unhappy and portentous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5564"/>The temptation, no doubt, is strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5815"/>But when I turn to tell you so, and put pen to paper, even in answer to your pleasant letter of last week, I stop and hesitate what I shall say.

But I think I have done exactly what you meant I should do; I have used them in every way I could for the benefit of the <name>Museum</name>, and of your present expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5921"/>Out of them, mainly, I have made <num value="2">two</num> reports, which I suppose will be published this winter, and which I hope you will find substantially right.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5922"/>But this is all. We have all agreed that it was better not to go into the newspapers at present; but rather to leave the account of your doings and their results to come out from higher and more authentic sources, or what will ultimately be best, from yourself. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5923"/>There is, however, <num value="1">one</num> matter about which it seems especially important to write to you now. By your last letter to me, dated <placeName key="tgn,1022014" n="1.000 10" reg="Manaus,Amazonas,Norte,Brasil,South America">Manaos</placeName>, <dateStruct value="-11-23"><day reg="23">23d</day> <month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>, as well as from other letters I have seen, it is apparent that you would like to stay longer in <placeName reg="Brasil, South America, " key="tgn,1000047">Brazil</placeName>; probably another season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5924"/>It does not surprise me. You are, besides many other things higher and better, a collector.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5925"/>You are a <hi rend="italics">passionate collector</hi>. I have seen and known many such, but I never saw <num value="1">one</num> who was satisfied with what he had gathered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5926"/>There is, however, somewhere, a natural and necessary limit to everything human, and it is clearly the part of wisdom to discover betimes where that limit is fixed, lest we should make serious mistakes in what is most important for the ordering of our lives; I mean, if it is in a matter which really concerns our well-being and success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5927"/>At the present moment, and in relation to your present plans, there seem to be <num value="2">two</num> points of this sort, in which you and your friends are alike deeply interested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5928"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> relates to the care and preservation of the specimens you may collect, and which must, most of them, perish or lose their value if not cared for in good season and efficiently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5929"/>Before you went to <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName> there were twice as many specimens in your possession as could be properly arranged in the present building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5930"/>You bade me say so in <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>Reports</name> of the <rs>Committee</rs> on the <name>Museum</name>, and it was said accordingly, and remains now of record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5931"/>Since you left us vast numbers of other specimens have been received, by way of exchange and donation, from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> and all parts of the world; and there seems, from your letters, to be no end to those you are sending from <placeName reg="Brasil, South America, " key="tgn,1000047">Brazil</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5932"/>We do not believe that it will be possible <pb id="p.473" n="473"/> to erect all the buildings and provide all the scientific service, attendance, and materials necessary to protect and maintain in good condition such masses of specimens, and make them intelligible and useful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5933"/>The mill will be stopped from the floods that will be poured upon the machinery through which alone it can be made to move. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5934"/>On the other point I speak wholly from the authority of scientific experts in whom you have confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5935"/>It relates to yourself only, and to your great and noble purposes and objects in life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5936"/>I do not feel that anybody has a right to object to your devoting yourself exclusively to the highest investigations in natural science, postponing to them all labors relating to the mere collection and preservation of the materials for doing so. It is your clear right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5937"/>You have done an immense deal of work of this humbler sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5938"/>The Museum exists by your generous sacrifices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5939"/>You are <hi rend="italics">emeritus</hi>, and it may be your duty, as well as your right, to change in this respect the present course of your life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5940"/>But I do not suppose that such devotion to the very highest purposes of science would be any injury to the <name>Museum</name>, which, on the contrary, you would illustrate and render every year more important and useful by your labors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5941"/>But your collections, as I am assured, are already larger, much larger, than you can submit to such investigations as you intend to make, even if you should live as long as those most attached to you can hope or ask that you should.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5942"/>Indeed, those who best know assure me, that the time you are now giving to the accumulation of specimens&mdash;which may, after all, perish from want of the means needful to protect them&mdash;might, in their judgment, be better employed for your own fame, and for the advancement of such scientific investigations as you can make better than any man alive, and without which these same vast collections might as well remain in their blind kegs, in the dark cellar where they are now hidden away, and so your vast personal labors and disinterested sacrifices, in bringing them together, be mainly lost.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5943"/>It is, I fear, not unlikely, that, surrounded and solicited as you are now by such extraordinary means of readily accumulating what you value more than all gold, and to collecting which you have devoted so much of your life and your great powers, you will feel that I am writing ungraciously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5944"/>But I am sure that I ought to write to you thus freely and frankly, not only from our personal relations and from your most open and kind nature, but because I know that I only send you the earnest convictions of those who most value you, and whom you most value . . . . . <pb id="p.474" n="474"/></p>

At <num value="77">77</num>-<num value="8">8</num> a man does, not what he most likes to do, but what he is able to do; and I am not able to do the half of what I could in a day only a few years ago, nor half as well as then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6071"/>A long time before I came to this conclusion good old <persName n="Jackson,Doctor,,,," id="n0231.0024.00483.04090" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Andrew,,,:1"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, whom you must remember, told me, in <num value="1">one</num> of the last visits he ever made me, that he was reduced to <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6072"/>It seemed to me very strange, but I now find that my time is come, and coming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6073"/>I feel constantly a great weariness, and avoid all the work I can, except reading, of which I have not yet begun to tire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6074"/>I hope it will last me out, especially my love of old books; but I do not know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6075"/>I care little about new ones.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6076"/>During the year past you have been very good to me, and I take much pleasure in acknowledging it. <pb id="p.484" n="484"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6077"/>Your letter about <persName n="Merivale,Mister,Herman,,," id="n0231.0024.00484.04091" reg="default:Merivale,Herman,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Herman</foreName> <surname>Merivale</surname></persName> came before he did, which I think is always an agreeable circumstance in letters of introduction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6078"/>I was very glad to see him again, and liked him better the more I knew of him. He was a good deal with us, and I did for him gladly what I could during the few days he stayed here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6079"/>When you see him, pray give him our kind regards, and ask him to come again.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6080"/>I thank you, too, for a copy of the <num value="13" type="ordinal">thirteenth</num> report of the <rs>Civil Service Commissioners</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6081"/>It is very interesting and curious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6082"/>But I did something better with it than look it carefully over, and learn what I could from it. I put it into the hands of an old friend of mine, <persName n="Thayer,General,,,," id="n0231.0024.00484.04092" reg="nearbymention:Thayer,Sylvanus,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thayer</surname></persName>, who made <placeName reg="West Point, Clay, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057765">West Point</placeName> all that it is, and who, though above <measure n="84years" type="date">eighty-four years</measure> old, and therefore no longer able to make anything else, is doing what he can to have a similar system of examination for office introduced here. . . . . . But though we need this system more than any other country, it will be difficult to establish it among us. Those who have the power are naturally unwilling to give it up, and will make a good fight to keep it. Still, there are so many more that want to have men both of ability and of honesty to do their work for them in public affairs, that I do not despair The copy you sent me of your report on the subject&mdash;going far back, as it does, and giving results&mdash;has done good service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6083"/>No doubt, like any other system, it has its weak side, when it is brought to the test of a wide experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6084"/>The higher offices, I suppose, cannot be reached by it, and for those of less consequence the qualities you can ascertain, by any prearranged system of inquiries, will somewhat restrict the range of your subsequent choice for office, and, therefore, sometimes prevent you from taking the person best fitted for the office you want to fill . . . . . I am told, too, that some persons refuse to submit to examinations for places in <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> and elsewhere, who have yet good qualifications for them, and would seek them under other circumstances, or might be sought for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6085"/>Yet I cannot but think you get a safer class of men, on the whole, even in the <orgName n="Foreign Office" type="office">Foreign Office</orgName>, where I suppose your attaches may claim a regular advancement, which may sometimes lead to awkward results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6086"/>At least, I feel sure that we should in this country do better. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6087"/>I hope you will write to me again before long; and that when you do you will tell me about <persName n="Head,Lady,,,," id="n0231.0024.00484.04093" reg="nearbymention:Head,Edmund,,,"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Head</surname></persName> and her daughters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6088"/>Meantime, if you see them, pray give them our affectionate regards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6089"/>We think of them and speak of them often.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6105"/>my dear <persName n="Trevelyan,,,,," id="n0231.0024.00485.04105" reg="nearbymention:Trevelyan,Walter,C.,,"><surname>Trevelyan</surname></persName>,&mdash;My silence is not forgetfulness, neither is it ingratitude; it is simply old age. I am past <num value="78">seventy-eight</num>, and, like nearly everybody of that age, I do, not what I like best to do, but what I can. I cannot walk much, and I forget a great deal, and I write as little as I can. Reading is my great resource, and I have lately been much amused with <persName n="Robinson,,Crabbe,,," id="n0231.0024.00485.04106" reg="default:Robinson,Crabbe,,,"><foreName>Crabbe</foreName> <surname>Robinson</surname></persName>, who is a model for old men, as far as their strength holds out. But your letter to me, <pb id="p.486" n="486"/> written above a year ago, full of kindness and interesting facts, was as welcome to me as ever, and so was the remarkable <q direct="unspecified">Canterbury Report,</q> with its marvellously condensed appendix, which came a few days ago. On both I must say a word, for I think, even from your letter, that you like to hear talk on the suppression of intemperance better than on almost anything else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6106"/>Indeed, it has long been a main object with you in life,&mdash;certainly a most worthy <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6107"/>And, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, you seem in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> to have got hold of a better and more effective mode of contending against this monstrous evil than we have in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> and <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName>; for you come, as nearly as you can, to the voluntary principle, which seems needful in all virtue, and, perhaps, in all real and satisfactory reform in manners and morals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6108"/>But when union of efforts is necessary, as it is in this case, the smaller each union is, in moderate numbers,&mdash;if the aggregate of all the unions is numerous enough,&mdash;the more likely is the main general purpose to be carried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6109"/>The most formidable political combination of our times was, I suppose, the <q direct="unspecified">Tugend-Bund</q> of <dateStruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></dateStruct>, etc., because it consisted of an immense number of small societies, scattered all over <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 6" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>, but little connected with each other except by their <num value="1">one</num> great object, and really knowing little about each other's operations and mode of proceeding.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6110"/>Now, if I understand the matter, you have in the <name>Province</name> of <placeName reg="Canterbury, Kent, England" key="tgn,7012044">Canterbury</placeName>,&mdash;embracing, to be sure, a large part of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>,&mdash;above a <num value="1000">thousand</num> parishes, hamlets, etc., where money will not buy the means of intoxication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6111"/>It is a great thing, and it has been brought about without legislation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6112"/>On the other hand, <hi rend="italics">we</hi> are attempting to compel the whole <num value="1000000">million</num> and more of our people in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, by the most stringent legislation, to do the same thing,&mdash;i. e. to stop the sale of all intoxicating liquors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6113"/>But no people, and especially no people living under such free institutions as ours, can thus be driven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6114"/>It is a moderate statement to say, that in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> the <q direct="unspecified">Liquor Law,</q> as it is called, is broken a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> times a day. <placeName key="tgn,7013445" n="1.000 1" reg="boston, suffolk, massachusetts">In Boston</placeName>, I think any man can get what he wants, from a pipe of wine to a glass of beer, whenever he likes, and as often as he likes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6115"/>Now this is a bad thing for the law, the courts, and the police generally; and it is the worse because a sort of moral foundation is claimed for disregarding such a law,&mdash;I mean, because it is claimed that it makes only <num value="1">one</num> party an offender, when both parties are; since, if I buy a bottle of wine, I tempt the seller to do wrong for gain, and so become a party to the offence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6118"/>What you have sent me from time to time proves it. I only wish you would tell me what you think of our <hi rend="italics">modus operandi</hi>, as compared with yours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6119"/>If anything is published here that I think you will like to see, and are not likely to get as soon as you will care to have it, I will send it to you at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6120"/>This is very possible, nowadays, for the liquor question is getting mixed up with our general politics, which it never ought to be, any more than a question in religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6121"/>But such things can rarely be avoided in so free institutions as ours,--perhaps not in yours . . . .</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6122"/>What you tell me of <persName n="Champagne,,Thiebaut,,,de" id="n0231.0024.00487.04107" reg="expanded:Champagne,Thiebaut,,,"><foreName>Thiebaut</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Champagne</surname></persName> is very curious, and much of it new.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6123"/>But I never heard before the tradition that he brought home with him from <placeName key="tgn,1000004" n="1.000 23" reg="asia">Palestine</placeName> the <q direct="unspecified">Provence Rose,</q> which we cultivate here in a country <persName><foreName>Thiebaut</foreName></persName> never dreamt of; nor did I ever suppose that there were such remains of the ancient splendor of <persName n="Provence,,,,," id="n0231.0024.00487.04108" reg="mostcommon:Provence,nomatch:0"><surname>Provence</surname></persName> as you describe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6124"/>Please to tell me, therefore, when you write,&mdash;and I hope that, remembering my age, you will write before long,&mdash;please to give me the titles of anything published within the last <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> about the old <rs>Chansonnier</rs>, if it will give you no trouble to do it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6126"/>It is very curious, as are many books of our genealogies, tracing the connection between our <num value="2">two</num> countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6127"/>I only wish there were more proofs of such connection down to our own times, and that they were heartier. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6128"/>But I think I have written as much as my strength will fairly enable me to write at <num value="1">one</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6129"/>I will not, therefore, go on even to say a word, as I meant to, about the <name>Oxford</name> and Harvard Race, except to add, that we are surprised at the immense interest it excited; and that we can hardly hope, if your young men come here next year, as I hope they will, that we can receive them with equal fervor.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6222"/>And so gently ended a long life which had been filled to the brim with intellectual activity, and with labors useful to the mental life of his time, and to the young and the poor around him. He died without suffering or long decay; and, like his father, he was ready to go; like him, when he came to his deathbed, there was nothing disturbing his mind, <q direct="unspecified">he had nothing to do but to die.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6223"/></p> 
<p>Looking back over this long life, we see an unusual consistency in the framework of mind and character from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; an unusually steady development of certain elements and principles; the whole structure growing with a symmetry to which the freedom from external impediments contributed much, no doubt, but which was mainly due to a well-directed and very vigorous individual will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6224"/>Where this is the case, it is difficult to analyze and describe the combination of qualities we see, and yet avoid too much eulogy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6225"/>Taking up the consideration of <persName n="Ticknor,Mister,,,," id="n0231.0025.00494.04156" reg="nearbymention:Ticknor,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ticknor</surname></persName>'s character at the period of his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> return from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, we cannot help perceiving the danger there was of his being isolated from his fellowcitizens by the culture he had gained through twofold means; <pb id="p.495" n="495"/> through his brilliant experience in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> society, and his untiring use of that and of all his other opportunities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6226"/>It is quite certain, however, that his attractive qualities, with his sincere desire to be useful to the community, saved him from this peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6227"/>He had earnestness and zeal, entire purity, consciousness of high intentions, and a resolute will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6228"/>His love of truth and right being so often shocked, his hatred of baseness or corruption, and distrust of fanatics and demagogues, so often roused,&mdash;these very virtues sometimes gave him an appearance of intolerance and loftiness; but the impression passed away, if the person receiving it had any further opportunity of testing <persName n="Ticknor,Mister,,,," id="n0231.0025.00495.04157" reg="nearbymention:Ticknor,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ticknor</surname></persName>'s character and bearing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6229"/>His special mental gifts, a quick apprehension and a retentive memory, were both remarkable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6230"/>These were, as they generally are, accompanied by a thirst for acquisition, which his parents had naturally developed in the direction of literary culture, since they possessed it in some measure themselves, and were accustomed to stimulate it in others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6231"/>We can see, too, indirectly, in his early letter, describing <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Jeffrey</foreName></persName>'s visit to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, what was the tone of conversation and manners&mdash;somewhat measured and formal, but full of thought and real courtesy&mdash;that prevailed in the then small town where he was born, and that tended to develop the qualities and resources most prized in his own early home.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6232"/>But his later development was greatly due to moral qualities acting on and directing his intellect; for in him a healthy and manly nature was trained, even in the atmosphere of an indulgent home, to self-control, industry, and the highest respect for truth in every form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6233"/>These <num value="3">three</num> elements, joined to his <num value="2">two</num> special mental gifts, made him a scholar, earnest, exact, disinterested, and faithful; and a gentleman whose good-breeding and most winning manners caused him, from the early period of his youth when he <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> passed the borders of his native <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, to be welcomed in refined society everywhere.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6234"/>To his moral qualities it was due that he continued always in an attitude of inquiry, always craving more, and more exact knowledge, and that he held himself, until he was <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> <pb id="p.496" n="496"/> years old, in a process of education such as most youths are apt to consider unnecessary after <num value="20">twenty</num> or <num value="21">twenty-one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6235"/>When he was young, the best plea it seemed possible to make before the bar of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> for the intellect of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> was, that the raw material was abundant, but the appliances for education so imperfect that originality had no chance of obtaining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6236"/>justice, for want of scholarship to place it well before the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6237"/><persName n="Ticknor,Mister,,,," id="n0231.0025.00496.04158" reg="nearbymention:Ticknor,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ticknor</surname></persName> felt this want; but before he sought to supply it abroad he had proved, that, when the eager thirst was accompanied by certain moral attributes, attainments were possible, even here, sufficient to place their possessor in full communion with the more fortunate inhabitants of countries which offered every means of mental training.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6238"/>No better discipline of mind could have been secured, in the most famous schools and universities, than was attained by him with the defective means and amidst the simple customs of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> at the beginning of this century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6239"/>No better foundation for success of the highest kind could have been laid than that which, when he was a boy, made self-mastery, integrity, and love of work the essentials of his daily life as much as the air he breathed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6240"/>No better foundation than this <hi rend="italics">can</hi> be laid for such continual progress in thought, as is the product of knowledge stored and methodized, and of moral purpose always rising as the knowledge advances.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6241"/>To his moral qualities, again, was due his paramount and obvious purpose of making his knowledge, his experience, and his thought of use to others, especially to the young, and of placing all his powers at the service of his fellow-men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6242"/>The great vivacity and earnestness of his nature could not, with all his self-mastery, be always restrained from too great vehemence and pertinacity in discussion, but irritation was rarely made obvious in words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6243"/>His disinterested aims were cherished; his natural cheerfulness he cultivated as a part of the requirements of manliness and kindness, and of religion; therefore, though he was often disposed to be anxious, and to exercise great caution in the affairs of daily life, he was never depressed or discontented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6244"/>When inevitable trouble or annoyance came, <pb id="p.497" n="497"/> in large matters or small, he held his peace; and the habit of finding grievances, or of hiding the real blessings of life behind imaginary ills, was far from his disposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6245"/>There was nothing affected or artificial about him, for his whole nature was too strong and sincere, even if his life-long consideration for others had not checked such weakness; and there was no eccentricity in his ways.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6246"/>It was characteristic of his wise self-knowledge and resolute will, that, having, like many other men, formed the opinion that it is judicious to retire from responsibilities and duties before the judgment is weakened by age, unlike most other men, he acted on this opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6247"/><num value="4">Four</num> or <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> before his death he resigned all responsibilities and trusts, even giving the charge of his property, at last, to his son-in-law, and employing his daughter in small matters of business, by which she gained instruction, but of which he must have been reluctant to abandon even the practical charge.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6248"/>Thus, at all periods, we see the vigorous will and the vigorous intellect moulding each other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6249"/>These volumes consist so much of the writings of him who is their subject, that his opinions and qualities are, perhaps, as fairly shown as they were even in intimate intercourse, and, uniting these more personal and private compositions with his published works, his intellectual gifts are made apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6250"/>That he appreciated wit and imagination, without possessing them in large measure, and that his taste in the <rs>Fine Arts</rs> was that of a healthy, quick intelligence, carefully trained by observation, rather than a spontaneous instinct, will be seen without disparagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6251"/>As a student of character, he was vigilant, thoughtful, and kindly, his recorded judgments of persons being very rarely pointed by a severe remark of any sort; or, if any severity is found in his letters and journals, it is sure to rest on some moral ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6252"/>He was not disposed to be satirical, though he was sometimes stern, and his principle was always to weigh his judgments carefully and to be just.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6253"/>If, however, he had noted a fact in the career or the character of a man which distinctly indicated a moral want in his nature, he never forgot it. <pb id="p.498" n="498"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6254"/>The welcome he received, before he attained his majority, among the clever men of his own community,&mdash;lawyers, preachers, and merchants who had seen the world; <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n0231.0025.00498.04159" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>'s approbation of him as a representative of American youth, shown by his voluntary offer of letters of introduction for <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>; <persName n="Stael,Madame,,,,de" id="n0231.0025.00498.04160" reg="mostcommon:Stael,Auguste,,,:3"><roleName n="Madame">Madame</roleName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Stael</surname></persName>'s determination, after her children had seen him enough to describe him to her, that she would see him whether her physicians gave permission or not,&mdash;are but the early signs of the attraction and resources he bore about him. His early experience of society in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> and <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> was calculated to ingraft on the somewhat grave and formal courtesy of his home circle more promptitude and presence of mind in conversation, and to introduce the same element into the expression of that deference and politeness which are the unselfish essence of high breeding.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6255"/>At the end of his life his name was widely known, and his character and intellect were respected wherever in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> and <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> they were familiar, and, after its close, tokens of this were abundantly given in public and private channels.
