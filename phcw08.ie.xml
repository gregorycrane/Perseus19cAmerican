<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>It is quite astonishing to discover that the immense collection of photographs reflecting the <q direct="unspecified">soldier life</q> of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">65</year></dateStruct> so intimately and vividly had its rise in secret-service work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>It is literally true, however, that <persName n="Gardner,,Alexander,,," id="n0113.0001.00014.00002" reg="default:Gardner,Alexander,,,"><foreName>Alexander</foreName> <surname>Gardner</surname></persName>'s privileges of photographing at headquarters and within the <rs>Federal</rs> lines, at a <num value="1000">thousand</num> historic spots and moments, resulted entirely from the desire of the authorities to insure the strictest secrecy for their movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Obviously, any commander was pretty much at the mercy of the individual who copied the maps, charts, and the like for his <persName n="Service,,Secret,,," id="n0113.0001.00014.00003" reg="default:Service,Secret,,,"><foreName>Secret</foreName> <surname>Service</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Through an untrustworthy or careless employee the most zealously guarded secrets of contemplated destinations or routes might reach the adversary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>The work of preparing these maps, therefore, was confided to <persName n="Gardner,,Alexander,,," id="n0113.0001.00014.00004" reg="default:Gardner,Alexander,,,"><foreName>Alexander</foreName> <surname>Gardner</surname></persName>, the brilliant Scotchman <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> brought to <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> and instructed in the photographic art by <persName n="Brady,,,,," id="n0113.0001.00015.00005" reg="nearbymention:Brady,Matthew,B.,,"><surname>Brady</surname></persName> himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>He proved so trustworthy that he was permitted in his spare time to indulge his hobby of photographing the soldiers themselves&mdash;a useless hobby it seemed then, since there was no way of reproducing the pictures direct on the printed page.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>But <persName n="Gardner,,,,," id="n0113.0001.00015.00006" reg="nearbymention:Gardner,Alexander,,,"><surname>Gardner</surname></persName>, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and last an artist, worked so patiently and indefatigably that, before the campaign was over, he had secured <num value="1000">thousands</num> of outdoor views which, with the many that <persName n="Brady,,,,," id="n0113.0001.00015.00007" reg="nearbymention:Brady,Matthew,B.,,"><surname>Brady</surname></persName> took in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> and part of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, and later in the path of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0113.0001.00015.00008" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,:3"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s final campaign from the <rs>Wilderness</rs> to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, form the nucleus of the collection presented herewith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Needless to say, <persName n="Gardner,,,,," id="n0113.0001.00015.00009" reg="nearbymention:Gardner,Alexander,,,"><surname>Gardner</surname></persName> did not break faith with his employers or pass any of these photographs to Southern sympathizers, or through the <rs>Confederate</rs> lines.</p></figure> <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> <note anchored="yes" place="inset">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Be that as it may, there is no doubt that from the very dawn of the war until its lurid and dramatic close, the <rs>Southern</rs> leaders had infinitely the advantage in the matter of information.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>it was more than difficult for the <rs>Union</rs> generals to obtain reliable information as to the strength and position of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The Southern people were practically united, devoted to their cause and all that it comprised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The only inhabitants, as a rule, who would furnish information were deserters or else the so-called <q direct="unspecified">intelligent contrabands,</q> whose reports were in many cases utterly untrustworthy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Therefore it became necessary for these men of indomitable courage to brave the halter in order to obtain information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>During the campaign of the army in front of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, they proved of incalculable value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>If captured, he could drop this paper, apparently by accident, without exciting suspicion; and if successful in his expedition, the pass, after a moment's exposure to the heat, enabled the bearer to re-enter his own lines and proceed without delay to headquarters.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It followed that the <rs>South</rs> often knew pretty much everything worth knowing of the disposition and preparations of the <rs>Union</rs> forces&mdash;often, indeed, of their carefully guarded plans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It followed that, on the other hand, the <rs>Northern</rs> generals had as often to guess at the opposing conditions, since so very much of the information paid for proved utterly worthless.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>Nor was the <rs>Confederate</rs> good humor merely of the moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>Throughout the war, the men in gray overcame their hardships by a grim gaiety that broke out on the least provocation&mdash;at times with none at all as when, marching to their armpits in icy water, for lack of bridges they invented the term <q direct="unspecified">Confederate pontoons</q> in derision of the <rs>Federal</rs> engineering apparatus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>The general aspect of the <rs>Confederate</rs> camps compared unfavorably with those of the men in blue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>They were not, as a rule, attractive in appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>The tents and Camp equipage were nothing like so <q direct="unspecified">smart,</q> so spick and span&mdash;very far from it, indeed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>Our <orgName n="Engineer Corps" type="corps">engineer corps</orgName> were far inferior, lacking in proper tools and equipment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>The sappers and miners of the <rs>Federal</rs> army on <placeName key="tgn,2230256" n="1.000 81" reg="cemetery hill, adams, pennsylvania">Cemetery Hill</placeName>, at <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, did rapid and effective work during the night following the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day's battle, as they had previously done at <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>&mdash;work which our men could not begin to match.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>Spades and axes were luxuries at such times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>Bands of music were rare, and generally of inferior quality; but the men made up for it as far as they could by a gay <hi rend="italics">insouciance</hi>, and by singing in Camp and on the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>I have seen the men of the <orgName type="regiment" key="1MDInfantry">First Maryland Infantry</orgName> trudging wearily through mud and rain, sadly bedraggled by a long march, strike up with great gusto their favorite song, <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Gay,,,,," id="n0113.0006.00122.00395" reg="mostcommon:Gay,nomatch:0"><surname>Gay</surname></persName> and Happy.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>The contrast between the sentiment of the song and the environment of the column was sufficiently striking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>In <num value="1">one</num> respect, I think, our camps had the advantage of the <rs>Union</rs> camps&mdash;we had no sutlers, and we had no camp-followers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>But though our Camp equipage and equipment were so inferior to those of our antagonists, I do not think any experienced soldier, watching our marching columns of infantry or cavalry, or witnessing our brigade drills, could fail to be <pb id="p.123" n="123"/> <figure id="fig.123">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>A conspicuous feature of the <rs>Southern</rs> army was its Americanism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>In every camp, among the infantry, the cavalry and the artillery, the men were, with few exceptions, <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0113.0006.00123.00396" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>In spite of deprivations, the men were light-hearted; given a few days' rest and feeding, they abounded in fun and jocularity and were noted for indulgence in a species of rough humor which found suggestion in the most trivial incidents, and was often present in the midst of the most tragical circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>In so representative a body the type varied almost as did the individual; the home sentiment, however, pervaded the mass and was the inspiration of its patriotism&mdash;sectional, provincial, call it what you will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>This was true even in the ranks of those knighterrants from beyond the border: Missourians, <persName><foreName>Kentuckians</foreName></persName>, Marylanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>The last were name worthy sons of the sires who had rendered the old <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Maryland Line, Baltimore, Maryland" key="tgn,2047886">Maryland Line</placeName></q> of the <name>Revolution</name> of <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct> illustrious, and, looking toward their homes with the foe arrayed between as a barrier, they always cherished the hope of some day reclaiming those homes&mdash;when the war should be over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>To many of them the war was over long before <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName>&mdash;when those who had <q direct="unspecified">struck the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blow in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName></q> also delivered <q direct="unspecified">the last in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>Here at least, there was no inferiority to the army in blue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>The soldierly qualities that tell on the march, and on the field of battle, shone out here conspicuously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>A more impressive spectacle has seldom been seen in any war than was presented by <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Jeb,,,,," id="n0113.0006.00124.00398" reg="mostcommon:Jeb,nomatch:0"><surname>Jeb</surname></persName></q> <orgName n="brigades"><persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0113.0006.00124.00399" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,:2"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>'s brigades</orgName> of cavalry when they passed in review before <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0113.0006.00124.00400" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Brandy Station, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2110767">Brandy Station</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1863-06-"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>The pomp and pageantry of gorgeous uniforms and dazzling equipment of horse and riders were indeed absent; but splendid horsemanship, and that superb <hi rend="italics">esprit de corps</hi> that marks the veteran legion, and which, though not a tangible or a visible thing, yet stamps itself upon a marching column-these were unmistakably here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>And I take leave to express my own individual opinion that the blue-gray coat of the <orgName n="Confederate Officer" type="org">Confederate officer</orgName>, richly adorned with gold lace, and his light-blue trousers, and that rakish slouchhat he wore made up a uniform of great beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>Oh, it was a gallant array to look upon&mdash;that <dateStruct><month>June</month></dateStruct> day, so many years ago!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>When our infantry soldiers came to a river, unless it was a deep <num value="1">one</num>, we had to cross it on <q direct="unspecified">Confederate pontoons,</q> i. e., by marching right through in column of fours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>Among the amusements in camp, card-playing was of course included; <num value="7">seven</num>--up and vingt-et-un, I believe, were popular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>His tobacco, at any rate, was the real thing&mdash;genuine, no makebelieve, like his coffee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>Often there were large gatherings of the men, night after night, attending prayer-meetings, always with preaching added, for there was a strong religious tone in the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>. <num value="1">One</num> or <num value="2">two</num> remarkable revivals took place, notably in the winter of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">64</year></dateStruct>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>It was a characteristic of the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldier&mdash;I do not say he alone possessed it&mdash;that he never considered himself discharged of his duty to the colors by any wound, however serious, so long as he could walk, on crutches or otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1240"/>We are coming to the period in this narration when we might fairly claim to have been soldiers indeed; when the disjointed fragments had at last been welded together into an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1258"/>Usually we knew there must be trouble ahead, but not always how imminent it might be.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1259"/>Perhaps the pace may have been rather more hurried than usual for some miles, and a halt, for any reason, was most welcome to the footsore troops, who promptly proceeded to profit by every minute of it&mdash;lying down on the dusty grass by the roadside, easing knapsack straps and belts, and perhaps snatching the opportunity for a short smoke (for which there had been no breath to spare previously) or for a moistening of parched throats from the canteen.</p>
