<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/><emph>T</emph>HE study of the records of our ancestors is an attractive pursuit to all, and particularly so to the historical student and to the genealogist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>The value of musty records is more appreciated each year; the carelessness and lack of completeness with which most of them were kept and the loss of many through fire and improper care is to be greatly regretted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>It has been frequently stated, in fact is a sort of tradition, that the earliest records of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 6" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> were destroyed by fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>I never heard it said when or where it happened, but many have accepted this statement as a fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>How or when the story originated I do not know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/><persName n="Brooks,,,,," id="n0334.0004.00020.00328" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Samuel,,,"><surname>Brooks</surname></persName>, in his <hi rend="italics">History of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 6" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName></hi>, states that <q direct="unspecified">the records of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> are lost,</q> and again that <q direct="unspecified">the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="25">twenty-five</num> or <num value="30">thirty</num> pages of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> book of records are unfortunately lost, probably from carelessness about loose and decayed sheets.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>These words are reiterated by <persName n="Usher,,,,," id="n0334.0004.00020.00329" reg="nearbymention:Usher,LTHOUGH,,,"><surname>Usher</surname></persName> in his later work, evidently taking it for granted that this was true without making any study or consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>While I have the greatest respect for <persName n="Brooks,Reverend,Charles,,," id="n0334.0004.00020.00330" reg="default:Brooks,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev.</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName>, whom I remember so well as <num value="1">one</num> of the <orgName n="School Committee" type="committee">school committee</orgName> in my youthful days, whom every <num value="1">one</num> delighted to honor, and who ever had a pleasant word and kindly greeting for all, I feel, to use his own words in reference to a claim made by another historian in a matter relative to <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 6" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>, that I must good-naturedly dissent from this statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>I think that an examination of the oldest book of records of our town will convince anyone that it is substantially complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>It is possible that a leaf <hi rend="italics">may</hi> have gone astray, but I doubt it very much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/><persName n="Brooks,,,,," id="n0334.0004.00020.00331" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Charles,,,"><surname>Brooks</surname></persName> says, after he speaks of the loss of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="25">twenty-five</num> or <num value="30">thirty</num> pages, that <q direct="unspecified">the next <num value="30">thirty</num> pages are broken out of their places and may be soon lost.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>When I became city clerk, nearly <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> after this <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> was written, I found this volume in the same condition as described by him, but <hi rend="italics">not a leaf missing that was there when he wrote about it</hi>. No <hi rend="italics">particular</hi> care had apparently been taken to preserve it; but realizing its value and the possibility of its loss or destruction in whole or in part, I took early opportunity to have it permanently preserved by being rebound by what is known as the <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Emery,,,,," id="n0334.0004.00021.00332" reg="mostcommon:Emery,W.,H.,,:1"><surname>Emery</surname></persName> process,</q> retaining the old parchment covers and the leather thongs originally fastening the book together, thus placing it beyond destruction or wear by any examination or use. Nearly half a century had gone by with the volume in this most dilapidated condition and yet no harm had come to it, although probably examined hundreds of times during that period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>This book contains the town records from the year <dateStruct value="1674--"><year reg="1674">1674</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1718--"><year reg="1718">1718</year></dateStruct>; the next volume covers the succeeding years to <dateStruct value="1735--"><year reg="1735">1735</year></dateStruct>; the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, from this date to <dateStruct value="1781--"><year reg="1781">1781</year></dateStruct>; and the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>, from <dateStruct value="1781--"><year reg="1781">1781</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>These books are all in good condition, and with the succeeding ones up to the present time are all completely indexed, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="3">three</num> volumes copied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>I have been waiting for means to be provided to have the contents printed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>There is also a card index containing a reference to each and every name and every place it appears in the books, which means <num value="1000">thousands</num> of references, as these volumes contain all the tax lists for over an <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure>. This work of copying and indexing has been in charge of <num value="1">one</num> whom I consider the best qualified to do the same of any person that could be obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>At this time it may be interesting to quote a statement made by <num value="1">one</num> who was employed by a neighboring town to copy some of its old records.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>He says: <q direct="unspecified">In justice to myself I could not copy such bad spelling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>I have, therefore, corrected throughout the bad spelling of those old records, and have given the words in the current, modern, true orthography, as justified by the standard authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>Whereas the language was incoherent, indefinite, and bungling; where bad grammar was used; where the style was deplorably <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> bad, and where the true meaning was evidently not given, I have not hesitated to amend expressions, so far, at least, as to make it correct, intelligible, and decent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>I have in many instances abridged the record but never changing the sense, but expressing it by a more concise and transparent phraseology.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>The copying done by the clerk in my office was not carried out on this plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>Every letter and mark appears in the copy exactly as in the original.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>Tonight I propose to confine my remarks to the <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num></hi> volume and its contents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>In size it is <measure n="15inches" type="distance">fifteen inches</measure> long, <measure n="6inches" type="distance">six inches</measure> wide, and about an inch thick, or rather was, before being repaired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>There are <num value="256">two hundred and fifty-six</num> pages of town records, tax rates, etc., and the back part of the book contains <num value="21">twenty-one</num> pages, mostly of entries of births, marriages, and deaths, but in which is occasionally mixed other matters, including a warrant for the collection of rates, some action of the town in regard to <persName n="Woodbridge,Reverend,Benjamin,,," id="n0334.0004.00022.00333" reg="default:Woodbridge,Benjamin,,,"><roleName n="Reverend">Rev.</roleName> <foreName>Benjamin</foreName> <surname>Woodbridge</surname></persName>'s salary, which was a cause of dissension for many years, and a record of the reimbursement of certain persons for powder furnished, etc. At the beginning is what was apparently the <q direct="unspecified">fly-leaf,</q> on which is the record of an action in regard to <q direct="unspecified">procuring &amp; main-taineing of a publique town stock of ammunition,</q> under date of <dateStruct value="1678-06-14"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="14">14</day>, <year reg="1678">1678</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>This is in the handwriting of <persName n="Wade,,Jonathan,,," id="n0334.0004.00022.00334" reg="default:Wade,Jonathan,,,"><foreName>Jonathan</foreName> <surname>Wade</surname></persName>, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> town clerk, but an entry on the other side of the leaf, of a few lines, and which is indefinite in its nature, dated <dateStruct value="-02-2"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg="2">2</day></dateStruct>, <num value=".9882">84/85</num>, is in the handwriting of <persName n="Willis,,Stephen,,," id="n0334.0004.00022.00335" reg="default:Willis,Stephen,,,"><foreName>Stephen</foreName> <surname>Willis</surname></persName>, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> town clerk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>Both of these were probably made on this leaf on account of their being accidentally omitted in their proper chronological order.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>From this reason, and from the primitive manner in which the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> entries are made, the small amount recorded, (the page following what I have referred to as the fly-leaf, and which I believe to be the original <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> page of the volume, being sufficient to contain all that was recorded for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, <dateStruct value="1674--"><year reg="1674">1674</year></dateStruct>, <dateStruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></dateStruct>, and <dateStruct value="1676--"><year reg="1676">1676</year></dateStruct>), I <pb id="p.23" n="23"/> am convinced that this was a new and untried work, and that this is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> book of records.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>I do not wish to be an iconoclast, and have a great respect for old stories, but until stronger evidence is produced of there being previous official records than I am now aware of I shall believe that we possess all that were ever kept, tradition to the contrary notwithstanding, and that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volume is <hi rend="italics">complete</hi>, regardless of the statements of <persName n="Brooks,,,,," id="n0334.0004.00023.00336" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Charles,,,"><surname>Brooks</surname></persName> and <persName n="Usher,,,,," id="n0334.0004.00023.00337" reg="nearbymention:Usher,LTHOUGH,,,"><surname>Usher</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>There may possibly have been accounts of a <hi rend="italics">private</hi> nature, before the date of our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> book, made out for those who owned so much of the territory of what was then <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 6" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> and transmitted to them, but if so, such were not considered to be for public use. The ink used in writing this volume was of a permanent nature, very different from much of that which is used at the present time, and the entries of <measure n="230years" type="date">two hundred and thirty years</measure> ago are as fresh and readable as when written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>What I have spoken of as the original <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> page begins as follows:&mdash;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/><q direct="unspecified">The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> monday of [february in] the yeare of our <rs type="role2">Lord</rs> <dateStruct value="1674--"><year reg="1674">1674</year></dateStruct> at a meeting of the <name>Jnhabitants</name> of meadford <persName n="Nathanaell,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0004.00023.00338" reg="mostcommon:Nathanaell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">mr</roleName> <surname>Nathanaell</surname></persName> wade was chosen Constable for the y[eare] ensuing,</q> and then follows <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> lines relative to sheep being at large during certain months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>A large part of the early legislation consisted of votes on restraining the cattle, ringing and yoking of swine, keeping a supply of powder, and the election of the few officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Choosing a constable seems to have been <num value="1">one</num> of the most important duties, and a fine was provided for such as were elected to this position who refused to serve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The election of a tithing man was an annual duty, and this office seems to have been subject to more changes than almost any other&mdash;perhaps, from the <num value="1">one</num> who filled it having succeeded in getting the ill will of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/><placeName reg="Johns Hopkins">Johns Hopkins</placeName> tells us that the tithing man was <q direct="unspecified">a kind of Sunday Constable whose special duty it was, in the old parish meeting-house, to quiet the restlessness of youth and to disturb the slumbers of age.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/><pb id="p.24" n="24"/> We can well imagine that the raps and pokes of the wand carried by this official might raise personal prejudices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>On <dateStruct value="1682-02-12"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg="12">12</day>, <year reg="1682">1682</year></dateStruct>-<num value="3">3</num> <q direct="unspecified">it was agreed upon, that all generall meetings for the time to come shall be att <num value="8">eight</num> of the clock in the morning &amp; whossoeuer shall faill shall pay a fine of fix pence pr hour &amp; if absent the whole meeting <measure n="2s." type="currency"><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Evidently it was as difficult a work to get out the voters then as it is found to be in more recent times, but the measures taken to accomplish the object were of a different nature; possibly at the present time a fine for absence instead of the methods used might have an effect on the size of the vote cast.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>It is to be noticed that in the petition as above presented the word <q direct="unspecified">town</q> is used for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in the records; although not calling <persName n="Medford,,,,," id="n0334.0004.00024.00340" reg="mostcommon:Medford,nomatch:0"><surname>Medford</surname></persName> directly a <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">town</hi>,</q> by inference it does so, as it asks for the power and privileges as other towns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>The <orgName n="General Court" type="misc">General Court</orgName> did not declare <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 6" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> to be a <q direct="unspecified">peculiar <hi rend="italics">town</hi>,</q> but a <q direct="unspecified">peculiar.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>The reason of this is obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>The word <q direct="unspecified">peculiar</q> in Colonial and provincial <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> meant a parish, precinct or district not yet erected into a town, but having authority to act on all, or most matters of local administration, but not in choosing a representative to the <orgName n="General Court" type="misc">General Court</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Although taxes had been assessed, legislation had been enacted at various times, and the settlement had been recognized in <num value="1">one</num> way or another since <dateStruct value="1630--"><year reg="1630">1630</year></dateStruct>, the rights of the place were still incomplete, and it had no representative in the <rs>Provincial Government</rs> for several years after this declaration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>All of these facts are evidence toward bearing out the statement relative to our records being intact, and that no public ones had been kept previous to those we now have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>There are several errors in other of <persName n="Brooks,,,,," id="n0334.0004.00025.00344" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Charles,,,"><surname>Brooks</surname></persName>' extracts of the records, which become evident on examination, but I shall not go into this feature in detail.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>This, of course, as you will recognize, was an action to put into effect the <q direct="unspecified">warning out</q> law, and this method of procedure was continued for an <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure>, many of those who, with their descendants, afterwards became our best citizens, having been subjected to this warning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>All who were residents, and received into their families so-called strangers, were obliged to notify the selectmen at once of the fact, that such action as might be deemed advisable could be taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> procedure of the selectmen, under this vote, was on <dateStruct value="1685-04-01"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="1">1</day>, <year reg="1685">1685</year></dateStruct>, when <num value="1">one</num> <persName n="Burgess,,William,,," id="n0334.0004.00025.00345" reg="default:Burgess,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Burgess</surname></persName> and <pb id="p.26" n="26"/> his family, from <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, were protested against as becoming legal inhabitants of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 6" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>, and warned to be gone, which was filed and entered at the <rs type="place">County Court</rs> in <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>.
