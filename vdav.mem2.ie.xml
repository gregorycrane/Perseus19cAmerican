<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>The task of relating my husband's life in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is approached with anxious diffidence, but it must be fairly set forth for his justification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>I am unwilling needlessly to antagonize any part of the country, but love my own with devotion proportionate to the great sacrifices made in its behalf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>The memories of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, its triumphs, its decadence, and fall, are proud, and very bitter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>If in dwelling upon the splendid gallantry of our soldiers, the cheerful endurance and unwonted labor of all classes of our women, or the barbarities practised upon us, both before and after the subjugation of our country, I speak plainly, it is because my memory furnishes data which the deliberate judgment of my old age does not contradict, and the anguish is a living pain which years have done little to soothe, and from which the <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> desire for recrimination, or even for revenge, is totally absent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most patriotic, humane, and benevolent of men has been portrayed as a monster of ambition and cruelty, and the mistaken policy of silence under these accusations has fixed upon the minds of right and fair-minded opponents their belief in the truth of the allegations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Here, before a jury of his peers and the world, I would present his case as he stated it, and with it contemporary testimony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>This proof impartially weighed will show him to have honorably and religiously lived, and fearlessly died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>His services to his country were many and brilliant; to it he sacrificed his ambitions, his prosperity, his time, health, and happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>He gave his all-and since he enjoyed the love and confidence of <num value="8000000">eight millions</num> of our own people, <quote>verily great was his reward.</quote>

<p>between the announcement by telegraph of the secession of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> and the receipt of the official notification which enabled me to withdraw from the <name>Senate</name>, rumors were in circulation of a purpose, on the part of the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>This threat received little attention from those most concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Indeed, it was thought that it might not be an undesirable mode of testing the question of the right of a State to withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>I did not hear the conversations or know the purport of them from my husband, but was pained to see the deep depression under which he labored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The only time he ever seemed cheerful was when he spoke of his hope that the moderation of the <rs>President</rs> and his advisers would restrain the ardor of the anti-slavery men. <quote>If they will give me time,</quote> he said, <quote>all is not lost; violence on <num value="1">one</num> side and extreme measures of wrong on the other now, will dissolve the <rs>Union</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>And bytelegrams and letters to every Southern State he endeavored to postpone their action.</p></note> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>No attempt was made, however, to arrest any of the retiring members; and, after a delay of a few days, spent in necessary preparations, I left <placeName reg="Washington, Wilkes, Georgia" key="tgn,2024666">Washington</placeName> for <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, passing through <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Southwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, a small part of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659"><rs type="direction">North</rs> Alabama</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>A deep interest in the events which had recently occurred was exhibited by the people of these States, and much anxiety was indicated as to the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Many years of agitation had made them familiar with the ideas of separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Nearly <num value="2">two</num> generations had risen to manhood since it had begun to be <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> discussed as a possible alternative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Few, very few, of the <rs>Southern</rs> people had ever regarded it as a desirable event, or otherwise than as a last resort for escape from evils more intolerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>It was a calamity which, however threatened, they still hoped might be averted, or indefinitely postponed, and they had regarded with contempt, rather than anger, the ravings of a party in the <rs>North</rs>, which denounced the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the <rs>Union</rs>, and persistently defamed their brethren of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> Now, however, as well in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, neither of which had yet seceded, as in the more southern States which had already taken that step, the danger so often prophesied was perceived to be at the door, and eager inquiries were made as to what would happen next, especially as to the probability of war between the <name>States</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The course which events were likely to take was shrouded in the greatest uncertainty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>In the minds of many there was not the unreasonable hope (which had been expressed by the <rs>Commissioner</rs> sent from <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> to <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>) that the secession of <num value="6">six</num> Southern States-certainly soon to be followed by that of others, would so arouse the sober thought and better feeling of the <rs>Northern</rs> people as to compel their representatives to agree to <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> a <orgName n="States Convention" type="convention">Convention of the States</orgName>, and that such guarantees would be given as would secure to the <rs>South</rs> the domestic tranquillity and equality in the <rs>Union</rs> which were rights assured under the <rs>Federal</rs> compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>There were others, and they the most numerous class,--who considered that the separation would be final, but peaceful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>For my part, while believing that secession was a right, and, properly, a peaceable remedy, I had never believed that it would be permitted to be peaceably exercised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Very few in the <rs>South</rs>, at that time, agreed with me, and my answers to queries on the subject were, therefore, as unexpected as they were unwelcome.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>To wrench oneself from the ties of <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure> is a most distressing effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Our friends had entered into our joys and sorrows with unfailing sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>We had shared their anxieties and seen their children grow from infancy to adolescence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>To bid them farewell, perhaps to meet in the near future with a <quote>great gulf between us,</quote> was, <quote>death in life.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>He anticipated a long and exhausting war, and knew that his property in cotton planting would be utterly destroyed in <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> the course of the impending conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Deeply depressed and supremely anxious, he made his preparations to go home. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>We left <placeName reg="Washington, Wilkes, Georgia" key="tgn,2024666">Washington</placeName> <quote>exceeding sorrowful,</quote> and took our <num value="3">three</num> little children with us. As we came into the <rs>Southern States</rs> the people surrounded the train at every little hamlet, and called <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0038.0001.00006.00010" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> out. Wherever we stayed long enough, he told them to prepare for a long and bloody war, and tried to impress them with the gravity of the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>After many short speeches, he became very much exhausted from the constant exertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>When the conductor noticed it he said, <quote>Never mind, when we stop at the next <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> stations I will blow off steam at <q direct="unspecified">My friends and fellow-citizens,</q> and go off at once;</quote> and so he did, much to the disgust of the crowd. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>We proceeded without accident until we reached the <rs type="place">Crutchfield House</rs>, at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>There a crowd was gathered, among whom was the cordial proprietor, the elder <rs>Crutchfield</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>While the supper was being prepared, a speech was called for. <persName n="Crutchfield,Mister,,,," id="n0038.0001.00006.00011" reg="mostcommon:Crutchfield,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Crutchfield</surname></persName>'s brother was a Union man, and had been drinking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>He began a violent tirade against <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0038.0001.00006.00012" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>He had <num value="12">twelve</num> or <num value="13">thirteen</num> people with him who seemed to be his companions in jollity, but who did not partake <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> of his irritation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>He offered to resent personally anything <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0038.0001.00007.00013" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> might say. The excitement became intense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The office was in <num value="1">one</num> corner of a large, unfurnished room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>News of the disturbance was brought to me, and I went into the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The excitement was at its highest pitch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>A rough man sitting on a barrel said to a negro near him, <quote>Tell that lady she need not be uneasy, <placeName reg="Jeff Davis, Georgia, United States" key="tgn,2000371">Jeff Davis</placeName> ain't afraid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>He will make his speech.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The disturber of the peace was <quote>hustled out.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The interruption lasted about <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure>. Much has been made of this scene, but it was merely the vagary of a drunken man, for which his brother apologized. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>As soon as we reached <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, man after man boarded the train and accompanied us to <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0038.0001.00007.00015" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:2"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, until nearly a brigade was on the cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>She knew intimately every man of prominence in the <rs>State</rs>, and had no little political influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>We were rendered very <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> anxious by the accounts she gave of the state of excitement pervading everyone; there was no rest anywhere. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>At <placeName reg="Jackson, Madison, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099733">Jackson</placeName>, <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0038.0001.00008.00018" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> found his commission from <persName n="Pettus,Governor,I.,I.,," id="n0038.0001.00008.00019" reg="default:Pettus,I.,I.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <foreName>I.</foreName> <foreName>I.</foreName> <surname>Pettus</surname></persName>, as <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs> of the forces of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, dated <dateStruct value="1861-01-25"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg="25">25</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Then began the business of making provisions for arms, and for the organization and discipline of the forces of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>. <persName n="Pettus,Governor,,,," id="n0038.0001.00008.00020" reg="nearbymention:Pettus,I.,I.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Pettus</surname></persName> came to <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0038.0001.00008.00021" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> to consult about the purchase of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>He thought <num value="75000">75,000</num> stand would be sufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Again <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0038.0001.00008.00022" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> was very emphatic, saying, <quote>The limit of our purchases should be our power to pay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/></p> 
<p>On my arrival at <placeName reg="Jackson, Madison, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099733">Jackson</placeName>, the capital of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, I found that the <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">Convention of the State</orgName> had made provision for a State army, and had appointed me to the command, with the rank of <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs>. <num value="4">Four</num> <rs type="role" reg="Brigadier-General">brigadier-generals</rs>, appointed in like manner by the <rs>Convention</rs>, were awaiting my arrival for assignment to duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The State had few serviceable weapons, and no establishment for their manufacture or repair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>This fact (which is as true of other Southern States as of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>) is a clear proof of the absence of any desire or expectation of war. If the purpose of the <rs>Northern States</rs> to make war upon us because of secession had been foreseen, preparations to meet the consequences would have been contemporaneous with the adoption of a resort to that remedy &mdash; a remedy the possibility of which had for many years been contemplated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Had the <rs>Southern States</rs> possessed <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> arsenals and collected in them the requisite supplies of arms and ammunition, such preparations would not only have placed them more nearly on an equality with the <rs>North</rs> in the beginning of the war, but might, perhaps, have been the best conservator of peace. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Let us, the survivors, however, not fail to do credit to the generous credulity which could not understand how, in violation of the compact of Union, a war could be waged against the <name>States</name>, or why they should be invaded because their people had deemed it necessary to withdraw from an association which had failed to fulfil the ends for which they had entered into it, and which, having been broken to their injury by the other parties, had ceased to be binding upon them.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>He went on to say that our swamp lands, he feared, could not be cultivated by white men. They were the most fertile lands in the country, but they must, he feared, lie fallow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>The railroad conductor announced his decision that the railroad train should proceed no farther.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>Looking among those who were about us for <num value="1">one</num> whose demeanor gave reason to expect from him a collected answer, <pb id="p.96" n="96"/> I selected <num value="1">one</num> whose gray beard and calm face gave best assurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>He, however, could furnish no encouragement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>Our line, he said, was broken, all was confusion, the army routed, and the battle lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>I asked for <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0038.0010.00096.00279" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> and <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0038.0010.00096.00280" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,G.,T.,,"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> ; he said they were on the field when he left it. I returned to the conductor and told him that I must go on; that the railroad was the only means by which I could proceed, and that, until I reached the headquarters, I could not get a horse to ride to the field where the battle was raging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>He finally consented to detach the locomotive from the train, and, for my accommodation, to run it as far as the army headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>In this manner <persName n="Davis,Colonel,,,," id="n0038.0010.00096.00281" reg="nearbymention:Davis,J.,R.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" n="Aide de camp">aide-de-camp</rs>, and myself proceeded. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>At the headquarters we found the <rs type="role" reg="Quartermaster-General">Quartermaster-General</rs>, <persName n="Caball,,W.,L.,," id="n0038.0010.00096.00282" reg="default:Caball,W.,L.,,"><foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Caball</surname></persName>, and the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</rs>, <persName n="Jordan,,,,," id="n0038.0010.00096.00283" reg="nearbymention:Jordan,T.,J.,,"><surname>Jordan</surname></persName>, of <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0038.0010.00096.00284" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,G.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>'s staff, who courteously agreed to furnish us horses, and also to show us the route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>While the horses were being prepared, <persName n="Jordan,Colonel,,,," id="n0038.0010.00096.00285" reg="nearbymention:Jordan,T.,J.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Jordan</surname></persName> took occasion to advise my aidede-camp, <persName n="Davis,Colonel,,,," id="n0038.0010.00096.00286" reg="nearbymention:Davis,J.,R.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, of the hazard of going to the field, and the impropriety of such exposure on my part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>The horses were after a time reported ready, and we started to the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>The stragglers soon became numerous, and warnings as to the fate which awaited us <pb id="p.97" n="97"/> if we advanced were not only frequent, but evidently sincere. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>There were, however, many who turned back, and the wounded generally cheered upon meeting us. I well remember <num value="1">one</num>, a mere stripling, who, supported on the shoulders of a man, who was bearing him to the rear, took off his cap and waved it with a cheer, that showed within that slender form beat the heart of a hero-breathed a spirit that would dare the labors of <persName n="Hercules,,,,," id="n0038.0010.00097.00287" reg="mostcommon:Hercules,nomatch:0"><surname>Hercules</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>As we advanced, the storm of the battle was rolling westward, and its fury became faint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>When I met <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0038.0010.00097.00288" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, who was upon a hill which commanded a general view of the field of the afternoon's operations, and inquired of him as to the state of affairs, he replied that we had won the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>I left him there and rode still farther to the west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>Several of the volunteers on <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0038.0010.00097.00289" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,G.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>'s staff joined me, and a command of cavalry, the gallant leader of which, <persName n="Lay,Captain,John,F.,," id="n0038.0010.00097.00290" reg="default:Lay,John,F.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Lay</surname></persName>, insisted that I was too near the enemy to be without an escort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>We, however, only saw <num value="1">one</num> column near to us that created a doubt as to which side it belonged; and, as we were riding toward it, it was suggested that we should halt until it could be examined with a field-glass.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>Our cavalry, though there was present but the squadron previously mentioned, and specified in a statement of the commander from which I will make some extracts, dashed boldly forward to charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>The demonstration was followed by the immediate retreat of what was, I believe, the last, thereabout, of the enemy's forces maintaining their organization, and showing a disposition to dispute the possession of the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>In riding over the ground, it seemed quite possible to mark the line of a fugitive's flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>Here was a musket, there a cartridge-box, there a blanket or overcoat, a haversack, etc., as if the runner had stripped himself, as he went, of all impediments to speed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>As we approached toward the left of our line, the signs of an utter rout of the enemy were unmistakable, and justified the conclusion that the watchword of <quote>On to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></quote> had been changed to <quote> Off for <placeName reg="Washington, Wilkes, Georgia" key="tgn,2024666">Washington</placeName>.</quote>

<p>On the extreme left of our field of operations, I found the troops whose opportune arrival had averted the impending disaster, and so materially contributed to our victory.

All these troops and the others near to them had hastened into action without supplies or camp-equipage; weary, hungry, and without shelter, night closed around them where they stood, the blood-stained victors on a hard-fought field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>It was reported to me that some of the troops had been so long without food as to be suffering severe hunger, and that no supplies could be got where they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>I made several addresses to them, all to the effect that their position was that best adapted to a pursuit of the enemy, and that they should therefore remain there; adding that I would go to the headquarters and direct that supplies should be sent to them promptly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>I rode to see him, found him in severe pain, and, from the twitching visible and frequent, seemed to be threatened with tetanus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>A man sat beside him whose uniform was that of the enemy; but he was gentle, and appeared to be solicitously attentive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>He said that he had no morphine, and did not know where to get any. I found in a short time a surgeon who went with me to <persName n="Gardner,Colonel,,,," id="n0038.0010.00100.00297" reg="mostcommon:Gardner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Gardner</surname></persName>, having the articles necessary in the case.

I took the name and the <rs>State</rs> of the supposed Good Samaritan, and at army headquarters directed that he should not be treated as a prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>The sequel will be told hereafter. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>It was late, and we rode back in the night, say <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure>, to the army headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>When, after some preliminary conversation, I asked whether any troops had been sent in pursuit of the enemy, I was answered in the negative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>The large amount gained of fine artillery, small-arms, and ammunition, all of which were much needed by us, was not the least gratifying consequence of our success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>The generals, like myself, were all content with what had been done. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>I propounded to them the inquiry as to what it was practicable to do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>He described these fortifications as having wide, deep ditches, with palisades which would prevent the escalade of the works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>Turning to <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0038.0011.00112.00350" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, he said, <quote>They have spared no expense.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>It was further stated in explanation that we had no sappers and miners, nor even the tools requisite to make regular approaches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>If we had possessed both, the time required for <pb id="p.113" n="113"/> such operations would have more than sufficed for <orgName n="army"><persName n="Patterson,General,,,," id="n0038.0011.00113.00351" reg="mostcommon:Patterson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Patterson</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> and other forces to have been brought to that locality, in such numbers as must have rendered the attempt, with our present means, futile. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>This view of the matter rests on the supposition that the fortifications and garrisons described did actually exist, of which there seemed then to be no doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>If the reports which have since reached us be true, that there was at that time neither fortifications nor troops stationed on the south bank of the <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Potomac</placeName>; that all the enemy's forces fled to the north side of the river, and even beyond; that the panic of the routed army infected the whole population of <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington City</placeName>; and that no preparation was made, or even contemplated, for the destruction of the bridge across the Potomac-then it may have been, as many have asserted, that our army, following close upon the flying enemy, could have entered and taken possession of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>These reports, however, present a condition of affairs altogether at variance with the information on which we had to act.

<p>The victory of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 6" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> was certainly extraordinary, not only on account of the disparity of our numbers and the inferiority of our arms, but also because of many other disadvantages under which we labored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>We had no disciplined troops, and, though our citizens were generally skilled in the use of small-arms, which, with their high pride and courage, might compensate for the want of training while in position, these inadequately substituted military instruction when manoeuvres had to be performed under fire, and could not make the old-fashioned musket equal to the long-range, new-model muskets with which the enemy was supplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>The disparity in artillery was still greater, both in the number and kinds of guns; but, thanks to the skill and cool courage of <persName n="Pendleton,Reverend,Captain,W.,N.," id="n0038.0012.00114.00353" reg="default:Pendleton,Captain,W.,N.,"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev.</roleName> <foreName>Captain</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>N.</foreName> <surname>Pendleton</surname></persName>, his battery of light, smooth-bore guns, manned principally by the youths whose rector he had been, proved more effective in battle than the long-range rifle-guns of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>The <pb id="p.115" n="115"/> character of the ground brought the forces into close contact, and the ricochet of the round balls carried havoc into the columns of the enemy, while the bolts of their rifle-guns, if they missed their object, penetrated harmlessly into the ground. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>The field was very extensive, broken, and wooded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>The <rs type="role" reg="senior-General">senior general</rs> had so recently arrived that he had no opportunity minutely to learn the ground, and the troops he brought were both unacquainted with the field and with those with whom they had to co-operate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>To all this must be added the disturbing fact that the plan of battle, as originally designed, was entirely changed by the movement of the enemy on our extreme left, instead of right and centre, as anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>The operations, therefore, had to be conducted against the plan of the enemy, instead of on that which our generals had prepared and explained to their subordinate commanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>The promptitude with which the troops moved, and the readiness with which our generals modified their preconceived plans to meet the necessities as they were developed, entitled them to the commendation so liberally bestowed at the time by their countrymen at large. </p>

When he came I had no doubt of his identity, and explained to him that I had directed that he should not be treated as a prisoner, but that, in the multitude of those wearing the same uniform as his, some neglect or mistake had arisen, for which I was very sorry, and that he should be immediately released and sent down the river to the neighborhood of <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, where he would be among his own people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>The entire silence of <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0038.0013.00124.00383" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> in regard to those conferences is noticeable from the fact that, while his answer was strictly measured by the terms of my inquiry as to pursuit, he added a statement <pb id="p.125" n="125"/> about a conference at <placeName reg="Fairfax Court-House">Fairfax Court-House</placeName>, which occurred in the autumn, say <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, and could have had no relation to the question of pursuit of the enemy after the victory of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 6" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, or other active operations therewith connected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>The reasons stated in my letter for making an inquiry, naturally pointed to the conferences of <dateStruct value="-07-21"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="21">21st</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="-07-22"><day reg="22">22d</day></dateStruct>, but surely not to a conference held months subsequent to the battle, and on a question quite different from that of hot pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>my dear Sir: I think you are unjust to yourself in putting your failure to pursue the enemy to <placeName reg="Washington, Wilkes, Georgia" key="tgn,2024666">Washington</placeName> to the account of short supplies of subsistence and transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>Sir: Yesterday my attention was called to various newspaper publications, purporting to have been sent from <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 6" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, and to be a synopsis of your report of the battle of <dateStruct value="-07-21"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="21">21st</day></dateStruct>, last, and in which it is represented that you have been overruled by me in your plan for a battle with the enemy, south of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, for the capture of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> and <placeName reg="Washington, Wilkes, Georgia" key="tgn,2024666">Washington</placeName>, and the liberation of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/> I inquired for your long-expected report, and it has been to-day submitted for my inspection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>It appears, by official endorsement, to have been received by the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</rs> on <dateStruct value="-10-18"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg="18">18th</day></dateStruct>, though it is dated <dateStruct value="1861-08-26"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg="26">26</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>With much surprise I found that the newspaper statements were sustained by the text of your report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>I was surprised, because if we did differ in opinion as to the measure and purposes of contemplated campaigns, such facts could have no appropriate place in the report of a battle; further, because it seemed to be an attempt to exalt yourself at my expense; and, especially, because no such plan as that described was submitted to me. It is true that, some time before it was ordered, you expressed a desire for the junction of <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0038.0013.00129.00396" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s <pb id="p.130" n="130"/> army with your own. The movement was postponed until the operations of the enemy rendered it necessary, and until it became thereby practicable to make it with safety to the <rs type="place">Valley of Virginia</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>Hence I believe was secured the success by which it was attended. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>If you have retained a copy of the plan of campaign which you say was submitted to me through <persName n="Chesnut,Colonel,,,," id="n0038.0013.00130.00397" reg="nearbymention:Chesnut,James,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Chesnut</surname></persName>, allow me to request that you will furnish me with a duplicate of it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>The Congress in its discretion, ordered the publication of the report, except that part to which the endorsement referred, thereby judiciously suppressing both the endorsement and the portion of the report to which it related.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>In this case and <hi rend="italics">every other</hi> official report ever submitted to me, I made neither alteration nor erasure. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/> Having become satisfied that the advance of the enemy with a decidedly superior force, both as to numbers and war equipage, to attack or to turn my position in this quarter, was immediately impending, I despatched on <dateStruct value="-07-13"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="13">13th</day></dateStruct> <dateStruct value="-07-1"><day reg="1">one</day></dateStruct> of my staff, <persName n="Chesnut,Colonel,James,,," id="n0038.0013.00131.00400" reg="default:Chesnut,James,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>James</foreName> <surname>Chesnut</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, to submit, for the consideration of the <rs>President</rs>, a plan of operations substantially as follows: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>This accomplished, the <orgName n="Army of the Shenandoah" type="army">army of the Shenandoah</orgName>, under <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0038.0013.00132.00405" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, increased with a part of my forces and rejoined, as he returned, by the detachment left to hold the mountain-passes, was to march back rapidly into the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, fall upon and crush <persName n="Patterson,,,,," id="n0038.0013.00132.00406" reg="mostcommon:Patterson,nomatch:0"><surname>Patterson</surname></persName> with a superior force, wheresoever he might be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>Permit me to say that this accusation is untrue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>I am, and have been, in command of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>Have felt the responsibility of that command, and understood that, even if so disposed, I could not put it aside. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>Let me remind you, too, that in an army which has been almost stationary, there are few orders necessary to the commander of an <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>It was a time of flagrant war. Either we were <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, or the army and country were left without such officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>Our former grade had been abolished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>We were not <rs type="role" reg="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-Generals</rs>, we were nothing, and could perform no military duty, exercise no command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>I think it <pb id="p.148" n="148"/> clear that I was a General by the plain terms of the law. It is plain from the action of the <rs>President</rs> and Congress that such was their construction, as I was at once ordered to <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> to take command in the valley of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 15" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and the <rs>President</rs> soon after placed <num value="3">three</num> <rs type="role" reg="Brigadier-General">Brigadier--Generals</rs> under my orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>In hurrying to assume the command in the valley of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 15" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, I did not wait for my commission to be sent to me. I did not doubt that it would be made out, for I was persuaded that it was my right, and had no idea that there was any purpose of withholding it. I remained <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> in the valley, too earnestly engaged in the public service to busy myself particularly in my personal interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>But when the emergencies of the campaign required me to march to <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 6" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, and to act with another general officer, I appreciated the importance and the indispensable necessity of not leaving the question of rank open or doubtful between us. With this view I transmitted a telegraphic despatch to the <rs>President</rs> on <dateStruct value="-07-20"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="20">20th</day></dateStruct>, inquiring, in the simplest and most direct terms, what my rank was.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>He returned to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> the ensuing day. The nomination was made immediately on his return, and was promptly confirmed by Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2261"/>I ask leave now to present them as supplemental to that letter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2262"/>If it be true, as there assumed, that in the settled judgment of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> the separation of the <name>States</name> is final, then the failure of so great a power to recognize the fact in a formal manner imparts an opposite belief, and must operate as an incentive to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to protract the contest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2263"/>In a war such as that pending in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, where a party in possession of the government is striving to subdue those who, for reasons sufficient to themselves, have withdrawn from it, the contest will be carried on in the heat of blood and of popular excitement long after its object has become hopeless in the eyes of the disinterested public. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2264"/>The Government itself may feel that its power is inadequate to bring back the recusant States, arrd yet be unable at once to control the fierce elements which surround it while the war wages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2265"/>Such, it is confidently believed, is the actual condition of affairs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2266"/>It is impossible, in the experience of <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure> of no ordinary trial, in the small results attained, and in the manifest exhaustion of its resources, that any hope remains with the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> either of bringing about a restoration <pb id="p.340" n="340"/> of the dissevered Union, or of subjugating those who have renounced it. And yet the failure of foreign powers formally to recognize this condition of things disables those in authority from conceding that fact at home. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2267"/>Again, it is known that there is a large and increasing sentiment in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in accordance with these views; a sentiment which has its origin in the hard teachings of the war as it has progressed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2268"/>It is believed (or so confidently affirmed) that there was a large party in the <rs>Southern States</rs> devoted to the <rs>Union</rs>, whose presence and power would be manifested there as soon as the public force of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was present to sustain it. I need not say how fully the experience of the war has dispelled this delusion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2269"/>Again, it was believed, and confidently relied on, that in the social structure of the <rs>Southern States</rs> there was a large population of the dominant race indifferent, if not hostile, to the basis on which that social structure rests, in which they were not interested, and who would be found the allies of those whose mission was supposed to be in some way to break it up; but the same experience has shown that the whole population of the <rs>South</rs> is united, as <num value="1">one</num> people, in arms to resist the invader, <pb id="p.341" n="341"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2270"/>A Nothing remains, then, on which to rest any hope of conquest but a reliance on the superior numbers and the supposed greater resources of the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2271"/>I think the results of the last (or pending) campaign have proved how idle such expectations were, against the advantages of a people fighting at home and bringing into a common stock of resistance, as a free &mdash; will offering, all that they possessed, whether of blood or treasure-a spectacle now historically before the world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2272"/>It is in human experience that there must be those in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> who cannot shut their eyes to such facts, and yet, in the despotic power now assumed by the <rs>Government</rs>, to give expression to any doubt would be to court the hospitalities of the dungeon. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2675"/>My recent interviews with you have put you so fully in possession of my views, that <pb id="p.402" n="402"/> it is scarcely necessary to give you any detailed instructions, even were I at this moment well enough to attempt it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2676"/>My whole purpose is, in <num value="1">one</num> word, to place this war on the footing of such as are waged by civilized people in modern times, and to divest it of the savage character which has been impressed on it by our enemies, in spite of all our efforts and protests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2677"/>War is full enough of unavoidable horrors, under all its aspects, to justify, and even to demand, of any <name>Christian</name> ruler who may unhappily engage in carrying it on, to seek to restrict its calamities, and to divest it of all unnecessary severities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2678"/>You will endeavor to establish a cartel for the exchange of prisoners on such a basis as to avoid constant difficulties and complaints which arise, and to prevent for the future what we deem the unfair conduct of our enemies, in evading the delivery of prisoners who fall into their hands, in retarding it by sending them on circuitous routes, and by detaining them sometimes for months in camps and prisons, and in persisting in taking captive non-combatants. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2679"/>Your attention is also called to the unheard &mdash; of conduct of Federal officers, in driving from their homes entire communities of women and children, as well as of men, whom they find in districts occupied by their troops, for no <pb id="p.403" n="403"/> other reason than because these unfortunates are faithful to the allegiance due to their States, and refuse to take an oath of fidelity to their enemies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2680"/>The putting to death of unarmed prisoners has been a ground of just complaint in more than <num value="1">one</num> instance, and the recent execution of officers of our army in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, for the sole cause that they were engaged in recruiting service in a State which is claimed as still <num value="1">one</num> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, but is also claimed by us as <num value="1">one</num> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, must be repressed by retaliation if not unconditionally abandoned, because it would justify the like execution in every other State of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and the practice is barbarous, uselessly cruel, and can only lead to the slaughter of prisoners on both sides, a result too horrible to contemplate without making every effort to avoid it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2681"/>On these and all kindred subjects you will consider your authority full and ample to make such arrangements as will temper the present cruel character of the contest, and full confidence is placed in your judgment, patriotism, and discretion that, while carrying out the objects of your mission, you will take care that the equal rights of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> be always preserved.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2684"/>Numerous difficulties and disputes have arisen in relation to the execution of the cartel of exchange heretofore agreed on by the belligerents, and the commissioners for the exchange of prisoners have been unable to adjust their differences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2685"/>Their action on the subject of these differences is delayed and embarrassed by the necessity of referring each subject as it arises to superior authority for decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2686"/>I believe that I have just grounds for complaint against the officers and forces under your command for breach of the terms of the cartel, and, being myself ready to execute it at all times in good faith, I am notjustified in doubting the existence of the same disposition on your part. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2687"/>In addition to this matter, I have to complain of the conduct of your officers and troops in many parts of the country, who violate all the rules of war by carrying on hostilities, not only against armed foes, but against non-combatants, aged men, women, and children; while others not only seize such property as is required for the use of your forces, but destroy <pb id="p.405" n="405"/> all private property within their reach, even <rs n="agricultural implements" type="product">agricultural implements</rs>; and openly avow the purpose of seeking to subdue the population of the districts where they are operating, by the starvation that must result from the destruction of standing crops and <rs n="agricultural implements" type="product">agricultural implements</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2688"/>Still, again, others of your officers in different districts have recently taken the lives of prisoners who fell into their power, and justify their act by asserting a right to treat as spies the <rs type="role" reg="military-Officer">military officers</rs> and enlisted men under my command who may penetrate for hostile purposes into States claimed by me to be engaged in the warfare now waged against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and claimed by the latter as having refused to engage in such warfare. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2689"/>I have heretofore, on different occasions, been forced to make complaint of these outrages, and to ask you that you should either avow or disclaim having authorized them; and have failed to obtain such answer as the usages of civilized warfare require to be given in such cases. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2690"/>These usages justify, and indeed require, redress by retaliation, as the proper means of repressing such cruelties as are not permitted in warfare between <name>Christian</name> peoples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2691"/>I have, notwithstanding, refrained from the exercise of such retaliation, because of its obvious tendency <pb id="p.406" n="406"/> to lead to a war of indiscriminate massacre on both sides, which would be a spectacle so shocking to humanity and so disgraceful to the age in which we live and the religion we profess, that I cannot contemplate it without a feeling of horror that I am disinclined to doubt you would share. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2724"/>Deeply impressed as I was with these views and feelings, in undertaking the mission and asking the conference, I can but express my profound regret at the result of the effort made to obtain it, and I can but entertain the belief that if the conference sought had been granted, mutual good could have been effected by it; and if this war, so unnatural, so unjust, so unchristian, and so inconsistent with every fundamental principle of American constitutional liberty, <quote>must needs</quote> continue to be waged against us, that at least some of the severer horrors, which now so eminently threaten, might have been avoided.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2855"/>Your statements that the <rs>Government</rs> in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> was better able to judge of the relative necessities of the armies under your command than you were, and the further statement that you could not know how <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n0038.0042.00429.01655" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s wants compared with yours, were considered extraordinary; but as they were accompanied by the remark that the <rs>Secretary</rs>'s despatch had been imperfectly deciphered, no observation was made on them till the receipt of your telegram to the <rs>Secretary</rs> of the <dateStruct value="--12"><day reg="12">12th instant</day></dateStruct>, stating, <quote> I have not considered myself commanding in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> <pb id="p.430" n="430"/> since assignment here, and should not have felt authorized to take troops from that Department after having been informed by the <rs>Executive</rs> that no more could be spared.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2856"/></p> 
<p>My surprise at these <num value="2">two</num> statements was extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2857"/>You had never been <quote> assigned to the <rs>Mississippi</rs> command.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2859"/>Orders as explicit as those under which you were sent to the <rs>West</rs>, and under which you continued to act up to <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> gth, when you were directed to repair in person to <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, can only be impaired or set aside by subsequent orders, equally explicit; and your announcement that you had ceased to consider yourself charged with the control of affairs in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> because ordered to repair in person to <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, both places being within the command to which you were assigned, was too grave to be overlooked; and when to this was added the assertion that you should not have felt authorized to draw troops from that <orgName n="Department of the Tennessee" type="department">Department (Tennessee</orgName>) <quote>after being informed by the <rs>Executive</rs> that no more could be spared,</quote> I was unable to account for your language, being entirely confident <pb id="p.431" n="431"/> that I had never given you any such information. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2860"/>I shall now proceed to separate your <num value="2">two</num> statements, and begin with that which relates to your <quote>not considering</quote> yourself commanding in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, since assignment <quote>here,</quote> <hi rend="italics">i.e</hi>., in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2861"/>When you received my telegram of <dateStruct value="-06-15"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="15">15th</day></dateStruct>, informing you that <quote>the order to go to <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> did not diminish your authority in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, both being in the country placed under your command in original assignment,</quote> accompanied by an inquiry about the information said to have been derived from me, restricting your authority to transfer troops, your answer on <dateStruct value="-06-16"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="16">16th</day></dateStruct> was, <quote> I meant to tell the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, that I considered the order directing me to command here as limiting my authority to this Department, especially when that order was accompanied by <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> orders transferring troops from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> to <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2862"/></p> 
<p>This is in substance a repetition of the previous statement without any reason being given for it. The fact of orders being sent to you to transfer some of the troops in your Department from <num value="1">one</num> point to another to which you were proceeding in person, could give no possible ground for your <quote>considering</quote> that Special Order, <num value="275">No. 275</num>, was rescinded <pb id="p.432" n="432"/> or modified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2863"/>Your command of your geographical district did not make you independent of my orders as your superior officer, and when you were directed by me to take troops with you to <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, your control over the district to which you were assigned was in no way involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2864"/>But the statement that troops were transferred from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> to <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> by order of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, when you were directed to repair to the latter State, gives but half the fact, for although you were ordered to take with you <num value="3000">three thousand</num> good troops, you were told to replace them by a greater number, then on their way to <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, and whom you were requested to divert to <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, the purpose being to hasten reinforcements to <persName n="Pemberton,,,,," id="n0038.0042.00432.01656" reg="mostcommon:Pemberton,nomatch:0"><surname>Pemberton</surname></persName> without weakening <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0038.0042.00432.01657" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:2"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2865"/>This was in deference to your own opinion, that <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0038.0042.00432.01658" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:2"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> could not be safely weakened, nay, that he ought even to be reinforced at <persName n="Pemberton,,,,," id="n0038.0042.00432.01659" reg="mostcommon:Pemberton,nomatch:0"><surname>Pemberton</surname></persName>'s expense; for you had just ordered troops from <orgName n="command"><persName n="Pemberton,,,,," id="n0038.0042.00432.01660" reg="mostcommon:Pemberton,nomatch:0"><surname>Pemberton</surname></persName>'s command</orgName> to reinforce <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0038.0042.00432.01661" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:2"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2866"/>I differed in opinion from you, and thought <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> far more exposed to danger than <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0038.0042.00432.01662" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:2"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>, and was urging forward reinforcements to that point, both from <placeName reg="Carolina City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2222249">Carolina</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 15" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, before you were directed to assume command in person in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2867"/>I find nothing then either in your despatch <pb id="p.433" n="433"/> of <dateStruct value="-06-16"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="16">16th</day></dateStruct>, nor in any subsequent communication from you, giving a justification for your saying, that you <quote> had not considered yourself commanding in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, since assignment here</quote> (<hi rend="italics">i.e</hi>., in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>). Your despatch of the <dateStruct value="--5"><day reg="5">5th instant</day></dateStruct> is again a substantial repetition of the same statement without a word of reason to justify it. You say, <quote>I considered my assignment to the immediate command in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> as giving me a new position, and limiting my authority to this Department.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2868"/>I have characterized this as a grave error, and in view of all the facts cannot otherwise regard it. I must add that a review of your correspondence shows a constant desire on your part, beginning early in <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, that I should change the order placing <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> in <num value="1">one</num> command under your direction, and a constant indication on my part, whenever I wrote on the subject, that in my judgment the public service required that the armies should be subject to your control. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2869"/>I now proceed to your <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> statement, in your telegram of <dateStruct value="-06-12"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="12">12th</day></dateStruct>, that <quote>you should not have felt authorized to take troops from that <orgName n="Department of the Tennessee" type="department">Department (Tennessee</orgName>) after having been informed by the <rs>Executive</rs> that no more could be spared.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2870"/></p> 
<p>To my inquiry for the basis of this statement, <pb id="p.434" n="434"/> you answered on the <dateStruct value="--16"><day reg="2">16th</day></dateStruct>, by what was in substance a reiteration of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2871"/>I again requested, on the <dateStruct value="--17"><day reg="2">17th</day></dateStruct>, that you should refer by date to any such communication as that alleged by you. You answered on <dateStruct value="-06-20"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="20">20th</day></dateStruct>, apologized for carelessness in your <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reply, and referred me to a passage from my telegram to you of <dateStruct value="-05-20"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="20">20th</day></dateStruct>, and to <num value="1">one</num> from the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> of <dateStruct value="-06-5"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="5">5th</day></dateStruct>, and then informed me that you considered <quote> Executive</quote> as including the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2872"/>Your telegram of <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> I 2th was addressed to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> person; it begins <quote> Your despatch,</quote> and then speaks of the <rs>Executive</rs> in the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> person, and on reading it, it was not supposed that the word <quote>Executive</quote> referred to anyone but myself; but of course, in a matter like this, your own explanation of your meaning is conclusive. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2873"/>The telegram of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> of <dateStruct value="-06-5"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="5">5th</day></dateStruct>, followed by that of <dateStruct value="-06-8"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="8">8th</day></dateStruct>, conveyed unmistakably the very reverse of the meaning you attribute to them, and your reference to them as supporting your position is unintelligible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2874"/>I revert therefore to my telegram of <dateStruct value="-05-28"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="28">28th</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2875"/>That telegram was in answer to <num value="1">one</num> from you in which you stated that, on the arrival of certain reinforcements, then on the way, you would have about <num value="23000">23,000</num>; that Penberton could be saved <pb id="p.435" n="435"/> only by beating <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0038.0042.00435.01663" reg="mostcommon:Grant,James,,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>; and you added, <quote>unless you can promise more troops we must try with that number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2876"/>The odds against us will be very great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2877"/>Can you add <num value="7000">seven thousand</num>?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2878"/></p> 
<p>My reply was <quote> The reinforcements sent to you exceed by, say <num value="7000">seven thousand</num>, the estimate of your despatch of <dateStruct value="--27"><day reg="27">27th instant</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2879"/>We have withheld nothing which it was practicable to give you. We cannot hope for numerical quantity, and time will probably increase the disparity.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2880"/></p> 
<p>It is on this language that you rely to support a statement that I informed you no more troops could be spared from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, and as restricting your right to draw troops from that Department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2881"/>It bears no such construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2882"/>The reinforcements sent to you, with an exception presently to be noticed, were from points outside of your Department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2883"/>You had, in telegrams of <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> Ist, <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>, and <num value="7" type="ordinal">7th</num>, and others, made repeated applications to have troops withdrawn from other Departments to your aid; you were informed that we would give all the aid we possibly could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2884"/>Of your right to order any change made in the distribution of troops in your own district, no doubt had ever been suggested by yourself, nor could occur to your superiors here, for they had given you the authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2885"/><pb id="p.436" n="436"/> </p> 
<p>The reinforcements which went with you from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> were (as already explained and as was communicated to you at the time) a mere exchange for other troops sent from <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 15" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2886"/>The troops subsequently sent to you from <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0038.0042.00436.01664" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:2"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> were forwarded by him under the following despatch from me of <dateStruct value="-05-22"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="22">22d</day></dateStruct>: <quote>The vital issue of holding the <rs>Mississippi</rs> at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> is dependent on the success of <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0038.0042.00436.01665" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> in an attack on the investing force.

<p>The words that I now underscore suffice to show how thoroughly your right of command of the troops in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> was recognized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2891"/>I knew from your own orders that you thought it more advisable to draw troops from <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> to reinforce <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0038.0042.00436.01666" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:2"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>, than to send troops from the latter to <persName n="Pemberton,,,,," id="n0038.0042.00436.01667" reg="mostcommon:Pemberton,nomatch:0"><surname>Pemberton</surname></persName>; and <num value="1">one</num> of the reasons which induced the instruction to you to proceed to <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> was the conviction that your views on the point would be changed on arrival in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2892"/>Still, although convinced myself that troops might be spared from <orgName n="army"><persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0038.0042.00436.01668" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:2"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> without very great danger, and that <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> was on the contrary in imminent peril, I was unwilling to <pb id="p.437" n="437"/> overrule your judgment of the distribution of your troops while you were on the spot, and, therefore, simply left to <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n0038.0042.00437.01669" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> the power to aid you, if he could, and <hi rend="italics">zifyou had not given contrary orders.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2894"/>My despatch of <dateStruct value="-05-18"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="18">18th</day></dateStruct> pointed out to you the delay which a compliance would involve, and suggested that cavalry could be drawn from another part of your Department, as had been previously indicated. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2896"/>Now that <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> has disastrously fallen, this subject would present no pressing demand for attention, and its examination would have been postponed to a future period, had not your despatch of the <dateStruct value="--5"><day reg="5">5th instant</day></dateStruct>, with its persistent repetition of statements which I had informed you were erroneous and without adducing a single fact to sustain them, induced <pb id="p.438" n="438"/> me to terminate the matter at once by a review of all the facts. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3745"/>This prison was for the safe-keeping of privates and noncommissioned officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3746"/>It contained an area of about <measure n="5acres" type="area">five acres</measure>, laid off into main streets of about <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure> width, intersected at regular intervals by cross streets about half the width, perhaps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3747"/>Barracks were erected <pb id="p.563" n="563"/> fronting the main avenues, intended to accommodate (?) about <num value="180">180</num> men, and numbered <num value="1">one</num>, <num value="2">two</num>, <num value="3">three</num>, etc., up to <num value="60">sixty</num> odd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3757"/>Instead of the variegated costumes in which we were caparisoned, we were given a stiff, black cavalry hat, a brown-black coat and pants, the coat being divested of half its tail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3759"/>What disposition was ever made of the clothes we gave in exchange we never took the trouble to inquire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3779"/>The last <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> of our imprisonment was noted for scant rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3780"/>Hunger was the prevailing epidemic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3781"/>I will relate the following actual occurrence as an illustration of the humiliating effects of long, continued hunger: At <num value="1">one</num> end of our barracks was our kitchen, and by the door of the kitchen stood a barrel, into which was thrown the beef bones, slop, etc. Some of these starved creatures used to go to these barrels, fish out the bones, and appropriate what could be got off them to appease their terrible hunger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3782"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion a Yankee guard found a prisoner engaged in this business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3783"/>He snatched the bone out of the prisoner's hand, cocked his pistol, presented it at the hungry prisoner, and ordered him down on his allfours to bark like a dog for the bone he was holding above him, until his beastly inhumanity was satisfied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3784"/>To say that we who witnessed this transaction were indignant is a poor description of what we felt. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3785"/>Each barrack was supplied with wooden spittoons placed along the aisle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3786"/>A comrade from a neighbor barrack was visiting a friend in <num value="10">No. 10</num>, and while sitting in an upper bunk <pb id="p.567" n="567"/> attempted to spit into <num value="1">one</num> of these spittoons, but missing it, spat upon the floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3787"/>The Yankee sergeant nosing around discovered the spit upon the floor, and demanded of me the name of the party who did it. Now, there was an unwritten law among us not to tell tales out of school, and it was kept inviolate in the presence of any torture that might be used to extort from us information that would subject a comrade to punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3788"/>I informed him that I did not know who did it, but would not tell him if I knew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3789"/>This, of course, infuriated him. He gave me <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> to find the person and divulge his name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3791"/>The information not being forthcoming, we, to the number of <num value="100">one hundred</num> or more, were ordered out into the street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3792"/>Now, the snow lay on the ground to the depth of <measure n="18inches" type="distance">eighteen inches</measure>. Along the middle of the street was a pathway leading to the hydrant, and in this pathway we were drawn up in line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3793"/>We were then ordered to right backward dress out into the snow up to our knees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3794"/>We were then ordered to strip from the waist down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3795"/>This command being executed, we were next ordered to sit down on the snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3796"/>This command was complied with, and if perchance some shivering prisoner had <pb id="p.568" n="568"/> involuntarily pushed his shirt or blanket between himself and the dampness beneath, a detail was sent down the line in the rear and rudely snatched every remnant of clothing from beneath, so that there we sat with absolutely nothing intervening between us and the snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3797"/>These manceuvres were something new in military tactics, and doubtless never entered the brain of such sluggards as <persName n="Hardee,,,,," id="n0038.0055.00568.02153" reg="mostcommon:Hardee,nomatch:0"><surname>Hardee</surname></persName> and <persName n="Upton,,,,," id="n0038.0055.00568.02154" reg="mostcommon:Upton,nomatch:0"><surname>Upton</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3798"/>How long we sat there, I do not know; seconds seemed hours, minutes days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5930"/><gap/> My reason for not replying was an unwillingness to enter <pb id="p.883" n="883"/> into a controversy in which my friends in <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> stood arrayed against each other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5931"/>In departing from the rule heretofore observed, I trust that it will not be an unwarrantable intrusion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5932"/>Reared in the creed of Democracy, my faith in its tenets has grown with its growth, and I adhere to the maxim that <quote> the world is governed too much.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5933"/></p> 
<p>When our fathers achieved their independence, the corner-stone of the governments they constructed was individual liberty, and the social organizations they established were not for the surrender, but for the protection, of natural rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5934"/>For this, governments were established deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5935"/>This was not to subject themselves to the will of the majority, as appears from the fact that each community inserted in its fundamental law a <rs n="Bill of Rights" type="document">bill of rights</rs> to guard the inalienable privileges of the individual. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5936"/>There was then a <num value="2">two</num>-fold purpose in Government: protection and prevention against trespass by the strong upon the weak, the many on the few. <num value="1">1</num> The world had long suffered from the oppressions of government under the pretext of ruling by divine right, and excusing the invasion into private and domestic affairs on <pb id="p.884" n="884"/> the plea of paternal care for the morals and good order of the people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5937"/>Our sires rejected all such pretensions, their system being: Government by the people for the people, and resting on the basis of natural inalienable rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5938"/>Upon the basis of these general propositions I will briefly answer the inquiry in regard to the prohibition amendment at issue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5939"/> <quote>Be ye temperate in all things,</quote> was a wise injunction, and would apply to intolerance as well as to drunkenness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5940"/>That the intemperate use of intoxicating liquors is an evil, few, if any, would deny. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5941"/>That it is the root of many social disorders is conceded, but then the question arises, what is the appropriate remedy, and what the present necessity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5942"/>To destroy individual liberty and moral responsibility would be to eradicate <num value="1">one</num> evil by the substitution of another, which it is submitted would be more fatal than that for which it was offered as a remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5943"/>The abuse, and not the use, of stimulants, it must be confessed, is the evil to be remedied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5944"/>Then it clearly follows that action should clearly be directed against she abuse rather than the use. If drunkenness be the cause of disorder and crime, why not pronounce drunkenness itself to be a crime, and attach to it proper and adequate penalties?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5945"/><pb id="p.885" n="885"/> If it be objected that the penalties could not be enforced, that is an admission that popular opinion would be opposed to the law; but if it be true that juries could not be impanelled who would convict so degraded a criminal as a drunkard, it necessarily follows that a statu tory prohibition against the sale and use of intoxicants would be a dead letter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5946"/>The next branch of the inquiry is as to the present necessity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5947"/>I might appeal to men not as old as myself to sustain the assertion that the convivial use of intoxicants, and the occurrence of drunkenness, had become less frequent within the last <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> than it was before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5948"/>The refining influences of education and Christianity may be credited with this result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5949"/>Why not allow these blessed handmaidens of virtue and morality to continue unembarrassed in their civilizing work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5950"/>The parties to this discussion in your State have no doubt brought forward the statistical facts in regard to the effect produced in other States by this effort to control morals by legislation, and I will not encumber this letter by any reference to those facts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5951"/>You have already provision for local prohibition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5952"/>If it has proven the wooden horse in which a disguised enemy to State sovereignty as the guardian of individual liberty <pb id="p.886" n="886"/> was introduced, then let it be a warning that the progressive march would probably be from village to State, and from State to <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5953"/>A Governmental supervision and paternity, instead of the liberty the heroes of <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct> left as a legacy to their posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5955"/>If the utterance shall avail anything for good, it will compensate me for the objurgations with which I shall doubtless be pursued by the followers of popularism of the day. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6150"/>He possibly might have fared somewhat more sumptuously, for he was the recipient of some things from friends, but whatever of such supplies was received, or which he could procure, was sent to the soldiers in hospitals, whose needs he too well knew and never forgot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6164"/>His memory was nearly infallible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6175"/>Just after being seated, and I think other company was present, an unusual commotion was heard in the passage leading to the dining-room, and almost instantly in rushed the bright, fairhaired <persName><foreName>Willie</foreName></persName>, his youngest son, a lad of <num value="8">eight</num> or <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>, followed by half a dozen or more about his size and age, whom <persName><foreName>Willie</foreName></persName> had brought in to dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6176"/>He rapidly told of some gardening or other work he had in hand, and which he wished finished at a certain time, and not being able to accomplish it so soon himself, he had gone into the streets and gathering his very promiscuous party of laborers, completed the task voluntarily assumed, and now wanted dinner for his co-workers.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6181"/>Like most people of keen perceptions, incisive wit, and high ideal standards, <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0038.0084.00918.03810" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> was inclined to satire, and in his younger days indulged this propensity, never cruelly, but often to his own injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6182"/>His sense of the ludicrous was intense, his powers of observation were close, and his memory was phenomenal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6183"/>He seldom forgot a face, name, or circumstance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6184"/>If he travelled over a country once, he knew the topography of that part which he traversed, the trees that indicated the character of the soil, noted the grasses indigenous there, observed the kinds of domestic stock preferred, the general characteristics of the people, their occupations, their sources of wealth, and even their means of water-supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6185"/>With a mind ever alert and discriminating, he took to himself, never to be relinquished, all that nature and art spread out before him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6186"/>Always delicately soigne in his own person, he observed the lack of neatness in others, and was prone to see in it an indication of mental <pb id="p.919" n="919"/> characteristics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6187"/>Once when describing a poor man who came to him for a loan, he said, <quote>He was miserably poor, but his threadbare coat was brushed and his copperas linsey trousers and his horny hands were clean, so I gave him the money.</quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6189"/>There were few more shrewd judges of character than he, but he was apt to be misled by some of the qualities he admired and infer the rest, and was thus sometimes mistaken in his judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6190"/>He was himself so consistent that he could not understand the incongruities of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6191"/>If he found a man sincere in <num value="1">one</num> thing, or the opposite, it was impossible for him to believe that, swayed by a powerful motive, the reverse action could be adopted without all he attributed to him being forfeited; consequently, after every defection of a friend he suffered keenly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6192"/>Faithful in his lightest profession of regard, and retentive of his friendships, he was deeply wounded by the duplicity of those he had trusted &mdash; not expressedly bitter, for pride and reticence, both of which were unusually developed in him, prevented his <pb id="p.920" n="920"/> asking for sympathy by showing his woundbut some keen satire, or general reflection upon the faithlessness of men, would attest his discovery, or the remark, <quote>All men are not built like martyrs,</quote> would show his contempt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6193"/>He noticed every shade of expression that passed athwart the faces of those with whom he held intercourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6194"/>Once, when a general came to him to set forth his superior officer's mistakes, and ended his long story with, <quote>It is only a matter of patriotic interest, of course there is nothing personal to me involved,</quote> he was bowed out civilly and <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0038.0084.00920.03812" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> said: <quote>He came to ask for General--&lsquo;s place.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6195"/>On my expressing astonishment, he laughed and answered, <quote>I do not mean that he said so, only he seemed to be too full of expedients to gain a victory, and to suffer too much over the <rs>General</rs>'s neglect of his opportunities.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6196"/>In a few days a newspaper contained the criticism <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0038.0084.00920.03813" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> had listened to, with a suggestion of the name of the critic to fill the place not likely to be vacant. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6197"/>No young man ever came to him with a tale of injustice, or sorrowful experience, without finding a sympathetic listener and, while he had the means, a liberal contributor to necessities which had been implied or stated, <pb id="p.921" n="921"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6198"/>It was a rule of his house that no <num value="1">one</num> should be turned away hungry, however undeserving or unattractive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6199"/>A child's cry of pain would make him quiver from head to foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6200"/>A tear on the cheek of <num value="1">one</num> in his house, or a downcast look, caused him to inquire into the trouble, and sometimes his attempts to do justice were embarrassing enough. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6201"/>On the following page will be found the back of a letter asking for assistance, the endorsement on which he never expected to meet any eye but his own. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6202"/>Sometimes, when he was reading his mail I heard a groan and a muttered exclamation, <quote>Poor creature, and my hands are tied!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6203"/>It was always some appeal for help over which he was distressing himself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6204"/>He was excitable, but not petulant, easily persuaded where to yield did not involve a principle, and was more stern toward himself than to any other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6205"/>His methods of showing sympathy were sometimes eccentric.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6206"/>Once in the street, a gentleman beggar asked him for the <num value="20" type="ordinal">twentieth</num> time for <measure n="25cents" type="currency">twenty-five cents</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6207"/></p> 
<p>To his family he was niggardly in nothing, <pb id="p.922" n="922"/> but his personal self-denial was unusual; keenly alive to the pleasures of luxury, he <pb id="p.923" n="923"/> denied himself all that our love permitted him to relinquish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6208"/>He rarely made known a personal want. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6209"/>His piety was of the kind that vaunts not itself, but was the rule of his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6210"/>He forbore with those beneath him until patience ceased to be a virtue ; but with his equals he asserted and enforced his rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6211"/>He was extremely reticent, always saying less than he thought, but was careful to convey the exact truth in the little he expressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6212"/>He was courteous in the extreme to everyone, and his servants used commonly to express their appreciation of this by saying he was <quote>a very fine gentleman.</quote>
