<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>As the <name>Breckinridge</name> ticket was favored by the most pronounced Southern rights men, the vote in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> showed a small majority against immediate secession by separate State action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Yet even at this stage there was a small minority who resolutely strove to stem the swelling tide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Popular approval of this decisive step was manifested in all the large cities and towns by the firing of cannon, the ringing of bells, and bonfires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The volunteer companies of the <rs>State</rs> that had been organized under acts of the legislature began to offer their services to the governor, and many new companies were formed even in <dateStruct value="1860-12-"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>.</p>
