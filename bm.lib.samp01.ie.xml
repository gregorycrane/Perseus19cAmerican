<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>I say that military authority takes, for the time, the place of all municipal institutions, and slavery among the rest; and that, under that state of things, so far from its being true that the States where slavery exists have the exclusive management of the subject, not only the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, but the <rs>Commander</rs> of the army, has power to order the universal <rs>Emancipation</rs> of the slaves. . . . . From the instant that the slaveholding States become the theatre of a war, civil, servile, or foreign, from that instant the war powers of Congress extend to interference with the institution of slavery, in every way in which it can be interfered with, from a claim of indemnity for slaves taken or destroyed, to the cession of States, burdened with slavery, to a foreign power. . . . It is a war power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>I say it is a war power; and when your country is actually in war, whether it be a war of invasion or a war of insurrection, Congress has power to carry on the war, and must carry it on, according to the laws of war; and by the laws of war, an invaded country has all its laws and municipal institutions swept by the board, and martial power takes the place of them.

<p>I am a good deal alarmed at the rampant spirit of Abolition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>This war has professedly been in defence of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs> to its original state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>But there is a large class of men who openly oppose the prosecution of the war, except for the extinction of slavery, and openly say they don't want to see the <rs>Government</rs> restored, except with the abolition of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>At such a time, when the question of slavery is more irritating than ever, we find them continually tampering with it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Congress has, time and again, refused to abolish slavery in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, because it would be so flagrantly unjust to the States of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/></p> 
<p>But the question returns, Since it is settled that our armies shall not fight for slavery, shall they be ordered to tight against it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Well do we know, that as slavery began the rebellion, it eserves to die; but how to strike the monster is the question.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>There are <num value="2">two</num>--ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/><num value="1">One</num> is by a general act of emancipation, the other by confiscation of the property of rebels, slaves of course included.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Each has its advocates, in and out of Congress, and its advantages.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Emancipation has the merit of being a bold and decided course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>It goes straight to the mark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>It proclaims a distinct object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>It presents an end of the war very inspiring to the mind of the <rs>North</rs>, and which would at once attract the sympathy of all who hate slavery in <placeName>Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>But it has several very serious objections:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/><num value="1">1</num>. It is a tremendous stretch of power. There is no legal or constitutional right to do it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Congress has no power over slavery in the States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>That belongs to the States themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>They alone can abolish it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>If done now, it can only be under the temporary dictatorship of martial law.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/><num value="2">2</num>. A general act of emancipation is too sleeping. It makes no discrimination between, loyal and rebel masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>True, this injustice might be remedied by giving compensation to loyal masters, but the remedy is slow, remote, and uncertain, while the injury is immediate and great.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/><num value="3">3</num>. Such a step would at once alienate the border States, which it is so important to preserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Already <placeName>Kentucky</placeName> is half rebellion, from apprehension of this very thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>And it destroys the lingering <name>Union</name> sentiment in the farther <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Thus we see that emancipation, which is so easy to talk about, is a very difficult and dangerous measure to carry through,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>But there remains another way, which is open to none of these objections &mdash; a method strictly legal and constitutional, which does no injury to any loyal man, which offends no loyal State, and yet which secures the same object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>It is Confiscation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>This is the method proposed in the bill of <persName n="Trumbull,Mr.,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00010"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Trumbull</surname></persName>, now before the <orgName n="Senate" type="military">Senate</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Congress has no power to abolish slavery in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, but it has full power to confiscate the property of rebels in arms against the <rs>Government</rs>, slaves included.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>This of course involves their liberation, and what more do we want?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Let this act be published at <placeName>Beaufort</placeName>, and it needs no military degree of emancipation to set free the slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Every planter who has taken up arms against the <rs>Government</rs>, by that act has forfeited all claim to protection; and as he flees before our advancing armies, he leaves behind him his plantation and his <quote>faithful servants,</quote> no longer slaves, but free tenants of the soil.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>This act discriminates between loyal and rebel masters; it holds firm the border States; it strengthens <name>Union</name> men at the <rs>South</rs>; and, above all, it is a strictly legal and constitutional method of securing the end, setting the slaves of men in rebellion forever free.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/> Is not, then, an Act of Confiscation the best Act of Emancipation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>If Confiscation be not as sounding a word as Emancipation, yet it designates a legal act.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>It violates no law, and accomplishes the same end &mdash; the virtual overthrow of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>For the present, therefore, it seems to me that we should forbear to speak to declaring martial law wherever our troops come, arid proclaiming emancipation at the head of the army, and try that other method, which, if less ostentatious, is not less effectual,</p></quote> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>Let us glance at each of the <rs>Evangelist</rs>'s <num value="3">three</num> objections to the abolition of slavery, above stated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>The closing sentence of objection <num value="1">No. 1</num> utterly nullifies the sentences preceding it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>Indeed, the <num value="3">three</num> assertions of which this objection is composed bear the same relation to each other with the <num value="3">three</num> reasons which a boy gave for not lending his jacknife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>Says the boy--<quote>I don't want to;--I've lent it; I havn't got any.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>Says the editor--<quote>It is a tremendous power; the thing can't be done; it can be done only in the present emergency.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>Very well! then let us use the present emergency for that purpose, and thank Heaven for the undeserved opportunity of so using it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Instead of being a <quote>tremendous</quote> power, it is a beneficent power, the exercise of which is in-dispensable to our welfare, and even to our continued existence as <num value="1">one</num> nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>War, which is ordinarily evil, and only evil, has for once created the opportunity of doing a good thing, by instruments which in peace had no such power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>As <persName n="Adams,,John,Quincy,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00011"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>Quincy</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> has clearly shown, in time of war, either the <rs>President</rs> or <rs>Congress</rs> has the right to abolish slavery utterly, through the whole country, and any <rs type="role2">General</rs>, operating in a hostile State, has the right to proclaim its utter abolition there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>Since this editor admits that the existence of martial law (our present situation) carries this right with it, his talk about the disabilities of <placeName>Congress</placeName> and of the <rs>President</rs> in other circumstances is merely an attempt to throw dust in the eyes of his readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>His wish was father to that thought.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>His <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> objection also is utterly self-contradictory in form, and deceptive in character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>Self-contradictory, in that it dissuades from a certain act as unjust, at the same time showing how the injustice may be remedied; and deceptive, in pretending the act of restoring men to their rightful freedom to be unjust at all, in any manner or degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>Strict justice, applied to the slaveholder, would require him to pay up the arrears of wages to the slave, in addition to setting him free.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>An act of emancipation by the <rs>Government</rs> should make no distinction between loyal men and rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The act of slaveholding itself is a vice and a nuisance, always needing to be summarily abated; but, besides being a vice and a nuisance, it is the special causo of the whole difficulty under which our nation at present labors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>The loyal slaveholder is to the rebel slaveholder precisely what the grub is to the moth; what the <rs n="Shoshoni people" type="nativeamerican">snake's</rs> egg is to the coming snake; only an earlier stage of the same pernicious creature, constantly tending to ripen into pernicious activity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>As far as the slave is concerned, every slaveholder is a tyrant and a robber, against whom any just man is authorized and bound in duty to take the slave's part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>As far as the relation of the <rs>Government</rs> to loyalists on <num value="1">one</num> side and rebels on the other is concerned, its different aspect to these <num value="2">two</num> parties is made abundantly clear by its course of action on other points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>It protects all rights of the loyal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>It is absurd to say that, because they are loyal, it must also protect their vice and tyranny.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>As to the <rs>Evangelist</rs>'s <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> objection to the abolition of slavery, all its specifications are impudently sophistical and false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Instead of its being important to preserve the border slave States, it is the greatest of pities that they did not go in a body, and with <num value="1">one</num> accord, that the <rs>North</rs> might thus have been freed from its besetting temptation to favor slavery, and induced to strike at the weak point of the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>Our present course is the insane and suicidal policy of carefully preserving a nest-egg in the <rs n="Shoshoni people" type="nativeamerican">snake's</rs> habitation, while we crush the last year's brood; nay, I should rather say, while we vainly attempt to crush them, since our preposterous care for this egg prevents really efficient measures against the full-grown <rs n="Shoshoni people" type="nativeamerican">snakes</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>As to the <quote>lingering <name>Union</name> sentiment in the <rs>South</rs>,</quote> all, that there is worth having is among the non-slaveholding citizens, men who have long felt their own freedom to be hopelessly hampered by slavery, and who have been so far disarmed and subjugated by it as not to feel able to make the least demonstration in support of their pioneer and ally, <persName n="Helper,Mr.,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00012"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Helper</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>He wants nothing more, because he is <num value="1">one</num> of the leaders in that church (falsely calling itself <persName n="Christian,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00013"><surname>Christian</surname></persName>) which has always been the main bulwark of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>We, the <rs>Abolitionists</rs>, want much more than this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>We want freedom for <persName n="Christ,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00014"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>'s little ones, the slaves, who are trampled under foot, by those who pretend to preach His Gospel!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>We want justice and righteousness established as the foundation of our government!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>We want a country of whose institutions, whose rulers, whose policy, whose influence, we need no longer be ashamed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>We want the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to become, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, in truth the land of the free!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>And we want the cause, motive, vital principle of the existing rebellion to be thoroughly eradicated, instead of leaving its root living in the earth to produce another crop of disasters for our children.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>Another conspicuous representative and advocate of that sort of piety which exists without godliness is the <orgName n="New York Journal of commerce" type="newspaper">New York Journal of Commerce</orgName>, a paper which has thoroughly fulfilled its promise of making no improvement, when it was forced, a few months ago, to pretend to make a change of editorship.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>The article from this paper, entitled <title>The true interests of <rs type="color">black</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs>,</title> (which may be found in its appropriate department in another column) is a good specimen of the fluency in false assertion, false assumption and slanderous insinuation which the <orgName n="Journal of commerce" type="newspaper">Journal of Commerce</orgName> habitually practices.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>It assumes that slavery has really been <quote>the foundation of prosperity</quote> to the slave States, and a positive and very great advantage to the free States allied with them; that its bare cessation (apart from any evils incidental to forcible interference with it from the <name>North</name>) would be <quote>ruin</quote> to the whole country; that the abolition of such power as the slave-owner now holds over the slave would not only be ruin to the former, but loss to the latter &mdash; yes, a double loss, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of protection, then of subsistence; that to stop using the lash and chain upon able-bodied men and women is to leave them <quote>unprotected</quote> ; that to stop robbing them of the wages of labor is to leave their young children and their sick and aged relatives <quote>unprovided for</quote> ; that no portion of <quote>the human race</quote> will work in the <placeName>Southern</placeName> climate, <quote>except on compulsion,</quote> for any thing more than the bare support of life; that the negro will not work even for that, without compulsion; that without such compulsory labor as has hitherto existed in the <rs>South</rs>, or its equivalent, its whole population, <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs>, must be plunged into the depths of poverty; and that, these premises being assumed as just and true, our effort should be to <quote>restore the <rs>Union</rs> precisely as it was.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/></p> 
<p>The <orgName n="Journal of commerce" type="newspaper">Journal of Commerce</orgName> is accustomed not only to ignore, but to deny such existing facts as do not suit its theories and wishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>Yet, amidst all this blaze of directly opposing demonstration, the <orgName n="Journal of commerce" type="newspaper">Journal of Commerce</orgName> serenely lies on, through thick and thin.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>In a paper so constantly and unscrupulously using direct falsehood, we may properly place under this head statements which, in a person of ordinary honesty, mightbe considered merely the blunder of <quote>reckoning without his host.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>But when the <orgName n="Journal of commerce" type="newspaper">Journal of Commerce</orgName> asks whether <quote>philanthropic gentlemen</quote> will take the slave families, including old and young, sick and insane, <quote>and contract to furnish them, instead of pay in money, abundance of food, clothing, medical attendance, and the necessaries of comfortable life throughout life,</quote> it knows very well, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that nothing in the remotest degree resembling this exists anywhere, or has existed anywhere, among slaves; next, that if bona fide contracts like this were to be had, the laborer being the judge of what was <quote>abundance</quote> and of what was <quote>comfortable,</quote> and empowered to compel the fulfilment of the contract by a suit at law, vast numbers of free white men would apply for them; and finally that, while negroes are regarded and treated by white men as the <orgName n="Journal of commerce" type="newspaper">Journal of Commerce</orgName> labors to have them regarded and treated, no slave would accept such a pretended contract <quote>instead of pay in money.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Just give him the chance to get this <quote>pay in money,</quote> and see if he will not jump at it, and do with alacrity sufficient work to counterbalance it.,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Just so, when this pious paper proposes to restore the <name>Union</name> <quote>precisely as it was,</quote> it knows very well that the slave States will not have it so, and broke out of the old <rs>Union</rs> because they would not have it so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Any honest man who, in his profound depth of ignorance, proposes to return to the old state of things, is reckoning without his host.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>dear <rs type="role2">Sir</rs>,--I have read a newspaper copy of the <rs>Bill</rs> which you submitted, <dateStruct value="--9"><day reg="9">9th instant</day></dateStruct>, to the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>. Nothing in it do I wish to speak of save-its proposed assumption of special powers over liberated slaves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>I had hoped that among the good effects of the war, would be the recognition of human rights under whatever skin, and the equalizing before the laws of the <rs type="color">black</rs> and <rs type="color">red</rs> races with the white race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>But your <persName n="Bill,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00021"><surname>Bill</surname></persName> is among the-indications that I had hoped for too much.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>The great sin of <orgName n="Our Country" type="newspaper">our country</orgName> in all the periods of her existence, whether under Colonial or Constitutional rule, is the assumption of special powers by her white race over her other races; and on the principle adverted to, we are guilty not only of our own, but also of the past commissions of that sin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Moreover, if this sin is now carried to its ultimate height, then is our nation now to be destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>That her doom, <quote>Behold, thy house is left unto thee desolate,</quote> is already pronounced, no man is warranted in saying, though every right-minded man sees signs enough of it to make him tremble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>The breaking up of our nation is far more than begun; and so, too, is the march of her desolation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>It may, nevertheless, have still left to it a space for repentance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>If, as we all believe, <name n="Divine Providence" type="God">God</name> has made of <num value="1">one</num> blood all his children, then must this assumption, even when in small measure, be a high crime against His equal fatherhood toward them all, and against their equal brotherhood toward <num value="1">one</num> another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>His love of them all is equal: and from this results their obligation to acknowledge, constantly and cordially, the equal rights of each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>But if this assumption, when so limited, is, nevertheless, so criminal, how immeasurably criminal must it be when the assumption is beyond measure!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>The <rs n="Indian people" type="group">Indians</rs> we have driven from their homes and from their dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>The <rs n="Indian people" type="group">Indians</rs> we have slaughtered, and, what is worse, enslaved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>In the veins of tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of our slaves flows the blood of their enslaved <name>Indian</name> ancestors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>To the negro, even more wronged than the <rs>Indian</rs>, we have spared nothing at all of his manhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>Exclusion from participation in political power and from all the rights of citizenship, unpaid, toil and every insult, stripes and chains and death, have been his portion at our unnatural, cruel and fratricidal hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>And can we still &mdash; even now, when our nation is brought to the very brink of destruction, and brought to it so manifestly by pride in our own. race, and contempt and hatred of other races, and when, too, nothing short of the speediest and heartiest repentance can save it &mdash; can we, I ask, still continue to practise all, or even any, of our enormous wrongs against the <rs n="Indian people" type="group">Indians</rs> or the Negroes?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>I think that we cannot afford to.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>You think that we can; for your <persName n="Bill,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00022"><surname>Bill</surname></persName> provides that the liberated slaves, and, in effect, the whole black population of the country, (for it will come to this if your <persName n="Bill,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00023"><surname>Bill</surname></persName> becomes a law, and the nation exist long enough to let it operate to its fullest effect,) shall fall under the exercise not only of special, but, compared with any thing short of slavery, exceedingly tyrannical powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>It provides that they shall be excluded from our political family, put under absolute dictatorship, torn from homes as dear to them as are ours to us, apprenticed without their will, admitted to only qualified rights of property, and so qualified as to pen them up forever in swampy, barren <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, unless they shall be able to get themselves beyond the limits of unceasing, and almost as universal as unceasing <name>American</name> hate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Yes, your <persName n="Bill,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00024"><surname>Bill</surname></persName> provides that, in miserable <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, where the general worthlessness of the soil is indicated by the sparseness of the population, our colored countrymen &mdash; our poor, peeled and persecuted brothers and sisters &mdash; shall be forcibly congregated, and put under the political rule of a handful of whites, who, in such case, can hardly fail to become most terrible despots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Yes, it is in such circumstances that your <persName n="Bill,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00025"><surname>Bill</surname></persName> proposes to have the liberated slaves make their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> allowed experiment in agriculture, and in all material and moral improvement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>The experiment must necessarily prove a failure; and the failure will afford a fresh occasion for ridiculing and despising negroes, and will be unfairly and meanly turned into an argument to justify the oppressions heaped upon them &mdash; all their former oppressions as well as those provided for in your <persName n="Bill,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00026"><surname>Bill</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>I know not that any others will protest against your <persName n="Bill,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00027"><surname>Bill</surname></persName>, but I must.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>By my love of <name n="Divine Providence" type="God">God</name>, my love of man, and my love of country, all of which are deeply wounded by it, I must.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>It will bring our poor country into fresh perils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>It will be a fresh crime against our colored brethren, and a fresh insult to their Maker.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>Why, dear <rs type="role2">Sir</rs>, could you not have framed a <name>Bill</name>, which would provide an easier, lot for these brethren?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Do you reply that their former <num value="1">one</num> was much harder?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>I rejoin, that the harder was that, the easier should be this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>Under the righteous doctrine of recompenses we should, if we could, make their condition now as much happier than that of others as it was before more miserable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>All the greater is this obligation, because our Government was responsible for this more miserable condition &mdash; the received and acted on interpretation of the <rs>Constitution</rs> making the <rs>Government</rs> the great watch-dog of slavery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>I might reasonably ask Congress to do much for the liberated slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>I content myself, however, with asking it simply to recognize, their manhood, and withhold from them no civil nor political rights which it accords to others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>For what else they shall lack to begin their life of freedom, I will trust to private benevolence, and to an endless variety of help outside the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>But would I let such ignorant men vote?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Certainly, if other men as ignorant are allowed to.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>If the right of suffrage is denied to others who cannot write nor read, then, I admit, it should also be denied to such liberated slaves as cannot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>But would I let them go where they please?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>The same right of locomotion would I acknowledge in them as in others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>But they will be lazy unless they are compelled to work!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>Well, what if they will?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>Surely, no others have so good an excuse for being lazy as those who all their lifetime have been, compelled to work, and that, too without wages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>But would I not have them punished for laziness?. Certainly not, unless others are And would I let them intermarry with the whites?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>That is a personal and private matter, with which neither Congress nor any other law-makers have aught to do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>Nevertheless, I am free to say that I, see no objection to a colored lady's accepting the hand of a white gentleman, provided she can possibly surmount her prejudices against his complexion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>But another objection to granting the liberated slaves the rights of men is, that they will then rise up and kill the whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>They will be not a thousandth part-as likely to do so, as if the rights had been withheld.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>I have not heard of a single instance, since their full restoration to manhood, in which <rs type="direction">West</rs> <placeName reg="Bharat" key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName> black men have murdered white men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>I am not opposed to the colonizing of either small or large portions of our colored people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>But, unless we are prepared to acknowledge their equal rights, and to place them on the same civil and political plane with the whites, the colony should by all means be outside of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>If within it, and the population composed chiefly of those, who according to your <persName n="Bill,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00028"><surname>Bill</surname></persName> will be but Pariahs, it will be a very inconvenient, not to say very perilous incongruity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>I prefer the <rs>President</rs>'s Message and <persName n="Trumbull,Mr.,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00029"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Trumbull</surname></persName>'s Bill, at this point, to your <persName n="Bill,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00030"><surname>Bill</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>There was great merit in the plan submitted by <persName n="Blair,Mr.,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00031"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Blair</surname></persName> a few years ago.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>It contemplated, if I recollect, no less than full civil and political rights for the colonists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>The colony, it is true, was to be somewhere outside of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>But this, in then existing circumstances, was unavoidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>Slavery, which is now mortally wounded and rapidly dying, was then in vigorous life; and the slaveholders would not allow a black colony within the. national limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Ere passing from this subject let me admit that, in. my judgment, where the laws of nature allowed free play, the dark-skinned races would find their homes within, and the light-skinned races without the tropics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>But, in all justice, let the dark-skinned be left as free to refuse to migrate to the, tropics as the light-skinned to refuse to migrate from them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>In all our provisions for the liberated slaves, our especial aim should be to have them contented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>A war of races (by far the worst of all wars) is to be constantly and, sedulously avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>We are to remember that there are <num value="12">twelve</num> or <num value="15000000">fifteen millions</num> of negroes on this Continent and the neighboring islands; and that, through the force of deep repentance for her enormous wrongs against poor <placeName>Africa</placeName> and her children, Christendom will, ere long, be brought into the strongest., and. tenderest sympathy with all negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>The day is fast coming when the negroes will be the especial care of many self-accusing and remorseful nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>It was <persName n="Swedenborg,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00032"><surname>Swedenborg</surname></persName>, if I remember, who predicted that the <quote>celestial people</quote> would be discovered in <placeName>Africa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>If but a fancy, it is, nevertheless, a very pleasant <num value="1">one</num>, that the ministries of penitent Christendom will be among <name n="Divine Providence" type="God">God's</name> appointed means for fashioning that <quote>celestial people.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>If the <num value="12">twelve</num> or <num value="15000000">fifteen millions</num>, to whom I have referred, are not yet a formidable foe, nevertheless, unless we prevent it by just and generous dealing with them, they will become such to our posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Flatter not yourself that our emancipated slaves will be contented in an apprenticeship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Those, of the <placeName reg="British Isles" key="tgn,1009896">British Islands</placeName> were not.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Never were they more discontented: and hence, the <rs>British Government</rs> hastened to take them out of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>But you will argue that your plan will bring contentment to the apprentices because, it will bring wages to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>I, on the contrary, will argue that is will thereby; bring additional discontent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>From a false philosophy and a superficial view is it argued that men will be contented in proportion to the rights they get.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>A truer and deeper, insight teaches that, the more of their rights they get, provided they get not all of them, the more are they discontented.</p><quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Anything which, in your Judgment, would subserve their interests, and yet be compatible with the safety of the whites, would, I doubt not, have your favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>But you were probably educated to believe that, <num value="1">one</num> result of their unqualified freedom would be their violence and crimes against the whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Under the like mistake were they who, both in <placeName>Britain</placeName> and <persName n="America,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00034"><surname>America</surname></persName>, predicted that the <placeName reg="British Isles" key="tgn,1009896">British Islands</placeName>, would run blood in the event of the emancipation of their slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>They did not know how affectionate, how patient, and how slow to revenge the negro race is.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>They could not conceive that men, who had suffered such immeasurable wrongs at the hands of the whites, would, in their new-born freedom, prove so harmless to them; and that, too, when the whites were, compared with. themselves, but a powerless handful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Under the like mistake was it that several <name>American</name> vessels, lying in the harbor of <num value="1">one</num> of those Islands, hurried to sea the day before the <rs>Law</rs> of Emancipation went into effect &mdash; so strong was the apprehension that destruction would sweep over the <name type="place">Islands</name> the next day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>And you have, probably, never given your attention to the facts which prove that, when you have blessed the negro with his freedom, he is satisfied, and studies henceforth not to harm, but out of a grateful and loving heart to serve you.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Moreover, you were probably educated to believe that liberated negro slaves, unless continued in some degree of subjection to the whites, must prove unable to take care of themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Nevertheless, there is the testimony of the <placeName reg="British Isles" key="tgn,1009896">British Islands</placeName> to the fact that few people have ever made as rapid progress as their emancipated slaves in knowledge, virtue and wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>That the slaveholders and their allies and tools have been able to make Christendom believe that <name>British</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Emancipation is a failure. is, perhaps, the most striking instance ever known of the power and success of an oft-repeated and shamelessly persisted in lie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>An utter lie is it &mdash; for, in every aspect and every particular, <persName n="Emancipation,,British,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00035"><foreName>British</foreName> <surname>Emancipation</surname></persName> is a triumph and a blessing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>The unquestionable facts to show this were, only the last year, admirably put together in a pamphlet by <persName n="Child,Mrs.,L.,Maria,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00036"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <foreName>Maria</foreName> <surname>Child</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>It is now for Congress to abolish slavery as a military necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>I knew him well only when he became a member of this body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>Our seats here were side by side and, as he was constant in attendance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>I saw him daily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Our acquaintance soon became friendship. quickened by common sympathies, and confirmed by that bond which, according to the ancient historian, is found in the idem sentire de republica.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>In his death I have lost a friend; but the sorrow of friendship is deepened when I think of the loss to <orgName n="Our Country" type="newspaper">our country</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>If he did not impress me at once by personal appearance or voice or manner, yet all these, as we became familiar with them. testified constantly to the unaffected simplicity and integrity of his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>His life, so far as it was not given to his country, was devoted to the labors of agriculture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>He was a farmer, and amidst all the temptations of an eminent public career, he never abandoned this vocation, which does so much to strengthen both body and soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>More than merchant, manufacturer, or lawyer, the agriculturist is independent in his condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>To him the sun and rain and the ever-varying changes of the seasons are agents of prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Dependent upon nature, he learns to be independent of men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Such a person, thus endowed, easily turns away from the behests of party in order to follow those guiding principles which are kindred to the laws of nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Of such a character our friend was a beautiful example.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>In him all the private virtues commingled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>Truthful and frank, he was full of gentleness and generous sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>He had risen from humble fortunes, and his heart throbbed warmly for all who suffered in any way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Especially was he aroused against wrong and injustice wherever they appeared; and then all his softer sentiments were changed into an indomita-ble firmness &mdash; showing that he was <num value="1">one</num> of those beautiful natures where--</p><quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/></p><l part="F">the gods had joined </l><l>The mildest manners and the bravest mind.</l></quote> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>It was this firmness which gave elevation to his public life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>Though companions about him hesitated: though great men on whom he had leaned apostatized. he stood sure and true always for the Right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>Such a person was naturally enlisted against slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>His virtuous soul recoiled from this many-headed barbarism, which had entered into and possessed our National Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>His political philosophy was simply moral philosophy applied to public affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Slavery was wrong; therefore he was against it &mdash; wherever he could justly reach it &mdash; no matter what form it took &mdash; whether of pretension or blandishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>Whether stalking lordly like Satan, or sitting squat like a toad: whether cozening like Mephistopheles. or lurking like a poodle; whether searching as Asmodeus, even to lifting the roofs of the whole country, he saw it always, in all its various manifestations, as the <rs>Spirit</rs> of Evil, and was its constant enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>And now, among the signs that freedom has truly triumphed, is the fact that here, in this <name>Chamber</name>, so long the stronghold of slavery, our homage can be freely offered to <num value="1">one</num> who so fearlessly opposed it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>There was something in our modest friend which seemed especially adapted to private life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>But had he not been a public man, he would have been in his own rural neighborhood at home <num value="1">one</num> of those whose influence was positive for human improvement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>He would have been among those to whose praise <persName n="Clarkson,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00056"><surname>Clarkson</surname></persName> has testified so authoritatively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/><quote>I have had occasion,</quote> says this philanthropist, <quote>to know many <num value="1000">thousand</num> persons in the course of my travels, and I can truly say that the part they took on this great question &mdash; of the abolition of the slave trade &mdash; was always a true criterion of their moral nature,</quote> But he was not allowed to continue in retirement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>His country had need of him, and he became a member of the <rs>Michigan Legislature</rs>, and <persName n="Speaker,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00057"><surname>Speaker</surname></persName> of its House &mdash; <rs type="role2">Representative</rs> in <placeName>Congress</placeName> &mdash; <rs type="role2">Governor</rs>, and then <rs type="role" reg="Senator">Senator</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. This distinguished career was stamped always by the simplicity of his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>The <rs>Roman Cato</rs> was not more simple or determined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>He came into public life when Compromise was the order of the day, but he never yielded to it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>He was a member of the <persName><foreName>Democratic</foreName></persName> party, which was the declared tool of slavery, but he never allowed slavery to make a tool of him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>All this should now be spoken in his honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>To omit it on this occasion would be to forget those titles by which hereafter he will be most gratefully remembered.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>There were <num value="2">two</num> important questions, while he was a member of the other <orgName n="House" type="military">House</orgName>, on which his name is recorded for <placeName>Freedom</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was on the famous proposition introduced by <persName n="Wilmot,Mr.,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00058"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wilmot</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, for the prohibition of slavery in the <name type="place">Territories</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>On this question he separated from his party, and always firmly voted in the affirmative. Had his voice at that time prevailed, slavery would have been checked, and the vast conspiracy under which we now suffer would have received an early death-blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>The other question on which his record is so honorable was the <persName n="Bill,,Fugitive,Slave,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00059"><foreName>Fugitive</foreName> <foreName>Slave</foreName> <surname>Bill</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>From that, time forward his influence was felt in his own State for freedom, and when, at a later day, he entered the <orgName n="Senate" type="military">Senate</orgName>, he became known instantly as <num value="1">one</num> of our surest and most faithful <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, whose determined constancy was more eloquent for freedom than a speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>During all recent trials, he never for <num value="1">one</num> moment wavered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>With the instincts of an honest statesman, he saw the situation, and accepted frankly and bravely the responsibilities of the hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>He set his face against concession in any degree and in every form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>We cannot view the subject in this light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>Our mission is the same now that it was <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> ago.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>Through many and strange changes, we have slowly but steadily advanced toward its fulfillment; but there are many indications that our work is not yet in a state to be safely left to other hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>We have been, and we must still be, a fire to warm the atmosphere of public opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>More than <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a century ago, the fire was kindled with generous zeal, and year after year it has been fed with untiring industry and patience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>(Hear, hear.) That gentleman has already collected a very considerable sum for his church in <placeName>Canada</placeName>, and is now desirous of completing the amount as speedily as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>In recommending his cause to your favorable consideration, I can assure you not only of its worthiness of support, but that there is every possible guarantee that the funds obtained by <persName n="Kinnaird,Mr.,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00362"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Kinnaird</surname></persName> are duly appropriated to the objects of his mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>(Hear, hear.) With regard to slavery, there can be but <num value="1">one</num> feeling in an <name>English</name> meeting Upon the subject (hear,)--for, although <placeName>England</placeName>, has abolished slavery in her own dominions, her sympathy with the bondman has not ceased, and the claims of the <name>American</name> slave, when brought fairly before the <name>British</name> public, never fail to meet with an earnest and warm hearted response.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>(Cheers.) If the <rs n="American people" type="group">Americans</rs> will not adopt anti-slavery opinions, it is not because they have never been told better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>(Hear.) I am proud to say that we have some gentlemen here to-night, who have been the means of teaching the <rs n="American people" type="group">Americans</rs> better.

Regarding the war now raging in <placeName>America</placeName>, let it be understood that the <rs>South</rs> are emphatically fighting for slavery, though I will not say that the <rs>North</rs> are entirely anti-slavery; but knowing the <rs>South</rs> to be so unquestionably pro-slavery, we cannot but feel a sympathy with their opponents to at least as great an extent as their own anti-slavery principles go.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>(Hear, hear.)

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>The important object which had brought him there to-night grew out of that accursed system of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>If it were not for that disgraceful institution, he did not believe that there would be a single countryman of his begging in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>(Hear.) He could hardly be said to be begging now for his own countrymen, because, when they reached <placeName>Canada</placeName>, he looked upon them as subjects of the <rs>British Crown</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>(Hear.) <placeName>Canada</placeName> was the brightest spot on earth to the fugitive slave, for it was to him a place of refuge from all his hardships and all his wrongs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>It was the only spot upon the <name>American</name> continent where a colored person was recognized as a man, or where he could call himself, his wife or his child his own.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>The slaveholder claimed to be a <name n="Divine Providence" type="God">god</name> in his own country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>In all questions of religion; the slaveholders desired to be omnipotent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>Whatever the master was, <rs n="Roman Catholic" type="religion">Roman Catholic</rs>, <persName><foreName>Baptist</foreName></persName> or <placeName>Presbyterian</placeName>, that the slave must be.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>The slave was not allowed to choose with what denomination he should worship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>He must do whatever his master told him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>The negro had no appeal from his master's decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>If his master decided that he was to be burnt, he was burnt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>If his master decided that his right hand was to be cut off, it was cut off.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>Slavery, he emphatically declared, was an abomination of the blackest dye.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>The tyrannical and brutal influences of slavery were shown in the treatment of those who tad been possessed of the moral courage to tell the <rs n="American people" type="group">Americans</rs> the enormity of their crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>Look at the influence of slavery even in the <orgName n="Senate" type="military">Senate</orgName>, as evidenced in that shameful outrage upon <persName n="Sumner,,Charles,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00375"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>Slavery denied the right of <persName n="Christ,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00376"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>'s reign, and claimed to reign, for itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/><persName n="Kinnaird,Mr.,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00377"><roleName n="Mr.">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Kinnaird</surname></persName> next made reference to his own visits to <placeName>Canada</placeName>, and stated his conviction that much could be done to elevate the position of the colored man, after his escape from bondage had been completed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>He had noticed the want of an institution for their secular and religions education, by which they might be enabled to assume respectable positions in society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>He had, therefore, come to this country, with a view to complete the establishment of a church, a school, and a temporary home for colored refugees in <placeName>Hamilton</placeName>, <rs type="direction">West</rs> <placeName reg="Canada" key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>. By the erection of an institution combining these qualities, the poor fugitive who found his way to that spot need not be without food or lodging andthe means would be at hand for his education and employment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>The total cost of the building would be Zzzz.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>He already collected <persName n="Zzz,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00378"><surname>Zzz</surname></persName> <num value="120">120</num> since his arrival in <placeName>England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>The walls of the building were now up, and his friends in <placeName>America</placeName> wrote to say they wanted about <measure n="80l." type="pounds">&pound; <num value="80">80</num></measure> more to put the roof on.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>(Laughter and cheers.) Having passed a high compliment to the <rs>Anti-Slavery League</rs>, the Rev. gentleman resumed his seat amidst great applause.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>He might, however, state that, although they had commenced on a small scale, they had now greatly extended their operations, and frequently held meetings in large halls, which he was glad to say were always crowded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>(Hear.) The <rs>Anti-Slavery League</rs> was a desideratum, the want of which had long been felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>He was Very glad of its formation, and should always feel happy to render it his best assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>(Cheers.)

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>It was a good and noble idea to educate and clothe the poor fugitives from slaveholding tyranny, and fit them for the ordinary paths of life, that they might give the lie to the unjust assertion that the black man was inferior to the white.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>By the way, it may be that we did act illegally in not seizing the ship as well as the rebels, and subjecting her to a formal trial; but if in this we fell into a mistake, could <placeName>England</placeName> be so mean as to make war upon us for it?--for a mistake which was prompted by a kind and generous regard for the comfort and interests of <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>Surely, if <placeName>England</placeName> is not noble enough to refuse to punish for any mere mistake, she is, nevertheless, not monstrous enough to punish for the mistake, which grew solely out of the desire to serve her.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>But wherein have we harmed <placeName>England</placeName> in this matter We have insulted her, is the:answer in We have not however, intended to insult her: and an unintended insult is really no insult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>If, in my eagerness to overtake the man who has deeply injured me, I run rudely through my neighbor's house, be will not only not accuse me of insulting him, but he will pardon so much to my very excusable eagerness as to leave but little ground of any kind of complaint against me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>She could not make so causeless a war upon us, without deeply and broadly blotting her own character; and the character of modern civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>But, after all, what better is our modern civilization than a mere blot and boteh if the nation, which is preeminently its exponent, can be guilty, and without the least real cause of provocation, and upon pretexts as frivolous as they are false, of seeking to destroy a sister nation?--a sister nation, too, whose present embarrassments and distresses appeal so strongly to every good heart?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>The conduct of ours, on the contrary, was prompted by the spirit and purpose of doing right; and if, in any respect, it was erroneous, it was simply in regard to the forms of doing right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>Moreover, the guilt of her <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> can be diminished by nothing that was seemingly or really guilty in ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>The criminality of taking the rebels into the <rs>Trent</rs> was none the less, because of any mistakes which attended the getting of them out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>Nevertheless, <placeName>England</placeName> takes no action against him.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>How preposterous is the claim of <placeName>England</placeName> to her right to make war, because we took our rebellious subjects from her ship!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>The taking of them into her ship is the only thing in the case which can possibly furnish cause of war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>That, unless amply apologized for, does, in the light of international law, furnish abundant cause of war.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>Which of the parties in this instance needs conscience-quickening, is no less certain than in the instance of the footpad and the traveller, whom he had robbed of his bags of gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>And yet <placeName>England</placeName> bids us to our conscience.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>Why should <placeName>England</placeName> protect her <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>Her <rs type="role2">Queen</rs>, in her last <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>'s Proclamation, warned him that, for doing what he has done, he should <quote>in no wise obtain any protection.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>He had full knowledge of the official character of the rebels, and at least inferential knowledge of their bearing dispatches with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>But, besides that the whole spirit of it is against what he has done, her Proclamation specifies <quote>officers</quote> and <quote>dispatches</quote> in the list of what her subjects are prohibited to carry <quote>for the use or service of either of the contending parties.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/></p> 
<p><placeName>England</placeName> did not protect the <rs>Captain</rs> of her mailsteamer, <placeName>Teviot</placeName>, who, during our war with <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, was guilty of carrying the <placeName>Mexican</placeName> <persName n="Paredez,General,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00403"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Paredez</surname></persName>. He was suspended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>Why does she spare the <rs>Captain</rs> of the <placeName>Trent</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>Is it because she has more sympathy with the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> than she had with <placeName>Mexico</placeName>?--and is, therefore, more tender toward him who serves the former, than she was toward him who served the latter?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1036"/>But it will, perhaps, be said, that we have not demanded satisfaction in this case as we did in that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/><placeName>England</placeName>, nevertheless, knows that we tire entitled to it; and that she is bound to satisfy us for the wrongs she did us, before she complains of the way we took to save ourselves from the deep injury with which that great and guilty wrong threatened us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/>In this connexion, I add, that if, upon her own principles and precedents, the <rs>Captain</rs> of the <rs>Trent</rs> deserves punishment for what he did, she is stopped from magnifying into a grave offence undoing what he did.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1039"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>. The next thing which <placeName>England</placeName> should do is to give instructions, or rather to repeat those in the <rs>Queen</rs>'s Proclamation, that no more rebel <rs type="role2">Commissioners</rs> be received into her vessels.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/><num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>. And then she should inform us whether, in the case of a vessel that shall hereafter offend in this f wise, she would have us take the vessel itself, or take but the <rs>Commissioners</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>It is true that, whatever her preference, we would probably insist in every case in taking the vessel:--for it is not probable that we shall again expose ourselves in such a case to the charge of taking too little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/>It is, however, also true, that, should she prefer our taking the vessel, we will certainly never take less.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1043"/>But such instructions and information, although they would provide for future cases, would leave the present case unprovided for; and <placeName>England</placeName> might still say that she could not acquiesce in hour having, in this case, taken the <rs>Commissioners</rs> instead of the vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/>What then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/>She ought to be content with the expression of our regret that we did not take the mode of her choice, and the more so as that mode could not have been followed by any different result in respect to our getting possession of the <rs>Commissioners</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>But this might not satisfy her:--and what then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>She should generously wait until this unnatural and horrid war is off our hands; and if the parties could not then agree, they should submit the case to an <name>Umpire</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/>If, however, she should call for an <persName n="Umpire,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00404"><surname>Umpire</surname></persName> now, then, although the civilized world would think badly of her for it and our own nation be very slow to forgive her for it, I would, nevertheless, in my abhorrence of all war, have our Government consent to an <persName n="Umpire,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00405"><surname>Umpire</surname></persName> now.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1049"/>Nay, in the spirit of this abhorrence, and for the sake of peace, I would go much farther.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1050"/>If no other concession we could make would satisfy <placeName>England</placeName>, I would have our Government propose to surrender the rebels, <persName n="Mason,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00406"><surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00407"><surname>Slidell</surname></persName>, in case the <rs>English Government</rs> would say, distinctly and solemnly, that it would not itself disturb neutral vessels having on board rebels who had gone out from <placeName>England</placeName> in quest of foreign aid to overturn the <rs>English Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1051"/>An ineffably base Government would it prove itself to be should it refuse to say this, and yet declare war on the ground of our capture of rebels who were on their way for foreign help to overturn our government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1052"/>I spoke of my abhorrence of all war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1053"/>Our lifelong opponents of war find themselves unexpectedly in sympathy with mighty armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1054"/>They have to confess that they never anticipated a rebellion so vast; still less did they ever anticipate that <placeName>England</placeName> would be guilty of coming to the help of such a satanic rebellion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1055"/>I have said that <placeName>England</placeName> will not go to war with us in the case of the <rs>Trent</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1056"/>Nevertheless, I am not without fear that her Government will be driven to declare, war against us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/>The <rs>Government</rs> of no other nation (and this is honorable to <placeName>England</placeName>) is more influenced by the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1058"/>By such an affair as the capture of <persName n="Mason,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00408"><surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00409"><surname>Slidell</surname></persName>, the patriotism of the least-informed and superfieial and excitable part of her people is easily and extensively wrought upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1059"/>With this part of her people the inviolability of the <name>British</name> flag is more than all earth besides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1060"/>But it is not by that capture nor by those classes to whom it appeals with such peculiar power, that the <rs>Government</rs> will be moved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1061"/>If an irresistible pressure comes upon the <rs>Government</rs>, it will come from those people who long for the cotton and the free trade of the <rs>South</rs> and who have allowed themselves to get angry with the <rs>North</rs> by foolishly misconstruing our high tariff (which is simply a necessary war measure) into a hostile commercial measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1062"/>The capture of <persName n="Mason,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00410"><surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,,,,," key="n-0001.0000.00000.00411"><surname>Slidell</surname></persName> will be only the pretext not the provocation; only the occasion, not the cause of the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1063"/>If <placeName>England</placeName> wishes to go to war with us for any wrongs we have done her, she shall not have the chance &mdash; for we will promptly repair the wrongs, at whatever sacrifice of property or pride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1064"/>But if, as I still honor and love her too much to believe, she wishes to go to war with us at any rate, and chooses this our time of trouble as her time to make us an easy prey, then: will she be gratified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1065"/>It will be but fail, however, to advertise her that she must not take our fighting in the war with the rebels as a sample of what will be our fighting in the war with herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1066"/>The former is fooling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1067"/>The latter will be fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>On all subjects: connected with slavery, and therefore in a war about slavery, we <rs n="American people" type="group">Americans</rs> are fools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1075"/>And it will awake to assert itself, not merely against the <rs>English</rs>, but against the rebels also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1076"/>And it will do this mightily because it will, at the same time, be asserting it-self against its own life-long degradations arid the hateful cause of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/>Let us but know that <placeName>England</placeName>, to whom we have done no wrong, has resolved to come to the help of the <rs>Pro-Slavery Rebellion</rs> and our deep indignation against her, combining with our deeper indignation against ourselves, will arm us with the spirit and the power to snap the <quote>cords,</quote> and <quote>green withs,</quote> and <quote>new ropes,</quote> with which slavery has bound us, and to dash to the dust the foul idol whose worship has so demented and debased us.
