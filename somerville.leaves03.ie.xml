<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>the canal began at Middlesex Village, on the <placeName reg="Merrimack River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7021005">Merrimac river</placeName> in the town of <placeName reg="Chelmsford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2234243">Chelmsford</placeName>, and was lifted through a connected flight of <num value="3">three</num> locks, passing under the main street over an aqueduct across the brook-near which are some quaint old houses erected by the proprietors for the use of their employes &mdash;and through the long swamp to <placeName reg="River Meadow Brook, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1135362">River Meadow brook</placeName>, also crossed by aqueduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Thence it was continued to <placeName key="tgn,2049421" n="1.000 11" reg="billerica, middlesex county, massachusetts">Billerica</placeName>, where it entered the <placeName reg="Concord, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1123016">Concord river</placeName> by a stone guard lock, with a floating tow path, and passed out on the southern side through another stone guard lock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>The canal is still used by the <rs type="place">Talbot mills</rs> at <placeName key="tgn,2050255" n="1.000 1" reg="north billerica, middlesex, massachusetts">North Billerica</placeName> for the supply of water for power, and in this connection they have retained <num value="1">one</num> of the lock gates, thus saving for us <num value="1">one</num> of the best preserved and most interesting features of the old canal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>On the south bank of the <placeName reg="Concord, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1123016">Concord river</placeName> an extensive cutting through rocks was necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>The <placeName key="tgn,1129932" n="1.000 3" reg="shawsheen, massachusetts, united states">Shawsheen river</placeName> flows through a deep and narrow valley, and the stone work for the aqueduct constituted perhaps the most imposing structure on the canal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/><num value="2">Two</num> end abutments and a central pier, all stone, supported a wooden truck or box about <measure n="180feet" type="distance">180 feet</measure> long, elevated <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure> above the river, and of sufficient width and depth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>The abutments and pier remain undisturbed to this day, with some decaying fragments of the oaken truck still clinging to the pier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The highway and electric car line pass within a few feet of this monument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/><pb id="p.2" n="2"/></p> 
<p>Half a mile further south was <persName n="Nichols,,,,," id="n0303.0001.00002.00002" reg="mostcommon:Nichols,nomatch:0"><surname>Nichols</surname></persName>' lock, a portion of which still remains as a part of a cellar wall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>He was a successful farmer, and, in addition, kept an excellent inn for the accommodation of travelers on the canal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>There were many of these, and <persName n="Nichols,,,,," id="n0303.0001.00002.00004" reg="mostcommon:Nichols,nomatch:0"><surname>Nichols</surname></persName>' was a favorite place for dinner or a night's lodging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>In <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> the canal passed through wide, boggy meadows, where the bed sank some <measure n="60feet" type="distance">sixty feet</measure>; crossed the <rs type="place">Maple Meadow brook</rs> near the poor farm by another aqueduct, of which the remains are very picturesque; and then made an abrupt bend around the foot of a hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>This bend was called the <name>Oxbow</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>A mile further south the canal entered the town of <placeName reg="Woburn, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2051000">Woburn</placeName>, passing within a short distance of the house of <persName n="Baldwin,,Loammi,,," id="n0303.0001.00002.00005" reg="default:Baldwin,Loammi,,,"><foreName>Loammi</foreName> <surname>Baldwin</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Just to the north of <placeName reg="Woburn station">Woburn station</placeName> a picturesque view of the canal may be had from the railroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The canal has here been transformed into a duckpond, the width being preserved, but each end of the pond being formed by a dam and the railroad embankment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The canal crossed the swamp, where great quantities of earth were sunk in forming the bed and side banks, and passed to the rear of the present public library building and under the road near <placeName reg="Wilson's Tavern">Wilson's Tavern</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>This tavern has since been the homestead of the late <rs>Ruel Carter</rs>, and was destroyed by fire about <dateStruct value="1886--"><year reg="1886">1886</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The canal passed through <placeName reg="Horn Pond, Berkshire, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2399397">Horn pond</placeName>, where there was a very important engineering feature, and known as <placeName reg="Horn Pond, Berkshire, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2399397">Horn pond</placeName>, or <persName n="Stoddard,,,,," id="n0303.0001.00002.00006" reg="mostcommon:Stoddard,nomatch:0"><surname>Stoddard</surname></persName> locks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>At this point there was a descent of <measure n="50feet" type="distance">fifty feet</measure> by <num value="3">three</num> sets of double stone locks, the middle set being separated from that above and below by a basin-line expansion or widening of the canal, by which the draft of water by locking was equalized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/><num value="2">Two</num> of these locks were of hammered granite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>These locks were so near <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, the journey thither in the packet boat, <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Sullivan,General,,,," id="n0303.0001.00002.00007" reg="nearbymention:Sullivan,James,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sullivan</surname></persName>,</q> was such a pleasant <num value="1">one</num>, the view of the canal and lake was so picturesque and interesting, that the place speedily became a popular resort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Pleasure boats plied the lake, <persName n="Kendall,,,,," id="n0303.0001.00002.00008" reg="mostcommon:Kendall,nomatch:0"><surname>Kendall</surname></persName>'s Boston <orgName n="Brass Band" type="band">brass band</orgName> and the <orgName n="Boston Brigade Band" type="band">Brigade band of Boston</orgName> rendered sweet harmony, and the crowds wandered from the groves to the lake and back to the canal, where shots of lumber-rafts and canal-boats laden with cargoes were <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> continually passing through the locks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>So popular did the place become that in <dateStruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></dateStruct> the <rs type="place">Horn Pond House</rs> was leased for <measure n="700dollars" type="currency">$700</measure> for that year.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>After passing out of the <rs type="place">Horn Pond</rs> locks, the canal continued on down to the <rs type="place">Horn Pond brook</rs>, crossing it at grade by means of waste weirs, which remain to this day in a fair state of preservation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>In <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> the canal passed through <persName n="Gardner,,,,," id="n0303.0001.00003.00009" reg="nearbymention:Gardner,Henry,,,"><surname>Gardner</surname></persName> locks, located at the <rs>West</rs> side of the village, and on through to <placeName reg="Mystic Pond, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2534271">Mystic pond</placeName>, crossing the narrow upper arm of the pond over a stone aqueduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The bed of the canal is plainly visible here, and it is hoped the bed will remain untouched while the <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> of Progress is still moving on, converting the shores of <placeName reg="Mystic Pond, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2534271">Mystic pond</placeName> into a beautiful boulevard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>For something over a mile the canal lay within the grounds of the <rs type="place">Brooks</rs> estate in <placeName reg="West Medford">West Medford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Here stands a beautiful monument, that of the handsome elliptical stone arch, built by <persName n="Baldwin,,George,Rumford,," id="n0303.0001.00003.00010" reg="default:Baldwin,George,Rumford,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>Rumford</foreName> <surname>Baldwin</surname></persName>, son of <persName n="Baldwin,,Loammi,,," id="n0303.0001.00003.00011" reg="default:Baldwin,Loammi,,,"><foreName>Loammi</foreName> <surname>Baldwin</surname></persName>, to convey a farm road over the canal, and considered by engineers to be <num value="1">one</num> of the most graceful structures of the sort in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>It is plainly visible as <num value="1">one</num> is journeying along by the <rs type="place">Brooks farm</rs> in the electric cars.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The line of the old canal is where <address><street n="Boston avenue">Boston avenue</street></address> is now situated, passing through <persName n="Gibson,,,,," id="n0303.0001.00003.00012" reg="mostcommon:Gibson,nomatch:0"><surname>Gibson</surname></persName>'s lock and the aqueduct over the <placeName reg="Mystic, Massachusetts, United States" key="tgn,1127517">Mystic river</placeName>, at a point where the new stone bridge now is, then turning to the east the canal passed under the bridge of the <placeName reg="Lowell, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013975">Lowell</placeName> road,&mdash;the wing walls of this bridge are yet plainly visible,&mdash;and on past the <rs type="place">Royall House</rs>, where the canal passed under <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address> and sent off a branch to the river, for the benefit of the ship-yards of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> and <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName>; and so on through the <rs>Mystic</rs> trotting park to the base of <placeName reg="Winter Hill, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2777828">Winter hill</placeName>, <placeName reg="Somerville, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050602">Somerville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>From this point the canal followed the line of the high land around to the short bend in the <placeName reg="Mystic, Massachusetts, United States" key="tgn,1127517">Mystic river</placeName>, where <persName n="Dunning,,,,," id="n0303.0001.00003.00013" reg="mostcommon:Dunning,nomatch:0"><surname>Dunning</surname></persName>'s coal wharf is at present located; then to the south, through nearly the centre of the <rs>Broadway</rs> park; around the base of <placeName reg="Mount Benedict, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2162802">Mount Benedict</placeName>,&mdash;now nearly dug away,&mdash;across the foot of <address><street n="Austin street">Austin street</street></address>, where the gate-house may still be seen; then nearly parallel to <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address>, <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName>, to the <name>Neck</name>, where it passed under <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address>, through a lock and into the millpond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/><pb id="p.4" n="4"/> Most of the cargoes were loaded here, but for those wishing carriage to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> there was a lock with double gates working either way, according to the state of the tide, for admission into, the <placeName key="tgn,1122705" n="1.000 1" reg="Charles River, Massachusetts, United States, North and Central America">Charles river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Once in the river, it was an easy matter to reach any of the city wharves; but there was also an extension of the canal through what is now <address><street n="Haymarket square">Haymarket square</street></address>-<address><street n="Canal street">Canal street</street></address> being directly alongside&mdash;following nearly the lines of <address><street n="Blackstone street">Blackstone street</street></address> to the harbor, near what is now <address><street n="North Market street">North Market street</street></address>. Nearly all of the stone for <placeName reg="Quincy market">Quincy market</placeName> was brought over this route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>On the map of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, in the <rs type="place">Old State House</rs> in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, the canal can be traced under Cross, <placeName reg="Hanover, Plymouth, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049868">Hanover</placeName>, and <persName><foreName>Ann</foreName></persName>&mdash;now North street&mdash;along <address><street n="Canal street">Canal street</street></address>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>It is difficult to ascertain the whole number of boats employed at any <num value="1">one</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Many were owned and run by the proprietors of the canal, and many were constructed and run by private parties who paid the regular tolls for whatever merchandise they carried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The original toll was placed at twopence per ton per mile; it was afterward, by Act of Legislature, placed at <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="16" type="ordinal">sixteenth</num> of a dollar per ton per mile for goods carried in the boats, and the same for every ton of timber floated in rafts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The actual rates ranged from <num value="1">one</num> to <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">two dollars</measure> per gross ton for the <placeName><distance reg="27miles">twenty-seven miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName></placeName> to <persName n="Lowell,,,,," id="n0303.0001.00004.00014" reg="mostcommon:Lowell,nomatch:0"><surname>Lowell</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Boats belonging to the same parties were conspicuously numbered and lettered, and private boats, of which there were many, were painted with such designs as to be easily recognized, as in the case of freight cars of to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The luggage or merchandise boats, of which there are probably none in existence, were peculiarly constructed to meet the requirements of canal navigation, and the mode of propulsion was as peculiar as their model.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>They were about <measure n="75feet" type="distance">seventy-five feet</measure> long, <measure n="9feet" type="distance">nine feet</measure> wide in the middle, and a little narrowed at the ends; flat-bottomed across the full width, but the bottom sloped or rounded up from near the mid-length of the boat, both towards the stem and stern, so that while the sides were level on top and about <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> deep at mid-length they were only a foot or less in depth at either end. A load of <num value="20">twenty</num> tons would make the boats draw <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> or more near the middle, while the bottom would be <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> out of the water at each end. They were built of <measure n="2inch" type="distance">two-inch</measure> pine planks spiked on to small oak cross-joints and side knees, and had heavy oak horizontal timbers at each end. The sides were vertical and without cross thwarts, except what was called the mast board, a thick oak plank securely fastened across on top from side to side a little forward of the centre of the boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The seams between the planks were calked with oakum and pitched.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The rudder was a long steering oar pivoted on the centre of the cross frame of the stern, so as to afford a good leverage for guiding the unwieldy craft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The blade was about <measure n="18inches" type="distance">eighteen inches</measure> wide and <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure> long, and trailed in the water behind the boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>There were also <num value="3">three</num> large scull oars about <measure n="16feet" type="distance">sixteen feet</measure> long, with <measure n="6inch" type="distance">six-inch</measure> blades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/><num value="3">Three</num> setting poles or pike poles, as they are sometimes called (stout, straight, round poles, wrought out of tough and spongy ash about <measure n="15feet" type="distance">fifteen feet</measure> long, nearly <measure n="2inches" type="distance">two inches</measure> in diameter, and shed at <num value="1">one</num> end with a long iron point), completed the propelling outfit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The crew consisted of a skipper and <num value="2">two</num> bowmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>In going down the <placeName reg="Merrimack River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7021005">Merrimac river</placeName> the scull oars were used, and when there was a fair wind a sail was hoisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>In going down the river, the bowmen took positions close to either side of the boat facing the bow and about <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> from it, and each worked his oar against a thole-pin placed in the opposite gunwale, the oar handles crossing so that they were necessarily worked simultaneously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The skipper also had his oar, which he worked in a similar way when his attention was not wholly taken up in steering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>When the boats arrived at Middlesex Village, they were then towed to <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName> by horses, frequently without a driver, in which case the man at the rudder kept a small pile of stones or green apples ready for the encouragement of the horse.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>In mid-summer, when the river was low, only about half a full load could be carried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/><num value="3">Three</num> boats each way a week were run. The fare from <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> to <placeName reg="Middlesex Village, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2510683">Middlesex</placeName> was <measure n="75cents" type="currency">seventy-five cents</measure>, and from <placeName reg="Middlesex Village, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2510683">Middlesex</placeName> to <persName n="Lowell,,,,," id="n0303.0001.00005.00015" reg="mostcommon:Lowell,nomatch:0"><surname>Lowell</surname></persName> <num value="6">six</num> and <num value="1">one</num>-quarter cents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>A stage met the boats at <placeName reg="Middlesex Village, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2510683">Middlesex</placeName> to carry passengers to <persName n="Lowell,,,,," id="n0303.0001.00005.00016" reg="mostcommon:Lowell,nomatch:0"><surname>Lowell</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The pay for a boatman in <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct> was <measure n="15dollars" type="currency">$15</measure> per month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Luggage or merchandise boats made <measure n="2.5miles" type="distance">two and one-half miles</measure> per hour, while <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> passage boats made <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure>. The time required to go from <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> to <persName n="Lowell,,,,," id="n0303.0001.00006.00017" reg="mostcommon:Lowell,nomatch:0"><surname>Lowell</surname></persName> was about <measure n="12hours" type="date">twelve hours</measure>, and to <placeName reg="Concord, Merrimack, New Hampshire" key="tgn,7013647">Concord, N.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Of the passage boats there were at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="2">two</num>, <num value="1">one</num> running up and <num value="1">one</num> down daily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Later, when the amount of travel proved insufficient to warrant <num value="2">two</num> boats, <num value="1">one</num> was removed, and the <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Sullivan,Governor,,,," id="n0303.0001.00006.00019" reg="nearbymention:Sullivan,James,,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Sullivan</surname></persName></q> ran alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>This was a boat on the style of the <rs type="place">Erie canal</rs>-boats, though somewhat lighter, with a covered cabin over the whole length, except for the standing room at each end. The cabin was provided with seats, and was upholstered much as the horse cars of a decade ago. In its day the <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Sullivan,Governor,,,," id="n0303.0001.00006.00020" reg="nearbymention:Sullivan,James,,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Sullivan</surname></persName></q> was considered a model of comfort and elegance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>When the feverish haste born of the locomotives and telegraph had not yet infested society, a trip over the canal in the passenger packet <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Sullivan,Governor,,,," id="n0303.0001.00006.00021" reg="nearbymention:Sullivan,James,,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Sullivan</surname></persName></q> must have been an enjoyable experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Protected by iron rules from the danger of collision, undaunted by squalls of wind, realizing, should the craft be capsized, that he had nothing to do but walk ashore, the traveler speeding along the leisurely pace of <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> per hour had ample time for observation and reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Seated in summer under a spacious awning, he traversed the <rs type="place">valley of the Mystic</rs>, skirting the picturesque shores of <placeName reg="Mystic Pond, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2534271">Mystic pond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Instead of a foreground of blurred landscapes, vanishing ghostlike, ere its features could be fairly distinguished, soft bits of characteristic <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> scenery, cut clear as cameos, lingered caressingly on his vision.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>A large amount of lumber was being used during this period by the ship-yards on the <placeName reg="Mystic, Massachusetts, United States" key="tgn,1127517">Mystic river</placeName>, and nearly all of it being rafted down the canal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>By the regulations, these rafts could not be larger than <measure n="75feet" type="distance">seventy-five feet</measure> by <measure n="9.5feet" type="distance">nine and one-half feet</measure>; but a number of rafts could be banded together by slabs pinned between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>A band of <num value="7">seven</num> to <num value="10">ten</num> rafts required <num value="5">five</num> men, including the driver; <num value="4">four</num> rafts required <num value="4">four</num> men, and <num value="3">three</num> rafts <num value="3">three</num> men. These rafts were unpinned and sent through the locks separately, and then again united.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>As yet, there is no mention of schoolhouses, and, although they may have been built by private subscription&mdash;little cheap affairs&mdash;it is more probable that, for some years, at least, the benefits of education were dispensed in private rooms hired for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>From a study of conditions in some of the neighboring towns, we learn that it was customary, at this period of our history, for the poorer and more sparsely&mdash;settled districts to have an itinerant schoolmaster, who devoted himself for a stated period&mdash;say a month or <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure>&mdash;to <num value="1">one</num> section of the town, and so on until all had been similarly served.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The only way left was for the schoolmaster to circulate about, to time his peregrinations so as to suit the convenience of his constituents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>We tried to imagine the place and the country round as it looked then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>I wish,</q> she added, <q direct="unspecified">I could live, if only for a week or so, in those times, to see how this region looked, and to see the men,&mdash;Washington and <persName n="Putnam,,,,," id="n0303.0010.00058.00561" reg="mostcommon:Putnam,nomatch:0"><surname>Putnam</surname></persName> and the rest.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/></p> 
<p>The regular course in history had been covered, but the teacher had not known of any such longings to live &mdash; in another century, to see for herself how things were, and how the country looked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>That <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lesson in local history had come home, had appealed to the imagination, and had thoroughly aroused the interest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>A few years ago, in the city of <placeName reg="Malden, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1126718">Malden</placeName>, in a school not far from the site of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meeting house erected in that region, a discussion arose as to what had become of the old bell that had been mounted near the meeting house on an eminence still known as <placeName reg="Belle Rock, San Juan, Washington" key="tgn,2161706">Bell Rock</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>It was learned that, strange and unusual as it may be, dissension had arisen in the little church, due rather to the differences and strength of opinions than to the size of the society, and that <num value="1">one</num> roof would not comfortably cover the warring brothers and sisters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>Another meeting house having been built, a struggle for possession of the bell began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/><num value="1">One</num> party hid it in the well of the near-by parsonage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>This was as far as the children could trace it. <num value="1">One</num> morning the boys, quite excited about the matter, suggested a plan to <q direct="unspecified">chip in,</q> as they said, and have the bell dug up. Further inquiries, however, revealed the fact that it had been raised, and placed on a schoolhouse, and when that structure was destroyed years after, the bell was broken up and the pieces distributed about town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>Finally <num value="1">one</num> of the class triumphantly brought a piece of the same old bell to school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>A trifling affair, truly, but the spontaneous, enthusiastic interest in the early history of the place, indicated by the persistent efforts of the children and by their readiness to contribute their money to secure and preserve an old relic, is no trifle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>There are, however, serious difficulties operating against the teaching of this important subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>The teacher who is without family ties in the place, or other than a professional association with it, is quite apt to lack not only a knowledge of its past, but <pb id="p.59" n="59"/> also an interest in it. But assuming a willingness to do this work, she looks over the course of study and her program to find a place for it,&mdash;possibly to see what she can omit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>Can we blame her if the latter is the stronger motive?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>Consider, there are but <measure n="5hours" type="date">five hours</measure> in a school day,&mdash;the child's day, not the teacher's&mdash;and in them she must teach, somehow and at some time, reading, writing, arithmetic, bookkeeping, spelling, geography, grammar and language, drawing and painting, music, sewing, science, or nature studies, physiology, with special lessons on narcotics and stimulants, study of selected authors and their representative works, manners and morals, besides keeping all the school machinery running smoothly and properly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>There are many other things, almost <q direct="unspecified">too numerous to mention,</q> not laid down in the course of study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>She must prepare special exercises for the sessions preceding public holidays, regularly inspect, count, and repair books, keep registers and pupils' records, make frequent reports to parents and to school officials, etc. In the multiplicity of subjects crowded into the school, something is sure to be squeezed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>It will be that of which the teacher has the least knowledge to begin with, and in which the requirements and the supervision are least exacting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>Hence the neglect of local history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>Teachers are provided with nothing but an incomplete, illarranged list of topics, and are wholly without desk reference books.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>But in spite of difficulties, it is possible to accomplish much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>Local history does not call for great teaching ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>Sub-divisions of some of these topics would, of course, be made as events require, my effort being directed to an orderly arrangement with topics broad enough to include all the knowledge that may be gained, with a place for every fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>The arrangement is, in the main, necessarily chronological, excepting that under such topics as education or religious life, we should bring together in order all the facts, from earliest to present times; or, again, if we are studying the business life of the city, we should go back to <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> conditions and follow events, searching for the causes and influences which have affected its growth and development.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>Under <q direct="unspecified">Charter,</q> there should be a study of our city government, the departments, the duties and powers of each, and methods of transacting business, elections, etc.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>The schools should be provided with a standard text-book of local history, but others more complete should be accessible to the children, not a single copy or <num value="2">two</num>, but in sufficient number to meet the demands of many pupils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>Much material contained in souvenir editions of our papers and in souvenir books and pamphlets that cannot be bought for the schools because of the advertising in them can be brought by pupils from their homes, and used by them as their own property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>The information gained will be useful in later years, so many of our pupils are making histories for themselves, in which they write brief statements of facts, references to sources of information, illustrated by clippings from papers and souvenir books, small pictures of historic spots and of prominent men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>Quite a demand has been made of late by the children for photographs after the plan of the <rs>Perry</rs> pictures and the <rs>Brown</rs> pictures, but of <placeName reg="Somerville, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050602">Somerville</placeName> subjects, and a proposition is under consideration to print large quantities of them to sell at a very low cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>The camera craze is being turned to good use, and interest in history thereby increased.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>Collections and exhibits of relics borrowed for the occasion also add to the interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>The topical method of study and recitation should of course be used, as has been indicated already, but there should be no regularity in calling upon pupils to recite in this particular subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>All such efforts should be entirely voluntary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>The assignment of a topic should be considered a compliment, to recite a privilege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>This society does well to interest itself in the promotion of this study.
