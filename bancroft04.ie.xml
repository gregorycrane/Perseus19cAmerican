<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>To restore possessions as they had been, or were to have been, was accepted as the condition of peace; and guaranties were devised to keep them safe against vicissitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>But the eternal flow of existence never rests, bearing the human race onwards through continuous change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Principles grow into life by informing the public mind, and in their maturity gain the mastery over events; following each other as they are bidden, and ruling without a pause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>No sooner do the agitated waves begin to subside, than, amidst the formless tossing of the billows, a new messenger from the <rs>Infinite Spirit</rs> moves over the waters; and the bark which is freighted with the fortunes of mankind, yields to the gentle breath as it <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> whispers among the shrouds, even while the beholders still doubt if the breeze is springing, and whence it comes, and whither it will go.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The hour of revolution was at hand, promising freedom to conscience and dominion to intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>History, escaping from the dictates of authority and the jars of insulated interests, enters upon new and unthought &mdash; of domains of culture and equality, the happier society where power springs freshly from ever-renewed consent; the life and activity of a connected world.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>For <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, the crisis foreboded the struggles of generations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The strong bonds of faith and affection, which once united the separate classes of its civil hierarchy, had lost their vigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>In the impending chaos of states, the ancient forms of society, after convulsive agonies, were doomed to be broken in pieces; and the fragments to become distinct, and <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> seemingly lifeless, like the dust; ready to be whirled<note anchored="yes" type="sum" place="marg">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The voice of reform, as it passed over the desolation, would inspire animation afresh; but in the classes whose power was crushed, as well as in the oppressed who knew not that they were redeemed, it might also awaken wild desires, which the ruins of a former world could not satiate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>In <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, the influences of time were moulded by the creative force of reason, sentiment, and nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Its political edifice rose in lovely proportions, as if to the melodies of the lyre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Peacefully and without crime, humanity was to make for itself a new existence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>They brought the civilization which the past had bequeathed to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>; they were followed by the slave-ship and the <name>African</name>; their happiness invited emigrants from every lineage of Central and <placeName reg="Europe" key="tgn,1000003">Western Europe</placeName>; the mercantile system, to which they were subjected, prevailed in the councils of all metropolitan states, and extended its restrictions to every continent that allured to conquest, commerce, or colonization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The accomplishment of their independence would agitate the globe, would assert the freedom of the oceans as commercial highways, vindicate power in the commonwealth for the united judgment of its people, and assure to them the right to a self-directing vitality.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Their faith was just; for the world of mankind does not exist in fragments, nor can a country have an insulated existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>All men are brothers; and all are bondsmen for <num value="1">one</num> another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>All nations, too, are brothers, and each is responsible for that federative humanity which puts the ban of exclusion on none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>New principles of government could not assert themselves in <num value="1">one</num> hemisphere without affecting the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The very idea of the progress of an individual people, in its relation to universal history, springs from the acknowledged unity of the race.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>From the dawn of social being, there has appeared a tendency towards commerce and intercourse between the scattered inhabitants of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>That mankind have ever earnestly desired this connection, appears from their willing homage to the adventurers and to every people, who have greatly enlarged the boundaries of the world, as known to civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The traditions of remotest antiquity celebrate the half-divine wanderer who raised pillars on the shores of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>; and record, as a visitant from the skies, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> traveller from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to the central rivers of <placeName key="tgn,1000004" n="1.000 95" reg="asia">Asia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It is the glory of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName>, that, when she had gathered on her islands and among her hills the scattered beams of human intelligence, her numerous colonies carried the accumulated light to the neighborhood of the ocean and to the shores of the <name>Euxine</name>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>To have asserted clearly the unity of mankind was the distinctive glory of the <rs>Christian</rs> religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>No more were the nations to be severed by the worship of exclusive deities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The world was instructed that all men are of <num value="1">one</num> blood; that for all there is but <num value="1">one</num> divine nature and but <num value="1">one</num> moral law; and the renovating faith taught the singleness of the race, of which it embodied the aspirations and guided the advancement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The tribes of <placeName reg="Europe" key="tgn,1000003">Northern Europe</placeName>, emerging freshly from the wild nurseries of nations, opened new regions to culture, commerce, and refinement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The beams of the majestic temple, which antiquity had reared to its many gods, were already falling in; the roving invaders, taking to their hearts the regenerating creed, became its intrepid messengers, and bore its symbols even to <placeName reg="Island" key="tgn,1000077">Iceland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Siberia</placeName>.</p>

<p>It is this idea of continuity which gives vitality to history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>No period of time has a separate being; no public opinion can escape the influence of previous intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>We are cheered by rays from former centuries, and live in the sunny reflection of all their light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>It is yet free and indestructible; can as little be bound in chains as the aspiring flame; and, when once generated, takes eternity for its guardian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>We are the children and the heirs of the past, with which, as with the future, we are indissolubly linked together; and he that truly has sympathy with every thing belonging to man, will, with his toils for posterity, blend affection for the times that are gone by, and seek to live in the vast life of the ages.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5082"/>Leaving the nobler policy of liberty to find its defenders where it could, and wilfully, and as it were fatally blind to what would follow, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 15" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> chose the policy of conquest and exclusion; and had already acquired much of the empire of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 11" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, and nearly the whole of that of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 21" reg="france">France</placeName> in both hemispheres.</p>
