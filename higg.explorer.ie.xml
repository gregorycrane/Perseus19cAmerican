<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>With him went <num value="1">one</num> Heriulf, whose son Biarni had been in the habit of passing every other winter with his father, and then sailing on distant voyages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Then happened what follows.]</p></argument> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>That same summer (<num value="985">985</num> or <num value="986">986</num>) came Biarni with his ship to Eyrar (<placeName key="tgn,1000077" n="1.000 8" reg="island">Iceland</placeName>), in the spring of which his father had sailed from the island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>These tidings seemed to Biarni weighty, and he would not unload his ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Then asked his sailors<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>All said they would do as he wished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Then said Biarni, <q direct="unspecified">Imprudent they will think our voyage, since none of us has been in the <rs type="place">Greenland Sea</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/><pb id="p.4" n="4"/></p> 
<p>Yet they bore out to sea as soon as they were bound,<note anchored="yes">

<p>Or <q direct="unspecified">made ready,</q> as we say a ship is bound for <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>.</p></note> and sailed <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, till the land was sunk.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> 
<p>Disappeared below the horizon.</p></note> Then the fair wind fell off, and there arose north winds and fogs, and they knew not whither they fared; and so it went for many days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>After that, they saw the sun, and could then get their bearings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Then they hoisted sail, and sailed that day before they saw land; and they counselled with themselves what land that might be. <figure id="fig.004"> 
<head>A Norse ship.</head></figure> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>But Biarni said he thought it could not be <placeName reg="Gronland, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7024573">Greenland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>They asked him whether he would sail to the land, or not. <q direct="unspecified">This is my counsel, to sail nigh to the land,</q> said he. And so they did, and soon saw that the land was without fells,<note anchored="yes">

<p>Mountains. This has been supposed to be <placeName reg="Cape Cod, Barnstable, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013542">Cape Cod</placeName>.</p></note> and wooded, and small heights on the land; and they left the land to larboard, and let the <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> foot of the sail look towards land.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> 
<p>i.e., sailed away from the land.</p></note> After that, they sailed <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> before they saw another land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>They asked if Biarni thought this was <placeName reg="Gronland, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7024573">Greenland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>He said he thought it no more <placeName reg="Gronland, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7024573">Greenland</placeName> than the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; <q direct="unspecified">for the glaciers are very huge, as they say, in <placeName reg="Gronland, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7024573">Greenland</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>They soon neared the land, and saw that it was flat land, and overgrown with wood.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> 
<p>Possibly <placeName reg="Nova Scotia" key="tgn,7013046">Nova Scotia</placeName>.</p></note> Then the fair wind fell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Then the sailors said that it seemed prudent to them to land there; but Biarni would not. They thought they needed both wood and water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/><q direct="unspecified">Of neither are you in want,</q> said Biarni; but he got some hard speeches for that from his sailors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>He bade them hoist sail, and so they did; and they turned the bows from the land, and sailed out to sea with a west-south wind <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, and saw <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> land; but that land was high, mountainous, and covered with glaciers.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> 
<p>Possibly <placeName key="tgn,7005807" n="1.000 7" reg="newfoundland">Newfoundland</placeName>.</p></note> They asked then if Biarni would put ashore there; but he said he would not, <q direct="unspecified">for this land seems to me not very promising.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>They did not lower their sails, but held on along this land, and saw that it was an island; but they turned the stern to the land, and sailed seawards with the same fair wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>But the wind rose; and Biarni bade them shorten sail, and not to carry more than their ship and tackle would bear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>They sailed now <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure>, then saw they land the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Then they asked Biarni whether he thought that was <placeName reg="Gronland, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7024573">Greenland</placeName>, or not. Biarni answered, <q direct="unspecified">That is likest to what is said to me of <placeName reg="Gronland, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7024573">Greenland</placeName>; and we will put ashore.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>So they did, and landed under a certain ness<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> 
<p>Cape, or <hi rend="italics">nose</hi>, of land.</p></note> at evening of the day. And there was a boat at the ness, and <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> there lived Heriulf, the father of Biarni, on this ness; and from him has the ness taken its name, and is since called Heriulfsness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Now fared<note anchored="yes">

<p>Great.</p></note> glaciers were over all the higher parts; but it was like a plain of rock from the glaciers to the sea, and it seemed to them that the land was good for nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Then said Leif, <q direct="unspecified">We have not done about this land like Biarni, not to go upon it: now I will give a name to the land, and call it Helluland (flat-stone land).</q><note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>After that they sailed into the sea, and found another land, sailed up to it, and cast anchor; then put off a boat, and went ashore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>This land was flat, and covered with wood and broad white sands wherever they went, and the shore was low. Then said Leif, <q direct="unspecified">From its make<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Now they sailed thence into the sea with a north-east wind, and were out <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> before they saw land; and they sailed to land, and came to an island that lay north of the land; and they went on to it, and looked about them in good weather, and found that dew lay upon the grass;<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> 
<p>Perhaps honey-dew, a sweet substance left on grass by an insect called <hi rend="italics">aphis</hi>.</p></note> and that happened that they put their hands in the dew, and brought it to their mouths, and they thought they had never known any thing so sweet as that was. Then they went to their ship, and sailed into that sound that lay between the island and a ness<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> 
<p>Cape.</p></note> which went northward from the land, and then steered westward past the ness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>There were great shoals at ebb-tide; and their vessel stood up;<note anchored="yes">

<p>i.e., was left aground.</p></note> and it was far to see from the ship to the sea. But they were so curious to fare to the land, that they could not bear to bide till the sea came under their ship, and ran ashore where a river flows out from a lake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>But, when the sea came under their ship, then took they the boat, and rowed to the ship, and took it up into the river, and then into the lake, and there cast anchor, and bore from the ship their skin-cots,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> 
<p>Cots used to sleep in, and made of skin.</p></note> and made their booths.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Afterwards they took counsel to stay there that winter, and made there great houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>There was no scarcity of salmon in the rivers and lakes, and larger salmon than they had before seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>There was the land so good, as it seemed to them, that no cattle would want fodder for the winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>There came no frost in the winter, and little did the grass fall off there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Day <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> and night were more equal there than in <placeName reg="Gronland" key="tgn,7024573">Greenland</placeName> or <placeName reg="Island" key="tgn,1000077">Iceland</placeName>. . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>It is said that their long boat was filled with grapes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Now was hewn a cargo for the ship; And when spring came they got ready, and sailed off; and Leif gave a name to the land after its sort, and called it <placeName reg="Newfoundland, Canada, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005801">Vinland</placeName> (Wine-Land).

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>But in the spring, <persName n="Thorvald,,,,," id="n0226.0001.00010.00015" reg="mostcommon:Thorvald,nomatch:0"><surname>Thorvald</surname></persName> said they would get ready their ship, and send their long-boat, and some men with it, along to the westward of the land, and explore it during the summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>The land seemed to them fair and woody, and narrow between the woods and the sea, and of white sand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>There were many islands and great shoals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>They found neither man's abode nor beast's; but, on an island to the westward, they found a corn-shed of wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>More works of men they found not; and they went back, and came to Leif's booths in the fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>But the next summer fared <persName n="Thorvald,,,,," id="n0226.0001.00010.00016" reg="mostcommon:Thorvald,nomatch:0"><surname>Thorvald</surname></persName> eastward with the merchant-ship, and coasted to the northward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Here a heavy storm arose as they were passing <num value="1">one</num> of, <num value="2">two</num> capes, and drove them up there, and broke the keel under the ship; and they dwelt there long, and mended their ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Then said <persName n="Thorvald,,,,," id="n0226.0001.00010.00017" reg="mostcommon:Thorvald,nomatch:0"><surname>Thorvald</surname></persName> to his companions, <q direct="unspecified">Now will I that we raise up here the keel on the ness,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>He said then, <q direct="unspecified">Here it is fair, and here would I like to raise my dwelling.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>They went then to the ship, and saw upon the sands within the headland <num value="3">three</num> heights; and they went thither, and saw there <num value="3">three</num> skin-boats, and <num value="3">three</num> men under each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>Then they divided their people, and laid hands on them all, except <num value="1">one</num> that got off with his boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>They killed these <num value="8">eight</num>, and went then back to the headland, and looked about them there, and saw in the firth some heights, and thought they were dwellings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>After that there came a heaviness on them so great that they could not keep awake; and all slumbered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>Then came a call above them, so that they all awoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>Thus said the call, <q direct="unspecified">Awake, <persName n="Thorvald,,,,," id="n0226.0001.00011.00019" reg="mostcommon:Thorvald,nomatch:0"><surname>Thorvald</surname></persName>, and all thy company, if thou wilt keep thy life; and fare thou to thy ship, and all thy men, and fare from the land of the quickest.</q><note anchored="yes">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>This agreement made Karlsefni and his seamen, that they should have even handed<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> 
<p>i.e., in equal shares,</p></note> all that they should get in the way of goods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>They had with them all sorts of cattle, as they thought to settle there if they might.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Karlsefni begged Leif for his house in <placeName reg="Newfoundland, Canada, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005801">Vinland</placeName>; but he said he would lend him the house, but not give it. Then they bore out to the sea with the ship, and came to Leif's booths, hale and whole, and landed there their cattle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>There soon came into their hands a great and good prize; for a whale was driven ashore, both great and good; then they went to cut up the whale, and <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> had no scarcity of food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>The cattle went up into the country; and it soon happened that the male cattle became wild and unruly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>They had with them a bull.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Karlsefni had wood felled, and brought to the ship, and had the wood piled on the cliff to dry. They had all the good things of the country, both of grapes, and of all sorts of game and other things.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>After the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> winter came the summer; then they saw appear the <name>Skraelings</name>, and there came from out the wood a great number of men. Near by were their neat-cattle; and the bull took to bellowing, and roared loudly, whereat the <name>Skraelings</name> were frightened, and ran off with their bundles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>These were furs and sableskins, and skin-wares of all kinds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>And they turned toward Karlsefni's booths, and wanted to get into the house; but Karlsefni had the doors guarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Neither party understood the other's language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Then the <name>Skraelings</name> took down their bags, and opened them, and offered them for sale, and wanted, above all, to have weapons for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>But Karlsefni forbade them to sell weapons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>He took this plan: he bade the women bring out their dairy-stuff<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/> 
<p>Milk, butter, &amp;c.</p></note> for them; and, so goon as they saw this, they would have that, and nothing more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Now this was the way the <name>Skraelings</name> traded: they bore off their wares in their stomachs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>But Karlsefni and his companions had their bags and skin-wares, and so they parted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>Now hereof is this to say, that Karlsefni had posts driven strongly round <figure id="fig.013"> 
<head>Esquimau boat.</head></figure> <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> about his booths, and made all complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>At this time Gudrid, the wife of Karlsefni, bore a man-child, and he was called Snorri.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>In the beginning of the next winter the <name>Skraelings</name> came to them again, and were many more than before; and they had the same wares as before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>Then Karlsefni said to the women, <q direct="unspecified">Now bring forth the same food that was most liked before, and no other.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>And, when they saw it, they cast their bundles in over the fence. . . . [But <num value="1">one</num> of them being killed by <num value="1">one</num> of Karlsefni's men, they all fled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>in haste, and left their garments and wares behind.] <q direct="unspecified">Now I think we need a good counsel,</q> said Karlsefni; <q direct="unspecified">for I think they will come for the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> time in anger, and with many men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>But thus it was with the place where they thought to meet, that a lake was on <num value="1">one</num> side, and the wood on the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>Now it was done as Karlsefni had said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>Now came the <name>Skraelings</name> to the place where Karlsefni had thought should be the battle; and now there was a battle, and many of the <name>Skraelings</name> fell.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>There was <num value="1">one</num> large and handsome man among the <name>Skraelings</name>; and Karlsefni thought he might be their leader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Now <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>Skraelings</name> had taken up an axe, and looked at it a while, and struck at <num value="1">one</num> of his fellows, and hit him, whereupon he fell dead; then the large man took the axe, and looked at it a while, and threw it into the sea as far as he could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>But after that <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> they fled to the wood, each as fast as he could; and thus ended the strife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>Karlsefni and his companions were there all that winter; but in the spring <rs>Karlsefni</rs> said he would stay there no longer, and would fare to <placeName reg="Gronland, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7024573">Greenland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Now they made ready for the voyage, and bare thence much goods, namely, grape-vines and grapes and skin-wares.

<p>Knowing that it will afford you pleasure to learn that I have brought my undertaking to a successful termination, I have decided upon writing you this letter to acquaint you with all the events which have occurred in my voyage, and the discoveries which have resulted from it. <measure n="33days" type="date">Thirty-three days</measure> after my departure from <placeName reg="Cadiz, Harrison, Ohio" key="tgn,2078690">Cadiz</placeName>, I reached the <rs type="place">Indian Sea</rs>,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>To the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these islands, which <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> is called by the <rs>Indians Guanahani</rs>, I gave the name of the blessed Saviour (<placeName key="tgn,7005441" n="1.000 25" reg="el salvador">San Salvador</placeName>), relying upon whose protection I had reached this as well as the other islands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>To each of these I also gave a name, ordering that <num value="1">one</num> should be called Santa Maria de la Concepcion; another, <placeName key="tgn,2019279" n="1.000 62" reg="fernandina, nassau, florida">Fernandina</placeName>; the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Isabella</placeName>; the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>, Juana; and so with all the rest respectively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>At length, after proceeding a great way, and finding that nothing new presented itself, and that the line of coast was leading us northwards, I resolved not to attempt any further progress, but rather to turn back, and retrace my course to a certain bay that I had observed, and from which I afterwards despatched <num value="2">two</num> of our men to ascertain whether there were a king or any cities in that province.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>These men reconnoitred the country for <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, and found a most numerous population, and great numbers of houses, though small, and built without any regard to order; with which information they returned to us.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>All these islands are very beautiful, and distinguished by a diversity of scenery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>They are filled with a great variety of trees of immense height, and which I believe to retain their foliage in all seasons; for when I saw them they were as verdant and luxuriant as they usually are in <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> in the month of <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>,&mdash;some of them were blossoming, some bearing fruit, and all flourishing in the greatest perfection, according to their respective stages of growth, and the nature and quality of each: yet the islands are not so thickly wooded as to be impassable.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>This timidity did not arise from any loss or injury that they had received from us; for, on the contrary, I gave to all I approached whatever articles I had about me, such as cloth, and many other things, taking nothing of theirs in return: but they are naturally timid and fearful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>As soon, however, as they see that they are safe, and have laid aside all fear, they are very simple and honest, and exceedingly liberal with all that they have, none of them refusing any thing he may possess when he is asked for it, but, on the contrary, inviting us to ask them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>They exhibit great love towards all others in preference to themselves: they also give objects of great value for trifles, and content themselves with very little, or nothing, in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>I, however, forbade that these trifles and articles of no value&mdash;such as pieces of dishes, plates and glass, keys, and leather straps&mdash; should be given to them, although, if they could obtain them, they imagined themselves to be possessed of the most beautiful trinkets in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>It even happened that a sailor received for a leather strap as much gold as was worth <num value="3">three</num> golden nobles; and for things of more trifling value offered by our men, especially newly coined <hi rend="italics">blancas</hi>,<note anchored="yes">

<p>Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbade, as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the king and queen, our princes, and all Spaniards; and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting, and delivering to us, such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>They practise no kind of idolatry, but have a firm belief that all strength and power, and indeed all good things, are in heaven, and I had descended from thence with these ships and sailors; and under this impression was I received after they had thrown aside their fears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>I see the land!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>The joy of the people was so great, that it was wonderful to hear their cries and exclamations of pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>And they had good reason to be delighted; for they had become so wearied of bad living, and of working the water out of the ships, that all sighed most anxiously for land . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>On the morning of the aforesaid <rs>Sunday</rs>, we saw lying before us an island;<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>As soon as it became lighter, other islands began to appear on both sides; so that on that day there were <num value="6">six</num> islands to be seen lying in different directions, and most of them of considerable size.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>We directed our course towards that which we had <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <pb id="p.27" n="27"/> seen; and, reaching the coast, we proceeded more than a league in search of a port where we might anchor, but without finding <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>All that part of the island which we could observe appeared mountainous, very beautiful, and green even up to the water, which was delightful to see; for at that season there is scarcely any thing green in our own country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>When we found that there was no harbor there, the admiral decided that we should go to the other island, which appeared on the right, and which was at <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> leagues distance: <num value="1">one</num> vessel, however, still remained on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> island all that day, seeking for a harbor, in case it should be necessary to return thither.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>At length, having found a good <num value="1">one</num>, where they saw both people and dwellings, they returned that night to the fleet, which had put into harbor at the other island;<note anchored="yes">

<p>Marigalante, so named from the ship in which <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName> sailed.</p></note> and there the admiral, accompanied by a great number of men, landed with a royal banner in his hands, and took formal possession in behalf of their Majesties. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>On this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of our landing, several men and women came on the beach up to the water's edge, and gazed at the boats in astonishment at so novel a sight; and, when a boat pushed on shore to speak with them, they cried out, <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">Tayno, tayno</hi>!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>which is as much as to say, <q direct="unspecified">Good, good!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>and waited for the landing of the sailors, standing by the boat in such a manner that they might escape when they pleased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The result was, that none of the men could be persuaded to join us; and only <num value="2">two</num> were taken by force, who were secured, and led away. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>Another day, at the dinner-hour, we arrived at an <pb id="p.28" n="28"/> island<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/> 
<p><placeName reg="Saint Martin" key="tgn,7004782">St. Martin</placeName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs type="place">Caribbee Islands</rs>.</p></note> which seemed to be worth finding; for, judging by the extent of cultivation in it, it appeared very populous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>We went thither, and put into harbor, when the admiral immediately sent on shore a well-manned barge to hold speech with the <name>Indians</name>, in order to ascertain what race they were, and also because we considered it necessary to gain some information respecting our course; although it afterwards plainly appeared that the admiral, who had never made that passage before, had taken a very correct route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>But, since doubtful questions ought always by investigation to be reduced as nearly to a certainty as possible, he wished that communication should be held with the natives at once; and some of the men who went in a barge leaped on shore, and went up to a village, whence the inhabitants had already withdrawn, and hidden themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>They took in this island <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> women and some boys, most of whom were captives, like those in the other island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>We learned from the women whom we had brought with us, that the natives of this place also were Caribbees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>As this barge was about to return to the ships with the capture which they had taken, a canoe came along the coast, containing <num value="4">four</num> men, <num value="2">two</num> women, and a boy; and, when they saw the fleet, they were so stupefied with amazement, that for a good hour they remained motionless at the distance of nearly <num value="2">two</num> gunshots from the ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>In this position they were seen by those who were in the barge, and also by all the fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>Meanwhile, those in the barge moved towards the canoe, but so close in shore, that the <name>Indians</name>, in their perplexity and astonishment as to what all this <pb id="p.29" n="29"/> could mean, never saw them until they were so near that escape was impossible; for our men pressed on them so rapidly, that they could not get away, although they made considerable effort to do so.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>When the <name>Caribbees</name> saw that all attempt at flight was useless, they most courageously took to their bows, both women and men: I say most courageously, because they were only <num value="4">four</num> men and <num value="2">two</num> women, and our people were <num value="25">twenty-five</num> in number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/><num value="2">Two</num> of our men were wounded by the <name>Indians</name>, <num value="1">one</num> with <num value="2">two</num> arrow-shots in his breast, and another with <num value="1">one</num> in his side; and if it had not happened that they carried shields and wooden bucklers, and that they got near them with the barge, and upset their canoe, most of them would nave been killed with their arrows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>After their canoe was upset, they remained in the water, swimming and occasionally wading&mdash;for there were shallows in that part,&mdash;still using their bows as much as they could; so that our men had enough to do to take them: and, after all, there was <num value="1">one</num> of them whom they were unable to secure till he had received a mortal wound with a lance, and whom, thus wounded, they took to the ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>The difference between these Caribbees and the other <rs>Indians</rs>, with respect to dress, consists in their wearing their hair very long; while the others have it clipped irregularly, and paint their heads with crosses and a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> different devices, each according to his fancy, which they do with sharpened reeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>All of them, both the <name>Caribbees</name> and the others, are beardless; so that it is a rare thing to find a man with a beard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>The <rs>Caribbees</rs> whom we took had their eyes and eyebrows stained, which I imagine they do from ostentation, and to give them a more formidable appearance. . . . . <pb id="p.30" n="30"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>The country<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/> 
<p>Hayti, or Espa&ntilde;ola.</p></note> is very remarkable, and contains a vast number of large rivers, and extensive chains of mountains, with broad open valleys; and the mountains are very high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>It does not appear that the grass is ever cut throughout the year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>I do not think they have any winter in this part; for near <placeName reg="Navidad, Jackson, Texas" key="tgn,2536302">Navidad</placeName> (at <dateStruct value="-12-25"><occasion>Christmas</occasion></dateStruct>) were found many birds'-nests, some containing the young birds, and others containing eggs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>No <num value="4">four</num>-footed animal has ever been seen in this or any of the other islands, except some dogs of various colors, as in our own country, but in shape like large house-dogs; and also some little animals, in color, size, and fur like a rabbit, with long tails, and feet like those of a rat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> 
<p>Probably a species of <hi rend="italics">capromys</hi>, an animal of the rat kind.</p></note> There are not any wild beasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>There are great numbers of small snakes, and some lizards, but not many; for the <name>Indians</name> consider them as great a luxury as we do pheasants: they are of the same size as ours, but different in shape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>and many others such as we had never seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>No kind of domestic fowl has been seen here, with the exception <pb id="p.31" n="31"/> of some ducks in the houses in Zuruquia: these ducks were larger than those of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, though smaller than geese,&mdash;very pretty, with tufts on their heads, most of them as white as snow, but some black.</p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>We saw houses and people on the spot; and the country around was very beautiful, and as fresh and green as the gardens of <placeName key="tgn,7008769" n="1.000 1" reg="valencia,valencia,valencia,espana,europe">Valencia</placeName> in the month of <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>The next day I set sail in the same direction, in search of a harbor where I might repair the vessels, and take in water, as well as improve the stock of provisions which I had brought out with me. When we had taken in a pipe of water, we proceeded onwards till we reached the cape; and there finding good anchorage, and protection from the east wind, I ordered the anchors to be dropped, the water-cask to be repaired, a supply of water and wood to be taken in, and the people to rest themselves from the fatigues which they had endured for so long a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>I gave to this point the name of <placeName key="possibilities=81" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Sandy Point</placeName> (Punta del Arenal). <pb id="p.32" n="32"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>All the ground in the neighborhood was filled with footmarks of animals, like the impression of the fool of a goat; but, although it would have appeared from this circumstance that they were very numerous, only <num value="1">one</num> was seen, and that was dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>On the following day a large canoe came from the eastward, containing <num value="24">twenty-four</num> men, all in the prime of life, and well provided with arms, such as bows, arrows, and wooden shields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>They were all, as I have said, young, well-proportioned, and not dark black, but whiter than any other Indians that I had seen,&mdash;of very graceful gesture and handsome forms, wearing their hair long and straight, and cut in the <rs>Spanish</rs> style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>Their heads were bound round with cotton scarfs elaborately worked in colors, which resembled the <rs>Moorish</rs> <rs n="head dresses" type="product">head-dresses</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Some of these scarfs were worn round the body, and used as a covering in lieu of trousers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>The natives spoke to us from the canoe while it was yet at a considerable distance; but none of us could understand them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>I made signs to them, however, to come nearer to us; and more than <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> were spent in this manner: but if, by any chance, they moved a little nearer, they soon pushed off again.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>I caused basins and other shining objects to be shown to them to tempt them to come near; and, after a long time, they came somewhat nearer than they had hitherto done; upon which, as I was very anxious to speak with them, and had nothing else to show them to induce them to approach, I ordered a drum to be played upon the quarter-deck, and some of our young men to dance, believing the <name>Indians</name> would come to see the amusement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>No sooner, however, did they perceive <pb id="p.33" n="33"/> the beating of the drum, and the dancing, than they all left their oars, and strung their bows, and, each man laying hold of his shield, they commenced discharging their arrows at us; upon this the music and dancing soon ceased, and I ordered a charge<note anchored="yes">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>I have always read, that the world comprising the land and water was spherical, as is testified by the investigations of <persName><foreName>Ptolemy</foreName></persName> and others, who have proved it by the eclipses of the moon, and other observations made from east to west, as well as by the elevation of the pole from north to south.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>But I have now seen so much irregularity, as I have already described, that I have come to another conclusion respecting the earth; namely, that it is not round, as they describe, but of the <pb id="p.37" n="37"/> form of a pear, which is very round except where the stalk grows, at which part it is most prominent.. <persName><foreName>Ptolemy</foreName></persName>, and the others who have written upon the globe, had no information respecting this part of the world, which was then unexplored: they only established their arguments with respect to their own hemisphere, which, as I have already said, is half of a perfect sphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>And, now that your Highnesses have commissioned me to make this voyage of discovery, the truths which I have stated are evidently proved. . . . I do not find, nor have ever found, any account by the <name>Romans</name> or Greeks, which fixes in a positive manner the site of the terrestrial paradise; neither have I seen it given in any <hi rend="italics">mappe-monde</hi>,<note anchored="yes">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>I have already described my ideas concerning this hemisphere and its form; and I have no doubt, that if I could pass below the equinoctial line, after reaching the highest point of which I have spoken, I should find a much milder temperature, and a variation in the stars and in the water; not that I suppose that elevated point to be navigable, nor even that there is water there: indeed, I believe it is impossible to ascend thither, because I am convinced that it is the spot of <pb id="p.38" n="38"/> the earthly paradise, whither no <num value="1">one</num> can go but by <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> permission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>But this land which your Highnesses have now sent me to explore is very extensive; and I think there are many countries in the south, of which the world has never had any knowledge.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>I do not suppose that the earthly paradise is in the form of a rugged mountain, as the descriptions of it have made it appear, but that it is on the summit of the spot which I have described as being in the form of the stalk of a pear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>The approach to it from a distance must be by a constant and gradual ascent; but I believe, that, as I have already said, no <num value="1">one</num> could even reach the top. I think, also, that the water I have described may proceed from it, though it be far off, and that, stopping at the place which I have just left, it forms this lake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>There are great indications of this being the terrestrial paradise; for its site coincides with the opinion of the holy and wise theologians whom I have mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>And, moreover, the other evidences agree with the supposition; for I have never either read or heard of fresh water coming in so large a quantity, in close conjunction with the water of the sea. The idea is also corroborated by the blandness of the temperature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>And, if the water of which I speak does not proceed from the earthly paradise, it appears to be still more marvellous; for I do not believe that there is any river in the world so large or so deep. </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>When I had passed through the square, and reached the royal house, there was a great clamor of women and children at the gate, who ran into the palace screaming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/><measure n="10days" type="date">Ten days</measure> after this, the admiral called me aside, and spoke to me of the great peril he was in, addressing me as follows: <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Mendez,,Diego,,," id="n0226.0002.00045.00045" reg="default:Mendez,Diego,,,"><foreName>Diego</foreName> <surname>Mendez</surname></persName>, my son, not <num value="1">one</num> of those whom I have here with me has any idea of the great danger in which we stand, except myself and you; for we are but few in number, and these wild Indians are numerous, and very fickle and capricious; and whenever they may take it into their heads to come and burn us in our <num value="2">two</num> ships, which we have made into straw-thatched cabins, they may easily do so by setting fire to them on the land side, and so destroy us all. The arrangement you have made with them for the supply of food, to which they agreed with such good-will, may soon prove disagreeable to them; and it would not be surprising, if, on the morrow, they were not to bring us any thing at all. In such case, we are not in a position to take it by main force, but shall be compelled to <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> accede to their terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>I have thought of a remedy, if you consider it advisable; which is, that some <num value="1">one</num> should go out in the canoe that you have purchased, and make his way in it to Espa&ntilde;ola, to purchase a vessel with which we may escape from the extremely dangerous position in which we now are. Tell me your opinion.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>To which I answered, <q direct="unspecified">My lord, I distinctly see the danger in which we stand, which is much greater than would be readily imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>With respect to the passage from this island to Espa&ntilde;ola in so small a vessel as a canoe, I look upon it not merely as difficult, but impossible; for I know not who would venture to encounter so terrific a danger as to cross a gulf of <num value="40">forty</num> leagues of sea, and amongst islands where the sea is so impetuous, and scarcely ever at rest.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/></p> 
<p>His lordship did not agree with the opinion that I expressed, but adduced strong arguments to show that I was the person to undertake the enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>To which I replied, <q direct="unspecified">My lord, I have many times put my life in danger to save yours and the lives of all those who are with you, and <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has marvellously preserved me. In consequence of this, there have not been wanting murmurers, who have said that your lordship intrusts every honorable undertaking to me, while there are others amongst them who would perform them as well as I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>My opinion is, therefore, that your lordship would do well to summon all the men, and lay this business before them; to see if, amongst them all, there is <num value="1">one</num> who will volunteer to undertake it, which I certainly doubt; and, if all refuse, I will risk my life in your service, as I have many times already.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/></p> 
<p>On the following day his lordship caused all the men <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> to appear together before him, and then opened the matter to them in the same manner as he had done to me. When they heard it, they were all silent, until some said that it was out of the question to speak of such a thing; for it was impossible, in so small a craft, to cross a boisterous and perilous gulf of <num value="40">forty</num> leagues' breadth, and to pass between those <num value="2">two</num> islands, where very strong vessels had been lost in going to make discoveries, not being able to encounter the force and fury of the currents.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>I then arose, and said, <q direct="unspecified">My lord, I have but <num value="1">one</num> life, and I am willing to hazard it in the service of your lordship, and for the welfare of all those who are here with us; for I trust in <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, that, in consideration of the motive which actuates me, he will give me deliverance, as he has already done on many other occasions.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>When the admiral heard my determination, he arose and embraced me, and, kissing me on the cheek, said, <q direct="unspecified">Well did I know that there was no <num value="1">one</num> here but yourself who would dare to undertake this enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>I trust in <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, our <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, that you will come out of it victoriously, as you have done in the others which you have undertaken.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/></p> 
<p>On the following day I drew my canoe on to the shore, fixed a false keel on it, and pitched and greased it: I then nailed some boards upon the poop and prow, to prevent the sea from coming in, as it was liable to do from the lowness of the gunwales.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>I also fixed a mast in it, set up a sail, and laid in the necessary provisions for myself, <num value="1">one</num> Spaniard, and <num value="6">six</num> <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0226.0002.00047.00046" reg="mostcommon:Indians,Canadian,,,:1"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, making <num value="8">eight</num> in all, which was as many as the canoe would hold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>I then bade farewell to his lordship and all the <pb id="p.48" n="48"/> others, and proceeded along the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7015863;tgn,7005556" n="0.046 000000.5952	placename;tgn,7015863;jamaica, queens, new york,Queens,New York,Kings,New York,United States,North and Central America;0.040 000000.5208	placename;tgn,7005556;jamaica,North and Central America" reg="jamaica, queens, new york,Queens,New York,Kings,New York,United States,North and Central America;jamaica,North and Central America">Jamaica</placeName> up to the extremity of the island, which was <num value="35">thirty-five</num> leagues from the point whence we started.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>Even this distance was not traversed without considerable toil and danger; for on the passage I was taken prisoner by some <name>Indian</name> pirates, from whom <name n="God" type="God">God</name> delivered me in a marvellous manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>When we had reached the end of the island, and were remaining there in the hope of the sea becoming sufficiently calm to allow us to continue our voyage across it, many of the natives collected together, with the determination of killing me, and seizing the canoe with its contents; and they cast lots for my life, to see which of them should carry their design into execution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>As soon as I became aware of their project, I betook myself secretly to my canoe, which I had left at <num value="3">three</num> leagues' distance from where I then was, and set sail for the spot where the admiral was staying, and reached it after an interval of <measure n="15days" type="date">fifteen days</measure> from my departure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>I related to him all that had happened, and how <name n="God" type="God">God</name> had miraculously rescued me from the hands of those savages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>His lordship was very joyful at my arrival, and asked me if I would recommence my voyage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>I replied that I would, if I might be allowed to take some men to be with me at the extremity of the island until I should find a fair opportunity of putting to sea to prosecute my voyage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>The admiral gave me <num value="70">seventy</num> men, and with them, his brother the <hi rend="italics">adelantado</hi>, to stay with me until I put to sea, and to remain there <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> after my departure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>With this arrangement, I returned to the extremity of the island, and remained there <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure>. <pb id="p.49" n="49"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>Finding the sea become calm, I parted from the rest of the men with much mutual sorrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>I then commended myself to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and our <rs type="role" reg="Lady">Lady</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7004640" n="1.000 2" reg="antigua">Antigua</placeName>, and was at sea <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure> and <num value="4">four</num> nights without laying down the oar from my hand, but continued steering the canoe while my companions rowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>It pleased <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, that, at the end of <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure>, I reached the <rs type="place">Island of Espa</rs>&ntilde;ola at <placeName reg="Cape San Miguel">Cape San Miguel</placeName>, having been <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> without eating or drinking; for our provisions were exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>I brought my canoe up to a very beautiful part of the coast, to which many of the natives soon came, and brought with them many articles of food; so that I remained there <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> to take rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>I took <num value="6">six</num> Indians from this place, and, leaving those that I had brought with me, I put off to sea again, moving along the coast of Espa&ntilde;ola; for it was a <num value="130">hundred and thirty</num> leagues from the spot where I landed to the city of <placeName reg="Republica Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">San Domingo</placeName>, where the governor dwelt.. When that expedition was finished, I went on foot to <placeName reg="Republica Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">San Domingo</placeName>, a distance of <num value="70">seventy</num> leagues, and waited in expectation of the arrival of ships from <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, it being now more than a year since any had come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>In this interval, it pleased <name n="God" type="God">God</name> that <num value="3">three</num> ships arrived, <num value="1">one</num> of which I bought, and loaded it with provisions, &mdash;bread, wine, meat, hogs, sheep, and fruit,&mdash;and despatched it to the place where the admiral was staying, in order that he might come over in it with all his people to <placeName reg="Republica Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">San Domingo</placeName>, and from thence sail for <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>I myself went on in advance with the <num value="2">two</num> other ships in order to give an account to the king and queen of all that had occurred in this voyage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>I think I should now do well to say somewhat of the <pb id="p.50" n="50"/> events which occurred to the admiral and to his family during the year that they were left on the island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>A few days after my departure, the <name>Indians</name> became refractory, and refused to bring food, as they had hitherto done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>The admiral, therefore, caused all the caciques to be summoned, and expressed to them his surprise that they should not send food as they were wont to do, knowing, as they did, and as he had already told them, that he had come there by the command of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>He said that he perceived that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> was angry with them, and that he would that very night give tokens of his displeasure by signs that he would cause to appear in the heavens; and as, on that night, there was to be an almost total eclipse of the moon, he told them that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> caused that appearance, to signify his anger against them for not bringing the food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>The <rs>Indians</rs>, believing him, were very frightened, and promised that they would always bring him food in future; and so, in fact, they did, until the arrival of the ship which I had sent loaded with provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>The admiral, and those who were with him, felt no small joy at the arrival of this ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>And his lordship afterwards informed me in <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, that in no part of his life did he ever experience so joyful a day; for he had never hoped to have left that place alive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>And in that same ship he set sail, and went to <placeName reg="Republica Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">San Domingo</placeName>, and thence to <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>. </p></div2>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>Such is my fate, that the <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> of service through which I have passed with so much toil and danger have profited me nothing, and at this very day I do not possess a roof in <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> that I can call my own. If I wish to eat or sleep, I have nowhere to go but to the inn or tavern, and most times lack wherewith to pay the bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>Another anxiety wrung my very heart-strings, which was the thought of my son <persName><foreName>Diego</foreName></persName>, whom I had left an orphan in <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, and stripped of the honor and property which were due to him on my account, although I had looked upon it as a certainty that your Majesties, as just and grateful princes, would restore it to him in all respects with increase. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>For <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> was I at your royal court, where every <num value="1">one</num> to whom the enterprise was mentioned treated it as ridiculous; but now there is not a man, down to the very tailors, who does not beg to be allowed to become a discoverer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>There is reason to believe that they make the voyage only for plunder, and that they are permitted to do so to the great disparagement of my honor, and the detriment of the undertaking itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>It is right to give <name n="God" type="God">God</name> his due, and to receive that which belongs to <num value="1">one</num>'s self.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>This is a just sentiment, and proceeds from just feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>The lands in this part of the world, which are now under your Highnesses' sway, are richer and more extensive than those of any other <name>Christian</name> power; and yet, after that I had, by the divine will, placed them under your high and royal sovereignty, and was on the <pb id="p.52" n="52"/> point of bringing your Majesties into the receipt of a very great and unexpected revenue; and while I was waiting for ships to convey me in safety, and with a heart full of joy, to your royal presence, victoriously to announce the news of the gold that I had discovered, I was arrested, and thrown with my <num value="2">two</num> brothers, loaded with irons, into a ship, stripped, and very ill treated, without being allowed any appeal to justice. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>I was <measure n="28years" type="date">twenty-eight years</measure> old when I came into your Highnesses' service, and now I have not a hair upon me that is not gray: my body is infirm, and all that was left to me, as well as to my brothers, has been taken away and sold, even to the frock that I wore, to my great dishonor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>I cannot but believe that this was done without your royal permission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>The restitution of my honor, the reparation of my losses, and the punishment of those who have inflicted them, will redound to the honor of your royal character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>A similar punishment also is due to those who have plundered me of my pearls, and who have brought a disparagement upon the privileges of my admiralty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>Great and unexampled will be the glory and fame of your Highnesses, if you do this; and the memory of your Highnesses, as just and grateful sovereigns, will survive as a bright example to <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> in future ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>The honest devotedness I have always shown to your Majesties' service, and the so unmerited outrage with which it has been repaid, will not allow my soul to keep silence, however much I may wish it. I implore your Highnesses to forgive my complaints.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>I am indeed in as ruined a condition as I have related.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>They did not desire cloth of silk or gold, much less of any other sort; neither cared they for things made of steel and iron, which we often showed them in our armor, which they made no wonder at; and, in beholding them, they only asked the art of making them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>Near this they came to the sea; and here the narrative begins.]</p></argument> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>It was a piteous and painful thing to witness the perplexity and distress in which we were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>At our arrival, we saw the little means there were of our advancing farther: there was not anywhere to go, and, if there had been, the people could not move forward, because the greater part of them were sick, and there were few that could be of any use. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>The governor called them all to him, and of each by himself he asked his advice what to do to get out of a country so miserable, and seek elsewhere that remedy <pb id="p.74" n="74"/> which could not here be found, <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> part of the people being very sick, and the number increasing every hour for we regarded it as certain that we should all become so, and out of it we could only pass through death; which, from its coming in such a place, was to us only the more terrible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>These and many other embarrassments considered, and entertaining many plans, we <figure id="fig.074"> 
<head><persName><foreName>Cabeza</foreName></persName> <placeName reg="de Vaca building">de Vaca building</placeName> the boat.</head></figure> coincided in <num value="1">one</num> great project, extremely difficult to put in operation, and that was, to build vessels in which we might go away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>This to all appeared impossible; for we knew not how to build, nor were there tools, nor iron, nor forge, nor tow, nor resin, nor rigging; finally, no <num value="1">one</num> thing of so many that are necessary, nor any man who had a knowledge of their manufacture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>And, <pb id="p.75" n="75"/> above all, there was nothing to eat the while they were making, nor any knowledge in those who would have to perform the labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>Reflecting on all this, we agreed to think of the subject with more deliberation; and the discourse dropped for that day, each going his way, commending our course to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, our <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, that he should direct it as would best serve him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>The next day, it was His will that <num value="1">one</num> of the company should come, saying that he could make some pipe out of wood, which, with deer-skins, might be made into bellows; and, as we lived in a time when any thing that had the semblance of relief appeared well, we told him to set himself to work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>We assented to the making of nails, saws, axes, and other tools, of which there was such need, from the stirrups, spurs, cross-bows, and the other things of iron that there were; and we said, that, for support while the work was going on, we would make <num value="4">four</num> entries into Aute, with all the horses and men that were able to go; and that every <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> day a horse should be killed, which should be divided among those that had labored on the work of the boats, and those that were sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>The forays were made with the people and horses that were of any use, and in them were brought back as many as <num value="4">four</num> bushels of maize; but these were not got without quarrels and conflicts with the <name>Indians</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>We caused to be collected many palmettos for the benefit of the woof or covering, twisting and preparing it for use in the place of tow for the boats.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>We commenced to build on the <dateStruct value="--4"><day reg="2">4th</day></dateStruct>, with the <num value="1">one</num> only carpenter in the company; and we proceeded with so great diligence, that, on the <dateStruct value="-09-20"><day reg="20">twentieth</day> day of <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>, <pb id="p.76" n="76"/> <num value="5">five</num> boats were finished, of <num value="22">twenty-two</num> cubits in length each, calked with the fibre of the palmetto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>We pitched them with a certain resin, which was made from pine-trees, by a Greek named <persName n="Theodoro,,Don,,," id="n0226.0004.00076.00088" reg="default:Theodoro,Don,,,"><foreName>Don</foreName> <surname>Theodoro</surname></persName>; and from the same husk of the palmettos, and from the tails and manes of the horses, we made ropes and rigging; and from our shirts, sails; and from the savins<note anchored="yes">

<p>Cedars.</p></note> that grew there, we made the oars that appeared to us to be requisite.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>And such was the country in which our sins had cast us, that with very great trouble we could find stone for ballast and anchors to the boats, since in all of it we had not seen <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>We flayed the horses, and took off the skins of their legs entire, and tanned them, to make bottles in which we might carry water.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>During this time, some went gathering shell-fish in the coves and creeks of the sea, at which the <name>Indians</name> twice attacked them, and <measure n="10" type="killed">killed ten</measure> of our men in sight of the camp, without our being able to afford them succor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>We found them traversed from side to side by the arrows; and, although some had on good armor, it did not afford sufficient protection against the nice and powerful archery, of which I have spoken before. . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>Having come out, we went to the coast, where, with <pb id="p.78" n="78"/> the <num value="5">five</num> canoes I had taken from the <name>Indians</name>, we some.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>what improved the boats, making waist-boards, and securing them so that the sides rose <num value="2">two</num> palms above the waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>With this we turned to travel along the coast in the direction of the <rs type="place">River</rs> <persName n="Palmas,,,,," id="n0226.0004.00078.00093" reg="mostcommon:Palmas,nomatch:0"><surname>Palmas</surname></persName>, every day increasing our hunger and thirst; for the provisions were very scant, and getting near their end, and the water was gone, because the bottles we made from the legs of the horses soon rotted, and were useless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>Sometimes we entered coves and creeks that lay far in, and found them all shallow and dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>Thus we travelled <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure> among them, where we sometimes found <name>Indian</name> fishermen, a poor and miserable people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>At the end of this time, while the want of water was extreme, going near the coast at night, we heard the approach of a canoe; and as we saw it we waited its arrival: but it would not meet us, and, although we called, it would not return, nor wait for us. As the night was dark, we did not follow it, but kept on our way. When the sun rose, we saw a small island, and went to it, to see if we could find water: but our labor was vain; for it had none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>Being there at anchor, a heavy storm overtook us, that detained us <measure n="6days" type="date">six days</measure>, without our daring to go to sea: and, as it was now <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure> in which we had not drunk, our thirst was so excessive, that it put us to the extremity of drinking salt water; and some of the men so greatly crazed themselves by it, that directly we had <num value="4">four</num> of them to die. I state this thus briefly, because I do not believe there is any necessity for particularly relating the sufferings and toils in which we found ourselves; for considering the place we were in, and the little hope we had of relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/><pb id="p.79" n="79"/> every <num value="1">one</num> may conceive much of what would have passed there.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>Although the storm had not ceased, and we found that our thirst increased, and the water killed us, we resolved to commend ourselves to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> our <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, and venture the peril of the sea, [rather] than await the certainty of death which thirst imposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>Accordingly, we went out by the way in which we had seen the canoe the night we came there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>On this day, we ourselves were many times overwhelmed by the waves, and in such jeopardy, that there was not <num value="1">one</num> who did not suppose his death certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>I return thanks to our <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, that, in the greatest dangers, he should have shown us his favor; for at sunset we doubled a point made by the sand, and found great calm and shelter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>So we sailed that day until the middle of the afternoon, when my boat, which was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, discovered a point made by the land, and, against a cape opposite, a broad river passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>I anchored by a little island which forms the point, to await the arrival of the other boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>The governor did not choose to come up, but entered a bay near by, in which were a great many islets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>We came together there, and took fresh water from the sea; for the stream entered it impetuously.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/> 
<p>It is thought that this river may have been the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.</p></note> To parch some of the corn we had brought with us, since we had eaten it raw for <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> past, we went on the island; but, as we found no wood, we agreed to go to the river behind the point, which was <num value="1">one</num> league off. We were unable to get there by any efforts, so violent was the current on the way, which drove us from the land while we contended, and strove to gain it. The north wind, which <pb id="p.80" n="80"/> came from the shore, began to blow so strongly, that it drove us to sea without our being able to overcome it. Half a league out we sounded, and found, that, with <num value="30">thirty</num> fathoms, we could not get the bottom; but we could not be satisfied that the river was not the cause of cur failure to reach it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>Toiling in this manner to fetch the land, we navigated <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure>, and at the end of the time, a little while before the sun rose, we saw many smokes along the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>While attempting to reach them, we found ourselves in <num value="3">three</num> fathoms of water; and, it being dark, we dared not come to land; for, as we had seen so many smokes, we thought some danger might surprise us, and the obscurity leave us at a loss what to do. So we determined to wait until the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>When it came, the boats had all lost sight of each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>I found myself in <num value="30">thirty</num> fathoms; and, keeping my course until the hour of vespers, I observed <num value="2">two</num> boats, and, as I drew near to them, I found that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> I approached was that of the governor, who asked me what I thought we should do. I told him we ought to join that boat which went in the advance, and by no means to leave her; and, the <num value="3">three</num> being together, that we should keep on our way to where <name n="God" type="God">God</name> should be pleased to direct us. He answered me, saying it could not be done, because the boat was far to sea, and he wished to reach the shore; that, if I wished to follow him, I should order the persons of my boat to take the oars, and work, as it was only by strength of arm that the land could be gained.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>He was advised to this course by a captain he had with him named <persName n="Pantoja,,,,," id="n0226.0004.00080.00094" reg="mostcommon:Pantoja,nomatch:0"><surname>Pantoja</surname></persName>, who told him, that, if he did <pb id="p.81" n="81"/> not fetch the land that day, in <measure n="6days" type="date">six days</measure> more they would not reach it; and in that time they must inevitably famish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>I, seeing his will, took my oar; and the same did all who were in my boat, to obey it. We rowed until near sunset; but, as the governor carried in his boat the healthiest men there were among the whole, we could not by any means hold with or follow her. Seeing this, I asked him to give me a rope from his boat, that I might be enabled to keep up with him; but he answered me that he would do no little,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/> 
<p>i.e., that it would be as much as he could do.</p></note> if they, as they were, should be able to reach the land that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>I said to him, that, since he saw the little strength we had to follow him and do what he had commanded, he should tell me what he would that I should do. He answered me, that it was no longer a time in which <num value="1">one</num> should command another, but that each should do what he thought best to save his own life; that he so intended to act; and, saying this, he departed with his boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>As I could not follow him, I steered to the other boat at sea, which waited for me; and, having come up with her, I found her to be the <num value="1">one</num> commanded by the captains Be&ntilde;alosa and <persName n="Tellez,,,,," id="n0226.0004.00081.00095" reg="mostcommon:Tellez,nomatch:0"><surname>Tellez</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>Thus we continued in company, eating a daily ration of half a handful of raw maize, until the end of <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure>, when we lost sight of each other in a storm; and such was the weather, that it was only by divine favor that we did not all go down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>Because of the winter and its inclemency, the many days we had suffered hunger, and the heavy beating of the waves, the people began the next day to despair in such a manner, that, when the sun went down, all who were in my boat were <pb id="p.82" n="82"/> fallen <num value="1">one</num> on another, so near to death, that there were few among them in a state of sensibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>Among them all at this time there were not <num value="5">five</num> men on their feet; and, when the night came, there were left only the master and myself who could work the boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>At the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> hour of the night, he said to me that I must take charge of her, for that he was in such condition he believed that night he should die. So I took the paddle; and after <time value="12am">midnight</time> I went to see if the master was alive, and he said to me that he was better, and that he would take the charge until day. I declare that in that hour I would have more willingly died than seen so many people before me in such condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>After the master took the direction of the boat, I lay down a little while, but without repose; for nothing at that time was farther from me than sleep.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>Near the dawn of day, it seemed to me that I heard the tumbling of the sea; for, as the coast was low, it roared loudly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>Surprised at this, I called to the master, who answered me that he believed we were near the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>We sounded, and found ouselves in <num value="7">seven</num> fathoms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>He thought we should keep the sea until sunrise; and accordingly I took an oar, and pulled on the side of the land until we were a league distant; and we then gave her stern to the sea. Near the shore, a wave took us that knocked the boat out of the water to the distance of the throw of a crowbar; and by the violence of the blow nearly all of the people who were in her like dead were roused to consciousness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>Finding themselves near the shore, they began to move on hands and feet, and crawled to land in some ravines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>There we made fire, parching some of the maize we <pb id="p.83" n="83"/> brought with us, and where we found rain-water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>From the warmth of the fire the people recovered their faculties, and began somewhat to exert themselves.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/> 
<p>This strange incident of the revival of the men who seemed to have died may possibly have suggested to the poet <rs>Coleridge</rs> that passage in his <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Mariner,,Ancient,,," id="n0226.0004.00083.00096" reg="default:Mariner,Ancient,,,"><foreName>Ancient</foreName> <surname>Mariner</surname></persName></q> where the dead sailors rise up again:&mdash;</p> <lg type="pentameter"> <l>&lsquo;They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,</l> <l>Nor spake, nor moved their eyes:</l> <l>It had been strange, even in a dream,</l> <l>To see those dead men rise.&rsquo;</l></lg></note> The day on which we arrived here was the <dateStruct value="-11-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>.</p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>After the people had eaten, I ordered <persName n="Oviedo,,Lope,,,de" id="n0226.0004.00083.00099" reg="expanded:Oviedo,Lope,,,"><foreName>Lope</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Oviedo</surname></persName>, who had more strength, and was stouter, than any of the rest, to go to some trees that were near, and, having climbed into <num value="1">one</num> of them, to survey the country in which we were, and endeavor to get some knowledge of it. He did as I bade him, and made out that we were on an island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>He saw that the ground was pawed up in the manner that the land is wont to be where cattle range; and hence it appeared to him that this should be the country of Christians, and thus he reported to us. I ordered him to return to examine much more particularly, and see if there were any roads in it that were worn, and without going far, because of the danger there might be. He went, and, coming to a path, he took it for the distance of half a league, and found some huts without any tenants, for the <name>Indians</name> <pb id="p.84" n="84"/> had gone into the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>He took from them an earthen pot, a little dog, some few mullets, and thus returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>It appearing to us that he was long absent, we sent <num value="2">two</num> others, that they should look and see what might have befallen him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>They met him near by, and saw that <num value="3">three</num> Indians with bows and arrows followed, and were calling to him; and he, in the same way, was beckoning them on. Thus they arrived where we were; the <name>Indians</name> remaining a little way back, seated on the same bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>Half an hour after, they were supported by <num value="50">fifty</num> other <name>Indian</name> bowmen, whom, whether large or not, our fears made giants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>They stopped near us with the <num value="3">three</num> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>It were idle to think that there were any among us who could make defence; for it would have been difficult to find <num value="6">six</num> that could raise themselves from the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>The assessor and I went and called them, and they came to us. We endeavored the best we could to recommend ourselves to their favor, and secure their good-will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>We gave them beads and hawk-bells; and each <num value="1">one</num> of them gave me an arrow, which is a pledge of friendship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>They told us by signs that they would return in the morning, and bring us something to eat, as at that time they had nothing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>The next day at sunrise, the time the <name>Indians</name> had appointed, they came as they had promised, and brought us a large quantity of fish, and certain roots that are eaten by them, of the size of walnuts, some a little larger, others a little smaller, the greater part of them got from under the water, and with much labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>In the evening they returned, and brought us more fish, and some of the roots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>They sent their women and <pb id="p.85" n="85"/> children to look at us, who returned rich with the hawk-bells and beads that we gave them; and they came afterward on other days in the same way. As we found that we had been provisioned with fish, roots, water, and other things for which we asked, we determined to embark again, and pursue our course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>We dug out our boat from the sand in which it was buried; and it became necessary that we should all strip ourselves, and go through great exertion to launch her, for we were in such state, that things very much lighter sufficed to make us much labor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>Thus embarked, at the distance of <num value="2">two</num> cross-bow shots in the sea we shipped a wave that wet us all. As we were naked, and the cold was very great, the oars loosened in our hands; and the next blow the sea struck us capsized the boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>The assessor and <num value="2">two</num> others held fast to her for preservation; but it happened to be for far otherwise, as the boat carried them over, and they drowned under her. As the surf near the shore was very high, a single roll of the sea threw the remainder into the waves, and half drowned us on the shore of the island, without our losing any more than the boat had taken under.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>Those of us who survived escaped naked as we were born, losing all that we had; and, although the whole was of little value, at that time it was worth much.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>As it was then in the month of <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>, the cold severe, and our bodies so emaciated that the bones might have been counted with little difficulty, we had become perfect figures of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>For myself, I can say, that, from the month of <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> past, I had not eaten other thing than maize, and sometimes I found myself obliged <pb id="p.86" n="86"/> to eat it unparched; for, although the horses were slaughtered while the boats were being built, I never could eat of them, and I did not eat fish <num value="10">ten</num> times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>I state this to avoid giving excuses, and that every <num value="1">one</num> may judge in what condition we were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>After all these misfortunes, there came a north wind upon us, from which we were nearer to death than life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>Thanks be to our <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, that, looking among the brands that we had used there, we found sparks from which we made great fires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>And thus we were asking mercy of him, and pardon for our transgressions, shedding many tears, and each regretting, not his own fate alone, but that of his comrades about him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>At sunset, the <name>Indians</name>, thinking that we had not gone, came to seek us, and bring us food; but when they saw us thus, in a plight so different from what it was formerly, and so extraordinary, they were alarmed, and turned back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>I went toward them, and called to them; and they returned much frightened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>I gave them to understand by signs how that our boat had sunk, and <num value="3">three</num> of our number been drowned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>There, before them, they saw <num value="2">two</num> of the departed; and those that remained were near joining them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>The <rs>Indians</rs>, at sight of the disaster that had befallen us, and our state of suffering and melancholy destitution, sat down amongst us; and from the sorrow and pity they felt for us, they all began to lament, and so earnestly, that they might have been heard at a distance; and they continued so doing more than half an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>It was strange to see these men, so wild and untaught, howling like brutes over our misfortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>It caused in me, as in others, an increase of feeling, and a livelier sense of our calamity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/><pb id="p.87" n="87"/></p> 
<p>Their cries having ceased, I talked with the <name>Christians</name>, and said, that, if it appeared well to them, I would beg these Indians to take us to their houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>Some who had been in New Spain said that we ought not to think of it; for, if we should do so, they would sacrifice us to their idols.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>But seeing no better course, and that any other led to nearer and more certain death, I disregarded what was said, and besought the <name>Indians</name> to take us to their dwellings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>They signified that it would give them great delight, and that we should tarry a little, that we might do what we asked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>Presently, <num value="30">thirty</num> of them loaded themselves with wood, and started for their houses, which were far off, and we remained with the others until near night, when, holding us up, they carried us with all haste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>Because of the extreme coldness of the weather, lest any <num value="1">one</num> should die or fail by the way, they caused <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> large fires to be placed at intervals; and at each <num value="1">one</num> of them they warmed us, and, when they saw that we had regained some strength and warmth, they took us to the next so swiftly that they hardly permitted us to put our feet to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>In this manner, we went as far as their habitations, where we found that they had made a house for us with many fires in it. An hour after our arrival, they began to dance, and hold great rejoicing, which lasted all night, although for us there was no joy, appetite, or sleep, awaiting the time they should make us victims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>In the morning, they again gave us fish and roots, and showed us such hospitality, that we were re-assured, and lost somewhat the feat of the sacrifice.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>These were made slaves, and were severely treated.]</p></argument> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>I was obliged to remain with the people of the island more than a year; and because of the hard work they put upon me, and their harsh treatment, I determined to flee from them, and go to those of Charruco, who inhabit the forests and country of the main; for the life I led was insupportable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>Beside much other labor, I had to get out roots from below the water, and from among the cane where it grew in the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>From this employment I had my fingers so worn, that, did a straw but touch them, it would draw blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>Many of the canes were broken, so that they often tore my flesh; and I had to go in the midst of them with only the clothing on me I have mentioned.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>Accordingly, I put myself to work to get over to the other <rs>Indians</rs>; and afterward, while I was with them, affairs changed for me somewhat more favorably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>I set myself to trafficking, and strove to turn my employment to profit in the ways I could best contrive; and by this means I got from the <name>Indians</name> food and good treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>They would beg me to go from <num value="1">one</num> part to another for things of which they have need; for, in consequence of continual hostilities, they cannot travel the country, nor make many exchanges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>With my merchandise and trade I went into the interior as far as I pleased; and I travelled along the coast <num value="40">forty</num> or <num value="50">fifty</num> leagues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>The chief of my wares was pieces of sea-snails and their <pb id="p.89" n="89"/> cones, conches, that are used for cutting,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/> 
<p>The sea-snails and conches (or conchs) were shells of various species.</p></note> and a fruit like a bean, of the highest value among them, which they use as a medicine, and employ in their dances and festivities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>There are sea-beads also, and other articles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>Such were what I carried into the interior; and, in barter for them, I brought back skins, ochre, with which they rub and color their faces, and flint for arrow-points, cement and hard canes, of which to make arrows, and tassels that are made of the hair of deer, ornamented, and dyed red.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>This occupation suited me well; for the travel gave me liberty to go where I wished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>I was not obliged to work, and was not a slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>Wherever I went, I received fair treatment; and the <name>Indians</name> gave me to eat for the sake of my commodities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>My leading object, while journeying in this business, was to find out the way by which I should have to go forward; and I became well known to the inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>They were pleased when they saw me, and I had brought for them what they wanted; and those that did not know me sought and desired my acquaintance for my reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>The hardships that I underwent in this it were long to tell, as well of peril and privation, as of storms and cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>Many of them found me in the wilderness and alone; but I came forth from them all, by the great mercy of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> our <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>Because of them, I ceased to pursue the business in winter; for it is a season in which the natives themselves retire to their villages and huts, sluggish, and incapable of exertion.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>We left these, and travelled through so many sorts of people, of such diverse languages, that the memory fails to recall them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>They ever plundered each other; and those that lost, like those that gained, were fully content.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>We drew so many followers after us, that we had not use for their services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>While on our way through these vales, each of the <name>Indians</name> carried a club <num value="3">three</num> palms in length, and kept himself on the alert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>On raising a hare, which are abundant, they surround it directly; and numerous clubs are thrown at it, and with a precision astonishing to see.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>So many of them did they give us, that at night, when we stopped, each <num value="1">one</num> of us had <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> back-loads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>Those who had bows were not with us, but dispersed about the ridge in quest of deer; and, when they came at night, they brought <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> for each of us, besides birds, the quail, and other game.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>Indeed, all that they found or killed they put before us, without themselves daring to take any thing until we had blessed it, though they should be dying of hunger; for they had so established the custom since marching with us.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>After these were put up, we ordered the deer and hares to be roasted, with the rest that had been taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>This was soon done by means of certain ovens made for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>We took a little of each; and the remainder we gave to the principal personages that came with us, directing them to divide them among the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> brought his portion to us, that we should give it our benediction; for not until then dared they to eat of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>The women <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> brought us the pears, spiders, worms, and whatever else they could gather; for, even if they were famishing, they would eat nothing unless we gave it to them.

<p>In company with these we crossed a great river coming from the north; and, passing over some plains <num value="30">thirty</num> leagues in extent, we found many persons who came from a great distance to receive us; and they met us on the road over which we had to travel, and received us in the manner of those we had left. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>We told them to conduct us toward the north; and they answered us as they had done before, saying, that, in that direction, there were no people, except afar off; that there was nothing to eat, nor could water be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>Nowithstanding all this, we persisted, and said that in that course we desired to go; and they still tried to excuse themselves in the best manner possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>At this we became offended: and <num value="1">one</num> night I went out to sleep in the woods, apart from them; but they directly went to where I was, and remained there all night without sleeping, and in great fear, talking to me, and telling me how terrified they were, beseeching us to be no longer angry, and that though they knew they should die on the way, they would nevertheless lead us in the direction we desired to go.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>Whilst we still feigned to be displeased, that their fright might not leave them, there happened a remarkable circumstance, which was, that on this same day many of them became ill, and the next day <num value="8">eight</num> men died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>Abroad in the country wheresoever this became known, there was such dread, that it seemed as if the inhabitants at sight of us would die of fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>They besought us that we would not remain angered, nor require that many of them should die. They believed that we caused their death by only willing it; when in truth it gave us so much pain that it could not be <pb id="p.96" n="96"/> greater; for, beyond the loss of them that died, we feared they might all die, or abandon us out of fear, and all other people thenceforward should do the same, seeing what had come to these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>We prayed to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> our <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, that he would relieve them; and thenceforth all those that were sick began to get better. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>From that place onward there was another usage, that those who knew of our approach did not come out to receive us on the roads, as the others had done, but we found them in their houses, and others they had made for our reception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>They were all seated with their faces turned to the wall, their heads down, and the hair brought before their eyes, and their property placed in a heap in the middle of their houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1576"/>But, when we could not, we used little delay, but suddenly laid hands upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1909"/>They reviewed all their force, and found <num value="24">twenty-four</num> canoes with <num value="60">sixty</num> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1910"/>They hunted, and caught some wild animals there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1911"/>Passing thence about <num value="3">three</num> leagues farther on, we camped, in order to rest for the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1912"/>Forthwith some began to cut down timber, others to pull off bark to cover lodges to shelter them, others to fell large trees with which to barricade their lodges on the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1913"/>They know so well how to construct these barricades, that <num value="500">five hundred</num> of their enemies would find considerable difficulty in forcing them, in less than <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>, without great loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1914"/>They do not fortify the side of the river along which their canoes are ranged, so as to be able to embark, should occasion require.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1917"/>Remarking that, I remonstrated with them against the error they committed; told them to watch, as they saw us do, all night, and to have outposts to spy and see if they could perceive any thing, and not to live in that style, like cattle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1918"/>They told me they couldn't watch, and that they labored all day hunting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1919"/>So that, when they go to war, they divide their force into <num value="3">three</num>: to wit, <num value="1">one</num> party, scattered in divers places, hunting; another forms the main body, which is always under arms; and another party as a vanguard, to scout along the river, and see whether they will not discover some trail or mark indicating the passage of friends or enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1920"/>This they ascertain by certain marks the chiefs of <num value="1">one</num> nation give to those of another, which are not always alike, notifying each other from time to time when they alter any. By this means, they recognize whether those who have passed are friends or enemies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1921"/>The hunters never hunt in advance of the main body, or the scouts, so as not to create any alarm or disorder, but in the rear, and in the direction where they do not apprehend enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1922"/>They thus continue until they are <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> journey from the foe, when they advance stealthily by night, all in a body, except the scouts, and retire by day into the picket-fort, where they repose, without wandering abroad, making any noise, or building a fire, even for cooking, during that <pb id="p.272" n="272"/> time, so as not to be discovered, should their enemies happen to pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1923"/>The only fire they make is to smoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1924"/>They eat dried <name>Indian</name> meal, which they steep in water, like porridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1925"/>They prepare this meal for use when they are pinched, and when they are near the enemy, or when retreating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1926"/>After these attacks, they do not amuse themselves hunting, retreating precipitately. ..</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1929"/>We caught a quantity of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1930"/>There is also quite a number of beavers, as well in the river as in several other streams which fall into it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1932"/>Next day, we entered the lake, which is of considerable extent, some <num value="50">fifty</num> or <num value="60">sixty</num> leagues, where I saw <num value="4">four</num> beautiful islands, <num value="10">ten</num>, <num value="12">twelve</num>, and <num value="15">fifteen</num> leagues in length, formerly inhabited, as well as the <placeName key="tgn,7020830" n="1.000 1" reg="iroquois river, united states, north and central america">Iroquois River</placeName>, by <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0226.0012.00272.00443" reg="mostcommon:Indians,Canadian,,,:1"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, but abandoned since they have been at war the <num value="1">one</num> with the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1937"/>The form of the body resembles that of the pike; and it is armed with scales that the thrust of a poniard cannot pierce; and it is of a silver gray-color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1938"/>The point of the snout is like that of a hog. This fish makes war on all others in the lakes and rivers, and possesses, as these people assure, a wonderful instinct; which is, that, when it wants to catch any birds, it goes among the rushes or reeds bordering the lake in many places, keeping the beak out of the water without budging; so that when birds perch on the beak, imagining it a limb of a tree, it is so subtle, that, closing the jaws which it keeps half open, it draws the birds under water by the feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1939"/>The <rs>Indians</rs> gave me a head of it, which they prize highly, saying, when they have a headache, they let blood with the teeth of this fish at the seat of the pain, which immediately goes away.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1940"/>Continuing our route along the west side of the lake, contemplating the country, I saw on the east side very high mountains capped with snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1948"/>Now, on coming within about <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> journey of the enemy's quarters, we travelled only by night, and rested by day. Nevertheless, they never omitted their usual superstitions to ascertain whether their enterprise would be successful, and often asked me whether I had dreamed, and seen their enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1949"/>I answered No, and encouraged them, and gave them good hopes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1950"/>Night fell, and we continued our journey until morning, when we withdrew into the picket-fort to pass the remainder of the day there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1951"/>About <num value="10">ten</num> or <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time>, I lay down, after having walked some time around our quarters; and, falling asleep, I thought <pb id="p.275" n="275"/> I beheld our enemies, the <rs>Iroquois</rs>, drowning within sight of us in the lake near a mountain; and being desirous to save them, that our savage allies told me that I must let them all perish, as they were good for nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1952"/>On awaking, they did not omit, as usual, to ask me if I had any dream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1953"/>I did tell them, in fact, what I had dreamed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1954"/>It gained such credit among them, that they no longer doubted but they should meet with success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1955"/>At nightfall we embarked in our canoes to continue our journey, and, as we advanced very softly and noiselessly, we encountered a war-party of <placeName reg="Iroquois, Erie, New York" key="tgn,2414563">Iroquois</placeName>, on the <dateStruct value="--29"><day reg="2">29th</day></dateStruct> of the month, about <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> at night, at the point of a cape which juts into the lake on the west side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1956"/>They and we began to shout, each seizing his arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1957"/>We withdrew towards the water; and the <rs>Iroquois</rs> repaired on shore, and arranged all their canoes, the <num value="1">one</num> beside the other, and began to hew down trees with villanous axes which they sometimes got in war, and other of stone, and fortified themselves very securely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1958"/>Our party likewise kept their canoes arranged, the <num value="1">one</num> alongside the other, tied to poles so as not to run adrift, in order to fight all together, should need be. We were on the water about an arrow-shot from their barricades.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1959"/>When they were armed and in order, they sent <num value="2">two</num> canoes from the fleet, to know if their enemies wished to fight; who answered they desired nothing else, but that just then there was not much light, and that we must wait for day to distinguish each other, and that they would give us battle at sunrise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1960"/>This was agreed to by our party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1961"/>Meanwhile the whole night was spent <pb id="p.276" n="276"/> in dancing and singing, as well on <num value="1">one</num> side as on the other, mingled with an infinitude of insults and other taunts; such as the little courage they had, how pow-&eacute;rless their resistance against their arms, and, that when day would break, they should experience this to their ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1962"/>Ours, likewise, did not fail in repartee, telling they should witness the effect of arms they had never seen before; and a multitude of other speeches, as is usual at a siege of a town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1967"/>After being equipped with light armor, we took each an arquebuse, and went ashore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1971"/>I promised to do what I could, and that I was very sorry they could not clearly understand me, so as to give them the order and plan of attacking their enemies, as we should indubitably defeat them all,&mdash;but there was no help for that,&mdash;that I <pb id="p.277" n="277"/> was very glad to encourage them, and to manifest to them my good &mdash; will when we should be engaged.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1972"/>The moment we landed, they began to run about <num value="200">two hundred</num> paces towards their enemies, who stood firm, and had not yet perceived my companions, who went into the bush with some savages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1973"/>Ours commenced calling me in a loud voice, and, making way for me, opened in <num value="2">two</num>, and placed me at their head, marching about <num value="20">twenty</num> paces in advance, until I was within <num value="30">thirty</num> paces of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1974"/>The moment they saw me, they halted, gazing at me, and I at them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1977"/>Ours, on witnessing a shot so favorable for them, set up such tremendous shouts, that thunder could not have been heard; and yet there was no lack of arrows on <num value="1">one</num> side and the other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1978"/>The <rs>Iroquois</rs> were greatly astonished, seeing <num value="2">two</num> men killed so instantaneously, notwithstanding they were provided with arrow-proof armor, woven of cotton thread and wood: this frightened them very much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1979"/>Whilst I was reloading, <num value="1">one</num> of my companions in the bush fired a shot, which so astonished them anew, seeing their chiefs slain, that they lost courage, took to flight, and abandoned the field and their fort, hiding themselves in the depths of the forest, whither pursuing them, I killed some others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2122"/>It was at length agreed among those who were spectators, that as this phenomenon moved towards the land,&mdash; whether or not it was an animal, or any thing that had life in it,&mdash;it would be well to inform all the <name>Indians</name> on the inhabited islands of what they had seen, and put them on their guard.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2123"/>Accordingly, they sent runners and watermen off to carry the news to their scattered chiefs, that these might send off in every direction for the warriors to come in.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2124"/>By this time the chiefs of the different tribes were assembled on <placeName reg="York Island, Wisconsin, United States" key="tgn,2785820">York Island</placeName>, and were deliberating on the manner they should receive their <hi rend="italics">Mannitto</hi>on his arrival.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2125"/>Every step had been taken to be well provided with <pb id="p.292" n="292"/> plenty of meat for a sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2126"/>The women were required to prepare the best of victuals; idols or images were examined, and put in order; and a great dance was supposed not only to be an agreeable entertainment for the <hi rend="italics">Mannitto</hi>,but might, with the addition of a sacrifice, contribute towards appeasing him, in case he was angry with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2127"/>The conjurers were also set to work to determine what the meaning of this phenomenon was, and what the result would be. Both to these, and to the chiefs and wise men of the nation, men, women, and children were looking up for advice and protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2128"/>Between hope and fear, and in confusion, a dance commenced.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2129"/>While in this situation, fresh runners arrive, declaring it a house of various colors, and crowded with living creatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2130"/>It now appears to be certain that it is the great <hi rend="italics">Mannitto</hi>bringing them some kind of game, such as they had not before; but other runners, soon after arriving, declare it a large house of various colors, full of people, yet of quite a different color than they&mdash;the <name>Indians</name>&mdash;are of; that they were also dressed in a different manner from them, and that <num value="1">one</num> in particular appeared altogether red, which must be the <hi rend="italics">Mannitto</hi> himself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2131"/>They are soon hailed from the vessel, though in a language they do not understand; yet they shout&mdash;or yell&mdash;in their way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2132"/>The house&mdash;or large canoe, as some will have it&mdash;stops, and a smaller canoe comes ashore with the red man and some others in it: <pb id="p.293" n="293"/> some stay by this canoe to guard it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2139"/>He then took the glass, and, bidding the assembly farewell, drank it off.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2315"/>After this, some thought it best, for nearness of the river, to go down and travel on the sea-sands, by which means some of our men were tired, and lagged behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2316"/>So we staid and gathered them up, and struck into the land again, where we found a little path to certain heaps of sand, <num value="1">one</num> whereof was covered with old mats, and had a wooden thing like a mortar whelmed<note anchored="yes">
