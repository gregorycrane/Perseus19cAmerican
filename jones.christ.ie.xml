<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>On the memorable <dateStruct value="1861-04-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> day of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>&mdash;the day on which the <orgName n="Virginia Convention" type="convention">Virginia Convention</orgName>, in response to <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0163.0001.00017.00001" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s call for <num value="75000">seventy-five thousand</num> men to coerce the seceded States, passed its ordinance of secession&mdash;there occurred at the little village of <placeName reg="Louisa Court House">Louisa Court House</placeName> a scene similar to those enacted all over <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 20" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and the <rs>South</rs>, which none who witnessed it can ever forget.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>The <q direct="unspecified">Louisa Blues,</q> a volunteer company composed of the best young men of the county, were drilling at <time value="12pm">noon</time> on the court green, when a telegram from the governor of the <rs>State</rs> ordered them to be ready to take a train of cars at sundown that evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Immediately all was bustle and activity&mdash;couriers were sent in every direction to notify absentees&mdash;and in every household there were busy fingers and anxious hearts preparing those brave men to meet promptly the call of the sovereign power of their native State.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>I remember <num value="1">one</num> doting mother who wept in secret the tears she restrained in the presence of her loved boy of just <num value="16">sixteen</num> summers, who had but recently risen from severe illness, but whose frame grew strong with eagerness to march with his comrades to the post of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>When asked if she was not willing for her boy to respond to his country's call, she replied in that spirit of patriotism which characterized the women of the <rs>South</rs> throughout the war: <q direct="unspecified">Certainly I am!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>I wish him to go, and should be ashamed of him if he were unwilling to go. But there is <num value="1">one</num> thought of which I cannot rid myself, and which causes me the bitterest anguish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>I have always looked upon an army as a complete <quote>school of vice,</quote> and I fear that, amid the demoralizing influences of the camp, my boy (carefully nurtured though he has been) will wander far from the paths of virtue and religion, and will come back, if spared to return, not the innocent boy send forth to my country's service but a reckless, vicious man.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/><pb id="p.18" n="18"/></p> 
<p>An hour before the appointed time that splendid company&mdash; mustering considerably more than its previous roll strength, for a number of new recruits had enlisted in its ranks&mdash;marched to the depot where an immense crowd had assembled to see them off. An aged minister of the gospel (now gone to his reward) spoke words of earnest counsel, and led in a fervent prayer that the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of <persName><foreName>Jacob</foreName></persName> might go forth with these young men, keep them in the way whither they went, and bring them back to their homes in peace and safety&mdash;but, above all, that he would shield them from the vices of the camp and lead them into paths of righteousness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The man of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is interrupted by the shrill whistle of the iron horse&mdash;the train dashes up to the depot&mdash;all are soon aboard, and, amid tender farewells and suppressed sobs of anxious friends, and the waving of handkerchiefs and vociferous cheers by the vast crowd, those patriot-soldiers hurry forth at the bidding of their loved and honored <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 20" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>At <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName> they were met by companies from <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> and <persName n="Albemarle,,,,," id="n0163.0001.00018.00002" reg="mostcommon:Albemarle,nomatch:0"><surname>Albemarle</surname></persName>, and <num value="2">two</num> companies of students from the <orgName n="University of Virginia" type="university">University of Virginia</orgName>, who marched forth from those classic shades to illustrate a bright page in the history of their <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Mater,,Alma,,," id="n0163.0001.00018.00003" reg="default:Mater,Alma,,,"><foreName>Alma</foreName> <surname>Mater</surname></persName></hi>.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The call of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 20" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> now echoes through the land&mdash;from seaboard to mountain-valley, from <placeName reg="Alleghany, Alleghany, Virginia" key="tgn,2110294">Alleghany</placeName> to <placeName reg="Chesapeake Bay, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7013592">Chesapeake</placeName>, from the <rs>Potomac</rs> to the <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> border, the tramp of her sons is heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The farmer leaves his plow in the furrow, the mechanic his job unfinished, the merchant his books unposted, the lawyer his brief unargued, the physician his patient unattended, the professor his chair unfilled, the student his classes, and the preacher his pulpit, and there rush to our northern frontier, not Hessian or Milesian mercenaries, not men bought up for so much <q direct="unspecified">bounty money,</q> but the wealth, the intelligence, the refinement and culture, the virtue and patriotism, the very flower of our Southern youth and manhood.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Thus was formed what was afterwards called the <hi rend="italics">Army of</hi> <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Virginia</placeName></hi>&mdash;the noblest army (I hesitate not calmly to affirm, after the lapse of years) that ever marched under any banner or fought for any cause <q direct="unspecified">in all the tide of time.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>But I do not propose, in this volume, to attempt even a sketch of the military exploits of this noble army of heroes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>I revert rather to another and far different scene from the <num value="1">one</num> I have sketched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Over a year has rolled by, and that fair-haired, rosy-cheeked boy, <q direct="unspecified">mother's darling,</q> of <dateStruct value="1861-04-"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>&mdash;now a bronzed veteran of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>, who has followed the <q direct="unspecified">stars and bars</q> on many a victorious field&mdash;returns to his boyhood's home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>But he comes not back with light, elastic step and erect carriage as when he marched forth so gayly at his country's call.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>He is borne on a litter&mdash;he has been shot through the lungs, his life-tide is ebbing away, and he has come home to die. On that memorable <dateStruct value="1862-06-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> day of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year>1862</year>,</dateStruct> at <placeName reg="Cold Harbor">Cold Harbor</placeName>, when <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Stonewall,,,,," id="n0163.0001.00019.00004" reg="mostcommon:Stonewall,nomatch:0"><surname>Stonewall</surname></persName></q> <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0163.0001.00019.00005" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> issued his crisp order, <q direct="unspecified">Tell <persName n="Ewell,General,,,," id="n0163.0001.00019.00006" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Ewell</surname></persName> to sweep the field with the bayonet,</q> and our whole line pressed grandly forward, carried every position before it, and persuaded <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0163.0001.00019.00007" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,H.,B.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> that it was indeed time to <q direct="unspecified">change base</q> from before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to the shelter of his gun-boats at <placeName reg="Harrison's Landing, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2378614">Harrison's Landing</placeName>, our youthful hero fell in the very forefront of the battle in <num value="1">one</num> of the most splendid charges of the famous old <orgName type="regiment" key="13VAInfantry">Thirteenth Virginia Infantry</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The surgeons gave us no hope, but <name n="God" type="God">God</name> spared him to reach home and linger for over <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> to illustrate how a Christian soldier could be patient under suffering, and how, when he came to die, a smile could light up his countenance, joy could beam from his eye, and peace reign within his heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The camp had not proven to him a <q direct="unspecified">school of vice,</q> but on the contrary he had learned there the preciousness of his mother's Bible, and had gone with simple faith to her Saviour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>And as the last hour drew near he met death with calm resignation, said to the weeping loved ones who stood around: <q direct="unspecified">I trust in <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> and am not afraid to die,</q> and left, in his triumphant death as well as in the peaceful hours of his later life, the fullest assurance that he went to join his sainted mother&mdash;for she had <q direct="unspecified">gone before,</q> a few weeks prior to his death&mdash;in that brighter, better home above, where <q direct="unspecified">war's rude alarms</q> never disturb, and loved ones never part.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The fears of that <name>Christian</name> mother, as her boy left the parental roof to encounter the peculiar temptations of soldier life, were the fears of our wisest and best men. Armies had been hitherto <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> regarded as decidedly demoralizing, and it had passed into a proverb: <q direct="unspecified">The worse the man the better the soldier,</q> against which the examples of <persName n="Vickars,,Hedley,,," id="n0163.0001.00020.00008" reg="default:Vickars,Hedley,,,"><foreName>Hedley</foreName> <surname>Vickars</surname></persName>, <persName n="Havelock,,,,," id="n0163.0001.00020.00009" reg="mostcommon:Havelock,nomatch:0"><surname>Havelock</surname></persName>, <persName n="Gardiner,Colonel,,,," id="n0163.0001.00020.00010" reg="mostcommon:Gardiner,W.,F.,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Gardiner</surname></persName> and other <name>Christian</name> soldiers were cited in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It is not for a moment denied that these fears were well-founded, and that as a rule the influence of an army is demoralizing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Its very object is to destroy life, and its scenes of carnage unquestionably tend, if not properly used, to blunt the moral perceptions, and harden in iniquity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>And, then, absence from the influences of home and church, and the restraints of society, coupled with the common idea that things which would be criminal at other times are allowable in the army&mdash;all tend to raise the floodgates of immorality and vice.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>I shall give no rose-colored picture in these sketches, but shall frankly admit that vices common to most armies were, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>but too prevalent in our own, and that many of our most skilful officers and bravest men blotted their fair name by open vice or secret sin.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>But I shall be able to show, on the other hand, that <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> <hi rend="italics">was</hi> in our camps with wonderful power, and that no army in all history&mdash;not even <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0163.0001.00020.00011" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>'s <q direct="unspecified">Roundheads</q>&mdash;had in it as much of real, evangelical religion and devout piety as the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>I shall not discuss in these pages the causes of the great <q direct="unspecified">War between the <name>States</name>,</q> or revive any of its, <q direct="unspecified">buried issues.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Let its stormy passions, its animosities, its bitter memories be buried forever beneath the wave of forgetfulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>And let us thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name> that men who <q direct="unspecified">wore the blue</q> and men who <q direct="unspecified">wore the gray</q> may meet once more in friendly reunion&mdash;that older brethren, <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, long alienated, have come to <q direct="unspecified">see eye to eye,</q> and to realize that they had only been <q direct="unspecified">looking at the opposite sides of the shield</q>&mdash;that younger men have no alienations to reconcile, no bitter memories of a stormy past to efface&mdash;that the day is hastening when the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> shall be more ready to do justice to each other's motives &mdash;that the day has come when a Confederate soldier, on a Boston platform, or a Federal soldier, to a Charleston audience, may <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/></p><l>Shoulder his crutch</l> <l>And fight his battles o'er again,</l></quote> while those who were once his enemies, now his friends, stand with uncovered head, or cheer to the echo his story of heroic deeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/><pb id="p.21" n="21"/></p> 
<p>But it is due to the truth of history, as well as necessary to a correct understanding of my subject, that I should say that the <rs>Christian</rs> people of the <rs>South</rs> not only thought they were right in resisting the invasion of their soil and the coercion, by the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, of sovereign States, but that they went forth to battle, or sent their sons, in firm reliance upon <q direct="unspecified">the <name n="God" type="God"><rs type="role" reg="Lord">Lord</rs> of hosts</name>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Scarcely a company moved without some public religious service, and it was considered a most important part of each man's equipment that he should carry in his knapsack a copy of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> word.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>All of our evangelical denominations were well represented in the rank and file of our army, and many of our preachers felt it their duty to go to the front, accompanied by the very flower of their young men. Of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="4">four</num> companies from <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> to arrive in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 20" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, <num value="3">three</num> of the captains were earnest, <name>Christian</name> men, and <num value="50">fifty</num> of <num value="1">one</num> of the companies were members of the same church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>A regiment, stationed near <placeName reg="Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia" key="tgn,7014278">Portsmouth</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1861-06-"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, was reported to contain <num value="400">400</num> of the same denomination, and another regiment had in its ranks <hi rend="italics"><num value="5">five</num></hi> ministers of the gospel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>I well remember that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time I ever saw the famous old Rockbridge Artillery&mdash;on the <dateStruct value="1861-07-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> when we were drawn up in line of battle at <placeName key="tgn,2058511" n="1.000 2" reg="darksville, randolph, missouri">Darksville</placeName>, in the lower <placeName reg="Valley of Virginia">Valley of Virginia</placeName>, expecting an attack from <persName n="Patterson,General,,,," id="n0163.0001.00021.00012" reg="mostcommon:Patterson,William,Smith,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Patterson</surname></persName>&mdash;it contained <num value="7">seven</num> Masters of Arts of the <orgName n="University of Virginia" type="university">University of Virginia</orgName>, <num value="40">forty</num>two other college graduates, <num value="19">nineteen</num> theological students, others (including a son of <persName n="Lee,General,R.,E.,," id="n0163.0001.00021.00013" reg="default:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>) who were among the noblest young men of the <rs>South</rs>, and a proportion of <name>Christian</name> men as surprisingly large as it was highly gratifying.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>When the news of the secession of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 20" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> reached the quiet little town of <placeName reg="Lexington, Lexington, Virginia" key="tgn,7013889">Lexington, Virginia</placeName>, nestled among the <rs type="place">Blue mountains</rs>, some of the students of <orgName n="Washington College" type="college">Washington College</orgName> at once raised a secession flag on the dome of the college building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>(They had done the same thing some days before, but the faculty had unanimously voted that it must be taken down, as <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 20" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> was still in the <rs>Union</rs>.)

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>I have never understood the compatableness of Christianity with war as I see it in the present struggle for Southern independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Never have I seen or read of greater promptness on the part of Christians, of all denominations, to shoulder the musket in defence of their homes, their families, and all that makes life desirable.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>The duty is to us most grateful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>World-wide and enduring as must be the renown of our honored friend for great abilities, grandeur of character and achievements, perhaps, in proportion to appliances, never surpassed&mdash;his crowning glory was, in our view, the sublime simplicity of his <name>Christian</name> faith and life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>To the inviolable dignity of a soul among the noblest of all history was in him thoroughly united that guileless, unpretending, gentle and yet earnest spirit of a little child, so emphatically designated by our <rs type="role2">Lord</rs> as the essential characteristic of his chosen ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>These were the traits which, while they justly endeared him to children, and friends, and all the people, rendered him prompt to every, even the humblest duty, and caused him, although burdened with weighty cares, to accept the quietly useful task of presiding over so inconspicuous a good work as that of the <placeName reg="Rockbridge, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002186">Rockbridge County</placeName> <orgName n="Bible Society" type="society">Bible Society</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>Of the judicious zeal with which he undertook this service, evidence conclusive was at once given in the wisely simple yet stirring appeal, which he penned and sent forth to the several ministers and congregations of the county, urging them to renewed energy in remedying Bible destitution throughout our borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>Well may the friends of this cause mourn the loss of such a leader, and record on the tablets of their hearts an example so good, as an incentive to their own efficiency for the future!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>In connection with this testimonial of the society's loving estimate of their last president, the undersigned were instructed to cause to be published the <hi rend="italics">Appeal</hi> above referred to, written by <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0163.0002.00062.00177" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s own hand, of which copies were at the time sent to all the ministers and congregations of the county.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/></p> 
<p>My views are summed up in a few words:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>Each branch of the <orgName n="Christian Church" type="church">Christian Church</orgName> should send into the army some of its most prominent ministers who are distinguished for their piety, talents and zeal; and such ministers should labor to produce concert of action among chaplains and Christians in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>These ministers should give special attention to preaching to regiments which are without chaplains, and induce them to take steps to get chaplains, to let the regiments name the denominations from which they desire chaplains selected, and then to see that suitable chaplains are secured.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>A bad selection of a chaplain may prove a curse instead of a blessing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>If the few prominent ministers thus connected with each army would cordially co-operate, I believe that glorious fruits would be the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>Denominational distinctions should be kept out of view, and not touched upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>And, as a general rule, I do not think that a chaplain who would preach denominational sermons should be in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>His congregation is his regiment, and it is composed of various denominations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>I would like to see no question asked in the army of what denomination a chaplain belongs to; but let the question be, Does he preach the <name>Gospel</name>?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>The neglect of the spiritual interests of the army may be seen from the fact that not <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of the regiments have chaplains.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>Among the wants of the church in the army are some ministers of such acknowledged superiority and zeal as, under <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, to be the means of giving concert of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>Our chaplains, at least in the same military organization encamped in the same neighborhood, should have their meetings, and through <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> blessing devise successful plans for spiritual conquests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>All the <pb id="p.95" n="95"/> other departments of the army have system, and such system exists in any other department of the service that no <num value="1">one</num> of its officers can neglect his duty without diminishing the efficiency of his branch of the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>And it appears to me that when men see what attention is bestowed secularly in comparison with what is religiously, they naturally underestimate the importance of religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>From what I have said, you may think I am despondent; but, thanks to an ever kind <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, such is not the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>I do not know where so many men, brought together without any religious test, exhibit so much religious feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>The striking feature is that so much that is hopeful should exist, when so little human instrumentality has been employed for its accomplishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>In civil life, ministers have regular meetings to devise means for co-operation in advancing the interests of the church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>This can be done in the army, and I am persuaded it should be done. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/><q direct="unspecified">Some ministers ask for leave of absence for such trivial objects, in comparison with the salvation of the soul, that I fear they give occasion to others to think that such ministers do not believe that the salvation of the soul is as important as they preach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>It is the special province of the chaplains to look after the spiritual interests of the army, and I greatly desire to see them evincing a rational zeal proportional to the importance of their mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>Do not believe that I think the chaplains are the only delinquents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1273"/>When his wound was dressed, he playfully remarked that it would be a <quote>good furlough</quote> for awhile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1274"/>He was borne to the house of <persName n="Yerby,Mister,,,," id="n0163.0004.00115.00447" reg="mostcommon:Yerby,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Yerby</surname></persName>, in <placeName reg="Spotsylvania, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002912">Spotsylvania county</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1276"/>He spoke more of his suffering comrades than of himself, and especially expressed his sympathy and sorrow for a terribly mutilated young officer who was lying by his side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1277"/>He was removed to <placeName key="tgn,2311138" n="1.000 1" reg="edge hill, nelson, virginia">Edge Hill</placeName>, <placeName reg="caroline county, Virginia" key="tgn,1002235">Caroline county</placeName>, the residence of his brother-in-law, <persName n="Schooler,Mister,Samuel,,," id="n0163.0004.00115.00449" reg="default:Schooler,Samuel,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Samuel</foreName> <surname>Schooler</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1278"/>Soon his wound assumed a threatening and dangerous character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1279"/>Virulent erysipelas supervened, and he suffered intense agony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1280"/>By profuse discharges from his wound, and by constant, severe pain, his frame became emaciated and reduced to little more than a skeleton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1281"/>Every attention which the skill of physicians and the affectionate care and nursing of the assembled family could render could only retard, but could not overcome the steady approaches of coming death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1282"/>His friends were unwilling to believe that <num value="1">one</num> for whom they so ministered, for whose recovery they so fervently prayed, upon whose continued life so many hopes and interests were depending, must be taken from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1283"/>But the gravest fears were soon excited, and before long <persName n="Coleman,Colonel,,,," id="n0163.0004.00115.00450" reg="nearbymention:Coleman,James,D.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Coleman</surname></persName> himself began to anticipate his speedy departure from earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1284"/>He endured with marvellous patience and uncomplaining cheerfulness the most excruciating agonies of body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1285"/>His faith in the rectitude and benevolence of his covenant <name n="God" type="God">God</name> never wavered, rather steadily increased as death approached nearer and still nearer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1286"/>And now the beautiful light of his pious spirit, like the glories of a clear autumn sunset, illumed the chamber in which he was gasping away his life, and lighted up, with sweet resignation and hope, the hearts of his lamenting kindred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1287"/>In the early stages of his disease he hoped&mdash;expected to recover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1288"/>He had much for which to live, and few men could better enjoy or adorn life, or render it more useful than he. He now decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1289"/>what before he had often pondered, that, with recovered health, he would devote his life and talents to the more direct service of <pb id="p.116" n="116"/> <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in the work of the <name>Gospel</name> ministry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1293"/>In the solitary night, when a troubled sleep could be induced only by means of powerful opiates, his mind would wander fitfully over the scenes of the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1294"/>Now he would imagine himself in presence of a class of pupils teaching, and he would recite rapidly in Latin and <persName n="French,,,,," id="n0163.0004.00116.00451" reg="mostcommon:French,S.,Bassett,,:1"><surname>French</surname></persName>, and then he seemed at the head of his company in the battle and uttered the stern word of command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1295"/>Then the names of distant friends, as in cheerful and social converse, passed his lips; then the dear names of <quote>wife,</quote> <quote>mother,</quote> <quote>child,</quote> in loving murmurs proved whither his restless thoughts were turning, and always the devotional ejaculation of praise to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and of fervent prayer for grace and strength would mingle with his wildest wanderings.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1296"/>In <num value="1">one</num> of these restless hours, shortly before he died, he roused himself up and turning to his brother said: <quote><persName n="Malcolm,,,,," id="n0163.0004.00116.00452" reg="mostcommon:Malcolm,nomatch:0"><surname>Malcolm</surname></persName>, did I die as a Christian soldier ought to die?</quote> &mdash;then entirely recovering consciousness, he smiled and said: <quote>I thought I had died on the battle-field.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1297"/>For <num value="98">ninety-eight</num> weary days he endured physical agonies, relieved by only occasional respites from pain, such as probably few men have ever been called to bear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1298"/>The incurable erysipelas, the inflammation involving the whole limb, and extending by sympathy to his whole frame, the frequent incisions and probings, the drain from incessant suppuration, the inaccessible ulcers originating in his changeless position on the couch, all combined to produce excruciating pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1299"/>Yet all was borne with a patience, resignation, even cheerfulness, that has, perhaps, never been surpassed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1300"/>When convinced that there was no rational hope of his recovery, he fixed the eye of his faith steadily upon the bright home in heaven, and seeming to enter already into communion with the beloved ones who had gone before, looked beyond the interval over which he must pass, and lived as though already in the light of his Redeemer's glory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1301"/>He was more than patient; he was exultant, at times enraptured.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1302"/>Referring to the fact that he was in the neighborhood where much of his youth had been spent, he said: <quote>Here were most of <pb id="p.117" n="117"/> the sins of my early life committed, and here do I come to die, and to find them all forgiven through the mercy and love of <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1353"/>we have thus presented, for your contemplation, an imperfect survey of the life of a Christian scholar and soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1354"/>The extraordinary deeds of some world-worshipped hero or fabulous demigod might, perhaps, have better amused or entertained the multitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1355"/>But such a sketch as this cannot fail to be more useful, in so far as it is practical and imitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1356"/>Here are excellencies you may attain, a character you may emulate, a life you may copy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1357"/> <quote>If no faults shade the picture,</quote> to quote the beautiful sentiment of <persName n="Hoge,Reverend-Doctor,,,," id="n0163.0004.00119.00469" reg="nearbymention:Hoge,William,J.,,"><roleName n="Reverend-Doctor">Rev.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1358"/>It may be true that <persName n="Coleman,Colonel,,,," id="n0163.0004.00119.00470" reg="nearbymention:Coleman,James,D.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Coleman</surname></persName>'s natural mental endowments, his original physical capabilities were of a higher order <pb id="p.120" n="120"/> than <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has given to most.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1359"/>But as a practical life I have endeavored to sketch <num value="1">one</num> that is plainly imitable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1360"/>Perhaps the most prominent characteristic of his moral nature was his conscientiousness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1361"/>In little matters, as in those more important, he was accustomed to ask, and to act upon the answer, what is duty?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1362"/> <quote>His conceptions of duty,</quote> says <persName n="Venable,Major,,,," id="n0163.0004.00120.00471" reg="mostcommon:Venable,Charles,S.,,:1"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Venable</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of his earliest and latest friends, <quote>were as true and direct as his performance of it was thorough and exact.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1363"/>This is imitable by all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1364"/>Persevering industry, including earnest attention to little things, was another marked feature of <persName n="Coleman,,Lewis,,," id="n0163.0004.00120.00472" reg="default:Coleman,Lewis,,,"><foreName>Lewis</foreName> <surname>Coleman</surname></persName>'s life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1365"/>In his studies, earlier and later, in all the practical routine of daily requirements, in the study and lecture-room, on the farm and in the camp, whatever service devolved upon him was promptly performed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1366"/>He seldom had arrearages of business to bring up. He pushed his work steadily before him, rarely needing to drag it along after its appropriate hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1367"/>Such an example may be wisely copied.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1368"/>He was uniformly cheerful and social.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1369"/>He always had a pleasant word for all he met, even for servants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1370"/>His lively wit, without a shade of malice or ill-nature; his honest ringing laugh, the wonderful sprightliness, felicity and tact of his ordinary conversation, drawing as from a perennial spring sparkling rills of facts, fancies and illustrations, made him a most genial and instructive companion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1371"/>He evinced in all his life the most unselfish benevolence of spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1372"/>He sought to promote the happiness of others rather than his own. He lived for others rather than for himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1373"/>No friend ever asked him for a favor who did not meet a cheerful and ready response, if the bestowment was within the compass of his means and the approval of his conscience.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1374"/>And for the happiness and welfare of the loved ones of his own family circle, no sacrifice was deemed too severe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1375"/>There seemed only <num value="1">one</num> earthly love that could surpass that of mother, father, <rs type="role" n="Brother">brothers</rs>, sisters, wife and children for him, and that was his love for them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/>And this trait of heart, too, is imitable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1377"/>Throwing its soft light over all these excellencies was his beautiful humility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1378"/>He rarely made himself, or anything that he did, the theme of conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1379"/><quote>He was a man of few professions,</quote> <pb id="p.121" n="121"/> says <persName n="Venable,Major,,,," id="n0163.0004.00121.00473" reg="mostcommon:Venable,Charles,S.,,:1"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Venable</surname></persName>, <quote>and his Christianity found more expression in action than words; yet it was not difficult to read the clear simplicity of his life and character.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1380"/>He never seemed himself aware that there was anything especially meritorious or unusual in his sweet, genial, benevolent life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1381"/>He never seemed conscious, even upon his death-bed, that he had made any notable sacrifice in resigning his elevated position at the university for his humble position in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1382"/>He often spoke in desponding tones of the little he had accomplished as a student and a Christian, and ever longed and struggled for higher attainments and higher usefulness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1383"/>Is not this temper worthy of imitation?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1384"/>The supreme, fostering, originating principle of all these excellencies of life and heart was his piety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1385"/>Early he learned that <quote>beginning of wisdom&mdash;the fear of the <rs>Lord</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1386"/>His piety was not the mere coloring that ornamented life; it entered into the warp and woof of his inner nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1387"/>He loved <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and lived in daily communion with the <name>Redeemer</name>, and thus became <quote>a living epistle of <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n0163.0004.00121.00474" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName>, known and read of all men.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/><hi rend="italics">Dear Sir</hi>: I have endeavored to procure all the particulars of your brother's fall, but have only partially succeeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1752"/>Many saw him just previous to his death, and several very soon afterward, but I can find no <num value="1">one</num> who saw him in the interval between the time when he was struck and when he expired, if there was any.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1754"/>But although, on account of the confusion, his death was unobserved, his presence was soon missed and a member of his company, fearing he had been injured, proceeded to look for him, and soon found his body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1755"/>He was lying on his face, resting it in his hands, and his pistol and his unsheathed sword lay by his side.</p>

His efforts to secure the salvation of his company were unceasing, and to compass this end he was much in prayer, and abounded in good works.

He is said to be an admirable officer, having taken charge of a brigade which had been in very bad condition, and made it <num value="1">one</num> of the finest in the army, and having gained, by his skilful and gallant leadership in the field, the entire confidence and warm affection of his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/>He struck me at once by his pleasing address, and his cordial greeting to a Christian brother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1807"/>He would listen, with a glowing countenance and not without tears, to the more affecting truths of the <name>Gospel</name>, and in all our intercourse seemed to me an unusually zealous, devout and humble <persName n="Christian,,,,," id="n0163.0004.00145.00569" reg="mostcommon:Christian,nomatch:0"><surname>Christian</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1808"/>I hear that he is always ready to pray and exhort in the prayermeetings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1809"/>His conversation showed an absorbing anxiety for the spiritual welfare of his men. And in mentioning incidentally an occasion on which he had tried to gather them into a special meeting for prayer, and the good results, he spoke with humble gratitude of the joy with which he found it possible to exert a marked religious influence over his officers and men. <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> <name n="God" type="God">God</name> bless him in all his efforts to do good.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1810"/>Every civilian who goes into the army will be struck with the wonderful influence possessed by the officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1811"/>Everything is arranged so as to give them authority and secure them respect&mdash;a thing necessary to the efficiency and the very existence of an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>And you very soon feel the effect upon <pb id="p.146" n="146"/> yourself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1813"/>You did not care any more for officers than privates&mdash; not you. But stay in camp awhile, and you catch the feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1814"/>You will go with a friend who is introducing you&mdash;will perhaps see a rather indifferent-looking youngster, eating his dinner, and care very little for him; but when he looks up and you see <num value="3">three</num> stars on his collar, and your friend says, <quote><rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>&mdash;&mdash;,</quote> you take off your hat.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1815"/>And let any officer, from the highest to the lowest, be a decidedly religious or a decidedly irreligious man, and the influence diffuses itself throughout his entire command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1816"/>These men sought distinction, and delight in authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1817"/>Alas! many of them little think of the weighty responsibilities which always pertain to any position of influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1818"/>They cannot divest themselves of this responsibility, not merely to the nation for the military efficiency of their command, but to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for the religious influence exerted upon these their fellow-men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1819"/>Of course, no <num value="1">one</num> wants them to do anything officially to constrain the men into anything like religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>But their example, and their ways of talking, produce an effect that is positively astonishing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1821"/>Have you a friend who is an officer?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/>Urge him not to neglect the solemn responsibility of his position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>If he is a Christian, let him try to be such a specimen of the <rs>Christian</rs> officer as the general above described, and he may do incalculable good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1930"/>They went out from all the churches, and labored together in a spirit worthy of the purest days of our holy religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1931"/>The aim of them all was to turn the thoughts of the soldiers not to a sect, but to <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0163.0005.00156.00614" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, to bring them into the great spiritual temple, and to show them the wonders of salvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2015"/>That cause rises far above all secular objects; for it involves within it our religion in its purity and in its successful dissemination throughout our whole Southern country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2016"/>The enemy has not only invaded our homes, but has desecrated our churches and stifled the voice of prayer in the temples of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and seized His ministers clinging to the very horns of the altar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2017"/>Freedom to worship <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has ceased wherever the legions of the foe have advanced; and the conscience of an outraged people, forbidden to utter its voice in public devotion, can only breathe its prayers for the rescue of our land from the enemies of our country and the despisers of our religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2018"/>But shall the defenders of a free faith and of our hearthstones be without the word of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the means of personal salvation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2019"/>The scheme of colportage answers the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2020"/>By it religion noiselessly walks through the camp, sowing the precious seed among the soldiers of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2021"/>It enters the hospitals and speaks peace to the sick and the dying, and lifts the broken and wounded spirit to the hope <pb id="p.164" n="164"/> which anchors the soul in the haven of eternal rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2022"/>What may we not hope to accomplish in filling the ranks of our host with the true soldiers of the <rs>Lord</rs> of battles?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2023"/>Shall we not rob war of much of its horror, when <num value="1000">thousands</num> of men, loyal to their country, but in disloyal opposition to the <rs>King</rs> of kings, shall be brought to acknowledge the sceptre of His power and yield obedience to His law?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2024"/>The word of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>&mdash;the tract which conveys little by little portions of that word to the mind of the soldier on duty; the book, or paper or pamphlet, which leads him to the fountain of all truth&mdash;these are the means you use to make the citizen-in-arms a better, because a Christian patriot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2025"/>The labors of the colporter, however humble and simple, thus become the instruments of the largest benefit to the army, to the country and to the kingdom of the <name>Redeemer</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2026"/>To the sick, the wounded and the dying, stilling the noise and tumult of the battle with the gentle whispers of a Saviour's love, his presence is an incalculable blessing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2027"/>The fruits of his toil are presented in a rich harvest already perceptible all through our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2028"/>Let him go on in the discharge of his duty; let men everywhere sustain him by counsel and contribution, and we will see the work crowned with temporal benefits, which can scarcely be estimated, and with eternal blessings, which shall be full of glory.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2032"/>Last Sabbath evening, at the <orgName n="Baptist Church 1" type="church">First Baptist Church</orgName> of this city, an unusually enthusiastic meeting was held, in behalf of army colportage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2033"/>Every seat was occupied, while many went away unable to find admission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2036"/>He had found the inmates of our hospitals eager to receive instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2037"/>Sometimes they had professed to be greatly benefited by the tracts, and often sent for him to come again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2038"/>An invalid remarked to him, that prior to his entering the army he had enjoyed religion, and had been a member of the <orgName n="Presbyterian Church" type="church">Presbyterian Church</orgName>; but, surrounded by the vices of the camp, he had become a backslider and lost all religious enjoyment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2039"/>After frequent conversations he became much interested in his soul's salvation, sent for the colporter again and again, and before his death expressed himself perfectly resigned to the will of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2040"/>Other facts and incidents of much interest were narrated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2041"/>He was followed by <persName n="Tucker,,John,Randolph,," id="n0163.0005.00165.00644" reg="default:Tucker,John,Randolph,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>Randolph</foreName> <surname>Tucker</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, in a speech of great power and eloquence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2043"/>We are passing through the most momentous era in the history of this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2044"/>The year <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> was filled with victories and covered Southern arms with imperishable glory; but from the beginning of this year we have met with nothing but disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2045"/>Every message brought over the telegraph but tells of some new defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2046"/>Why is this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2047"/>Up to the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs> our whole people were prostrate before <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2048"/>The speaker had met with many on the street with prayer trembling on their lips, while tears of penitence filled their eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2049"/>Now, those men have upon their lips blasphemous oaths, and their eyes are never turned to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for His blessing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2050"/>After the great victory of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> we ceased to realize our dependence on heaven; and nothing was more common than to hear such expressions as, <quote>We can whip the <rs>Yankees</rs> any way.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2051"/>Greed and avarice have taken possession of the hearts of many, while in every portion of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> distilleries have been springing up, until now the whole land groans under the liquid poison which is sweeping so many of our soldiers into the grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2052"/>Our streets are blocked up with men made drunk by the distilleries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2053"/>How dare we expect the blessing of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> when such things are tolerated?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2054"/>It is the decree of heaven that <quote>righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach <pb id="p.166" n="166"/> to any people.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2055"/>It is vain to speak of the justice of our cause, unless we seek upon that cause the blessing of heaven, and use the instrumentality which <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> places in our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2056"/>The speaker believed that piety will make a man a truer patriot and a braver soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2057"/>It assures him that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is his friend; that <quote>all things work together for his good,</quote> and that when he falls into the icy grasp of death, his soul will rise up to the unfading bliss of heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2058"/>It is not necessary to refer to <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0163.0005.00166.00646" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>, <persName n="Havelock,,,,," id="n0163.0005.00166.00647" reg="mostcommon:Havelock,nomatch:0"><surname>Havelock</surname></persName> and other pious generals, to illustrate this great principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2059"/>We have illustrations in every division of our own army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2060"/>Where can we look for a braver soldier than <persName n="Jackson,,Stonewall,,," id="n0163.0005.00166.00648" reg="default:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><foreName>Stonewall</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>; and yet never had the speaker known a more humble and earnest Christian than this noble man. What will become of these hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of soldiers when they return?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2061"/>If religious influences are not now brought to bear upon them, we may expect at the close of this war to have the country overrun with the most desperate, lawless men ever known in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2062"/>In view of all these considerations, the speaker argued that this work has the most weighty claims upon all classes of the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2067"/>From experience in command, he was prepared to commend this work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2068"/>There is no better way to insure success in this great struggle than by surrounding our men with religious influences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2069"/>It is difficult to get the soldier to attend regular preaching, but he will read a tract, and in the tedium of camp-life nothing is more acceptable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2730"/>Besides, I have been deterred, observing the tendency to put these subjects in a rose-colored light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2731"/>But, on the other hand, it is but proper for me to contribute my mite of experience, as I have certainly derived benefit from the letters of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2732"/>For instance, I had not made any attempt to stop the card-playing among the convalescents until I read what a brother chaplain had done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2733"/>His success emboldened me. So, <num value="1">one</num> day, approaching a group who were busily <quote>throwing the spotted leaf,</quote> but who desisted when they saw me, I did not content myself with proposing to give them some of my cards, but urged them to give up theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2734"/><quote>We mean no harm, sir,</quote> said a bright youth&mdash; <quote> we do not play for money, only for pastime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2735"/>It is dull here.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2736"/><quote>Yes,</quote> I replied, <quote>it must be dull, and I do not wonder you wish some recreation; but then you have books and papers in abundance, and I would not resort to cards.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2737"/><quote>I do not think it is wrong, sir.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2738"/><quote>The mere act of throwing cards may not be, but it is connected closely with gambling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2739"/>Besides, it does seem an inappropriate employment in a room filled with sick and dying men, and for those who have just been raised up from death's door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2740"/>But I will give you a simple argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2741"/>Have you a mother?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2742"/><quote>I have.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2743"/><quote>Do you think she would be willing for you to play cards, even for fun?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2744"/></quote> <quote>I know she would not.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2745"/><quote>Well, at what age is a man justifiable in violating his mother's wishes?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2746"/>The cards were thrown aside&mdash;I hope, permanently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2747"/>The group scattered, and the youth who had been the principal speaker followed me, and sat by my side while I read and prayed with a dying <name>Christian</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2748"/>Possibly this piece may strike the eye of some card-playing soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2749"/>To such an <num value="1">one</num>, I put the question, <quote>Would your mother approve of it?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2750"/>Encouraged by this success, I made a similar attempt in <num value="1">one</num> other hospital, with like results; and subsequently coming into the same room, I asked an elderly, <num value="1">one</num>-legged soldier what had become of the cards?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2751"/>He replied, <quote>I have not seen them since you talked to the boys the other day.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2752"/>I feel the more free to speak against cards because we have large and well-selected libraries of both religious and secular volumes, and because I am constantly distributing papers in abundance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2753"/>I have also lately queried within myself whether we ought not to supply our convalescent soldiers with other innocent means of recreation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2754"/>There are <num value="1000">thousands</num> in our hospitals, not able to go to camp, who are <pb id="p.208" n="208"/> well enough to find confinement very wearisome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2755"/>Some of them are readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2756"/>Those who are can't read all the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2757"/>I have thought of instituting clubs&mdash;of introducing a draught-board, grace-hoops, etc. To some, this would seem very queer work for a chaplain; but I am sure these things would help to make the hospital a pleasant home, and I know that in a late convalescence, on the rainy days, I did not despise such ministrations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2758"/>Tell me if you think I am wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2759"/>This is certain, that I find frequent religious meetings very acceptable to the men&mdash;acceptable, if for no other reason, because such services break in upon the monotony of their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2760"/>I have lately, in connection with <persName><roleName n="Brother">Brother</roleName> <foreName>Walton</foreName></persName>, held several extra meetings, and I never in my life saw more earnest attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2761"/>These meetings are held in a large room, partly filled with patients.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2762"/>To them especially are the services acceptable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2764"/>the reply is, <quote> If it did, I would wish to have it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2765"/>Very solemn is a meeting in such a place, where the preaching is sometimes not interrupted, so much as rendered more impressive, by the cough or hollow groan of a sufferer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2766"/>I think if the minister who was so severe on colporters and chaplains, could have seen the convalescents gathering, the cripples hobbling in, <num value="1">one</num> dear little <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> boy, who lost both legs at <placeName reg="Sharpsburg, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7014501">Sharpsburg</placeName>, brought in and placed in the broad window-sill on cushions &mdash;could have seen how happy some Christians looked, and how solemn some sinners appeared, he would have altered his mind and concluded, perhaps we were doing some good after all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3051"/>I was sent once to stop the firing of <num value="1">one</num> of our own batteries, which was, by mistake, firing into our own men; and I shall never forget the eagerness with which I put spurs to my horse and galloped across the field, crying at the top of my voice, as I waved a white handkerchief: <q direct="unspecified">Cease firing!

<text><body> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3069"/>The men generally want chaplains, and appreciate them, even if only moderately good and faithful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3070"/>I believe this is largely true of officers, too, though there are some notable exceptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3071"/>A certain brigadier said chaplains were <quote>the scourge of the army.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3072"/>Some colonels have objected that even faithful ministers, by awakening men's fears of retribution, have unfitted them for battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3073"/>And it is quite notorious that some field-officers object to chaplains, who might be a restraint on their drinking and profanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3074"/>But, after all, I believe most officers desire chaplains, and wish them to be good, earnest men. Certainly my observation and pleasant experience has been, that from officers, high and low, chaplains receive generally the most courteous and even kind treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3075"/>In short, I believe that a minister in the army, as elsewhere, will find his true status, and in proportion to his soberness, purity and zeal, be loved and respected by those who receive his ministrations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3076"/>Let none suppose that a chaplain's post is a <hi rend="italics">sinecure</hi>. True, he may shirk his duties and not be court-martialed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3077"/>True, he has some facilities for locomotion and <quote>foraging,</quote> not enjoyed by either officers or men. In fact, I believe his place is the most pleasant as well as the highest in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3078"/>Specially may he, with brother chaplains, with Christians of all Churches, and with cultivated men in the ranks or in office, enjoy <name>Christian</name> intercourse, often more extensive and unreserved than could be in an ordinary pastorate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3079"/>But, after all, as I said, his post is no sinecure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3080"/>If he sticks to the men as he ought, he must learn to say, <quote>'Tis home where'er my <rs n="oil cloth" type="product">oil-cloth</rs> is,</quote> and may often be seen at dewy eve, selecting a clean place or smooth rail for his bivouac.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3081"/>He, too, must learn to eat once a day, to live on crackers, and may often be seen broiling his fat bacon on the coals, or making rye coffee in a tin-cup.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3082"/>Above all, he must <pb id="p.228" n="228"/> forego domestic joys, and even when a furlough is practicable, forbear to use it, that he may stay at his post and labor for his men. I do not believe public sentiment in the army requires chaplains to <quote>take the sword.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3083"/>In a battle, the chaplain's place is with his ambulance, and then at the hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3084"/>But to be thus just in the rear is often to encounter the hottest fire of cannonballs and shells.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3085"/>The material of his congregation is the best, and his preaching is constantly backed by most solemn providences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3086"/>Then, as a general thing, except on forced marches, he may preach almost whenever he pleases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3101"/>In conclusion, I think, among the many evils of war, we should not forget such a benefit as this, that it corrects the growing tendency to effeminacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3102"/>How desirable, if many of our young preachers in this school shall learn to <quote>endure hardness.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3108"/>In private letters to brethren I have said, <q direct="unspecified">Send us the names of <hi rend="italics">good men;</hi></q> and I here repeat, we want <hi rend="italics">none others&mdash;</hi>our object being not merely to fill up the regiments with nominal chaplains, but to fill the vacancies with <hi rend="italics">efficient, working</hi> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3109"/>It is a common mistake that <hi rend="italics">anybody</hi> will do to preach to soldiers; and hence the chaplaincies are generally filled by young and inexperienced men. But a moment's reflection will suffice to convince, that since we have in the army the flower of the country, so we ought to have the best preachingtalent of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3110"/>I call upon our city and country pastors earnestly to consider whether it is not their duty to enter this wide field of usefulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3111"/>It is a field worthy the attention of our most experienced, most useful ministers, and if they cannot get their consent to enter regularly upon it, I call upon them to at least give us occasional visits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3112"/>We want men who will <hi rend="italics">stick to their posts</hi>. I am persuaded that a great deal of harm has been done by chaplains resigning, or absenting themselves for long periods from their commands, on <q direct="unspecified">detail to collect clothing,</q> or some such pretext.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3113"/>The great business of the chaplain is to <hi rend="italics">preach <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0163.0007.00229.00904" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName></hi> publicly, and from tent to tent, and the temporal welfare of the soldiers should be made subordinate to this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3114"/>We want men <hi rend="italics">physically able as well as willing to endure hardships and privations</hi>. If a chaplain would live up to the full measure of his usefulness, he must be with his regiment on the weary <pb id="p.230" n="230"/> march (frequently resigning his horse to some foot-sore soldier), lie with them around the bivouac-fire after evening prayers are over; be drenched on the outposts, or face the pelting snowstorm; divide with some hungry soldier his last hard cracker, and, in a word, share with his regiment whatever hardships they may be called on to endure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3115"/>Now, if a brother is physically unable to endure these hardships, he had best not enter the work, but there is no question that many a delicate brother would have his health permanently improved, if he would thus learn to <q direct="unspecified">endure hardness as a good soldier.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3116"/></p> 
<p>I trust that brethren in sending testimonials will remember these points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3117"/>And if the committee should feel called on to decline recommending any <num value="1">one</num>, of course they will not be understood as deciding who shall be denied chaplaincies, but simply <hi rend="italics">their own unwillingness to act in the matter</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3123"/>There are several entire brigades without a single chaplain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3124"/>This destitution was made a special topic of discussion, and it was resolved that we will make every effort to get chaplains for all of the regiments; and in the meantime, that we will each preach as often as we can to those that are destitute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3128"/><q direct="unspecified">The harvest is plenteous, and the laborers are few.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3129"/>I suppose that in the other <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> there is greater destitution than in ours.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3130"/>Another point discussed was the <hi rend="italics">general efficiency</hi> of chaplains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3131"/><num value="1">One</num> brother was disposed to coincide with the very harsh opinions that have been expressed so frequently concerning chaplains; but the general expression of opinion was, that while we all have to mourn that we have come far short of our duty, and there are some sad examples of inefficiency, <hi rend="italics">as a class</hi> army chaplains are as attentive to their duties and as efficient as the same number of pastors at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3132"/>In my own personal observation, during the <hi rend="italics"><measure n="22months" type="date">twenty-two months</measure></hi> I have been in the army, I have met with several chaplains who shamefully desert their posts on the slightest pretexts; but, <hi rend="italics">as a general rule</hi>, I have found them faithfully discharging their duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3133"/>Let the chaplain who is nearly always absent from his post, and shirks duty when there, be held up <hi rend="italics">by name</hi> to public censure, but let not the man who is constantly at the post of duty be made to share <hi rend="italics">his</hi> shame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3141"/>The object of special interest to all is the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3142"/>The political and social interests involved excite the patriotism, and move the affection of all. There is little necessity for exhortation to love of country, or love to our sons and brothers, who are fighting and falling in our defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3143"/>These emotions, strong in the beginning, have become more intense from the heroic fortitude of our noble army, and from the wicked designs and infamous conduct of our enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3144"/>The history of the past <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> of the war has amazingly developed and magnified the issues, and strengthened and deepened the convictions under which the conflict began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3145"/>Base, beyond all conception, must that heart be which does not swell with patriotic devotion to our dear and suffering country, which is not stirred with deep and righteous indignation against our cruel and guilty foes, and which is not melted with profound and tender sympathy for the privations of our soldiers and the afflictions of our oppressed fellow-citizens in the invaded districts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3146"/>While these emotions may exist in some adequate measure, is the religious interest commensurate with the demand of the times?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3157"/>In an important sense, the <pb id="p.233" n="233"/> cause of the country is the cause of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3159"/>In a sense equally as true, and even more important, is the fact, that the <rs type="place">Church</rs>, to the full extent of its ability and opportunity, is responsible for the souls of those who fall in this conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3160"/>Has she realized this solemn responsibility?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3161"/>Has she discharged her sacred duty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3162"/>With the opportunities which we have for estimating the work to be done, and of observing what has been accomplished, we are constrained to say that she has not. Surely her whole duty has not been done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3163"/>We tremble when we contemplate the results which may follow from such delinquency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3164"/>To estimate correctly the work which the <rs type="place">Church</rs> is called to perform, we must consider the vast number of our citizens who now compose the armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3165"/>All the men of the country, below the age of <num value="40">forty</num>, are in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3166"/>To these must be added many manly boys below, and many patriotic men above the prescribed ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3178"/>We know that your hearts are as truly <pb id="p.234" n="234"/> and deeply enlisted in the cause of the country as ours; and we are also aware of the fact that a large number of chaplains are stationed at posts and laboring faithfully in hospitals, and many ministers of the <name>Gospel</name> are serving as officers and as privates in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3179"/>But how great is the destitution in the field?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3180"/>And how many of our soldiers are perishing without the bread of life?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3181"/>There are no great difficulties in the way of obtaining an appointment for any suitable minister in any denomination of Christians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3182"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> has opened a wide and effectual door of access to the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3183"/>In the work itself there are no difficulties which zeal and faith cannot readily overcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3184"/>The chief obstructions are those which exist everywhere in the conflict between sin and holiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3185"/>There are no vices or prejudices peculiar to the army which are any greater hindrances to the work of grace than those which are to be encountered in the cities and throughout the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3186"/>Our work is a hard work, and there are privations which must be endured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3187"/>The fare of the chaplain is that of the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3188"/>The exposures and discomforts to be encountered are in striking contrast with the previous lives of most ministers of the <name>Gospel</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3189"/>The health of some has failed in the service, and some, indeed, have laid down their lives for their brethren, but to many the change of habits has been beneficial, and the feeble have come to endure hardness as good soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3190"/>The chaplain, however faithful, will at times be discouraged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3191"/>Men will seem to take little interest in his preaching; profanity, card-playing, and Sabbath-breaking will be on the increase; his presence often will be no restraint upon vice, and when he has faithfully discharged his duty he may meet with censure and ridicule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3192"/>In camp-life there is an indolence of mind produced, and an aversion to serious thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3193"/>There is also a disposition to seek entertainment in all manner of foolish talking and jesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3194"/>On the march, and on an active campaign, the attention is much absorbed, and time is often wanting for religious duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3195"/>The carelessness and open apostasy of professors of religion are here&mdash;as well as everywhere else&mdash;a great hindrance to the success of the <name>Gospel</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3196"/>The readiness with which chaplains have resigned their places, or absented themselves from their regiments, is a source of discouragement to the soldiers and to their brethren who remain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3197"/>In the hasty opinions and sweeping judgments of many, in and out of the army, the deficiencies of some have been unjustly attributed <pb id="p.235" n="235"/> to others, and the failure of a few regarded as the failure of all. But these, you perceive, brethren, are essentially the same difficulties, in a different form, which the minister of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> must encounter everywhere in this sinful world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3198"/>Our chief ground of discouragement, however, is in ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3199"/>With more faith in <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and more love for the souls of men, with more of the spirit of our blessed <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, we should behold greater and more precious results.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3200"/>If there are discouragements peculiar to our work, there are peculiar encouragements also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3201"/>We believe that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is with us, not only to own and bless His word to the salvation of men, but that His blessing rests upon our cause and attends our armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3202"/>It is a high privilege and great satisfaction to preach to soldiers to whom <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has given such signal victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3203"/>The moral influence of a just and righteous cause is a happy introduction to, and a good preparation for the holier cause of religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3204"/>The objects for which our soldiers are fighting possess incalculable power in controlling the naturally demoralizing influence of war. We are thankful to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for the large number of <name>Christian</name> officers who command our armies and aid us in our work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3205"/>The presence of so many pious men in the ranks gives us a Church in almost every regiment to begin with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3206"/>The intercourse and communion of <name>Christian</name> brethren in the army is as intimate and precious as anywhere upon earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3207"/>It is an interesting fact, that by this work ministers of the different denominations are brought into closer and more harmonious co-operation, thus promoting the unity and charity of the whole Church, and greatly encouraging each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3208"/>Many of the greatest temptations to vice are excluded from the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3209"/>There is much time for profitable reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3210"/>The near approach of death excites to serious thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3211"/>Religious reading is sought and appreciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3212"/>Many opportunities for personal kindness to the sick and the wounded, on the battle-field and in the camp, bind grateful hearts to faithful chaplains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3213"/>In preaching the word, conducting prayer-meetings and Bible-classes, by circulating the <name>Scriptures</name> and other religious reading, and by frequent conversations in private, we have ample opportunity for doing our <rs type="role2">Master</rs>'s work and laboring for immortal souls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3214"/>Our greatest encouragement, however, has been from the presence and power of the <rs>Holy Spirit</rs> among us. He who has led our armies to victory, conducting them like the hosts of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName> with the pillar of cloud and of fire by night <pb id="p.236" n="236"/> and by day, has also encamped round about us, and the tabernacle of the <rs>Lord</rs> has been in the midst of our tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3215"/>We believe there have been more powerful and blessed revivals of religion <hi rend="italics">in</hi> the army than <hi rend="italics">out</hi> of it during the last <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>. We know of a large Church in which almost all the additions for more than a year have been of young men visiting their homes on furloughs from the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3216"/>At this very time a most interesting and extensive work of grace is in progress amongst the troops stationed in and around the desolated city of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3217"/>The evidences of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> love and mercy are thus brought into immediate and striking contrast with the marks of the cruelty and barbarity of men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3218"/>Brethren, do not these movements of the <rs>Holy Ghost</rs> indicate where <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> ministers should follow, and in what work they should engage?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3219"/>Our work, though hard, is a pleasant work, and we feel it to be a precious and glorious work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3220"/>Much more has been accomplished than has been made known abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3221"/>Comparatively few publications have been sent out by the chaplains, but many earnest and faithful sermons have been preached, many copies of the <rs>Holy Scriptures</rs> have been put into the hands of the soldiers by chaplains and colporters, and much printed matter in the form of religious newspapers and tracts has been circulated and eagerly read; precious communions have been held, and souls have been added to the <orgName n="Christ Church" type="church">Church of Christ</orgName>, of such as, we believe, shall be saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3222"/>Eternity alone can disclose the extent of the blessed work which faithful chaplains have accomplished in our armies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3223"/>We have told you these things, brethren, that your interest might be increased in this cause, and in ourselves as identified with the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3224"/>If we have only mentioned what was before familiar to you, we desire to stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3225"/>We would respectfully, and in <name>Christian</name> love, submit the following suggestions for your consideration, earnestly beseeching your co-operation, your sympathy and your prayers:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3226"/>Let the <rs type="place">Church</rs> humble herself before her <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>&mdash;let all Christians, of every name in our land, engage in acts of humiliation and of prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3227"/>The frequent calls of our excellent and pious <rs type="role2">President</rs> to this duty have been attended by evident tokens of the <name>Divine</name> favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3228"/>May the observance of the appointed day, which is now at hand, be followed by the signal blessing of Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and the solemn day be kept holy unto the <rs>Lord</rs> <pb id="p.237" n="237"/> by the army and by all the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3229"/>I fever a nation was called to prostrate itself at the foot of the <name>Cross</name>, and to suplicate the mercy of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> with strong crying and tears, it is this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3230"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name>, we believe, will deliver us from our enemies, but that deliverance must come in answer to prayer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3231"/>In order that our prayers may be heard, and our solemn days be not an abomination unto the <rs>Lord</rs>, we must put away sin from among us. There are sins, both of a national and individual character, which are rapidly engendered in a time like this&mdash; a spirit of recklessness and profanity&mdash;a disregard of the laws of life and of property&mdash;too great a reliance upon an arm of flesh&mdash; and it may be, under peculiar aggravations, a sinful feeling of malignant and bloodthirsty revenge has been indulged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3232"/>But, more than all, a spirit of unhallowed greed, of unrighteous extortion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3233"/>Ill-gotten gains will prove a curse to the individual, and injurious to the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3234"/>It is no time for amassing wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3235"/>Can the true patriot, can the true <rs>Christian</rs> grow rich in the hour of his country's peril?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3236"/>If in any proper and legitimate manner, without injury to others, money is accumulated, give it to your country, give it to the poor, give it to the suffering families of the soldiers, send a chaplain to the army, and assist in the support of his family while he is engaged in the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3237"/>Let the <orgName n="Jesus Christ Church" type="church">Church of Jesus Christ</orgName> clear herself of this sin, and let not the hidden wedge and the <name>Babylonish</name> garment be found in her tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3238"/>By precept and example let the <rs type="place">Church</rs> seek to foster a generous and self-sacrificing spirit among all classes of the people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3239"/>Brethren, send us more chaplains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3240"/>The harvest truly is great, the laborers are few. We send abroad to the <rs type="place">Churches</rs> the <rs>Macedonian</rs> cry, Come and help us. The work is an earnest, a pressing work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3241"/>Now is emphatically the accepted time for the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3242"/>The cause will not brook delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3243"/>A series of battles, which may speedily follow the opening of the campaign, will sweep away <num value="1000">thousands</num> of our brave comrades and friends&mdash; <num value="1000">thousands</num> of your own sons and brothers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3244"/>Then come while it is called to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3245"/>Come up to the help of the <rs>Lord</rs>, to the help of the <rs>Lord</rs> against the mighty, and escape the curse of <placeName reg="Meroz">Meroz</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3246"/>We especially appeal to the <rs type="place">Churches</rs> in their organized capacity, and ask of conventions, conferences, presbyteries and associations, to set apart men of the best talent and largest experience unto this work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3247"/>Such a call, coming with the potential <pb id="p.238" n="238"/> authority of a <orgName n="God Church" type="church">Church of God</orgName>, would doubtless decide many of the ablest ministers in the country to cast in their lots with us. We cordially and earnestly invite the venerable fathers of the church to visit the army and preach for a few days or weeks in the regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3248"/>Such voluntary labors, in many instances, have been signally blessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3249"/>The <rs type="place">Churches</rs> should be willing to spare their pastors for this work, and seek temporary supplies from neighboring ministers; or, at least, all congregations might allow their ministers to visit the army for a time and labor for those who have gone forth in their defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3250"/>Have not the soldiers, who are away from their homes and Churches, the right to claim a part of the time of their own pastors?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3251"/>But especially do we call upon the younger men in the ministry&mdash;and we call upon you, young men, because you are strong&mdash;come, take part in this sacred cause and this holy fellowship with us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3252"/>If the ministers of the <name>Gospel</name>, below the age of <num value="40">forty</num>, are exempted from ordinary military duty, are they not bound to serve their country and the army in the capacity of chaplains?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3253"/>Have you a right to stay away while this destitution exists?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3254"/>We urge no extreme or fanatical view; let all the regiments be supplied, and still the vast majority of ministers will remain at home with their congregations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3255"/>We plead only for that which is just and equal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3256"/>And we feel that we but do this when we maintain that congregations should assist in the support of the families of chaplains while laboring in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3257"/>Such an arrangement would give hundreds of excellent men to the work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3258"/>Brethren, pray for us. To know that we are constantly remembered at a throne of grace&mdash;in the <rs type="place">Churches</rs> and in the families&mdash;in the public and in the private devotions of the people of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>&mdash;will greatly encourage our hearts and strengthen our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3259"/>Prayer should be made without ceasing to the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and Father of our <rs type="role2">Lord</rs> and Saviour <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n0163.0007.00238.00916" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName> in behalf of our cause, our country, our officers and our soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3260"/>Pray for us, that we may be faithful, and that our labors may be blessed in the conversion of souls.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3261"/>We ask these things of you, dear brethren, because we believe that the final success of our arms is intimately connected with the fidelity of the <rs type="place">Church</rs> in fulfilling its duty to the army, and closely related to the religious character of the army itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3262"/>It was remarked by <num value="1">one</num> of our distinguished and <name>Christian</name> generals, that <q direct="unspecified">the only ground of apprehension to be felt is from the <pb id="p.239" n="239"/> want of piety in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3263"/>Were all the soldiers sincere Christians and praying men, in a cause like ours, they would be invincible.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3264"/>In such an army there would be <num value="2">two</num> distinct sources of success in addition to the ordinary elements of military power &mdash;the loftier courage derived from <name>Christian</name> faith, and the direct blessing of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in answer to prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3265"/>If the want of faithfulness on the part of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>, the impiety of the army and the people, should prevent <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> blessing, then the unfaithfulness of the <rs type="place">Church</rs> will have blasted our hopes, destroyed our country, and left a continent in ruins.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3266"/>There should be no separation made between the army and the country, between the soldier and the citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3267"/>The army is composed of the people, and the soldiers are citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3268"/>At this very time the soldiers in the field are the only electors of representatives for many of the congressional and legislative districts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3269"/>Those who achieve our independence are the same who must maintain it. The sole governors of the country, for <num value="1">one</num> generation at least, will be the survivors of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3270"/>Those who win the battles, must make, administer, enforce and obey the laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3271"/>If these be depraved and godless through the neglect of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>, and their want of moral integrity and elevation destroy the government, and bring upon the land the curse of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, then in vain the mighty sacrifice of treasure and of blood &mdash;in vain the army of our martyred dead&mdash;in vain the sacred gift bequeathed from bleeding sires to sons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3272"/>Better never to have fought and won the victory, than afterwards to forfeit it and lose the blessing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3273"/>This may be the last struggle for constitutional liberty which will be made on this continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3274"/>The progress of the race, the happiness of <num value="1000000">millions</num>, are involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3275"/>A grand responsibility rests upon our young republic, and a mighty work lies before it. Baptized in its infancy in blood, may it receive the baptism of the <rs>Holy Ghost</rs>, and be consecrated to its high and holy mission among the nations of the earth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3276"/>This, we fondly hope, will be the last year of this bloody war. But of that no <num value="1">one</num> can certainly know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3277"/>How ardently is a permanent and honorable peace desired!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3278"/>For this object united prayers should go up continually to the throne of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> by night and by day. Weeping between the porch and the altar, <orgName type="college" n="Zion college">Zion</orgName> should lift up her voice without ceasing unto her Saviour and her <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3279"/>This war must be regarded by all <name>Christian</name> men as a chastisement from the hand of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> on account of our sins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3280"/><pb id="p.240" n="240"/> The object of all chastening is purification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3281"/>War, pestilence and famine, when they came upon <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> ancient people, were designed to turn them from their sins, and to bring them back to his love and service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3282"/>When that result was accomplished the chastisement was removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3283"/>Has the <rs type="place">Church</rs> in our afflicted land learned aright the chastening lessons of her <name n="God" type="God">God</name>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3284"/>Have the rulers and the people, like those of <placeName key="tgn,2113290" n="1.000 4" reg="nineveh, warren, virginia">Nineveh</placeName>, repented before the judgments of the <rs>Lord</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3285"/>In some hopeful measure this undoubtedly has been the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3286"/>We believe that in humility, in sincerity of faith, in thankfulness for mercies, and in prayerfulness, there has been improvement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3287"/>Men have been called to sacrifice self for principle, and freely has the sacrifice been made by <num value="1000000">millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3288"/>A tenderer charity, and a larger benevolence than ever before, open the hands and fill the hearts of many.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3289"/>A higher estimate has been placed upon <hi rend="italics">truth</hi> and upon <hi rend="italics">right</hi> by a people resisting unto blood, striving against sin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3290"/>The coming of peace will be insured, and will be hastened by our fidelity in duty and our devotion in prayer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3291"/>But, brethren, our great argument with you is the salvation of the souls of men, the salvation of our sons and brothers, the salvation of our dear soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3292"/>We plead for those who are ready to lay down the life that now is. Shall they lose also the life which is to come?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3293"/>If the sacrifice of the body is demanded, shall that of the soul be made?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3733"/>In many instances, chaplains, army missionaries, colporters and tracts have accomplished great things; but by far the most cogent influences that have operated upon and subdued the reckless spirit of the soldiery, are those which are born in the heart itself, upon the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3875"/>On the <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="2">first</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> after our arrival here, I held the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of a series of services, that were kept up, when the weather permitted it, every evening during the stay of the army in this region.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3876"/>These services were held after dark, in the open air, around a blazing camp-fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3877"/>They commenced always with singing, which quickly attracted a congregation, and were followed by prayer, and a plain, practical sermon, in which the great doctrines of justification by faith, evangelical repentance, and the new birth were set forth in the simplest language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3878"/>When the sermon closed, after singing and prayer, generally an earnest exhortation was made by <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> K&mdash;&mdash;, a man who, while most efficiently discharging the duties of a soldier of his country, has never forgotten that he is a soldier of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0163.0010.00287.01141" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:10"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3879"/>From the beginning of these services it was evident that <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> Spirit was working in many hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3880"/>The men listened with the deepest attention, and seemed very reluctant to leave the ground when the benediction was pronounced-sometimes spending hours in singing hymns, and earnest religious conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3881"/>On <num value="1">one</num> of these occasions <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> K&mdash;&mdash;went to them and said: <quote>What a blessed thing it would be, if all of you who are here present could agree to give yourselves to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> from this hour.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3882"/>And after an earnest exhortation to flee at once to <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> for righteousness, sanctification and redemption, he asked them what their views were on the great subject; and, to his surprise, <num value="6">six</num> out of <num value="7">seven</num> who were sitting together declared their determination to seek at once an interest in the atoning blood of <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3883"/>This was the beginning of the great and glorious work of grace that followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3884"/>Every night a deeper and deeper anxiety <pb id="p.288" n="288"/> was manifested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3885"/>There was little or no excitement, and no extraordinary means to promote deep feeling were resorted to. The Spirit of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> went with the preached word and earnest, pointed conversation, and the heads of many of the most hardened sinners were bowed down, as <quote>they became convicted of sin, of righteousness, and of a judgment to come.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3886"/>A deeper sense of sin, or more childlike faith, I have never seen manifested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3887"/>Another striking characteristic was the eagerness which was manifested by all for the sincere milk of the word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3888"/>The <rs type="document">Bible</rs> was the book to which they continually resorted; and those who had tasted of the love of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0163.0010.00288.01142" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:10"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> showed the greatest eagerness to lead others to the same precious fountain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3889"/>After the services had been continued for a week, a number of the young converts manifested a desire to dedicate themselves to the <rs>Lord</rs> in baptism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3890"/>And, though the weather was inclement, it was thought advisable not to postpone the service, as it then seemed probable that the army would move speedily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3891"/>The service was <num value="1">one</num> of the most solemn and deeply interesting I ever witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3892"/>The <num value="6">six</num> soldiers to be baptized stood in a line near the blazing camp-fire, surrounded by a large congregation of attentive and interested spectators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3893"/>The deep darkness of the night, and slight fall of rain, added much to the solemnity of the occasion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3894"/>Among the <num value="6">six</num> soldiers who came forward to enlist under the banner of the great <rs type="role" reg="Captain">Captain</rs> of their salvation there was a great variety of character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3895"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was a poor, weak man, who had given much trouble to the officers of his company; the next, a man of remarkable bravery, had been <num value="1">one</num> of the most notorious sinners in the company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3896"/>His evidence of conversion was strikingly clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3897"/>His sorrow for sin was very deep, and his faith simple and ardent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3898"/>Then came forward <num value="1">one</num> who had been regarded as <num value="1">one</num> of the most unpromising men in his company&mdash; whose previous life had been anything else than religious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3899"/>He seemed now to be thoroughly in earnest, and manifested the spirit of a genuine penitent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3900"/>The next was an amiable and moral young man, who had been long seeking the <name>Saviour</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3901"/>The last <num value="2">two</num> were among the bravest and best men in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3902"/>Having nobly struggled as good soldiers of their country, they came forward to enlist zealously in the service of their Redeemer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3903"/>When these <num value="6">six</num> were baptized, a very interesting youth, who <pb id="p.289" n="289"/> had been deeply concerned for several days, expressed a desire to follow their example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3904"/>He said he felt himself to be a guilty, helpless sinner, but he had given his soul to <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> to be His forever, and desired at once to enlist as His soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3905"/>Believing him to be a genuine convert, we at once administered to him the ordinance of baptism.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3906"/>This was an evening never to be forgotten by any who were present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3907"/>The Holy Spirit was evidently with us, working with power in many hearts; and <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> was also there, manifesting His power and willingness to save.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3908"/>Besides the little band of <num value="7">seven</num> who put on the <rs>Christian</rs> armor, there were many hearts moved that evening, and tears flowed from many eyes unused to weeping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3909"/>From that solemn hour we have reason to believe that a goodly number resolved to spend their lives in the service of their <rs type="role2">Lord</rs> and Saviour.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3910"/>From this time our services increased in interest, the number of anxious inquirers increased steadily, and many backsliders were led to repentance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3911"/>When <measure n="4weeks" type="date">four weeks</measure> had passed by, during which time the meetings were kept up every evening, except when interrupted by bad weather, <num value="19">nineteen</num> men had been baptized, <num value="36">thirty-six</num> admitted, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, to the communion of the <rs>Lord</rs>'s Supper, and about <num value="60">sixty</num> had professed a hope in the <rs>Lord Jesus</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3912"/>A few of the most striking cases of awakening are worthy of being specially noticed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3913"/>Among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> persons awakened was a notorious card-player and swearer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3914"/>He was <num value="1">one</num> evening standing guard near enough to the camp-fire to hear what passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3915"/>Upon hearing an old friend, who had long been his companion in sinful practices, confess a determination to renounce his sins, and seek an interest in the atoning blood of <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>, he, too, became powerfully convicted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3916"/>He realized, as never before, that he was a wretched sinner, standing on the verge of an awful hell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3917"/>He became more and more alarmed, and, at last, became so powerfully excited&mdash;to use his own words&mdash;he felt as if some <num value="1">one</num> was after him with a bayonet, and soon found himself almost on a run, as he moved backwards and forwards on his beat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3918"/>After a time he succeeded in driving off his serious feelings, but in a few days they returned with renewed violence, and he found no rest until he laid hold of <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3919"/>Well do I remember the earnest, happy expression of this man's face as he sat, night after night, by the camp-fire, eagerly devouring the preached word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3920"/>From <pb id="p.290" n="290"/> the day he found peace in believing he went forth as a genuine missionary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3921"/>He preached the <name>Gospel</name> in season and out of season; day by day he warned his ungodly companions to flee from the wrath to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3922"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion he visited a neighboring camp, and earnestly exhorted the men to come to our meetings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3923"/>As he walked across a field near the camp, he met a man who was swearing in a terrible manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3924"/>After gently reproving him, he asked him if he would not attend the evening meetings, and told him that there had been a great visitation of the <name>Spirit</name> in his camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3925"/>The mart replied that he did not know that he had any visitation except from the <rs>Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3926"/><quote>Yes,</quote> says he, <quote><name n="God" type="God">God</name> has poured out his Spirit upon many in my camp, who were hardened in sin, and they are now happy Christians.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3927"/> <quote>Are you a Christian, too?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3928"/>asked the stranger.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3929"/> <quote>Yes, I was like yourself, going on hardened in sin, and a few evenings since the <rs>Lord</rs> led me to see and feel my sins, and I now have a hope in <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3930"/>After a short pause, with much feeling he said, <quote>Will you pray for me?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3931"/> <quote>Yes, I will pray for you, and all like you, that you be brought to <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> as I have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3932"/>But you must, at the same time, pray for yourself.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3933"/>Then they parted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3934"/>After a few days they met again, and the reader can imagine the joy it gave our young convert to find that his appeal had gone to the heart of a stranger; that he had sought the <name>Saviour</name>, and found peace to his troubled soul.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3935"/>Another case I will describe, of peculiar interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3936"/>An ungodly young man came to our meetings, and became convicted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3937"/>And, as is too often the case, he earnestly strove to drive off all serious feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3938"/>While all around him attended the services, he staid away, fearing that he might be forced to yield his heart to the movings of the <name>Spirit</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3939"/><num value="1">One</num> night, when nearly all in his tent had gone to the meeting, a young friend, who had once been a professing <name>Christian</name>, persuaded him to accompany him. They came within hearing distance, and sat down on a pile of hay. During the sermon he became powerfully awakened, and as soon as it closed a cousin of his came and asked me to go to him. I found him in great distress of mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3940"/>As soon as he saw me, he clasped my hand, and said: <quote>I have sent for you to know what I must do.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3941"/><pb id="p.291" n="291"/></p> 
<p>I replied: <quote>You have nothing to do. Everything has been done for you. If you feel yourself to be a sinner, you may rest assured that the <rs>Lord</rs> is willing and ready to bless you now.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3942"/>And without a moment's delay he took hold of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0163.0010.00291.01143" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:10"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, and found peace in believing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3943"/>He then, in an earnest tone, said: <quote>Where is W., who brought me here?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3944"/>He is a backslider; go and talk to him.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3945"/>The next <rs>Sunday</rs> was a very stormy day. Not being able to hold a public service, I went from tent to tent, conversing and praying with the men. While in the tent occupied by these <num value="2">two</num> young men, I asked, <quote>Are all in this tent <name>Christian</name> soldiers?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3946"/>When I asked this question, I observed that young W. seemed depressed, though he said nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3947"/>That night was exceedingly stormy, and fearing that my tent would blow down, I went to a neighboring house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3948"/>Just before reaching the house I heard some <num value="1">one</num> address me, it being too dark to see distinctly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3949"/>I turned around, and discovered it was young W. He had followed me from the tent, that he might open his heart to me. He said: <quote>When you asked in my tent to-day, if all were <name>Christian</name> soldiers, and some <num value="1">one</num> replied, <q direct="unspecified">All except <num value="1">one</num>,</q> I felt that that was not exactly true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3950"/>I was once a professing <name>Christian</name>, but have recently been very wicked; and, while living an ungodly life, have led my sisters to believe that I was still a Christian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3951"/>I now feel as never before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3952"/>I trust I have truly repented of my sins, and believe that I am pardoned.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3953"/>I exhorted him to confess all to his family, and to make a fresh consecration of himself to his Saviour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3954"/>And as I thought of his experience, and that of his friend, I could not but be impressed by the mysterious way in which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3955"/>He had here made use of a backslider to lead a wicked companion to <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>, and then used the converted man to lead the backslider to repentance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3956"/><num value="1">One</num> other interesting incident, in like manner illustrating <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> gracious and mysterious <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, I will mention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3957"/><num value="1">One</num> evening, just before night, a large body of troops marched by our camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3958"/>In <num value="1">one</num> of the regiments was a very intelligent young man, from <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>, who, not being able, on account of sickness, to keep up with his regiment, stopped at our camp to rest, about the usual hour for service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3959"/>He listened with the deepest interest to the preached word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3960"/>I dwelt, in my sermon, on <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> mysterious dealings with His people, and endeavored to show His <pb id="p.292" n="292"/> faithfulness in afflicting us, and that He leads all His people <quote>by the right way</quote> into His heavenly kingdom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3961"/>When the service closed, observing him very thoughtful, I asked him if he was a professing <name>Christian</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3962"/>He said he was not, but trusted he could from that hour give his heart to the <name>Saviour</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3963"/>He said he came to the meeting in a bad humor, being displeased at his regiment moving so rapidly; but he then saw why he had been left behind, and believed he would be able to praise the <rs>Lord</rs> through eternity for having brought him to our service that evening.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3964"/>The <num value="60">sixty</num> men who professed a hope in <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> within these <measure n="4weeks" type="date">four weeks</measure> were from <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> different companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3965"/>But the larger portion of them belonged to the company of <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> K&mdash;&mdash;. When this company entered the service, <num value="1">one</num> year before, it was made up, for the most part, of the most wicked men to be met with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3966"/>The larger portion of the men were grossly addicted to gambling, drinking, and profanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3967"/>The captain labored unceasingly to overcome these vices, and continually pressed upon his men the great truths of the <name>Gospel</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3968"/>He had the satisfaction of seeing a steady improvement in the deportment of all, and he was especially gratified to see profanity almost entirely abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3969"/>And now, after <num value="1">one</num> year of faithful, persevering labor, he was rewarded by this gracious and most abundant outpouring of the <name>Spirit</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3970"/>The seed, which he had diligently sown, now took root, sprang up, and brought forth abundant fruit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3971"/>Of the <num value="80">eighty</num> odd members of his company present during these services, <num value="17">seventeen</num> were professing Christians when they commenced, <num value="40">forty</num>three more expressed a hope in <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0163.0010.00292.01144" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:10"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> before they closed, <num value="14">fourteen</num> were more or less anxious on account of their souls, and not more than <num value="6">six</num>, if so many, were indifferent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3972"/>The following extract from a letter I recently received from <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> K&mdash;&mdash;, written about <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> after the great awakening, will show how the young communicants in his company have held out:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3973"/> <quote>The young Christians in my company,</quote> he says, <quote>have held out, I think, with remarkable consistency; only <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> have been otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4056"/>The <q direct="unspecified">appeal to the <rs type="place">Churches</rs></q> (written by <persName n="Lacy,Reverend,B.,T.,," id="n0163.0010.00298.01199" reg="default:Lacy,B.,T.,,"><roleName n="Reverend">Rev.</roleName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Lacy</surname></persName>, as chairman of the committee) was read, cordially approved and adopted, after a few unimportant alterations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4057"/>A <quote><orgName n="Correspondence Committee" type="committee">committee of correspondence</orgName>,</quote> consisting of <num value="2">two</num> chaplains from each division of the corps, and representing the several denominations, was raised for the purpose of facilitating the introduction of chaplains into the destitute regiments, and the general subject of the scarcity of chaplains was again freely remarked on. It was agreed that each <num value="1">one</num> would aid the committee in the discharge of their duties by every means in his power, and that the appointment of the committee did not at all release individuals from the discharge of their duty in the premises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4058"/>And it was understood that the object of the committee was not to assume any dictatorial power in the matter, but merely to facilitate the supplying of chaplains for the vacant regiments, by finding suitable men and obtaining their appointments by the <pb id="p.299" n="299"/> colonels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4059"/>The duty of personal conversation with soldiers on the subject of religion, its difficulties, and how they may be overcome, etc., was another topic of remark; and it was agreed by all that this most potent and much neglected means of usefulness had accomplished a vast amount of good in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4060"/>As to its difficulties it was urged that they may be overcome by a man whose heart burns with the love of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0163.0010.00299.01200" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:10"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> and love for the souls of our brave soldiers&mdash;that the sentinel's beat, the weary march, the outpost, the battle-field, the bivouac and the hospital, afford ample time and place to press upon our charges the duty of personal religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4061"/>The fast-day was mentioned, and it was agreed that by a division of labor we would have services in as many of the regiments as possible, and that, in addition to prayer for the country, we would make the religious condition of our corps a subject of special prayer&mdash;that the <rs>Lord</rs> would grant us a general revival of His work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4062"/>During this meeting we were highly entertained by remarks from <persName n="Faulkner,Colonel,,,," id="n0163.0010.00299.01201" reg="mostcommon:Faulkner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Faulkner</surname></persName>, chief of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0163.0010.00299.01202" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,T.,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>'s staff, and <persName n="Battle,Colonel,,,," id="n0163.0010.00299.01203" reg="mostcommon:Battle,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Battle</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="3ALInfantry">Third Alabama Infantry</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4063"/>It is a most gratifying fact that many of the officers of our corps are earnest <name>Christian</name> men; and it affords me pleasure to say that of those who are not professors of religion I have never met with <num value="1">one</num> who threw obstacles in the way of my work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4072"/>The brethren generally reported unusual interest in their fast-day exercises&mdash;immense congregations and the deepest interest manifested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4073"/>I am persuaded that the day was very generally observed throughout the army&mdash;even the negro cooks observed it in my regiment&mdash;and its good results are already apparent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4074"/>The subject of religious reading for our soldiers next came up, and I wish that the brother who thought colporters of no use could have been present to hear what chaplains think of the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4075"/>By the way, a new name was suggested by some brother for the colporter&mdash;that of <quote>spiritual commissary</quote> &mdash;and tracts and religious papers were called <quote> spiritual rations.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4076"/>Visitation of the sick was discussed&mdash;its importance, best methods of accomplishing it, etc.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4078"/>These meetings are interspersed with devotional exercises, and I am sure that they have been of spiritual benefit to us. And then, they have warmed our sympathies, aroused our zeal, and given a system to our labors, which must result in lasting good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4079"/>The only wonder is, that we did not begin to hold them long before we did.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4080"/>It was my privilege to be in <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> again about a week ago (while my regiment was on picket just below the town) and participate in the glorious meeting in progress there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4081"/>Up to that time <hi rend="italics"><num value="190">one hundred and ninety</num></hi> had joined the different Churches, a number of others had professed conversion, and the altar was still crowded with penitents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4084"/>But I must hasten to a close&mdash;not, however, before relating a pleasing little incident that occurred in our brigade the other day. <persName n="McGill,Reverend,John,,," id="n0163.0010.00300.01209" reg="default:McGill,John,,,"><roleName n="Reverend">Rev.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>McGill</surname></persName>, the efficient chaplain of the <orgName type="regiment" key="52VARegiment">Fifty-second Virginia Regiment</orgName>, had the misfortune to lose his horse a few weeks ago.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4108"/>In my late visit, it was my high privilege to preach <num value="6">six</num> times to crowds of men eager to hear the <name>Gospel</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4111"/>It sounded over the camp like a bell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4112"/>A prayer-meeting had been appointed for the half hour before public worship, and the house was already full: so full that it was not without difficulty that I made my way to the <pb id="p.303" n="303"/> pulpit; so full that when <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0163.0010.00303.01220" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,T.,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Paxton,General,,,," id="n0163.0010.00303.01221" reg="mostcommon:Paxton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Paxton</surname></persName> came to the door, they modestly retired, least they should displace some already within; so full that <num value="1">one</num> of the men aptly compared the close packing to that of <quote>herrings in a barrel.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4455"/>Our congregations have been very large; for some distance the entire grove being crowded with deeply interested listeners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4461"/><persName><roleName n="Brother">Brother</roleName> <foreName>Renfroe</foreName></persName> is receiving many for baptism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4464"/><num value="50">Fifty</num> have professed conversion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4465"/>I will give a few facts, by way of illustrating the character of this work of grace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4466"/>I announced at <num value="1">one</num> of the meetings that there was an assortment of tracts in the chaplain's tent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4467"/>In a few moments after I found numbers crowding around the tent and helping themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4468"/>Each man looked over the packages and selected such as he wanted, and consequently <hi rend="italics">every tract which explained the plan of salvation, or which treated of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0163.0011.00327.01384" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:10"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, was taken, and the others left</hi>.

No <num value="1">one</num> seemed to feel that he had time to read of anything else except the way to be saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4469"/>Another interesting feature in the meeting is the deep solicitude which all seem to have that they may be genuinely converted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4470"/>The young converts often come <pb id="p.328" n="328"/> to us privately deeply affected, in many cases weeping and trembling, to ask for further instruction as to what constitutes conversion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4471"/>They have an unspeakable dread of being deceived on this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4472"/><num value="1">One</num> young man, the son of a Baptist minister, said to me: <quote>Oh, sir, I have a <hi rend="italics">little hope</hi>, but I am afraid to confess it, for fear it may not be well founded.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4473"/>Another said that for <hi rend="italics">months</hi> he had been hoping that he was a Christian, but that he was <quote>so <hi rend="italics">afraid</hi> that he might backslide and dishonor his Master.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4474"/>It is interesting, too, to see how long the work of grace has been in progress in many hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4475"/>Several have for more than a year been under deep conviction and been seeking the <name>Saviour</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4476"/>Not a few have received their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> religious impressions on the battlefield.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4477"/>I think <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> spoke of having been convicted at the <rs>Chancellorsville</rs> fight, while an interesting young man assured us that during the battle of <placeName reg="Seven Pines, Marion, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119933">Seven Pines</placeName>, while his comrades were falling around him, he promised the <rs>Lord</rs> that he would love and serve Him; from that day to this he has been trying to make good his vow. Without doubt, in hundreds of instances, the shock of battle has been sanctified to the saving of souls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4478"/>It is worthy of record that this meeting is greatly developing the gifts of Christians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4479"/>Many a brother is aroused to his duty to put forth active efforts for the salvation of sinners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4480"/><num value="2">Two</num> of the young men, members of the <orgName type="regiment" key="AL10">Tenth Alabama</orgName>, are now holding a protracted meeting in a neighboring camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4481"/>They go over every evening and preach the <name>Gospel</name>, comforting and encouraging Christians and warning sinners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4482"/>A revival has sprung up under their labors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4483"/>A chaplain of a Virginia regiment remarked, yesterday, that the <rs>Master</rs> intends honoring many of these young men by putting them in the ministry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4484"/>We have, from the beginning of the war, been pleading with the <rs type="place">Churches</rs> to send preachers to the army, and with some little success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4485"/>It seems, now, that the army itself is to produce a supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4486"/>I beg that all through the land earnest and constant prayer be made that scores and hundreds of <name>Christian</name> men in the army may be called of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to the work of the ministry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4489"/>When he made known the fact that he had arrived at the conclusion that it was his duty to <pb id="p.329" n="329"/> give himself to the army, his churches were very unwilling to give him up.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4492"/>I cite this incident with the hope of encouraging the churches to give their pastors, at least for a few months, to this work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4493"/>Your own son, or brother or father, may be converted through the preaching of your minister in camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4494"/>And if this may not be, some <num value="1">one</num> else may be reached and saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4772"/>These young converts sing, pray and exhort, and their labors are made instrumental in the conversion of their comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4773"/>A Baptist chaplain told me yesterday, that every day or <num value="2">two</num> he was called on to baptize soldiers, brought to him by the young converts, the fruits of their prayer-meetings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4781"/>We need, however, funds to support those engaged in this good work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4804"/>So far as my observation has extended, it is only necessary for a few sermons to be preached, in any regiment or brigade, to secure the conviction and conversion of sinners.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4875"/>There were some peculiar difficulties in the way of our work during the period embraced in this chapter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4876"/>The severe weather of the winter and early spring made outdoor services rarely possible, and the skies had scarcely begun to smile upon us when <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0163.0012.00353.01539" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> crossed the <rs>Rapidan</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4877"/>Lee at once advanced and attacked him, and there ensued the death-grapple from <q direct="unspecified">the <rs>Wilderness</rs></q> to <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 9" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Petersburg</placeName>, when we marched or fought, or were busy entrenching nearly every day. And then followed the siege of <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 9" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Petersburg</placeName> and defence of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, when our little army (reduced at last to <num value="33000">33,000</num> men to guard <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure> of entrenchments) was on starvation rations, and was yet forced to do an amount of marching, fighting, digging and watching that would have exhausted much sooner any other troops of which history gives any account, and all of which was very decidedly unfavorable to religious services, or any evangelical work among the soldiers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4878"/>And yet the good work went graciously on, there were precious seasons along the line of the <rs>Rapidan</rs> up to the very opening of the campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4879"/>Many were converted on the march, in the trenches, on the battle-field, in the hospital&mdash;and the <rs type="place">Richmond</rs> and <placeName reg="Petersburg line">Petersburg lines</placeName>, despite their scenes of carnage and blood, were made glorious by the presence of <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0163.0012.00353.01540" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:10"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> in the trenches</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4880"/>I remember that the very day on which our line was broken below <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 9" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Petersburg</placeName>, necessitating the evacuation of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 9" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Petersburg</placeName>, and that sad march which terminated at <placeName reg="Appomattox Court House">Appomattox Court House</placeName>, I had an appointment to preach and to baptize at the very point at which the lines were broken, and had been laboring there for some days in <num value="1">one</num> of the most interesting revivals which I witnessed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4881"/>Indeed, the revivals along the <placeName><distance reg="40miles">forty miles</distance> of Confederate</placeName> entrenchments, where there were about <num value="60">sixty</num> chapels, during the winter of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>&mdash;<num value="65">65</num> were as general and as powerful as any we <pb id="p.354" n="354"/> had at all, and only ceased when the army was disbanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4882"/>Really they did not cease then, for in the great revivals with which our Churches in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 20" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and the <rs>South</rs> were blessed during the <rs type="season">summer</rs> and <rs type="season">autumn</rs> of <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct> a very large proportion of the converts were from among our returned soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4883"/>I witnessed myself a large number of professions of conversion among them, and in the meetings in which I preached (acting as an independent evangelist from the mountains to the seaboard after I had <q direct="unspecified">laid by</q> the corn and threshed the wheat, for I took off my coat and went into the field to work on my return from the army), I always found our returned soldiers the most tender and impressible part of the congregations.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4887"/>I have confined myself chiefly to those regiments and brigades most destitute of ministerial labor; but would take occasion to say that I have been treated by the chaplains of all denominations with uniform courtesy and kindness, and have invariably found both officers and men ready to afford me every assistance in the prosecution of my work.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4891"/>An important part of my work has been to endeavor to secure chaplains for the vacant regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4892"/>I have been instrumental in securing the appointment of <num value="12">twelve</num> chaplains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4893"/>I could have secured the appointment of a number of others could I have found suitable brethren to take the places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4894"/>Several excellent men could be gotten from the ranks, but for the refusal of the present secretary of war to make such appointments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4895"/>I trust that I have also been of some service in assisting ministers coming to labor for a short time in the army, with information as to the most suitable places for them to labor, etc.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4896"/>The past <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> have been very unfavorable to preaching in the army, owing to the unceasing activity which has prevailed, but when denied an opportunity of preaching I have found an abundant work in the hospitals, in pointing the sick and wounded to the great Physician.

<text><body> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4902"/>The religious condition of our army at present is both healthful and hopeful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4903"/>Now that the weather has become unfavorable for frequent outdoor services, many of the regiments have neatly constructed log chapels, and many other chaplains, in lieu of this convenience, substitute the social prayer-meeting from hut to hut, Bible-classes, tract distribution, private conversation, etc., for the more public ministrations of the word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4904"/><pb id="p.356" n="356"/> There is very great demand for good reading of all sorts, and the friends of the soldier can do nothing more acceptable to him than to send good books, papers, magazines, etc., to <persName><roleName n="Brother">Brother</roleName> <foreName>Fry</foreName></persName>, at our depository, who will see them properly distributed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4905"/>By the way, our depository, under <persName><roleName n="Brother">Brother</roleName> <foreName>Fry</foreName></persName>'s effective management, is proving a complete success and a great blessing to the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4906"/>Not only are chaplains supplied, but pious men in many of the regiments without chaplains, get from it packages of tracts and papers, and go as colporters to their comrades.</p>

There are still <dateStruct value="50"><year reg="50">fifty</year></dateStruct> regiments and battalions without chaplains, but it will be remembered that when our Chaplains' Association sent out, just a year ago, an appeal to the <rs type="place">Churches</rs> for more laborers in the army, <hi rend="italics">over half the</hi> regiments were without chaplains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4942"/>The large increase will be gratifying not only to the <rs>Christian</rs> public, but to all who rightly estimate the <hi rend="italics">military power</hi> of religion in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4943"/>A year ago there were whole brigades without chaplains, and regiments which had had scarcely a sermon, but this has ceased to be. There is not a brigade which has not <num value="1">one</num> or more chaplains, and the supply of missionary labor has been far greater than during any previous year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4944"/>Indeed, but for the fact that a large number of chaplains have resigned, the supply would nearly equal the demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4945"/>The labors of these messengers of salvation have been wonderfully blessed during the past year, and in contemplating what has been done, we may well <quote>thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and take courage.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4946"/>But there is <num value="1">one</num> thought which strikes me painfully in looking over these statistics&mdash;the proportion of <persName n="Baptist,,,,," id="n0163.0012.00358.01555" reg="nearbymention:Baptist,Virginia,,,"><surname>Baptist</surname></persName> chaplains to those of our Methodist and Presbyterian brethren is <hi rend="italics">so small</hi>, when we consider the relative membership of each Church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4947"/>I suppose that there are about as many Baptists as Methodists, and over twice as many as Presbyterians in the army&mdash;and yet our Presbyterian brethren have as many chaplains as we, and our <name>Methodist</name> brethren almost twice as many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4948"/>I rejoice that the ministry of these denominations have awakened to some appreciation of what they owe to the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4949"/>I mourn that our <pb id="p.359" n="359"/> <persName n="Baptist,,,,," id="n0163.0012.00359.01556" reg="nearbymention:Baptist,Virginia,,,"><surname>Baptist</surname></persName> ministry seem <hi rend="italics">behind them</hi> in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4950"/>Brethren of the ministry, there is still an open door to this widespread field of usefulness; and I call upon you to consider whether it is not <hi rend="italics">your</hi> duty to enter it. And by the way, I would respectfully ask of our older brethren in the ministry, if it is necessary for Congress (according to the law passed by the <name>Senate</name>) to extend the conscript age to <num value="55">fifty-five</num>, does not this call upon some of them to give themselves to the work of army evangelization?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4951"/>If the age of those who are <hi rend="italics">to do the fighting</hi> is to be extended, ought not the age of those who are <hi rend="italics">to do the preaching</hi> in the army be also extended?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4952"/>Is it right that our chaplaincies should be filled almost entirely by <hi rend="italics">young</hi> men&mdash;many of them with no experience as preachers?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4953"/>True, most of our useful ministers have families whom they would have to leave, and separation from loved ones is a bitter trial, but then our soldiers have to endure this, besides risking their lives, and it would seem right that they should be willing to make a like sacrifice in preaching to them the glad tidings. . . . <q direct="unspecified">All quiet along the lines</q> is the stereotyped phrase which will probably express our military status for weeks to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4955"/>The spirits of our army were never better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4956"/>The men are re-enlisting for the war, wherever an effort is made to get them to do so, and there is withal a spirit of content and hopefulness which the people at home would do well to imitate.

<p>The good work which I reported in this brigade some time ago still goes graciously on, though they have been temporarily deprived of their chapel and the services of their efficient chaplain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5240"/>Many of these are highly educated, and, before the war, were preparing themselves for, or actively engaged in, some secular calling.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5253"/>In my previous letters I have not said as much as I desired with reference to our hospital work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5254"/>Of course, the frequent witnessing of such scenes has a tendency to blunt <num value="1">one</num>'s sensibilities, and yet it would be indeed a heart of steel that could remain untouched at the succession of woes constantly presented at our field hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5255"/>I have seen the old gray-haired sire anxiously pace to and fro as ambulance after ambulance brings in its mangled freight, and at last, perchance, his noble boy is <pb id="p.380" n="380"/> borne in, or he learns that he has fallen on the gory field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5259"/>I am glad to be able to say, that the arrangements for the comfort of our wounded are now much more complete than they have hitherto been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5260"/>There are a larger number of ambulances, and a much better supply of hospital stores of every kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5263"/>They are thoroughly organized, and a set of real working men who do not mind taking off their coats and pitching right into anything which can promote the comfort of our poor wounded fellows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5265"/>The results of the glorious revivals with which our army has been visited, have been manifested in the very large proportion of the wounded who express a calm confidence in <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0163.0012.00380.01717" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> which renders them happy in their affliction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5266"/>I have talked with poor fellows, dreadfully mangled and about to die, who were as composed and happy as if about to fall asleep under the parental roof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5267"/>I met a noble young <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> officer who, too badly wounded to talk, yet wrote me on a slip of paper, in answer to my inquiries: <q direct="unspecified">My whole trust is in <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0163.0012.00380.01718" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, and I feel perfectly resigned to <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5273"/>I learned of another incident, strikingly illustrating the <hi rend="italics">military</hi> <pb id="p.381" n="381"/> <hi rend="italics">power of religion</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5274"/>Despite unfavorable surroundings the men do not neglect their little prayer-meetings, and thus the good work goes on. On a large part of the line, however, we have regular preaching, and a good deal of interest is manifested in the services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5276"/>Indeed, we might look for a very general revival throughout the army if the position of all the troops would admit of regular labor amongst them, and we had laborers to enter the glorious harvest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5277"/>The past few weeks have been very unfavorable for religious services, as the weather has been too cold for outdoor exercises, and but few chapels have been completed, owing to scarcity of timber and transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5278"/>I refer in this remark to the lines south of the <rs>Appomattox</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5279"/>Between the <rs>Appomattox</rs> and the <rs>James</rs>, and north of the <rs>James</rs> too (I believe), every brigade have <num value="1">one</num> or more chapels, and there have been very decided manifestations of the revival spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5280"/>In some of the brigades they are enjoying precious seasons of revival.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5281"/>A number of chapels have been completed on our part of the lines, others are in process of erection, and we are hoping for a like visitation of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> Spirit.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5771"/>When the battle was over and victory perched upon our banner, <persName><foreName>Albert</foreName></persName> found himself surrounded with the dead and dying, among whom were some of his particular friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5772"/>He was strongly and strangely exercised with a mingled feeling of joy and grief, a sort of hysteric paroxysm of laughing and crying, weeping for the slain, and rejoicing that he had escaped unharmed, with a deep consciousness that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> had been his shield and hiding-place in the hour of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5773"/><persName><foreName>Albert</foreName></persName> endured all the sufferings of fatigue, cold and hunger incident to a winter campaign; none murmured less, none were more faithful in the discharge of duty than he.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5774"/>In this state of mind, he entered upon the <measure n="7days" type="date">seven days</measure> battles before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5775"/>The solemnities of the occasion aroused him to a sense of his danger, causing him to cleave more closely to his Bible and its precious promises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5776"/>With his hand on this blessed book pressed to his heart, he called on <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to be his shield and support in the hour of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5777"/>He passed the terrible ordeal of <placeName reg="Twymans Mill, Madison, Virginia" key="tgn,2114675">Gaines's Mill</placeName> on Friday and <placeName key="tgn,2489907" n="1.000 203" reg="malvern hill, charles city, virginia">Malvern Hill</placeName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct>, where the men fell around him like grain before the reapers and covered the ground thick as autumn leaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5778"/>A degree of joy and gratitude swelled his heart as he surveyed the field of death, in view of his own wonderful escape, but not so deep and warm as on a former occasion, when his faith and piety <pb id="p.415" n="415"/> were more earnest and simple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5779"/><persName><foreName>Albert</foreName></persName> continued at times to read his Bible, but it was evidently more as a task than a pleasant duty; his keen relish for Divine things had abated very much; the excuses of camp-life, long marches, and the general indifference of officers and men upon the subject of religion, offered his conscience the consolation of a temporary opiate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5780"/>Sometimes, however, on the reception of letters from home, and sometimes, when alone on his midnight round of picket-duty, he would shed a penitential tear and resolve to double his diligence and regain his lost ground as a Christian; but a plant so tender and unprotected by the pale of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>, unwatered by the dews of the sanctuary, persecuted and scathed by the lightnings of contempt, nipped and browsed upon by every wild beast of the forest, necessarily became greatly dwarfed in life and growth; a feeling of self-security, a trust in fate or chance, impressed him more than a simple faith in the ever-present <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5781"/>In this spiritually demoralized condition he entered the <rs>Sharpsburg</rs> fight, without even asking <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to protect him and save him from danger and death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5782"/>Soon after the battle opened he was struck by a ball and carried back to the rear a wounded man; from profuse hemorrhage, a sick, dreamy sensation stole over him; the light faded from his eyes, while a <num value="1000">thousand</num> mingled sounds filled his ears, and a faint vision of home, friends, green turf, battle-fields and graveyards flitted by like phantoms of the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5783"/>With returning consciousness, there came a sense of shame and sorrow for having declined in his religious state, and a conviction that his wound was the chastening of the <rs>Lord</rs> to rebuke his wanderings and check his self-reliance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5784"/>As soon as he was sufficiently restored, he drew from his pocket his neglected Bible, kissing it many times over and bathing it in tears as truly penitential as <persName><foreName>Peter</foreName></persName>'s when he wept at the feet of <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5785"/>His bloody fingers searched out the old-cherished promises of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, leaving many a gory stain on the blessed pages of inspiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5786"/>The law of the <rs>Lord</rs> again became his meat and drink, on which he feasted by day and by night; a new life was infused into his soul, which enabled him to bear his sufferings with true <name>Christian</name> heroism.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6325"/>His quiet, earnest manner in his pious work struck me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6326"/>He could keep them orderly and obedient and on duty, while his officers could not. I soon found him not only moral, but intellectual; not merely gifted with animal, but with the highest <name>Christian</name> courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6327"/>Humble, unpretending, modest in his demeanor, he was too high to do wrong himself, and too firm to be tempted or misled by others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6740"/>He was a young man of great modesty, youthful in appearance, tender-looking and generous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6741"/>Gallantry had won him early promotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6742"/>He was the cherished son of a pious mother, towards whom his heart seemed ever turning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6743"/>For a long time he lingered, his mind ever clear, but he foresaw his end. Under the dissipations of camp he had too far forgotten the pious counsels of his mother, and the regret of this became very harrowing to his heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6744"/>He constantly spoke of his mother, and longed for her presence before death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6745"/>A long time he had great difficulty in understanding how <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0163.0014.00474.02191" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> could be his substitute; but finally the <name>Spirit</name> opened his heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6747"/>He clung to me and was always begging me to read to him and pray with him; and whereas he seemed to gain no benefit for a long time, he learned eventually to enjoy the word as I have seldom seen men do, making good and touching comments on it as I read verse after verse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6753"/>Astonished, I inquired if he was raised in a Christian family, and if he had any conscious antipathy to the matter of religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6759"/>I talked with him; I prayed; I left him wrapped in grief and wonder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6764"/>During that time his tongue, so habitually silent hitherto, spoke freely of <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>' pardoning blood, and his face, hitherto grum, became radiant with sunny hope, while the previous murmuring of his heart gave place to contentment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6765"/>He wondered at himself, and greatly rejoiced <pb id="p.475" n="475"/> every hour that the <rs>Lord</rs> had prepared such blessed testimony for his dear mother to rest upon in her bereavement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6810"/>A <hi rend="italics">large</hi> crowd pressed into the chapel, and many stood under the eaves about the door, while many had to retire on account of the rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6811"/>I began to think the young man was nearly right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6812"/>It was evident that the services had made some impression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6813"/>In a little while I learned that many men and messes had said they felt ashamed of their evil practice, and many messes covenanted, some under fines, to abstain from so vicious a habit.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6815"/>I looked around; saw a young man wounded; spoke to him, and learned that he belonged to the <orgName type="mil" key="LABrigade">Louisiana Brigade</orgName>, and also to that splendid band of soldiers whose conduct on that morning alone deserves celebration in the heart of every Confederate, the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2">Second Corps</orgName> Sharpshooters; and that he had received his wound just as he was mounting the enemy's entrenchment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6816"/>I had hardly spoken to him when he asked, smiling, if I remembered the sermon I preached on swearing in their brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6817"/><quote>Yes,</quote> said I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6818"/><quote>Well, sir,</quote> he said, <quote>I made up my mind that night when you and the general got through that I never would swear again; and all our mess said the same thing, and we haven't sworn since.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6819"/>Certainly, in mingling with that gallant command in the vexatious trenches and on the march, I <hi rend="italics">heard</hi> but little profanity among them from that time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6820"/>This thought suggests a general observation which I had the pleasure of making in the closing trials of our once splendid army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6827"/>They seemed much surprised at learning my testimony as to the kindly regard in which dutiful ministers were held, and spoke of the great contrast which our relation to the army officers bore to their own. They inquired relative to the great work of grace, and the means by which it was promoted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6828"/>I told them courteously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6829"/>They then inquired: <quote> How much salary do you get?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6830"/>Upon learning how small it was, they expressed great surprise, and said they could not live on that; they were entitled to, I believe, <num value="2">two</num> horses and <measure n="130dollars" type="currency">$130</measure>, and that they seemed to think rendered it a speculation of doubtful profit!</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6846"/><hi rend="italics"><rs type="role">Rev.</rs> and Dear <rs type="role2">Brother</rs></hi>: I have learned through the religious press your purpose, as suggested in your letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6847"/>I heartily commend the enterprise and the objects sought to be promoted by it. And most gladly would I contribute, according to my ability, towards the accomplishment of your purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6848"/>Whilst with the army (a period of about <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>), my impressions are most favorable as to the influence and effect of religious truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6849"/>It appeared to me that during a course of ministerial experience extending through <measure n="24years" type="date">twenty-four years</measure> I had never witnessed more precious seasons of grace, or more signal displays of Divine mercy, than it was my privilege to witness in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6850"/>Scores, perhaps I would not err were I to say hundreds, of professed conversions passed under my own observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6851"/>Never before was it my privilege to preach to as large congregations or to congregations more respectful in deportment, more serious, and upon whom the truth of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> seemed to have more marked power and effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6852"/>The <hi rend="italics">morale</hi> of the army, too, appeared to me to be good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6853"/>So far as my observation extended, among both officers and privates, there was less profanity than would be found among an equal number of men anywhere else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6854"/>By officers, from the highest to the lowest grade, in my official capacity as chaplain, I was treated with uniform respect and courtesy, and from the men I received nothing but the utmost kindness and consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6855"/>There were, no doubt, bad men in the army, both officers and privates, but it was my happiness to be thrown with those, for the most part, of an opposite character.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6856"/>Whilst many of the severest trials and privations of my life were experienced in the army, it affords me real pleasure to state that many of the happiest seasons of my life were passed with the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6857"/>To my dying day shall <pb id="p.479" n="479"/> I remember those precious meetings, held by day and by night, with that noble army of patriots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6858"/>In the camp, in the hospital, in the bomb-proof, along the line of toilsome march, I mingled freely with them, and, as best I could, preached to them the <name>Gospel</name> of the grace of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6859"/>It is my most cherished hope that the labors of our chaplains, than whom, in my judgment, there was not a body of ministers in the land more worthy of all praise, were largely productive of lasting, nay, eternal good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6860"/>The last great day alone will develop the full amount of good which, through the mercy of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, that noble body of men were enabled to accomplish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6861"/>It is with mournful pleasure that in the seclusion of a quiet country charge I revert to those scenes of thrilling interest and excitement, not to say peril, through which you and I and the whole corps of field-chaplains passed with the brave and veteran <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>.</p>

<p>Before joining the army, we had heard much about the demoralized condition of the men, their profanity, etc., which no doubt prejudiced my mind somewhat, and I was agreeably surprised to find much of the reverse on joining this company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6955"/>That man recovered, but never evidenced by his subsequent course that he had ever experienced the great change; far from it; as the dews of death seemed to be gathering over him, he seemed to feel the importance of religion, and doubtless did feel it; but, as he recovered and took a fresh hold on life, he again gave way to the sinfulness of his nature and lived without <name n="God" type="God">God</name>&mdash;a strange thing.

Yet the active Christians of the company, among whom were some <num value="6">six</num> seminary students, employed themselves distributing tracts and Testaments and religious papers, which were always eagerly received and carefully read by the men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6958"/>And from their serious faces we could see they were in earnest and enjoyed the comforting assurances therein provided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6961"/>These meetings were very well attended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6962"/>We also distributed tracts, religious papers, and Testaments, and these means of grace were greatly blessed by the <rs>Lord</rs> to the good of many souls, we trust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6963"/>The effect was visible in the conduct of the men, and we felt assured from the frequent conversations we had with many that the <rs>Lord</rs> had been with us to do us good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6965"/>A novel and excellent way was to string a number of tracts and suspend to a tree on the public road, on the <name>Sabbath</name>, inviting all who felt interested to pull off a tract and read it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6977"/>The interest in these prayer-meetings continued through the spring, and many professed to have passed from death unto life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6978"/>The marked changes in the habits and deportment of men and officers were hopeful assurances to us that this was no mere enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6979"/>Some who have since passed away in the storm of battle, or by the influence of disease, gave proof that they had indeed passed from death unto life during this precious season of ingathering of souls, while of others we may only trust that this was truly a seasonable time with them to have trusted in <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6985"/>There was also an increased desire to possess a Testament, and particularly a Bible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6986"/>At this time, spring of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, I think the religious interest was more general and more deeply impressed on the minds of the men than at any other period during the war; at least it was more visible and noticeable in its effects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6987"/>The spiritual condition of the men in the army, at this time and after, was thought to be deeper and stronger than that of the people at home &mdash;commonly said, that all the religion was in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6988"/>I never saw this influence <pb id="p.484" n="484"/> more visibly expressed than at a Sabbath-day service held near <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, at the old quarters occupied by <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0163.0014.00484.02291" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,T.,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> previous to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <rs n="Battle of Fredericksburg" type="battle">battle of Fredericksburg</rs> or <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>.

I heard many broken utterances and ejaculations during that prayer, and some declared they tried to pray then, while they thought they had never tried to pray in earnest before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6996"/>Deep and solemn earnestness appeared written on every countenance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6997"/>At the conclusion an impressive pause followed; then the preacher said a few words in application of the text&mdash;that it would be all for the best, whatever <name n="God" type="God">God</name> would determine in reference to the event; and then the crowd quietly dispersed to their camps, ever to retain in their memories this impressive proceeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6998"/>Then, in the evening and on the next morning, the news of his (<placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s) death was reported in camp, and I was struck with the calm, subdued feeling of resignation among the men of his corps&mdash;so different, in contrast, in the spirit and tone manifested by the people at home, when they heard the sad news.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6999"/>The sermon seemed to have wrought its own application in the mind of the army, and the feeling prevailed that it was right and all for the best, though we could not understand it.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7036"/>Often did some of the members retire privately into the woods to enjoy a quiet season of prayer, and even while going into retirement we fell in with others engaged in the same interesting employment, which would only stir up the feeling of devotion that burned in the heart.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7037"/>These numerous seasons of prayer were very precious; the company and the regiment enjoyed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7038"/>Oft when the circumstances surrounding were deemed unfavorable, some of the men would urge that the prayer-meetings should be held, and those who had recently professed <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0163.0014.00486.02301" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> were willing to pray with us in these meetings, which was encouraged, hoping it would prove a means of grace to them.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7043"/>I saw besides something of the revivals and of the religious state of our different armies at various times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7044"/>But I did not see things under circumstances to enable me to contribute to a history with the <num value="1">one</num> exception of <orgName n="Brigade"><persName n="Wise,,,,," id="n0163.0014.00486.02304" reg="mostcommon:Wise,Henry,A.,,:2"><surname>Wise</surname></persName>'s Brigade</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7046"/>Beside a number of other visits made to it, in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 20" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and the <rs>South</rs>, I spent more than a week, including <num value="2">two</num> Sabbaths, with the regiment, <orgName type="regiment" key="4HvArtillery">Fourth Heavy Artillery</orgName> originally (at <placeName reg="Gloucester Point, Gloucester, Virginia" key="tgn,2111953">Gloucester Point</placeName>) and afterwards <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 34">Thirty-fourth Infantry</orgName>, during the summer of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, while the brigade enjoyed its quiet time of several months at <quote><placeName reg="Chapin's Farm">Chapin's Farm</placeName>,</quote> below <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7047"/>I preached <pb id="p.487" n="487"/> and held religious services during the time mentioned, which resulted in the hopeful conversion of some <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7048"/>At least as many, I think, had been hopefully converted in those <placeName reg="Bedford, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002144">Bedford</placeName> companies before my arrival, part of them in connection with public efforts of ministers in the other regiments and partly through the <name>Divine</name> blessing upon the labors of lay brethren of the regiment, among whom, especially in <orgName type="company" n="Company H">Company H</orgName> (to which my son belonged), there were some excellent, working <name>Christian</name> men. I have always thought that, looking at matters <quote> humanly,</quote> it is probable that we should, at that time, have had a great apparent religious development in the <num value="34" type="ordinal">Thirty-fourth</num> except that a great awakening had already manifested itself in <num value="2">two</num> of the regiments (<num value="26" type="ordinal">Twenty-sixth</num> and <num value="46" type="ordinal">Forty-sixth</num>), whose camps were close by&mdash;that of the <num value="46" type="ordinal">Forty-sixth</num> within a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure>; and the men of the <num value="34" type="ordinal">Thirty-fourth</num> had, many of them, been attending the services held, day and night, in those neighboring camps, and had become interested in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7049"/>The faithful and excellent chaplains of the <num value="26" type="ordinal">Twenty-sixth</num> and <num value="46" type="ordinal">Forty-sixth</num>, <persName><roleName n="Brother">Brothers</roleName> <foreName>Wiatt</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Miller,Brother,W.,G.,," id="n0163.0014.00487.02305" reg="expanded:Miller,W.,Gaines,,"><roleName n="Brother"></roleName><foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <surname>Miller</surname></persName>, can give you a full history of the work in those regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7050"/>But I may say that it was powerful, and, in the <num value="26" type="ordinal">Twenty-sixth</num> especially, enduring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7051"/>I suppose that few, if any, regiments in all the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> were more thoroughly pervaded by the influence of religion during the middle and latter periods of the war, than the <num value="2">two</num> just mentioned; and a good deal of the same state of things existed, at the same time, in the <num value="34" type="ordinal">Thirty-fourth</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7052"/>The <num value="59" type="ordinal">Fifty-ninth</num>, which, with some artillery and a company or <num value="2">two</num> of cavalry, generally detached, filled up the brigade, did not have a chaplain, while I visited the brigade, till the latter part of the war, when they were served by <persName n="Wharton,Reverend,Lyman,,," id="n0163.0014.00487.02306" reg="default:Wharton,Lyman,,,"><roleName n="Reverend">Rev.</roleName> <foreName>Lyman</foreName> <surname>Wharton</surname></persName>, of Liberty, <placeName reg="Bedford, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2002144">Bedford county</placeName>, of the <orgName n="Episcopal Church" type="church">Episcopal Church</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7053"/>I shall never forget those bright days and brilliant moonlight nights at <placeName reg="Chapin's Farm">Chapin's Farm</placeName>, the delicious cool water of the camp wells, the full gatherings in the regimental chapel and the sounds of prayer and praise ascending from our encampment, mingling sometimes with similar sounds from those in the vicinity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7054"/>Not being able, for reasons already adverted to, to contribute much of actual detailed history, I will give you the general results of my observations on the religious state of the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName>, especially within the last <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of the war. You, as a more interior man, so to speak, saw some things better than I could do. But it may be of some interest and value to know the impressions, some of them very strong, of <num value="1">one</num> who was a frequent visitor to the army and was in constant intercourse, for years, with our soldiers, on the points following.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7055"/>I shall not, perhaps, follow the order of them very rigidly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7056"/><num value="1">1</num>. <hi rend="italics">The comparative state of different parts of the army</hi>, as respects religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7057"/>It struck me everywhere, in my extensive intercourse and observation, that the morality and religious feeling of the soldiers belonging to bodies detached and scattered, in greater or less numbers together, over the country, was much below that of those in more regular service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7058"/>This was owing, I suppose, to the greater laxity of discipline and exposure to temptation as well as the want of ministerial labor and culture, and the absence, in a great degree, of any public sentiment, even such as we may suppose to have existed in the army, to restrain them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7059"/>I thought I distinctly saw a great difference also between those parts of the army that enjoyed the labors of chaplains and other means of religious culture and those that did not; indeed the difference struck me as exceedingly great and palpable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7060"/>And these facts, as I suppose, account for the conflicting statements made by persons who visited or belonged to different parts of the army, during the war, as to its moral and spiritual condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7061"/>The facts themselves, owing, I suppose, to the causes just indicated, were in exceeding contrast.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7062"/><num value="2">2</num>. <hi rend="italics">The attendance on preaching and religions services</hi>. This varied in different regiments and parts of the army, according, I suppose, to the prevalent degree of interest in religion, perhaps a good deal according to the amount of faithful labor <pb id="p.488" n="488"/> employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7063"/>And it seemed to me that there were generally, if not always, some careless ones who could not be drawn from their tents to the chapel or place of concourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7064"/>But, instituting the comparison, I would think, from my observation, that the attendance in camp, on religious services, was proportionally much larger than in our communities at home, taking our population of all classes who are of sufficient age and have somewhat of ability to attend church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7065"/>Perhaps, however, the greater convenience of attendance, with the want of employment when <quote>off duty,</quote> had something to do with this state of facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7066"/>Nevertheless it afforded the greater opportunity, to chaplains and ministers, for reaching the masses of the soldiery by the preached word.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7067"/>Some of the largest congregations I ever saw in attendance on religious services were in our camps during the war.--I shall never forget a Sabbath night that I spent in the spring of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, in the then war-battered town of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7068"/>The feeling of the great revival there was still up, and the soldiers, beginning at an early hour to crowd in, by nightfall filled the spacious <orgName n="Episcopal Church" type="church">Episcopal church</orgName> edifice, then used for these convocations, lower floor, galleries, presenting, on a grand scale, the unique spectacle, seen only in camp, of a great religious assembly composed only of males.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7069"/>And when the singing began, what a volume of solemn sound swelled up from the voices of that mighty throng!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7070"/>And when the call was made to prayer, how devoutly did the bodies of those men of war and battle bow before Jehovah, a whole congregation literally <quote> kneeling before the <rs>Lord</rs>,</quote> and setting an example well worthy of imitation among us, here at home!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7071"/>After the sermon, a number came forward, some desiring prayer, as awakened persons, others to be admitted to church-fellowship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7072"/><persName><roleName n="Brother">Brother</roleName> <foreName>Owen</foreName></persName>, whom I learned to admire and love almost as soon as I saw him, and his fellow-laborers there, must have reaped, in those early months of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, a glorious harvest indeed!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7073"/>But I remember now, with even more interest, so strongly has it been photographed in my memory by events and scenes soon following, the congregation and service, on the morning of that same Sabbath, at <placeName><persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0163.0014.00488.02307" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,T.,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>'s Headquarters</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7074"/>You probably have visited and remember that last camping-place of his, near <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Hamilton's Crossing</placeName>, where the tents of the general and his staff were pitched in a little valley, between a small stream which ran through it and a wooded ridge which girt the vale on the west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7075"/>On the slope of this ridge, behind the tents, an area had been formed, in the woods, for a place of religious assemblage, by felling the trees and arranging them for seats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7076"/>Even an hour before the time for service those seats began to be occupied, and before the service commenced many were standing around in addition to those who could find a place to sit. It was a grand opportunity for tract distribution; and <persName><roleName n="Brother">Brother</roleName> <foreName>Lacy</foreName></persName> and myself carried forth a large basketful, which were soon disposed of, as well as some Testaments, in the most rapid manner, and almost without our going into the congregation; you know how; for I have no doubt you have sometimes seen how they would rise and come and help themselves and their comrades, on such occasions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7077"/>Yes! I shall never forget that Sabbath assemblage, at those Headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7078"/><persName n="Lacy,Mister,,,," id="n0163.0014.00488.02308" reg="nearbymention:Lacy,B.,T.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lacy</surname></persName> supposed a <num value="1000">thousand</num> to be present, and I should have judged the number to be not less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7079"/>It was <num value="1">one</num> of the most brilliant and noble assemblies of military men ever brought together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7080"/>Beside <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0163.0014.00488.02309" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Mary,Custis,,"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> and <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0163.0014.00488.02310" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,T.,J.,,"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, I remember that <persName n="Early,,,,," id="n0163.0014.00488.02311" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><surname>Early</surname></persName> and <persName n="Kershaw,,,,," id="n0163.0014.00488.02312" reg="mostcommon:Kershaw,J.,B.,,:2"><surname>Kershaw</surname></persName> were there, and a host of officers of various rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7081"/>And then, those masses of men that filled the rude seats and formed the dark margin of those who stood around; they were some of the very <hi rend="italics">elite</hi> of <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s Corps and of the very flower of our <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7082"/>All over the area, till the services opened, the men were seen intently reading the books and tracts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7083"/><persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0163.0014.00488.02313" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,T.,J.,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> took his seat between <num value="2">two</num> of the tents, in a position where few could see him. <persName n="Lacy,Mister,,,," id="n0163.0014.00488.02314" reg="nearbymention:Lacy,B.,T.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lacy</surname></persName> preached a solemn and powerful sermon, from the case of the rich man and <persName n="Lazarus,,,,," id="n0163.0014.00488.02315" reg="mostcommon:Lazarus,nomatch:0"><surname>Lazarus</surname></persName>, making it suggestive of the reversed contrasts of this world and the next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7084"/><pb id="p.489" n="489"/> It was the last Sabbath in <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, and the day was bright and propitious, except that a breeze was stirring, which created some difficulty to the speaker; but <persName><roleName n="Brother">Brother</roleName> <foreName>Lacy</foreName></persName> was able, by the power of his full and strong voice, to overcome this; and he seemed to be listened to with profound attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7085"/>That was the last, the very last Sabbath that <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0163.0014.00489.02316" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,T.,J.,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> ever attended a public service, for it was the <num value="1">one</num> that opened the week of the <rs>Chancellorsville</rs> fights, and the next <num value="1">one</num> found him torn with the cruel wounds that brought on his death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7086"/>And often, since that time, have I thought, how many of the brave fellows whom I saw there, that day, reading and listening, were reading and hearing the messages of heaven for the very last time!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7087"/>I parted with <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0163.0014.00489.02317" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,T.,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> at his tent on the next day, and in the act of parting he was led by the conversation to express himself, in regard to the great struggle in which the country was then engaged, in a manner that was very impressive and interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7088"/>But it has become even more so in the connection of those words with events immediately following and in the light of events now transpiring around us. I communicated the conversation, after his death, to some of the public prints, and do not now repeat it to you because I do not know that it could answer any purpose for your book.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7089"/>But, returning to my proper topic, I saw a yet larger, grander concourse of soldiers at a religious service, in <orgName n="army"><persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n0163.0014.00489.02318" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, while it was encamped in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Middle</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, near <placeName key="tgn,2101476" n="1.000 6" reg="shelbyville, bedford, tennessee">Shelbyville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7091"/>The congregation formed a vast circle, filling up with a dense mass a large opening in the woods, many seated on the logs arranged for the purpose, but many standing and forming the outer circumference, and a few, Zaccheus-like, clambering up and seating themselves in the trees to see and hear.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7092"/>I have permitted myself, under the impulse of feelings awakened by the recurrence of my memory to those scenes gone by, to enlarge in a degree that I had not expected and hardly consistent with method.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7093"/>If I were preparing this for the press I should detach a good deal of what I have put under this head and print it separately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7094"/>But, writing to you privately, I have indulged myself somewhat, in writing along as I have done and following my feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7095"/>And now, next, as to</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7096"/><num value="3">3</num>. <hi rend="italics">Good order and attention</hi>, in the attendance on religious services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7097"/>This, so far as my observation extended, was, with scarce an exception that I remember, most exemplary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7098"/>I hardly ever saw the idle hanging about outside the building or in the outskirts of the out-door congregations which infests so many of our places of worship at home, and very seldom saw any running in and out or any of the whispering and smiling which are likewise too common among us. And no man who has ever preached to our soldiers, under tolerably favorable circumstances, will fail to say that he seldom ever preached to more attentive hearers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7099"/>And here I may speak of what I observed as to the estimation in which faithful chaplains and ministers were held by the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7100"/>True, it was not every chaplain that was held in such esteem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7101"/>Indeed, it seemed to me that our soldiers were, as a general thing, remarkably correct in their discrimination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7102"/>They used sometimes to say to me, <quote> We don't like <rs type="role">Mr.</rs>&mdash;&mdash;; he smokes his pipe and enjoys himself with the officers, preaches sometimes and hardly ever comes among us.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7103"/>And very often I had the pleasure of hearing <num value="1">one</num> and another of them say, <quote> Our chaplain, sir?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7104"/>ah! he is a good man; he often comes round to see us, is always at work and has done a great deal of good; we all like him.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7105"/>I wish, in fact, that ministers at home were generally held in as good estimation, <quote> for their work's sake,</quote> as they were&mdash;those at all of the right stamp&mdash;on the part of the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7106"/>I can testify for myself that I have never, anywhere, as a general thing, been treated with such consideration, on account of my office as a minister, as among the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldiers; and I shall ever remember the <quote>pleasant times </quote> that I had among them Next, as to <pb id="p.490" n="490"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7107"/><num value="4">4</num> <hi rend="italics">The acceptability and value of religious books and tracts</hi> among the soldiers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7108"/>I think I can safely say that I have never seen anything like it in our home communities; and I suppose all chaplains and distributers will render the same testimony, without hesitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7109"/>Never, in my view, was there such an opening for evangelism by the press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7110"/>The word of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in the form of a pocket-Bible or Testament, was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing sought after, and the hymn-book came next; but it was generally necessary&mdash;this was my experience at least&mdash;only to show <num value="1">one</num>'s self, with a packet of tracts or religious papers, in the corner of an encampment and begin to give out some of them, and you would be very soon surrounded by an eager crowd, asking for something to read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7111"/>And as on these and other occasions, a soldier would frequently ask not only for himself, but for some of his mess or of his other comrades; the novel spectacle was sometimes presented of even unconverted men, in camp, acting the part of distributers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7112"/>And, so far as I could see, the matter did not stop with merely receiving the books and tracts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7113"/>They were generally read, and very promptly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7114"/>Whether this ready reception and perusal of printed religious matter was due in any great measure or not to the isolation of men in camp and their want of something to occupy their minds, such was the state of facts; and it afforded a great advantage in operating for their spiritual benefit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7115"/>In many cases, as you probably know, the soldiers sent home tracts that pleased them, while, on the other hand, as I know, such publications were in many instances the missives of <name>Christian</name> love and solicitude from those at home to the sons, brothers and husbands in camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7116"/>You are also, no doubt, acquainted with the fact that soldiers sometimes learned to read, and even to write, while in the army; and I actually knew of more than <num value="1">one</num> case in which a soldier acquired the ability to correspond with his wife or other friends at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7117"/>In the hospitals this work of education was quite considerably carried on. The demand there was great for spelling-books, etc., and my wife at <num value="1">one</num> time prepared a little primer for soldiers (which it was designed to enlarge in another edition), at the request of the <name>Evangelical</name> <orgName n="Tract Society" type="society">Tract Society</orgName>; and I was informed by our secretary, <persName n="Miller,Mister,,,," id="n0163.0014.00490.02321" reg="nearbymention:Miller,W.,G.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Miller</surname></persName>, that there was a large call for it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7118"/>After saying what I have done under these heads, I would declare my own general experience as to what I may call the susceptibility of our soldiers to religious effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7119"/>I have never found any class of men so approachable on the subject of their salvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7120"/>I could talk with them about it almost anywhere; often did so on the cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7121"/>And here I found <num value="1">one</num> of the admirable uses of religious tracts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7122"/>A tract almost always afforded an easy way of introducing religious conversation, whilst it also answered the purpose of <quote> clinching the nail </quote> of what was spoken.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7123"/>A word as to</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7124"/><num value="5">5</num>. <hi rend="italics">The character of the piety prevalent in the army</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7125"/>For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year or so, as a general thing, the transition to camp-life seemed to throw a baleful influence over the morality and the religious character of young men going to the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7126"/>But a happy change seemed to take place afterward, owing, perhaps, in a good measure, to the fact that religious effort for our soldiers was so extended and systematized in the after years of the war. But I have always been disposed to think that the character of the chaplaincy improved, after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year or so; did it not?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7127"/>And I have supposed this to be owing to the fact that some men went into the army as chaplains, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, under the influence more or less, of the war spirit or other secular motives, who, in time, dropped off. The army lost some excellent ministers by ill health and other causes; but it <quote> sloughed off</quote> a number of unfit ones after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> enthusiasm of things had worn off; and I suppose that most of those who remained or came in afterwards were men who had their eyes open to the rough realities of the soldier-minister's life and acted under true motives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7128"/>For my own part, I am free to say that, with the exception of the <pb id="p.491" n="491"/> foreign missionaries that I have had acquaintance with, I have known no such body of faithful, devoted servants of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> as the chaplains, in general, of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7129"/>And, as to the prevalent tone of piety, among the soldiers converted in the army or otherwise professing religion, I think it was certainly higher than, as a general thing, it was at home at that time; and I am inclined to believe that it was higher than it is in most of our Churches and communities at home at any time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7130"/>Almost everybody joined in the psalmody of the camp-services, and the novel example was often to be seen there of fine congregational singing, where most of the parts were well supported, without a female voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7131"/>The devoutness of attitude and manner I have already spoken of, and the attention to the preached word.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7132"/>And as it seemed to me, so too it seemed to strike almost every minister and Christian that went to camp, that there was a somewhat peculiarly earnest, hearty character about the piety of the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7133"/>And I have really feared that our <name>Christian</name> young men from the army would lose something of the warmth and life of their piety in coming home to some of our churches.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7134"/>In this connection I would say that, with a very few exceptions, those who professed conversion in the army, within my acquaintance, have stood well, most of them very well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7135"/>Some of them promise to make valuable church-members.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7136"/>I have known of several of the army converts, <num value="1">one</num> of them a distant relative of mine, who have turned their attention to the ministry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7137"/>I have no doubt that the number would have proved to be a good deal larger but for the fact that the war itself so threw back our young men, that survived, in their education, and the destitution of means, on the part of many of them, for carrying on a course of study.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7138"/>On the whole, having, from my relation to it, been familiar with the army, my general impression is, that there has never, in this country, been such a field of evangelistic effort as it presented, and that such effort has never, anywhere among us, produced larger fruits.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7139"/>And never, in my opinion, in all the history of religion on this continent, has any body of ministers had the privilege of doing a more enviable, if I might not say glorious, work than that fulfilled by the faithful chaplains of the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7140"/>How many a poor, brave fellow was cheered in his separation from home and <quote> the loved ones,</quote> or comforted in the languishings of sickness or wounds; how many a <num value="1">one</num> led to <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0163.0014.00491.02322" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, that went to glory from a hospital bed or a gory battlefield, or that has come back to serve <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the <rs type="place">Church</rs>, through the self-denying labors of those servants of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7141"/>If there has been, in our generation, a ministerial work and crown to be coveted, it seems to me it is that of <num value="1">one</num> of our army chaplains who did his work earnestly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7142"/>And so, in more or less degree, of zealous, active <name>Christian</name> men in the army, especially officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7143"/>What a noble work of usefulness did some of them accomplish!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7484"/>For several months the army was in such constant motion that little could be done besides occasional preaching.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7485"/>Soon after the <rs>Fredericksburg</rs> battle, <dateStruct value="-12-13"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="13">13</day></dateStruct>, we went into winterquar-ters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7486"/>I then commenced pastoral work-visiting among the tents, holding prayermeetings, etc. I commenced a sunrise prayer-meeting, which was attended, of course, only by the more earnest of the brethren, who were quite few in number, and kept it up for many weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7487"/>I continued efforts of this kind&mdash;preaching, too, quite often for some <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, without any visible fruits of my labors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7488"/>But about the expiration of this period, I could see serious faces in our little congregations, and we had new attendants at our sunrise meeting, and some who would hardly speak to the chaplain before would now make their way to his tent to inquire what they were to do to be saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7489"/>Oh, you can imagine what overflowings of joy I experienced at these tokens of the <name>Divine</name> presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7490"/>It was almost the <quote><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fruits</quote> of all my feeble efforts in the cause of the <rs>Master</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7491"/>The number of inquirers increasing, I instituted inquiry meetings, which were held at same place as the sunrise meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7492"/>Perhaps I should have stated that this place was a certain tree some <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure> from the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7493"/>We would open the inquiry-meeting with singing and prayer, and while the brethren would keep this up, I would take the anxious out to converse with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7494"/>It was not long before I had the privilege of leading a number of noble young fellows into the water, and among them <num value="1">one</num> who afterwards was head and shoulders above all the others in zeal for the cause, in power for usefulness, and in humble, sincere piety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7495"/>This was <persName n="Stallions,Brother,Timothy,,," id="n0163.0014.00503.02467" reg="default:Stallions,Timothy,,,"><roleName n="Brother">Brother</roleName> <foreName>Timothy</foreName> <surname>Stallions</surname></persName>, who, at his conversion, did not know his letters, though a man of family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7496"/>He commenced to study, and in a few months, notwithstanding the hindrances and disadvantages of a soldier's life, he was able to read the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> quite readily, which he often did in our meetings, adding also frequently pointed and earnest remarks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7497"/>He soon had a name in the whole brigade for courage and piety, which he bore untarnished throughout the war. He is still living, and when I last heard from him was preaching <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> in his same quiet way&mdash;by his devout walk and his fervent exhortations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7498"/>The interest I mentioned above continued almost unabated for some <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="8months" type="date">eight months</measure>. It was a very quiet work, but permanent in its effects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7499"/>Of course, our regular meetings were broken up when the army left winter-quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7500"/>But all through the summer of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct> I had the pleasure of baptizing a few at nearly every place where we remained any length of time, beside testifying to the conversion of others who united with other denominations.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7503"/>When I entered my regiment, and for some time afterward, there was no other chaplain present with the brigade, and I had brigade services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7504"/>This arrangement was continued after the appointment of other chaplains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7509"/>My brigade enjoyed several seasons of respite; that is, they would be relieved from the fatigue and danger of the front line, and would be kept in reserve in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7510"/><num value="1">One</num> of these seasons was protracted more than <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure>, during which time we held from <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="5">five</num> meetings a day. It was a precious season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7511"/>The men were relieved from all duty, even guard-duty and cooking, so that we had nothing to do but hold meetings.

Our prayer and inquiry-meetings were held under a large, sweet-gum tree, about <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> from the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7513"/>We usually had from <num value="50">fifty</num> to <num value="70">seventy</num>five brethren at these, not <num value="1">one</num> of whom refused to lead in prayer, and not a few would interest us with remarks and exhortations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7514"/>The preaching was done in the bivouac (we had no tents except such as the men carried on their backs). The religious interest of the brigade seemed more general than I had ever seen it before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7515"/>I have looked around over the whole camp during preaching, and failed to see a single loiterer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7516"/>Some <num value="40">forty</num> or <num value="50">fifty</num> made profession at this time, and I baptized them, or rather the most of them, in a pond, the only <num value="1">one</num> in the vicinity, where we were exposed to the fire of the enemy; but not <num value="1">one</num> of us was hurt on such occasions, though the bullets whistled most unpleasantly around and in the midst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7703"/>Many <name>Christian</name> soldiers and other good-disposed men told me that I could do no good in preaching to soldiers, but all seemed glad to welcome me among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7704"/>I was acquainted with a large number of the regiment before the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7707"/>The chaplains of the brigade soon returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7721"/>I have stood at that place at night and on Sabbaths and preached, as it seemed to me, to a solid acre of men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7722"/>There were as many evidences of genuine penitence as I ever noticed at home&mdash;yes, more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7723"/>Almost every day there would be a dozen conversions, and there were in the <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure> in the brigade, not less than <num value="500">five hundred</num> who professed conversion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7724"/>Not all of our brigade, for there was a battalion of artillery camped near us, and other brigades, who attended our preaching, many of whom professed religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7725"/>We estimated the conversions then at <num value="550">five hundred and fifty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7729"/>But the army returned from that campaign to <placeName reg="Orange, Orange, Virginia" key="tgn,7014299">Orange</placeName>, went into winter-quarters and spent the winter there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7730"/>Part of this winter I was at home on furlough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7731"/>But prayer-meetings, Bible-classes and preaching were successfully kept up through the winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7732"/>And the revival also, in a less degree, continued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7733"/>The <orgName n="Young Men's Christian Association" type="association">Young Men's Christian Association</orgName> was largely attended, many went to exhorting, and a great many prayed in public, some of whom were greatly gifted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7734"/>A most interesting feature was the large number who would retire after the evening <quote>roll-call</quote> in groups, to pray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7735"/>Walk out from camp at that hour in any direction and you would find them, <num value="2">two</num>, <num value="3">three</num>, half-dozen and a dozen, in a place, all bowed in the dark, earnestly praying for themselves and the conversion of their comrades; they nearly always took some unconverted ones with them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7736"/>Through the awful campaign of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct> there were very limited opportunities to preach to this brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7737"/>It was almost constantly under fire or on the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7739"/>Though I preached to them as often as I could, yet most of my preaching was to other commands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7740"/>I have several times preached when shot and shell were flying over our heads, and also several times I had minnie-balls to strike in my congregation while preaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7741"/>We often had prayer-meetings in the trenches, where <name n="God" type="God">God</name> did greatly bless and comfort our hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7742"/>In the winter-quarters at <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 9" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Petersburg</placeName> there was much faithful preaching, and regular prayer-meetings kept up in this brigade.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7749"/><num value="3">3</num>. The character of the brigade was decidedly moral and religious, compared with what it was before this good work began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7750"/>The worship of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> became a fixed part of the regular duties of the brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7751"/>The religious element was as well defined, as well organized and as constant, as in any congregation to whom I have preached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7752"/>Christians were recognized as such, ministers were respected and kindly treated and loved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7753"/>I have never had a congregation at home that seemed to esteem me more, and certainly I never loved a congregation so much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7754"/>I never was treated disrespectfully by a soldier or officer while I was in the army&mdash;not in <num value="1">one</num> instance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7755"/>They preserved a tender regard for my feelings.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7758"/><num value="4">4</num>. The officers of my regiment, to a man, were respectful to me and to my position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7759"/>They always attended preaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7760"/>There was no exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7761"/>Some of them <pb id="p.512" n="512"/> were good Christians, while all believed that there was no officer in the regiment worth more to it than a good chaplain, and no part of their daily duties of so much importance as that of religious services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7762"/>The men who commanded the regiment for the most part of the time that I was with them, were: <persName n="Forney,Colonel,W.,H.,," id="n0163.0014.00512.02547" reg="default:Forney,W.,H.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Forney</surname></persName>, Episcopalian; <persName n="Shelley,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0163.0014.00512.02548" reg="mostcommon:Shelley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>Shelley</surname></persName>, <name>Methodist</name> inclined; <persName n="Truss,Major,Joseph,,," id="n0163.0014.00512.02549" reg="default:Truss,Joseph,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>Joseph</foreName> <surname>Truss</surname></persName>, <persName n="Baptist,,,,," id="n0163.0014.00512.02550" reg="mostcommon:Baptist,Virginia,,,:1"><surname>Baptist</surname></persName>; <persName n="Brewster,Captain,,,," id="n0163.0014.00512.02551" reg="mostcommon:Brewster,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Brewster</surname></persName>, of seemingly no fixed denominational preference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7763"/>There never was a time that any <num value="1">one</num> of these noble spirits would not do any and every thing that I desired to further the interests of public worship, preaching, prayer-meetings, etc. They did not allow anything that they could control to interfere with our hours of worship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7795"/>When this <name>Christian</name> gentleman entered this prison, a few days after the great <rs n="Battle of Gettysburg" type="battle">battle of Gettysburg</rs>, he found it occupied by about <measure n="2000" type="prisoners">2,000 prisoners</measure>, almost all of whom were officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7796"/>These men had been captured at various points in the <rs>South</rs>, and every Southern State was largely represented; and while it would not be just, probably, to say that there was more impiety manifested by these men than is usually found in such miscellaneous collections, it is nevertheless true that several forms of wickedness, such as profanity, gambling and neglect of the <name>Sabbath</name>, had assumed among them very alarming dimensions; and while there was the greatest need for religious effort, the obstacles in the way of success were so many, and of such a nature, as apparently to render any attempt at a reformation almost hopeless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7797"/>But, though the impediments to be overcome were so many and so great, <name n="God" type="God">God</name> sent us a man bold enough to undertake, and skilful enough to accomplish, the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7798"/>He signalized his presence among us by lifting up at once in the view of all the banner of <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7799"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> he had only a few followers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7800"/>Even many professed disciples of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0163.0014.00513.02561" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> stood aloof from him for awhile, as if doubting to what this movement would come; but he was not discouraged by the day of <quote>small things;</quote> He persevered in the face of most serious obstacles, exerting his influence at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> on single individuals and within the narrow limits of his own prison apartment; then, when his followers had increased in numbers, and he had gained a larger share of the attention of his comrades in bonds, he gradually extended his efforts to other parts of the prison and operated on larger masses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7801"/>By means of Bible-classes and prayer-meetings a healthful reactionary movement was inaugurated, which subsequently developed itself into almost every scheme that could be devised for the good of the prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7802"/>A very large <orgName n="Christian Association" type="association">Christian association</orgName> was organized, under whose superintendence several <measure n="100" type="prisoners">hundred prisoners</measure> were instructed in the truths of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> word, and nightly prayers observed in almost every room of <pb id="p.514" n="514"/> the prison; so that after the lapse of a few months it was no uncommon thing at early twilight to hear ascending from every heart of that <quote>lone isle in <placeName reg="Erie, Erie, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7017542">Erie</placeName>'s great water</quote> sweet songs of praise to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7803"/>The visible fruit of this movement was a complete reformation in the moral character of the prisoners; so that in many parts of the prison a profane word was scarcely ever heard; the <name>Sabbath</name> was observed with the greatest solemnity, about <num value="100">one hundred</num> made a credible profession of faith in <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0163.0014.00514.02562" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, and <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> own children were excited to greater diligence in His service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7804"/>Your correspondent is acquainted with several young men now preparing for the <name>Gospel</name> ministry, with the prospect of distinguished usefulness, whose attention would probably never have been seriously given to that subject but for that movement, and doubtless many more, whom he does not know, have enlisted in the same glorious service under the influence of that awakening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7805"/>In addition to the large number actually converted, many left the prison under the most serious religious impressions, and doubtless many of them have already found, and others will yet find, their way into the kingdom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7806"/>And the chief instrument in this great work was a single individual, who had had few advantages in the way of mental training, and possessed no natural endowments superior to those of the mass of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> people.</q>

<p>I had purposed publishing a roster of the chaplains of the whole army, but find (at the last moment, when it is too late to replace it from other sources) that the roster which I prepared during the war has been lost or mislaid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7808"/>I very much regret this, and will not attempt now to make a roster lest it should be too incomplete to be of much value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10057"/>The soldiers, with but few exceptions, were serious and attentive, but very few seemed inclined to seek religion (fewer than at any meeting which I had attended for a long time, where so many soldiers were present); but it is a noticeable fact that the soldiers who remain in departments where they are less exposed to conflicts with the enemy, are not so much inclined to be religious as those who face the enemy in mortal combat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10583"/><hi rend="italics">Dear Brethren</hi>: Permit an aged minister, a fellow-laborer in the kingdom and patience of <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>, to address a few words of advice to you. It is to be presumed that before you volunteered for the service in which you are now engaged you took time patiently and deliberately to consider the work upon which you were about to enter, soberly and in the fear of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; made up your minds to take the work as that which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> designed you to do; you assumed it with all its responsibility, crosses, sacrifices, and labors; you entered not from any mere patriotic impulse or romantic notions, nor that you might acquiesce in any lost fame or notoriety, but you loved the souls of our soldiers, and you believed that <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, in His providence, indicated the army mission as your allotted providential field of labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10584"/>If you have entered on your work with such feelings, you have consecrated yourself, soul and body, to the accomplishment of this great work to which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the <rs type="place">Church</rs> have set you, and will not be driven from it by any mortifications or difficulties to which it may expose you; these you may expect&mdash;they will be sure to meet you. You will be opposed by the devil, your own wicked hearts, and frequently by ungodly officers, who, instead of setting proper examples before their men, do everything they can, so far as example goes, to corrupt them, and hinder their success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10585"/>By this class of officers you will probably be contemned, and treated with no very great degree of respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10586"/>Make up your account to this, and be not thrown off your balance when it occurs; let it not move you from your great business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10587"/>It may sometimes happen that even when such officers make no open opposition to your religious operations among their men, yet there are a <num value="1000">thousand</num> ways in which they can throw obstacles in your way, and thwart your efforts for the soldier's salvation; nor is this strange, when you reflect that very seldom exhortation and prayer which you deliver is a standing reproof to them, but it is your business to overcome all these difficulties by patient, persevering, and pious efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10588"/>Remember, <name>Christian</name> faith, and meekness, and love, shall triumph over all hindrances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10589"/>But ungodly officers are not the only difficulties which you must encounter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10590"/>Among the soldiers you will find much opposition, secret or open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10591"/>Your patience may be taxed in consequence of the careless recklessness of some of these&mdash;the utter indifference of others&mdash;the professed infidelity of others&mdash;but that all can be overcome by <name>Christian</name> patience and persevering effort; and that it was through many or all these phases of experience that you were brought at last to the cross of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0163.0017.00609.04169" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, don't give up a poor fellow because in these respects his case would seem to be hopeless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10592"/>But while from many, both officers and soldiers, you meet with small encouragement, from a large number of both officers and men you will meet a cordial greeting and cheering encouragement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10593"/>Be thou faithful in the ministry of the word&mdash;preach the truth always, and indorse it with your life, and <name n="God" type="God">God</name> will not let you labor in vain; some seed will fall into good ground, though much of it may seem to have fallen on thorny ground, or by the highway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10594"/>It may be that the circumstances which surround you may offer but few facilities for public preaching, but remember that the pulpit is not the only place where the faithful pastor will preach&mdash;in private, by the wayside, in the tent, in the hospitals by the bedside of the sick or wounded soldier; there especially is your place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10595"/>Be much with the sick, wounded, and dying&mdash;there, while life is ebbing out, when the past is painfully remembered, and the future looms up gloomily before the vision of the dying patriot, when he thinks of home and loved ones there, and feels that his earthly mission is almost ended, then preach <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> to him, talk to him of the cross and pardon, and of heaven, and kneel beside him, and in the language of pleading, earnest faith, commend his departing spirit to the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> who made him, and the exalted Redeemer who died for him, rose again, and ever liveth to intercede for him, and then, when the vital spark is extinct, give him <name>Christian</name> burial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10596"/>Remember. <pb id="p.610" n="610"/> if you would succeed in your work, you must be the <orgName n="Soldiers Friend" type="newspaper">soldier's <hi rend="italics">friend</hi></orgName>&mdash;no affective and repulsive dignity must drive him from you. You must convince him that you are his friend, and that you seek his good; he must <hi rend="italics">feel</hi> that you are his friend, and that he can safely and fully confide in you, and then you may hope to do him good.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10597"/>My dear brethren, do you work with all your heart!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10598"/>Don't you forget that to the souls of the soldiers is your great work, for this you were sent to your present field by <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the <rs type="place">Church</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10599"/>This is work enough to engage all your powers, and when you have done all you will feel that you have done too little, and will then have great cause of humiliation before <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10602"/>Now here is a proper pattern for army missionaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10603"/>If you would do good in the army, let that be your paramount object in all your conduct, and all your plans must be subordinate to this <num value="1">one</num> object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10604"/>I once knew a very respectable clergyman who went into the army as chaplain to a regiment; though full of zeal to go, he stayed but a few months, when he returned to easier work, saying that he believed the army presented the finest field for usefulness with which he was acquainted, but that he could not remain in it without losing his self-respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10605"/>No wonder this man left, and there have been a good many such, who were zealous to go, but they have soon left the field to return to more comfortable quarters; and these have caused the chaplaincy to stink in the nostrils of officers and men, and done great injury to the cause of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10606"/>Dear brethren, do not you follow this example, but do the work of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> faithfully, and leave your good name in His hands. </p><closer><signed><persName n="Andrew,,James,O.,," id="n0163.0017.00610.04171" reg="default:Andrew,James,O.,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>O.</foreName>  <surname>Andrew</surname></persName>.</signed></closer></body></text> </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10646"/>At the annual meeting of the association in <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> last, it was remodelled so as to conform as nearly as possible to the organizations of other benevolent enterprises of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10647"/>The object of the association is to supply the soldiers of our armies with religious literature, from the <rs>Holy Scriptures</rs> down to the simple and unpretending but often powerful little tract.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10648"/>All our own publications, and all we have been able to purchase, are supplied <pb id="p.612" n="612"/> gratuitously to the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10649"/>We allow them to pay for nothing that comes from the shelves of our depositories.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10650"/>We are enabled to pursue this plan by the very liberal donations which have flowed into our treasury from the friends of the enterprise, both in and out of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10651"/>The soldiers themselves have been among our most liberal patrons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10652"/>Even some of the privates in the ranks have sent <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> of their monthly pay to aid in this good work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10653"/>For the sake of convenience in reaching all our widely scattered troops, we have found it necessary to establish centres of operations at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond, Virginia</placeName>; <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon, Georgia</placeName>; and beyond the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, at <placeName reg="Marshall, Harrison, Texas" key="tgn,2105926">Marshall, Texas</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Shreveport, Caddo, Louisiana" key="tgn,7014504">Shreveport, Louisiana</placeName>; it is yet uncertain which place has been selected as the most suitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10654"/>From these points we can easily reach all our armies with such reading matter as our means and the facilities for publishing will enable us to furnish.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10655"/>Connected with these depositories the association has <num value="25">twenty-five</num> ministers and laymen actively engaged in carrying forward our work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10656"/>Besides these, regular agents and colporteurs, there are scores of chaplains and pious laymen in the army who are constantly engaged in circulating religious reading among their comrades in arms.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10657"/>The association has not been without encouragement in its work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10658"/>Hundreds of letters from all portions of our armies assure us that the fruit in this truly inviting field of <name>Christian</name> effort has been abundant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10659"/>As an auxiliary to the preaching of the gospel, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and great instrument in the conversion of men, the <name>Soldiers</name>' Tract Association has striven to do its part of the work of saving our soldiers from the vices of the field and camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10660"/>The powerful and stirring gospel sermon has been followed by the earnest appeals of the hortatory, or the touching story of the narrative tract, and thus under these combined influences many a gallant soldier has been enrolled under the banner of <persName><foreName>Immanuel</foreName></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10661"/>Many persons, judging by the lessons of past history, have learned to regard the camp as the great school of vice, and of almost all other wars this is true, but ours will ever stand as a grand exception on the page of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10662"/>To <num value="1000">thousands</num> it has already become the school of virtue, of salvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10663"/>And, unlikely as it may seem, this war has, amid all its bitter trials, shown to many the path of learning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10664"/>Many men who entered the service without the knowledge of a single letter of the alphabet, have, in a comparatively brief period, learned to read and write.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10665"/>In a recent address from the president of <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Christian</rs> associations in the army, it was stated that, through the faithful labors of the pious members of the association, many soldiers had been taught in regular classes the elementary principles of education, and could read for themselves the word of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and write cheerful letters to their friends at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10666"/>In after years, amid the prosperity of our dear native land, not a few chosen leaders of a free, happy, <name>Christian</name> people may say, <quote> We learned to read while in the army;</quote> and many <num value="1000">thousands</num> will say. <quote>We learned to serve <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in the army.</quote>
