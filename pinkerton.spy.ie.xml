<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>Nearly a score of years have passed since the occurrence of the events related in the following pages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>The <quote>Rebellion,</quote> with its bloody scenes, has ended, and the country is at peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>The grass is waving green and beautiful over many Southern fields that once ran with human blood, as the contending forces met in the deadly encounter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>The birds are carolling sweetly in the air, which then was laden with the clarion notes of the trumpet; the fierce, wild yell of assaulting soldiery; the booming of cannon, and the groans of the wounded and dying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>The merchant, the mechanic, and the husbandman have returned to the pursuits which they followed before the dark clouds of war had overshadowed this fair land, and they shouldered their muskets in defense of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>From the desolation and the ravages of war, the country has emerged into the <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> sunshine of abiding peace, and now, in the evening twilight, the gray-haired veterans gather around their family hearth-stones to repeat the stories of bravery and devotion associated with those trying hours of their country's history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>In the twilight of my days I have been tempted to the recitals which follow, and in relating my experiences as the <rs>Chief</rs> of the <rs>Secret Service</rs> of the <rs>Government</rs> during the <rs>Rebellion</rs>, I have been governed by a desire to acquaint the public with the movements of those brave men who rendered invaluable service to their country, although they never wore a uniform or carried a musket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Working quietly, and frequently under disguises, their assistance to the <rs>Union</rs> commanders was of incalculable advantage, and many acts of courage and daring were performed by these men which, until now, have never been revealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Indeed, as to my own <hi rend="italics">nom-de-plume</hi>, <quote><persName n="Allen,,E.,J.,," id="n0172.0001.00024.00003" reg="default:Allen,E.,J.,,"><foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Allen</surname></persName>,</quote> many of the officers of the army and officials of the <rs>Government</rs>, with whom I was in constant communication, never knew me by any other name, and the majority of them are to this day in ignorance of the fact that <persName n="Allen,,E.,J.,," id="n0172.0001.00024.00004" reg="default:Allen,E.,J.,,"><foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Allen</surname></persName>, late <rs type="role" reg="Chief">Chief</rs> of the <rs>Secret Service</rs>, and <persName n="Pinkerton,,Allan,,," id="n0172.0001.00024.00005" reg="default:Pinkerton,Allan,,,"><foreName>Allan</foreName> <surname>Pinkerton</surname></persName> are <num value="1">one</num> and the same person.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>During the progress of the struggle, and the years <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> which have since elapsed, many of my old acquaintances, who held important positions in the army and in governmental departments, have passed away from earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Some of them falling in the heat of battle, in the courageous discharge of duty, while others, passing through the fiery ordeal, have died amid the comforts and the charms of home.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/><persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0172.0001.00025.00006" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, <persName n="Stanton,,Edwin,M.,," id="n0172.0001.00025.00007" reg="default:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><foreName>Edwin</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName>, <persName n="Seward,,William,H.,," id="n0172.0001.00025.00008" reg="default:Seward,William,H.,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> and <persName n="Chase,,Salmon,P.,," id="n0172.0001.00025.00009" reg="default:Chase,Salmon,P.,,"><foreName>Salmon</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName>, all giants in their day, have departed from the sphere of their usefulness, and have gone to their long home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Soldiers and civilians, generals and privates, with whom I was connected, and their name is legion, have taken up their journey to <quote>that bourne from whence no traveler e'er returns.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>In detailing the various events which follow, I have been careful to offer nothing but that which actually transpired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>I have avoided giving expression to any thoughts or feelings of antagonism to the <rs>South</rs>, because the time for such utterances has passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Indeed, except for the existence of slavery, I always cherished a warm affection for the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>But this institution of human bondage always received my most earnest opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Believing it to be a curse to the <rs>American</rs> nation, and an evidence of barbarism, no efforts of mine were ever <pb id="p.26" n="26"/> spared in behalf of the slave, and to-day I have not a single regret for the course I then pursued.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Many times before the war, when I was associated with those philanthrophic spirits who controlled the so-called <quote><orgName n="Underground Railroad" type="railroad">Underground Railroad</orgName>,</quote> I have assisted in securing safety and freedom for the fugitive slave, no matter at what hour, under what circumstances, or at what cost, the act was to be performed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/><persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0172.0001.00026.00010" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, the white-haired abolitionist of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> fame, was my bosom friend; and more than <num value="1">one</num> dark night has found us working earnestly together in behalf of the fleeing bondman, who was striving for his liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>After his gallant effort at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, and while he was confined in a Virginia prison, my efforts in his behalf were unceasing; and had it not been for the excessive watchfulness of those having him in charge, the pages of American history would never have been stained with a record of his execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>As it is, though his fate may have been in accordance with the decrees of the laws then existing, I can recall with all the old enthusiasm that I then experienced, the thundering effect of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of our brave <quote>boys in blue,</quote> joining in that electric war cry, the refrain of which was: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/></p><l><persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0172.0001.00026.00011" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>'s body lies mouldering in the grave,</l> <l>But his soul goes marching along,</l></quote> <pb id="p.27" n="27"/> while they hurried in solid phalanx to meet the enemy upon the field of battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>In the preliminary chapters, I have detailed with accuracy the facts connected with the conspiracy to assassinate <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n0172.0001.00027.00012" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, when he was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> elected to the <name>Presidency</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The part I took in discovering the existence of that plot and the efforts of my men in ferreting out the prime movers of that murderous compact, are told for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in these pages, and the correctness of their relation is undoubted; though in the dark days that followed, the bullet of the assassin removed the martyred <rs>President</rs>, while engaged in the fulfillment of his mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>I cannot repress a sense of pride in the fact, that at the commencement of his glorious career I had averted the blow that was aimed at his honest, manly heart.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>In the events which transpired during the years <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, I took an active part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>From the early days of <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> until after the <rs n="Battle of Antietam" type="battle">battle of Antietam</rs> had been fought and won, I was connected with the military operations of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">In Washington</placeName> I acted under the directions of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretaries of War</rs>, and <persName n="Porter,Colonel,Andrew,,," id="n0172.0001.00027.00013" reg="default:Porter,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Andrew</foreName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName>, the <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">provost-marshal</rs>; and in the field, I was under the immediate direction of <persName n="McClellan,General,George,B.,," id="n0172.0001.00027.00014" reg="default:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>My relations with the various departments were <pb id="p.28" n="28"/> always of the most cordial and confidential character To particularize in this matter is almost impossible; but I cannot refrain from mentioning, in the highest terms of respect and friendship, <persName n="Scott,Colonel,Thomas,A.,," id="n0172.0001.00028.00015" reg="default:Scott,Thomas,A.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>In the early days of the nation's peril, he occupied the position of <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Secretary of War">Assistant Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>In him I always found a warm friend and advocate, and in many emergencies his prompt and intelligent action was most potent in accomplishing good results in that era of confusion, of doubt and hesitation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Of my service with the military department while in active duty, little needs to be said here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>From the time of his commission by <persName n="Dennison,Governor,,,," id="n0172.0001.00028.00016" reg="mostcommon:Dennison,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Dennison</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, to the day when he was relieved, after his splendid victory at <placeName key="tgn,7016218" n="1.000 581" reg="antietam, washington, maryland">Antietam</placeName>, I followed the fortunes of <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0172.0001.00028.00017" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Never doubting his ability or his loyalty-always possessing his confidence and esteem, I am at this time proud and honored in ranking him foremost among my invaluable friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>When secret enemies were endeavoring to prejudice the mind of the <rs>President</rs> against his chosen commander; when wily politicians were seeking to belittle him in the estimation of the people, and when jealous minded officers were ignorantly criticising his plans of campaign, <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0172.0001.00028.00018" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> pursued <pb id="p.29" n="29"/> his course with unflinching courage and with a devotion to his country unsurpassed by any who have succeeded him, and upon whose brows are entwined the laurels of the conqueror.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>His marvelous reorganization of the army, the enthusiasm with which his presence invariably inspired the soldiers under his command, and the grand battles which he fought against enemies in front and in rear, have all passed into history-and to-day the intelligent and unprejudiced reader finds in a calm and dispassionate review of his career, an ample and overwhelming justification of his course as a loyal and capable commander-in-chief.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Self-constituted critics, whose avenues of information were limited and unreliable, have attempted to prove that the force opposed to <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0172.0001.00029.00019" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> was much less than was really the case; and upon this hypothesis have been led into unjust and undeserved censure of the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>From my own experience, I <hi rend="italics">know</hi> to the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>My system of obtaining knowledge upon this point was so thorough and complete, my sources of information were so varied, that there could be no serious mistake in the estimates which I then made and reported to <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0172.0001.00029.00020" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>From every available field the facts were gleaned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>From prisoners of war, contrabands, loyal <pb id="p.30" n="30"/> Southerners, deserters, blockade-runners and from actual observations by trustworthy scouts, my estimates were made, and to-day I affirm as strongly as I then did, that the force opposed to <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0172.0001.00030.00021" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> approximated nearer to <num value="200000">200,000</num> men, than they did to the numerous estimates of irresponsible historians who have placed the strength of the rebel forces at that time below <num value="100000">100,000</num> men. In this connection I must refer also to the valuable assistance rendered both <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0172.0001.00030.00022" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> and myself by that indefatigable Aid-de-camp <persName n="Key,Colonel,,,," id="n0172.0001.00030.00023" reg="mostcommon:Key,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Key</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Though he no longer mingles with the things of earth, the memory of his devotion and his intelligent services to the cause of the <rs>Union</rs> is imperishable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>No truer, braver man ever drew a sword than did this noble and efficient staff officer, now deceased.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Of <persName n="Webster,,Timothy,,," id="n0172.0001.00030.00024" reg="default:Webster,Timothy,,,"><foreName>Timothy</foreName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName>, who so ably assisted me in my various and delicate duties, and whose life was sacrificed for the cause he held so dear, I have only words of warmest commendation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Brave, honest and intelligent, he entered into the contest to perform his whole duty, and right nobly did he fulfill his pledge, No danger was too great, no trust too responsible, no mission too delicate for him to attempt, and though executed as a spy in a Richmond prison, his <pb id="p.31" n="31"/> name shall ever be cherished with honor and friend, ship by those who knew his worth, and who appreciated the unswerving devotion of a loyal heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>No dishonor can ever attach to the memory of a patriot who died in the service of his country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The events narrated have all occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The record is a truthful <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Although not so complete as I could wish, they must serve the purpose for which they are intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>In the disastrous fire which swept over <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></dateStruct>, my records were mainly destroyed, and to this fact must be attributed the failure to more elaborately detail the multitudinous operations of my men. With the able assistance of <persName n="Bangs,Mister,George,H.,," id="n0172.0001.00031.00025" reg="default:Bangs,George,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Bangs</surname></persName>, my efficient <rs n="General Superintendent" type="misc">General Superintendent</rs>, <quote>we did what we could,</quote> and the approbation of our commanding officers attest the efficiency of our efforts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>After leaving the service, the conduct of the war passed into other hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Other men were chosen to the command of the armies, and other sources of information were resorted to. Succeeding battles have been fought, defeats have been sustained, victories have been achieved, and the war is happily ended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The slave is free, and in the enjoyment of the rights of citizenship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The country is at peace, her prosperity is assured, and now that passion and prejudice have <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> died away, and honest judgments are given of the events that have transpired, I leave to the impartial reader, and historian, the question whether the course I pursued, and the <rs>General</rs> whom I loved and faithfully served, are deserving of censure, or are entitled to the praises of a free and enlightened people.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Many years have elapsed since the occurrence of the events which I am about to relate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Years that have been full of mighty import to the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>A bitter, prolonged and bloody war has laid its desolating hands upon a once united country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>For years the roar of cannon and the clash of steel reverberated through the bright valleys and the towering hills of the fruitful <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>In those years when brother arose against his brother, when ties of kindred and association were broken asunder like frail reeds, glorious deeds were wrought and grand results have been accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/><placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> has taught the world a lesson of bravery and endurance ; the shackles <pb id="p.34" n="34"/> have been stricken from the slave; an error of a century has been crushed, and freedom is now no longer an empty name, but a beautiful and enduring realism.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>To-day peace spreads her broad, sheltering arms over a reunited and enlightened nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The roll of the drum and the tramp of armed men are now no longer heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/><name>North</name> and <name>South</name> have again clasped hands in a renewal of friendship and in a perpetuity of union.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>But a short time ago a Republican <rs type="role2">President</rs> elected by but a slight majority of the voters of this great community, left his peaceful home in the <rs>West</rs> and journeyed to the capital of the nation, to take the oath of office and to assume the high duties of a chief magistrate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>As he passed through the towns and cities upon his route a general plaudit of welcome was his greeting, even noted political foes joining in the demonstrations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>His road was arched with banners and his path was strewn with flowers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Everywhere he found an enthusiasm of welcome, a universal prayer for success, and the triumphal train entered the capital amid the ovations of the populace, which reached almost a climax of patriotic and effervescing joy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/><measure n="20years" type="date">Twenty years</measure> ago witnessed a different condition of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The political horizon was dark and obscured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The low mutterings of the storm that was soon to sweep over our country, and to deluge our <pb id="p.35" n="35"/> fair land with fratricidal blood, were distinctly heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Sectional differences were developing into widespread dissensions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Cherished institutions were threatened with dissolution, and political antagonism had aroused a contented people into a frenzy of hate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>On the <dateStruct value="1856-05-22"><day reg="22">twenty-second</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year>1856</year>,</dateStruct> an American Senator was assaulted in the <rs type="place">Senate-house</rs> by a political opponent for daring to give utterance to opinions that were hostile to the slave-holding interests of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Later in the same year a Republican candidate, with professed anti-slavery views, was nominated for the presidency, and although defeated, gave evidence of such political strength that Southern leaders became alarmed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>At this time <persName n="Douglas,the Honorable,Stephen,A.,," id="n0172.0002.00035.00028" reg="default:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">the Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Stephen</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> was a prominent leader of the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>, but through his opposition to what was known as the <rs>Lecompton Bill</rs>, he incurred the displeasure of his political friends of the <rs>South</rs>, who vainly endeavored to enact such legislation as would practically lead to his retirement from the party.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>From what had already been learned, it was feared that their designs were to <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> prevent travel upon the road either by destroying the ferry-boats which then carried the trains across the <placeName reg="West Branch Susquehanna River, Pennsylvania, United States" key="tgn,2758145">Susquehanna river</placeName> at <persName n="Grace,,Havre,,,de" id="n0172.0003.00047.00058" reg="expanded:Grace,Havre,,,"><foreName>Havre</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Grace</surname></persName> or by demolishing the railroad bridges over the <placeName key="tgn,2369630" n="1.000 6" reg="gunpowder river, maryland, united states">Gunpowder river</placeName> and other streams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>This road was the great connecting link between the metropolis of the country and the capital of the nation, and it was of the utmost importance that no interruption should be permitted to the free communication between <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and the great cities of the <name>North</name> and <name>West</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>This letter at once aroused me to a realization of the danger that threatened the country, and I determined to render whatever assistance was in my power towards preventing the successful operation of these ill-advised and dangerous men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>I lost no time, therefore, in making my arrangements, and soon after receiving <persName n="Felton,Mister,,,," id="n0172.0003.00047.00059" reg="nearbymention:Felton,Samuel,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Felton</surname></persName>'s communication, in company with <num value="4">four</num> members of my force was upon the train speeding towards <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Upon arriving in that city, I went directly to the office of <persName n="Felton,Mister,,,," id="n0172.0003.00047.00060" reg="nearbymention:Felton,Samuel,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Felton</surname></persName> and obtained from him all the information he possessed of the movements and designs of the <rs>Maryland</rs> secessionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>I also had a consultation with <persName n="Kenney,Mister,H.,F.,," id="n0172.0003.00047.00061" reg="default:Kenney,H.,F.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Kenney</surname></persName>, the superintendent of the road, with reference to a plan of operation which I proposed, and which was considered would result in obtaining the information so much to be desired.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>I resolved to locate my men at the various towns along the road, selecting such places where, it was <pb id="p.48" n="48"/> believed, disaffection existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>With a view, therefore of acquiring the facts necessary for an intelligent prosecution of the inquiry, I took passage on <num value="1">one</num> of the trains of the road, intending to see for myself how affairs stood, and to distribute my men in such a manner as to me seemed best.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>At the city of <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Castle, Delaware" key="tgn,7014632">Wilmington, in Delaware</placeName>, I found evidences of a great political excitement, but nothing that indicated a hostile disposition or which led me to believe that any danger was to be apprehended at this place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>Nothing that savored of organization was apparent, and I was therefore compelled to look further for the existence of any antagonism to the railroad or any desire to prevent the running of their trains.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>At <placeName reg="Perryville, Boyle, Kentucky" key="tgn,7017532">Perryville</placeName> I found the same excitable condition of affairs, but nothing of a more aggressive character than at <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>Men indulged in fierce arguments, in which both sides were forcibly represented, but aside from this I discovered no cause for apprehension, and no occasion for active detective work as yet.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>At <persName n="Grace,,Havre,,,de" id="n0172.0003.00048.00062" reg="expanded:Grace,Havre,,,"><foreName>Havre</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Grace</surname></persName>, however, the lines were more clearly drawn and the popular feeling much more bitter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>It was at this point that the boats which carried the trains crossed the <placeName reg="West Branch Susquehanna River, Pennsylvania, United States" key="tgn,2758145">Susquehanna river</placeName>, and where serious damage might be done to the company, should the ferries be destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>I therefore left <num value="1">one</num> man at this place, with instructions to become <pb id="p.49" n="49"/> acquainted with such men as he might, on observation, consider suspicious, and to endeavor to obtain from them, by association, a knowledge of their intentions.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Under the influence of bad men the secession movement had gained many supporters and sympathizers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Loud threats were uttered against the <orgName n="Railroad Company" type="company">railroad company</orgName>, and it was boastfully asserted that <quote>no d-d abolitionist should be allowed to pass through the town alive.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>I have always found it a truism that <quote>a barking dog never bites,</quote> and although I had but little fear that these blatant talkers would perform any dangerous deeds, I considered it best to be fully posted as to their movements, in order to prevent a catastrophe, if possible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>I accordingly directed <persName n="Webster,,Timothy,,," id="n0172.0003.00049.00063" reg="default:Webster,Timothy,,,"><foreName>Timothy</foreName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName>, a daring and discreet man upon my force, to locate himself at this point, and to carefully note everything that transpired which had any relation to attempted violence or a disposition to resort to aggressive measures.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>As I neared the city of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> the opposition to the government and the sympathy with secession was manifestly more intense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>At <placeName reg="Magnolia Springs, Clay, Florida" key="tgn,2020255">Magnolia</placeName>, particularly, I observed a very dangerous feeling, and among men of all classes the general sentiment was in favor of resistance and force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>I took quarters at the <rs type="place">Howard House</rs>, and proceeded to inquire closely and carefully into the political situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>I soon found that the fears of the railroad officials were not wholly without foundation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>The opposition to <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0172.0003.00050.00065" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s inauguration was most violent and bitter, and a few days' sojourn in this city convinced me that great danger was to be apprehended, and that the sentiment of disunion was far more widespread and deeply rooted than I had before imagined.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>The police force of the city was under the control of <persName n="Kane,Marshal,George,P.,," id="n0172.0003.00050.00066" reg="default:Kane,George,P.,,"><roleName n="Marshal">Marshal</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Kane</surname></persName>, and was almost entirely composed of men with disunion proclivities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Their leader was pronouncedly in favor of secession, and by his orders the broadest license was given to disorderly persons and to the dissemination of insurrectionary information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>This individual was subsequently arrested, and, after a brief sojourn in <placeName key="tgn,7018023" n="1.000 10" reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi">Fort McHenry</placeName>, fled in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct> to the more congenial associations of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>I accordingly engaged a building situated on South street, and in a position where I could receive prompt reports from all quarters of the metropolis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/><pb id="p.51" n="51"/> I also sent for an additional force of men, whom I distributed among the people of all grades and conditions of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>The building I had selected was admirably adapted for my purpose, and was so constructed that entrance could be gained to it from all <num value="4">four</num> sides, through alleyways that led in from neighboring streets.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>Day by day, the reports of my men contained many important revelations of the designs of the opposition, and as a matter of additional precaution, I advised <persName n="Felton,Mister,,,," id="n0172.0003.00051.00067" reg="nearbymention:Felton,Samuel,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Felton</surname></persName> to employ a small number of men to guard the various bridges and ferries, who could be warned in time to resist attack should such be made.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>The chief opposition seemed to be to the inauguration of <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0172.0003.00051.00068" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, and the plan of the conspirators was to excite and exasperate the popular feeling against the <rs type="role" reg="President elect">President-elect</rs> to the utmost, and so successfully had this been done that a majority of the wealthier classes, with few exceptions-those in office-and the mob element in general were in full accord in their desire to prevent the inauguration from taking place.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>During the days that intervened between the inauguration of <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n0172.0007.00104.00338" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and the memorable <dateStruct value="1861-04-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> day of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> treason was busy in the <rs>South</rs>, and secession resolved itself into an accomplished fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>At that time I was engaged in the energetic practice of my profession as a detective, which, large as it was, and constantly increasing, required a personal supervision, which absorbed my undivided attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>When, however, it became evident that a conflict was unavoidable, I soon found my services were needed, and putting aside all considerations of a private or business nature, I yielded a ready and cheerful response to the call, and during my connection with what was afterwards known as <pb id="p.105" n="105"/> the secret service of the government, I rendered every assistance that lay in my power to further the cause of union, and to serve the country of my adoption.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>The month of <dateStruct value="1861-04-"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, was an important <num value="1">one</num> in the history of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>Whatever fears and apprehensions had filled the minds of the <rs>Northern</rs> people as to the solution of the great political questions then pending, a resort to arms had, until that time, been regarded as not likely to occur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>A people who had been reared amid the blessings of a long and undisturbed peace, and whose lives, under this benign influence, had been prosperous and happy, they were almost entirely unprepared for a serious contest or a warlike struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>Many times before the political horizon had grown dark and threatening, but the storm had subsided almost instantly, under that wise yielding of obedience to law and to the will of majorities, which it was hoped would now exercise its power for the preservation and continuance of amity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>When, therefore, on the <dateStruct value="-04-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, the attack upon <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> in <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston Harbor</placeName> was made, the <rs>Northern</rs> people were almost startled by surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>Though entirely unprepared for such an event, it was clearly demonstrated to all that war could now no longer be honorably avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>It was now too late to inquire into original causes of the contest; it remained only for the loyal heart to resent the insult to a nation's flag, and to sustain the government in upholding its constitution <pb id="p.106" n="106"/> and in enforcing its laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>This act fired the patriotic heart and solidified the patriotic ranks, and, with the crumbling of the walls upon <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, were shattered all the hopes previously entertained of a peaceful solution of the problems which were then before the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>I have very little doubt that the assault upon <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> was ordered by the rebel government, under the fallacious hope and groundless belief that it would not provoke immediate or wide-spread civil war. The Southern leaders were well aware of the fact that the frontier could not be entirely stripped of regulars, and assuming, or pretending to, that the existing laws contained no provision authorizing a call of the militia, they inferred that it would be difficult for the new administration to obtain at once legislation of a coercive character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>Then, too, they relied, in a great measure, upon a friendly feeling toward the <rs>South</rs> from their late political associates in the <rs>North</rs>; but in this their reckoning was at fault, and the roar of <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0172.0007.00106.00339" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>'s guns in <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston Harbor</placeName> cleared up the political horizon as if by magic.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/><num value="7">Seven</num> disloyal States, with all their machinery of a separate government, stood behind those batteries, and the cool deliberation of the assault gave evidence of plan, of purpose and of confidence.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>The effect of this proclamation upon the people of the <rs>North</rs> was almost electrical, and the heart of the whole nation throbbed with its patriotic emotions as that of a single individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>The general sentiment appeared to be in entire accord with the utterance of <persName n="Douglas,,Stephen,A.,," id="n0172.0007.00107.00341" reg="default:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><foreName>Stephen</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, a live-long Democrat, that <quote>every man must be for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, or against it; there can be no neutrals in this war-only patriots and traitors.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>More than double the number of men that were required tendered their services, and before the lapse of <measure n="48hours" type="date">forty-eight hours</measure> armed companies and regiments of volunteers were in motion toward the expected border of conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>Nor was there exhibited that division of Northern sentiment that had been so boastfully predicted by the <rs>Southern</rs> leaders, and all men, of every belief, Democrats and Republicans, <pb id="p.108" n="108"/> Conservatives and Radicals, natives and foreigners, from <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName> to <placeName reg="Oregon" key="tgn,7007708">Oregon</placeName>, responded to the call, and came to the defense of the constitution, the government and the <rs>Union</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>Here, as elsewhere, conspiracy had been at work for months, and many of the prominent political leaders were in full accord with the rebel government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>The legislature was believed to be unreliable, and treason had obtained so firm a foothold in the populous city of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, that a secret recruiting office was sending enlisted men to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>The venomous germ of treason, once planted, grew in magnitude and virulence, until it finally culminated in the infamous riot of <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> g9th, when the blood of the citizen soldiery of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shed in defense of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>A spirit of opposition to the passage of Northern troops through the city, on their way to the seat of government, had been engendered among the <quote>rough</quote> element of <placeName key="tgn,7013352" n="1.000 12" reg="baltimore, baltimore independent city, maryland">Baltimore</placeName>, and the excitement reached its climax upon the arrival of the <orgName type="regiment" key="6MARegiment">Sixth Massachusetts Regiment</orgName>, which was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to answer the call for troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>When their presence became known the traitorous element could no longer be restrained, and while the men were passing quietly <pb id="p.109" n="109"/> through the city, on their way from <num value="1">one</num> railroad station to another, they were murderously attacked by a reckless, howling mob, which resulted in bloodshed and carnage, and some of the most fiendish outrages were perpetrated that ever blackened a page of American history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>The crowning act of disloyalty, and <num value="1">one</num> which threatened the most serious consequences to the government, was committed about midnight of the same day.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>Before daylight the following morning, the bridges at <placeName key="tgn,2505507" n="1.000 10" reg="Melvale, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland">Melvale</placeName>, <placeName reg="Relay House">Relay House</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2046681" n="1.000 8" reg="cockeysville, baltimore, maryland">Cockeysville</placeName>, on the <placeName reg="Harrisburg, Dauphin, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013694">Harrisburg</placeName> road and over the <placeName reg="Bush River, Newberry, South Carolina" key="tgn,2210412">Bush</placeName> and <placeName reg="Gunpowder River, Maryland, United States" key="tgn,2369630">Gunpowder rivers</placeName> and <placeName key="possibilities=84" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Harris Creek</placeName>, were completely destroyed by fire, thus effectually severing railroad communication with the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>The telegraph wires leading to and from the capital were also cut, completely shutting off <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and the government from the loyal Northern States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>These acts, committed by the orders of the very men who that morning had risked their lives in defending the soldiers of the <rs>Union</rs>, are sufficient to show the rapid and over-mastering influence of revolutionary madness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>Of course, the news of these outrages spread far and wide over the country, and while they aroused <pb id="p.110" n="110"/> universal indignation, they nevertheless were the occasion of grave fears for the safety of the capital.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>It was on the <dateStruct value="-04-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> after the occurrence of these events that my services were required.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>I at once accepted the duty, and selected a man for its performance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>Experience proved that I was not mistaken in my selection, and as the messenger chosen for this duty is to bear an important part in the event, which I am about to relate, a description of him will at once acquaint the reader with his personal appearance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>He was a tall, broad-shouldered, good-looking man of about <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> of age.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>There was such a decided mixture of sternness and amiability, of innate force and gentle feelings, of frankness and resolution stamped upon his features, <pb id="p.111" n="111"/> that he instinctively impressed the beholder at a glance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>The deep gray eyes could twinkle and sparkle with good humor, or they would grow dark and menacing, and seem to flash under the influence of anger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>The mouth, almost concealed by the heavy brown mustaches which he wore, and the square, firm chin evinced a firmness that was unmistakable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>His nose, large and well-formed, and the prominent cheek bones all seemed in perfect harmony with the bold spirit which leaped from the eyes, and the strong will that lurked about the set lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>In figure, he was rather stout, but his shoulders were so broad, his feet and hands so shapely, and the lithe limbs so well formed, that he did not appear of as full habit as he really was. A casual observer on meeting this man would almost immediately and insensibly be impressed with the conviction that he was a man who could be trusted; that any duty devolving upon him would be sacredly kept; and as he stood before me on this sunny afternoon in <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, I felt that I could implicitly rely upon him in any emergency in which he might be placed, and to perform any service for which he might be selected.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>Though not a man of great enlightenment, he was gifted with a large amount of natural shrewdness, which enabled him to successfully meet any emergency which might arise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>From his association with people in the various walks of life, he had acquired that habit of easy adaptation which made him appear, and feel, perfectly at home in almost any society, whether in the drawing-room or the tavern, in the marts of trade, or laboring at the plow.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>The people were in a feverish state of excitement, the drinking saloons and the corridors of the hotels were filled with crowds of excited men, each of whom seemed to vie with the other in giving loud expressions of their opinions, and of denouncing the attempt of the government to transport armed troops through the streets of a peaceful city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>Ever mindful of the important duty devolving upon him, <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0172.0008.00124.00395" reg="nearbymention:Webster,Timothy,,,"><surname>Webster</surname></persName> wisely forebore to engage in any conversation with those whom he met, and among the number of the most outspoken of the <rs>Southern</rs> sympathizers were many whom he had previously met, and to whom he was known as an adherent of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>At an early hour he and his newly found companion returned to their hotel, and shortly afterward retired for the night.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>Arising early on the following morning, they found the same difficulty was to be encountered that had been successfully overcome at the commencement of their journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>The railroads between <placeName key="tgn,7013352" n="1.000 12" reg="baltimore, baltimore independent city, maryland">Baltimore</placeName> <pb id="p.125" n="125"/> and <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> had also been torn up, so as to render the running of the trains an impossibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>This fact necessitated the procuring of a team that would convey them to the capital; but this time <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0172.0008.00125.00396" reg="nearbymention:Webster,Timothy,,,"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>'s acquaintance with the proprietors of the hotel, and several of the permanent guests of the house, enabled them without difficulty or delay to secure a pair of horses and a road wagon, with a trusty driver, who guaranteed to carry them to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> for the same amount which had been paid upon the other portion of their journey, and at an early hour they were upon the road to the seat of government.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>Meantime <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0172.0008.00125.00397" reg="nearbymention:Webster,Timothy,,,"><surname>Webster</surname></persName> had been seriously considering his course of action with regard to his fellow-passenger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>That he was an agent of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> he had already admitted, and that he was the bearer of dispatches to prominent sympathizers with the <rs>South</rs> who were now living in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, was also well known to the detective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>How, therefore, to arrange his plans, so that these papers would be intercepted and the ambassador detained without arousing his suspicion?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>It must be accomplished so that no delay should result to his own journey, as he had resolved that his dispatches must be delivered that day. Just before starting out an idea occurred to him, and requesting the driver to wait a few minutes, as he had forgotten something in his room, he re-entered the hotel, and going to the room they had occupied the <pb id="p.126" n="126"/> evening before, he hurriedly wrote a note which he folded up and placed in his pocket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>The note was as follows :

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>He then descended the stairs, and entering the wagon, they were driven away towards <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>The day was exceedingly warm, and the horses, unused to long journeys, early began to show signs of weakness, but they kept on without incident, save an occasional question from a passer-by as to their destination, and about noon arrived at a hotel known as the <quote><measure n="12mile" type="distance">Twelve-mile</measure> House,</quote> so called from its being located at that distance from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>Fortunately, however, the officer did not appear to recognize him, and during the progress of the dinner <rs>Webster</rs> kept his face hidden as much as possible from his new-found friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>Cordial greetings were interchanged, and in a few minutes <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0172.0008.00127.00400" reg="nearbymention:Webster,Timothy,,,"><surname>Webster</surname></persName> had detailed to his friend the circumstances attending his meeting with the so-called <name>British</name> messenger, and his suspicions concerning them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>By this time they had become thoroughly acquainted, and they enlivened their drive with many a pleasing anecdote of experience or of invention, until they came in sight of <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington city</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>Here a difficulty awaited them, apparently unexpected by both travelers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>A Lieutenant at the head of <num value="8">eight</num> men emerged from a house by the wayside, and in a voice of authority directed the driver to stop his horses, after which he advanced to the vehicle and saluted the occupants with the utmost courtesy, saying: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>The conversation soon became general, and the most extravagant ideas were expressed with regard to the wonderful achievements that were expected of the <rs>Southern</rs> soldiers, and no doubt was entertained that the <rs>Yankees</rs>, as they called the <rs>Northern</rs> men, would be quickly vanquished by the chivalrous armies of the <quote>Sunny South.</quote></p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>Arriving at the capital I found a condition of affairs at once peculiar and embarrassing, and the city contained a strange admixture of humanity, both patriotic and dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>Here were gathered the rulers of the nation and those who were seeking its destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>The streets were filled with soldiers, armed and eager for the fray; officers and orderlies were seen galloping from place to place; the tramp of armed men was heard on every side, and strains of martial music filled the air.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/><pb id="p.138" n="138"/> Men who formerly occupied places of dignity, power and trust were now regarded as objects of suspicion, whose loyalty was impeached and whose actions it was necessary to watch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>Aristocratic ladies, who had previously opened the doors of their luxurious residences to those high in office and who had hospitably entertained the dignitaries of the land, were now believed to be in sympathy with the attempt to overthrow the country, and engaged in clandestine correspondence with Southern leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>The criminal classes poured in from all quarters, and almost every avenue of society was penetrated by these lawless and unscrupulous hordes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>An adequate idea can be formed of the transformation which had been effected within a few short weeks in this city of national government.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>On the day following my arrival I wended my way to the <placeName key="tgn,7014664;tgn,2115169;tgn,2115031;tgn,2113715;tgn,2110221" n="0.074 000000.3682	placename;tgn,7014664;Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia,New Kent,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.074 000000.3682	placename;tgn,2115169;Yorktown, York, Virginia,York,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.074 000000.3682	placename;tgn,2115031;White House, Mecklenburg, Virginia,Mecklenburg,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.074 000000.3682	placename;tgn,2113715;Port Republic, Rockingham, Virginia,Rockingham,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.074 000000.3682	placename;tgn,2110221;Aarons Creek, Halifax, Virginia,Halifax,Virginia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia,New Kent,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;Yorktown, York, Virginia,York,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;White House, Mecklenburg, Virginia,Mecklenburg,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;Port Republic, Rockingham, Virginia,Rockingham,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;Aarons Creek, Halifax, Virginia,Halifax,Virginia,United States,North and Central America">White House</placeName> and sought an interview with the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>Around the executive mansion everything was in a state of activity and bustle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>Messengers were running frantically hither and thither; officers in uniform were gathered in clusters, engaged in animated discussions of contemplated military operations; department clerks were bustling about, and added to these was a crowd of visitors, all anxious, like myself, to obtain an interview with the <rs>Chief Executive</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>I was not required to wait an unusual length of time, and I was soon ushered into the presence of <pb id="p.139" n="139"/> <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0172.0009.00139.00448" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:5"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, who greeted me cordially and introduced me to the several members of the <rs>Cabinet</rs> who were engaged with him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>As yet, no definite plans had been adopted, and I was requested to detail my views upon the subject, in order that the matter might be intelligently considered, and such action taken as would lead to definite and satisfactory results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>I accordingly stated to them the ideas which I entertained upon the subject, as fully and concisely as I was able to do at the time, and, after I had concluded, I took my departure, with the understanding that I would receive further communications from them in a few days.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>It was very evident to me, however, that in the confusion and excitement which were necessarily incident to the novel and perplexing condition of affairs then existing, that anything approaching to a systematized organization or operation would be for a time impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>The necessity for war had come so suddenly upon a peaceful community that there had been as yet but little time for thorough preparation or system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>The raising of a large army, with all the various contingencies of uniforming, arming <pb id="p.140" n="140"/> and drilling; the furnishing of supplies, and the assigning of quarters, were occupying the attention of the rulers of the government, and I felt confident that I would be required to wait a longer time than I could then conveniently spare from my business, ere I would be favored with any definite instructions from those in authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>This opinion was fully confirmed, after several unsuccessful attempts to obtain satisfying particulars from the heads of several of the departments, and leaving my address with the secretary of the <rs>President</rs>, I returned to <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>From the friendship and esteem I entertained for him growing out of my relations with him in those matters, both as an individual and as an executive officer, I felt the more anxious to enter into his service, now that he had assumed the command of a military department, and was about to take an active part in the impending struggle.</p>

I fully realized the delicacy of this business, and the necessity of conducting it with the greatest care, caution and secrecy.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>Within a few days I also sent out other scouts, singly and in pairs, on .the different routes that had been carefully prepared for them, and in a short time <pb id="p.156" n="156"/> quite a number of my best operatives were engaged upon more or less difficult and dangerous tasks, all tending to the same end.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>In organizing and controlling this secret service, I endeavored to conceal my own individual identity so far as my friends and the public were concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>The new field of usefulness into which I had ventured was designed to be a secret <num value="1">one</num> in every respect, and for obvious reasons I was induced to lay aside the name of <persName n="Pinkerton,,Allan,,," id="n0172.0011.00156.00499" reg="default:Pinkerton,Allan,,,"><foreName>Allan</foreName> <surname>Pinkerton</surname></persName> &mdash; a name so well known that it had grown to be a sort of synonym for detective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>Shrewd, wide-awake, and keen as a bloodhound on the scent, he allowed nothing to escape <pb id="p.158" n="158"/> him, but quietly jotted down every item of intelligence that could possibly be of advantage to the <rs>Union</rs> army, and picked up many important points, which would have escaped the notice of a man of less detective experience and ability.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>He was apparently an enthusiastic and determined rebel, and in a few cunningly-worded sentences he would rouse the stagnant blood of his hearers till it fairly boiled with virtuous indignation against <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName> in general, and <quote><persName n="Linkin,,Abe,,," id="n0172.0011.00158.00512" reg="default:Linkin,Abe,,,"><foreName>Abe</foreName> <surname>Linkin</surname></persName></quote> in particular.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>Naturally, he was of a quiet, reserved disposition, seldom speaking unless spoken to, and never betraying emotion or excitement under any <pb id="p.159" n="159"/> pressure of circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>His face always wore that calm, imperturbable expression denoting a well-balanced mind and a thorough self-control, while the immobile countenance and close-set lips showed that he was naturally as inscrutable as the <rs>Sphinx</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>Many of his associates were of the opinion that he was cold and unfeeling, but <hi rend="italics">I</hi> knew there could be no greater mistake than this; I knew that a manlier, nobler heart never existed than that which beat within the broad breast of <persName n="Webster,,Timothy,,," id="n0172.0011.00159.00514" reg="default:Webster,Timothy,,,"><foreName>Timothy</foreName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName>; and I knew that, reserved and modest as he was, he was never wanting in courtesy, never derelict in his duty, never behind his fellows in acts of kindness and mercy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>It was when he was detailed for such operations as the <num value="1">one</num> in question that his disposition underwent a complete metamorphosis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>Then his reserve vanished, and he became the chatty, entertaining boon companion, the hero of the card-table, the storyteller of the bar-room, or the lion of the social gathering, as the exigencies of the case might require.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>He could go into a strange place and in <num value="1">one</num> day surround himself with warm friends, who would end by telling him all he desired to know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>Assuming an air of quiet unconsciousness, he sauntered past the man without seeming to notice him, and entered the smoking-car, coolly lighted a cigar, drew a Nashville newspaper from his pocket, and settled himself to his reading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1195"/>At this place I found a very decided Union sentiment, the <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName> were floating from the various buildings, and the <rs>Union</rs> men were largely in the majority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1196"/>There was <num value="1">one</num> great cause for disquietude, however, which was very manifest even to a casual observer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1197"/>Many residents of <placeName reg="Bowling Green, Warren, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013447">Bowling Green</placeName> and the vicinity were slave owners, and the impression had become general throughout the negro communities that the opening of the war naturally and inevitably involved their freedom, an opinion, however, without sure foundation, at that time, but which was eventually to be justified by subsequent events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1198"/>The slaves had heard their masters discussing the various questions which naturally grew cut of a conflict of this chance character, and in which it was generally admitted, that emancipation must follow the commencement and continuance of hostilities between the <num value="2">two</num> sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1199"/>It was not surprising therefore, that this opinion should spread among the <pb id="p.187" n="187"/> entire colored element, or that it should be greedily accepted by these down-trodden blacks as the harbinger of a freedom for which they had been praying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1200"/>In conversation with <num value="1">one</num> of the leading men of <placeName reg="Bowling Green, Warren, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013447">Bowling Green</placeName>, I was thoroughly impressed with the importance of this phase of circumstances.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1203"/>Why, sir,</quote> continued he, <quote>we cannot sleep sound at nights for fear of the niggers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1204"/>They think <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0172.0013.00187.00593" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:5"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is going to set them free.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1207"/><quote>You should not talk before your niggers; it is not safe, and I never do it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1208"/>As I never owned a negro this was perfectly true.</p>

<p><quote>It would be a good plan,</quote> said I, anxious to preserve my reputation as a Southern pro-slavery man, <quote>to take all the men and boys over <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure> of age and sell them South.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1212"/><quote>That's the devil of it,</quote> he replied, <quote>we cannot do that; it was tried only last week, and a nigger that I was offered <measure n="1500dollars" type="currency">$1,500</measure> for last year, I could not sell at any price.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1213"/>Already, it seemed, the fruits of the slavery agitation were being made apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1214"/>The very institution for which these misguided men were periling their lives, and sacrificing their fortunes, was threatened with demolition; and the slaves who had so long and so often felt the lash of their masters, were now becoming a source of fear to the very men who had heretofore held them in such utter subjection.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1215"/>This state of affairs I found to be prevalent all over the country which I visited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1216"/>Bright visions of freedom danced before the eyes of the slaves, and they awaited anxiously the dawning of the day, when the coming of the soldiers of the <rs>North</rs> would strike from their limbs the shackles they had worn so long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1217"/>In the after years of this bloody struggle, many deeds of self-sacrifice were performed by these slaves, when, resisting the dazzling opportunities to obtain their coveted liberty, they cast their lot with the families of their old masters, whose male members were fighting to continue their bondage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1218"/>Many cases could be cited where, but for the faithful labors and devotion <pb id="p.189" n="189"/> of the despised slave, the families of many of the proud aristocrats would have starved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1219"/>But the faithful heart of the negro ever beat warmly for those whom he had served so long, and disregarding the tempting allurements of freedom, he devoted himself to the service and to the maintenance of those who had regarded him as so much merchandise, or simply as a beast of burden.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1220"/>At <placeName reg="Bowling Green, Warren, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013447">Bowling Green</placeName> I purchased a splendid bay horse, whose swiftness and powers of endurance I felt assured could be relied upon, intending to make the rest of my journey on horseback.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1221"/>By this means I would be the better able to control my movements than if I were compelled to depend upon the railroads for transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1222"/>I would also be enabled to stop at any place where I might find the necessity, or a favorable opportunity for observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1223"/>I had no cause to regret the purchase I had made, for right nobly did the spirited animal which I had selected perform the arduous duties that were imposed upon him. Day after day he would be urged forward, and under his flying feet the distance sped away almost imperceptibly, and each morning found my charger rested and refreshed, and ready for the day's journey, be the weather fair or foul, or the roads easy or rugged.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1224"/>I reached <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville, Tennessee</placeName>, in due season, and resolved to devote several days to my investigations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1225"/>Here the disunion element was more united and outspoken, <pb id="p.190" n="190"/> but even here, I detected evidences of a Union sentiment which was none the less profound, because of the danger which its utterances would have incurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1226"/>There could be no doubt that this State had resolved to cast her fortunes with the confederacy, and the rebel <persName n="Pillow,General,,,," id="n0172.0013.00190.00595" reg="mostcommon:Pillow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pillow</surname></persName> had been for some time engaged in fortifying the city of <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1227"/>At <placeName key="tgn,2308580" n="1.000 5" reg="east nashville, davidson, tennessee">Nashville</placeName> I met a number of officers of the rebel army, all of whom were full of enthusiasm, and whose bombastic utterances in view of the eventual results, seem at this time almost too absurd to be repeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1228"/>Here also I came in contact with an army surgeon, whose head was full of wild <hi rend="italics">Quixotic</hi> schemes for destroying the <rs>Northern</rs> armies by other processes than that of legitimate warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1229"/><num value="1">One</num> of his plans I remember was to fill a commissary wagon with whisky, in which had been previously mixed a generous quantity of strychnine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1230"/>The wagon was then to be broken and abandoned and left upon the road so as to fall into the hands of the <rs>Union</rs> soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1231"/>Of course, the liquor would be consumed by the finders, and the valiant <rs>Doctor</rs>, with evident satisfaction to himself, but to the equally evident disgust of his companions, loudly vaunted his death-dealing and barbarous scheme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1232"/>This brave warrior, however, I learned afterward, had fled in terror at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fire, and was afterwards dishonorably dismissed from the service he was so well calculated to disgrace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1233"/>So far as I was afterward able to learn, this grand project <pb id="p.191" n="191"/> for wholesale slaughter, of the valorous <rs>Doctor</rs>, received no sympathy or support from his more honorable associates, and the soldiers were enabled to drink their whiskey untainted with any other poisonous influences than is naturally a part of its composition.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1234"/>Leaving <placeName key="tgn,2308580" n="1.000 5" reg="east nashville, davidson, tennessee">Nashville</placeName>, I spurred on in the direction of <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1235"/>and in due time reached the city, which now presented a far different aspect than when I visited it only a few years before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1236"/>Then the country was at peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1237"/>The war cloud had not burst with all its fury over a happy land, and the people were quietly pursuing their avocations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1238"/>I was engaged in a detective operation which required my presence in the city, and had been in consultation with some of the <orgName n="Express Company" type="company">express company's</orgName> officials, for whom I was attempting to discover the perpetrators of a robbery of <num value="1">one</num> of their safes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1239"/>Turning a corner I came upon a scene that stirred my feelings to the utmost.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1240"/>It was the market square, and the merchandise disposed of were human beings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1241"/>There was the auction-block and the slave-pen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1242"/>Men, women and children were being knocked down to the highest bidder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1243"/>Wives were sold away from their husbands, and children from their parents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1244"/>Old and young were submitted to the vulgar speculators in flesh and blood, and their value was approximated by their apparent age, strength and healthfulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1245"/>My blood boiled in my veins as I witnessed, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, <pb id="p.192" n="192"/> the heart-rendering scenes which I had only heard or read of before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1246"/>The cold cruelty of the buyers and abject misery of the sold, filled me with a spirit of opposition to this vile traffic that gave me renewed strength to fulfill my duty as an active abolitionist, and to labor earnestly in the cause of emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1247"/>I shall never forget the events of that day, and I can recall the feeling of intense satisfaction which I experienced on my <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> visit, when even then, I could see the dawning of that liberty for which I had labored, and I knew that the day of emancipation could not be far distant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1248"/>Then the fair fame of independent <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> would no longer be blackened by the pressure of the slave or the master, but all men under the protection of the starry banner would be free and equal under the law.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1249"/>Now the streets were filled with soldiers, some of them fully armed and equipped, and others provided with but ordinary clothing, and furnished with such inefficient arms as they had brought with them from their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1250"/>A most motley gathering they were, and their awkward and irregular evolutions at this time gave but little promise of the splendid army of which they were destined in the near future to form so important a part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1251"/>The work of fortifying the city had been progressing in earnest; earthworks had been thrown up all along the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7022231" n="1.000 1584" reg="mississippi river">Mississippi</placeName>, and batteries were already in position, whose guns frowned threateningly upon the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1252"/><pb id="p.193" n="193"/></p> 
<p>Here to be known or suspected as a Union man was to merit certain death, and to advocate any theory of compromise between the <num value="2">two</num> sections was to be exiled from the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1253"/>Here rebeldom was rampant and defiant, and I had some difficulty in evading the suspicions of the watchful and alert Southron, who regarded all strange civilians with doubtful scrutiny, and whose <orgName n="Safety Committee" type="committee">committee of safety</orgName> were ever on the <hi rend="italics">qui vive</hi> to detect those whose actions savored in the least of a leaning towards the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1254"/>Fearlessly, however, I mingled with these men, and as I lost no opportunity in pronouncing my views upon the righteousness of the cause of secession, and of my belief in its certain triumph, I obtained a ready passport to the favor and confidence of the most prominent of their leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1255"/>I talked unreservedly with the private soldier and the <rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">general officer</rs>, with the merchant and the citizen, and by all was regarded as a stanch Southern man, whose interests and sympathies were wedded to rebellion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1256"/><persName n="Pillow,General,,,," id="n0172.0013.00193.00596" reg="mostcommon:Pillow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pillow</surname></persName> was in command at this point, and almost every citizen was enrolled as a soldier, whose services would be cheerfully and promptly rendered whenever the call should be made upon them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1257"/>Even this redoubtable chieftain was not proof against my blandishments, and he little dreamed when on <num value="1">one</num> occasion he quietly sipped his brandy and water with me, that he was giving valuable information to his sworn foe, and <num value="1">one</num> to whom every <pb id="p.194" n="194"/> idea gained was an advantage to the government he was attempting to destroy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1258"/>It is needless to relate the valuable items of information which I was enabled to glean upon this journey-information which in later days was of vast importance to the <rs>Union</rs> commanders, but which at this time would only burden a narrative of the events which they so ably assisted to successful results.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1259"/>Here, as in many other places, I found that my best source of information was the colored men, who were employed in various capacities of a military nature which entailed hard labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1260"/>The slaves, without reserve, were sent by their masters to perform the manual labor of building earthworks and fortifications, in driving the teams and in transporting cannon and ammunition, and, led by my natural and deep-seated regard for these sable bondsmen, I mingled freely with them, and found them ever ready to answer questions and to furnish me with every fact which I desired to possess.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1261"/>Here and there I found an unassuming white man whose heart was still with the cause of the <rs>Union</rs>, but whose active sympathy could not at this time be of service to the country, as he dared not utter a voice in defense of his opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1262"/>From all these sources, however, I was successful in posting myself fully in regard to the movements and intentions of the rebel authorities and officers, and, as I believed, had also succeeded in concealing my identity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1263"/><pb id="p.195" n="195"/></p> 
<p>On the <dateStruct value="--3"><day reg="2">third</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> of my sojourn in <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, however, my dreams of fancied security were suddenly dispelled, and I was brought face to face with the reality of danger.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1264"/>I had retired early to my room, according to my general custom, and had scarcely been seated when I was disturbed by a faint but quick and distinct knocking at my door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1265"/>I arose hastily, as it was something unusual for me to receive visitors after I had retired, and throwing open the door, I was somewhat surprised to see, standing before me, in a state of unmistakable excitement, the colored porter of the hotel.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1266"/>Before I had time to question him, he sprang into the room and closed the door behind him. His countenance evinced a degree of terror that immediately filled me with alarm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1267"/>His eyes were fixed wildly upon me, his lips were quivering, and his knees trembled under him, as though unable to sustain the weight of his body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1268"/>Indeed, so frightened was he, that he appeared to be struggling forcibly to do so.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1269"/><quote>What is the matter, Jem?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1270"/>I inquired, in as calm a tone as I could assume, and with a view of reassuring him. <quote>What has happened to frighten you so?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1271"/><quote>&apos;Fore <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, <persName><roleName n="Massa">Massa</roleName> <foreName>Allen</foreName></persName>,</quote> ejaculated the black, succeeding by a great effort in finding his voice, <quote>you done can't sleep in this house to-night, ef ye do, ye'll be a dead man before morning.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1272"/><pb id="p.196" n="196"/></p> 
<p>As may be imagined, this information was not of a very agreeable nature, indefinite as it was; I felt assured that my informant could be relied on that something had occurred to endanger my safety, and I became impatient to learn what he knew.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1273"/><quote>Out with it, Jem,</quote> said I, <quote>and let me know what it is all about.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1274"/>I spoke cheerfully and confidently, and the coolness of my manner had the effect of restoring the equilibrium of my sable friend, and, recovering himself with an effort, he began to explain: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1275"/></p> 
<p> I tell you what it is, <persName><roleName n="Massa">Massa</roleName> <foreName>Allen</foreName></persName>, and I'se gwan to tell it mighty quick.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1278"/>This was too important to be ignored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1279"/>I had no desire to be captured at that time, and I had no doubt of the correctness of the porter's story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1280"/>I resolved to act at once upon the suggestion, and to make good any escape before it was too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1281"/>My admonitory friend was fearfully in earnest about getting me away, and he quickly volunteered to procure <pb id="p.197" n="197"/> my horse, which I had quartered in close proximity to the hotel, and to furnish me with a guide who would see me safely through the lines and outside of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1282"/>Bidding Jem make all possible haste in his movements, I gathered together my few belongings, and in a few minutes I descended the stairs and made my exit through the rear of the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1283"/>Through the faithfulness of Jem, and the careful guidance of the watchful negro he had provided me with, I was soon riding away from threatened danger and ere morning broke I had proceeded far upon my way. How much service these faithful blacks had been to me, I did not fully learn until some time afterwards, when I was informed by <persName n="Webster,,Timothy,,," id="n0172.0013.00197.00597" reg="default:Webster,Timothy,,,"><foreName>Timothy</foreName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName>, who arrived in <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> following my departure, and who thus learned the full particulars of the exhausting pursuit of <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0172.0013.00197.00598" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:5"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s spies, who had mysteriously disappeared from the chief hotel, while a guard was being detailed to effect his arrest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1284"/>I met the faithful <rs>Jem</rs> several years later, when he had worked his way as a refugee from his native State and entered the <rs>Union</rs> lines in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and he was soon afterwards attached to my force, where he proved his devotion in a manner that was quite convincing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1285"/>My faithful steed, who had become thoroughly rested after his long journey, bore me safely through this danger, and in due time I entered the <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">State of Mississippi</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1286"/>Here rebellion and disunion were the order of the day, and a wide-spread determination <pb id="p.198" n="198"/> existed to fight the cause of the <rs>South</rs> to the bitter end. Stopping <num value="1">one</num> night at <placeName reg="Grenada, Grenada, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056541">Grenada</placeName>, I pushed on my way to <placeName reg="Jackson, Madison, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099733">Jackson</placeName>, and here I resolved to remain a day or <num value="2">two</num>, in order to make a thorough investigation of the place and its surroundings.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1287"/>Putting up my horse, I engaged quarters for myself at the principal hotel in the city, and feeling very much fatigued with my long journey, I retired early to my room and passed a long night in refreshing sleep.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1288"/>In the morning I arose about <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time>, as is my general custom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1289"/>I was feeling in excellent health and spirits; my journey had thus far been fully as successful as I could have desired; and safely concealed about my person I had items of value that would amply repay me for the fatigues I had undergone and the dangers I had passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1290"/>I had plans of the roads, a description of the country, a pretty correct estimate of the troops and their various locations and conditions, and altogether I felt very well satisfied with myself and with the results of my mission.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1291"/>As I descended the stairs, I noticed a fine soldierly officer standing in the doorway, and after bidding him a hearty good-morning, I invited him to accompany me to the saloon of the hotel, where we mutually indulged in a decoction as is the universal custom in Southern cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1292"/>After I had obtained my breakfast, it occurred to me that, before attempting any active measures for the day, I owed it to myself to procure the services of a barber for a much-needed <pb id="p.199" n="199"/> shave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1293"/>I had been traveling for a number of days, and my face had been a stranger to a razor for a long time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1294"/>and I concluded I would be more presentable if I consulted a tonsorial artist.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1295"/>This was an unfortunate idea, and I soon had occasion to regret having entertained it for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1296"/>I would have been far more contented if I had bestowed no thoughts upon my grizzled beard, and allowed nature to take its course with my hirsute appendage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1297"/>Entirely unconscious, however, of what was in store for me, I entered the well-fitted saloon of the hotel, and patiently waited my turn to submit myself to the deft fingers of the knight of the razor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1298"/>In response to the universal and well-understood call of <quote>next!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1299"/>I took my seat in the luxuriously upholstered chair, and in a few minutes my face was covered with the foamy lather applied by the dapper little German into whose hands I had fallen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1300"/>I noticed when I sat down that the man wore a puzzled and speculative look, as though he was struggling with some vexing lapse of memory, and as he drew the keen edge of the razor across my face, his eyes were fixed intensely upon my features.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1301"/>His manner annoyed me considerably, and I was at a loss to account for his strange demeanor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1302"/>Whatever ideas I may have entertained with regard to this singular action were, however, soon set at rest, only to give place to a feeling of unrestful anger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1303"/><pb id="p.200" n="200"/></p> 
<p>He had just cleared <num value="1">one</num> side of my face of its stubby growth of hair, when a smile irradiated his face, and with a look of self-satisfied recognition and pride, he addressed me: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1305"/>Had a thunderbolt fallen at my feet I could not have been more perfectly amazed, and for a moment I could scarcely tell whether I was afoot or on horseback.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1306"/>I devoutly wished that I was anywhere than with this <placeName reg="Dutch, Grainger, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098893">Dutch</placeName> barber, whose memory was so uncomfortably retentive.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1333"/>The lines of demarkation between these diverse communities were the <rs type="place">Allegheny Mountains</rs>, which extended through the very middle of the state, from north-east to south-west, and divided her territory into <num value="2">two</num> divisions, slightly unequal in size, but evidently different in topographical features and personal characteristics.

<p>From the nature of its earlier settlement, and by reason of climate, soil and situation, <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Virginia</placeName> remained the region of large plantations, with a heavy slave population, and of profitable agriculture, especially in the production of tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1336"/>They made their homes in the wilds of the woods, and among the rocky formations, under which was hidden the wealth they were seeking to develop, and in time this western country became the seat of a busy manufacturing industry, with a diversified agriculture for local consumption, while the east was largely given up to the production of great staples for export.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1581"/>By midnight, mounted officers and civilians began to arrive in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>; but not until the next day, when the rain was pouring down in torrents-that dreadful, drenching rain that continued for <measure n="36hours" type="date">thirty-six hours</measure>, with but slight intermission-did the poor, hungry, fagged-out soldiers commence straggling in. That they were promptly and properly fed by the people, rich and poor, who threw open their doors and gave what they could to alleviate the suffering of these brave but unfortunate men, speaks volumes for the unselfish generosity of the loyal families of the capital during that period.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1585"/>It was an immense responsibility which devolved upon him, but he accepted it cheerfully, and took up his task with that energy, tact and perseverance which precluded all possibility of failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1586"/>When <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> called to the command, he found a mere collection of regiments, undisciplined, undrilled and dispirited, cowering on the banks of the <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Potomac</placeName>, and with only such material to work upon, he soon organized, equipped, and trained with rare skill, that grand body of troops, which he afterwards led in the campaign of the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1587"/>The war was but just commenced, at a time when most people thought it would be over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1588"/>The <quote><measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure></quote> theory was completely exploded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1589"/>Those who had flattered themselves that the conflict would be <quote>sharp and short</quote> --that a single victorious and glorious campaign would crush the rebellion &mdash; were now undeceived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1590"/>My own hopes had controlled my judgment on this subject, and made me visionary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1591"/>I had <pb id="p.244" n="244"/> hoped for myself to be able speedily to return to congenial pursuits and my domestic circle, and that a speedy collapse of their frenzy would save the <rs>Southern</rs> people from the inevitable ruin which must result from a protracted war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1592"/>Above all, I had hoped for the oppressed and shackled race of the <rs>South</rs>, that the downfall of slavery would be early accomplished, and their freedom permanently established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1593"/>Being myself an old line abolitionist, and by no means the least active or energetic of those who had controlled and operated the famous <quote>under-ground railroad,</quote> I had the <name>Anti</name>-Slavery cause very much at heart, and would never have been satisfied until that gigantic curse was effectually removed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1594"/>Indeed, during the whole time that I labored for the cause of <hi rend="italics">thy</hi> Union, the dearest object I had in view was the abolition of the most cruel system of oppression that ever cursed any people &mdash; an oppression long ago so justly characterized by <persName n="Wesley,,John,,," id="n0172.0016.00244.00747" reg="default:Wesley,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Wesley</surname></persName> as <quote>the sum of all villainy</quote> --in comparison with which <placeName key="tgn,7016833" n="1.000 10" reg="Misr,Africa">Egyptian</placeName> bondage appeared simply burdensome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1595"/>All these hopes were dissipated by the results of the late campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1596"/>The war had developed into a <pb id="p.245" n="245"/> reality to estimate.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1599"/>There was no mistaking the duty of every loyal heart &mdash; the <rs>Republic</rs> must be saved at whatever cost.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1600"/>As I have previously stated, my connection with <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0172.0016.00245.00748" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,B.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> was not interrupted by this change in his position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1601"/>By my own preference, as well as at his request, I accompanied him to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and cast my lot with those who were rallying there to protect and defend the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1602"/>Among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> things the <rs>General</rs> did, after being assigned to the command of the troops around that city, was to organize a secret service force, under my management and control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1603"/>I was to have such strength of force as I might require; my headquarters were for the time located in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1604"/>It was arranged that whenever the army moved I was to go forward with the <rs>General</rs>, so that I might always be in close communication with him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1605"/>All spies, <quote>contrabands,</quote> deserters, refugees and prisoners of war, coming into our lines from the front, were to be carefully examined by me, and their statements taken in writing.

<p>This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> real organization of the secret service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1607"/>How much benefit was rendered to the country by this branch of the army will probably never be known &mdash; the destruction of nearly all my papers in the great fire of <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName> preventing their full publication-but that our operations were of immense practical value to the <rs>Union</rs> commander is a fact attested to by every <num value="1">one</num> connected with the leading movements of our forces.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1608"/>It was about this time that the city of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> was placed under martial law &mdash; a measure deemed necessary to correct the serious evils which existed, and to restore order in the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1610"/>In addition to these, the assistance of a detective police force was deemed indispensable, and in answering this requirement I found work enough to keep myself and entire corps busy during our stay in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1611"/>A better understanding of my position and the nature of my duties at this time may be gained from the following extracts from a letter which I addressed to <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0172.0016.00246.00750" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,B.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> when the organization of this department was yet in its incipiency. 
<text><body><opener><salute>General:</salute></opener> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1612"/>In accordance with your expressed desire, I beg leave to submit to you my views with regard to the <pb id="p.247" n="247"/> duties of my detective police force, should the services of the same be required by the government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1613"/>In order to promote the efficiency of such a force, it is highly necessary that its existence should be known to as few persons as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1614"/>It is an admitted and self-evident fact that the movements of the various departments of the government, civil and military, are closely watched, and it is beyond a doubt that from some source the rebels have received early, and to them, valuable notice of the intended actions of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1615"/>I am also led to believe that the rebels have spies who are in the employment of this government, or who possess facilities for acquiring information from the civil and military authorities, or bureaus, and that this information is imparted to others, and transmitted, within a very short time, to the rebel government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1616"/>Many of the parties thus leagued with the enemy are said to be persons of wealth and position.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1617"/>In operating with my detective force, I shall endeavor to test all suspected persons in various ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1618"/>I shall seek access to their houses, clubs, and places of resort, managing that among the members of my force shall be ostensible representatives of every grade of society, from the highest to the most menial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1619"/>Some shall have the <hi rend="italics">entree</hi> to the gilded salon of the suspected aristocratic traitors, and be their honored guests, while others will act in the capacity of valets, or domestics of various kinds, and try the efficacy of such relations with the household to gain evidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1620"/>Other suspected ones will be tracked by the <quote>shadow</quote> detective, who will follow their every foot-step, and note their every action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1621"/><pb id="p.248" n="248"/></p> 
<p> I also propose to employ a division of my force for the discovery of any secret traitorous organization which may be in existence; and if any such society is discovered, I will have my operatives become members of the same, with a view to ascertaining the means employed in transmitting messages through the lines, and also for the purpose of learning, if possible, the plans of the rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1622"/>All strangers arriving in the city, whose associations or acts may lay them open to suspicion, will be subjected to a strict survillance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1623"/><gap/> </p> 
<p>Another and more dangerous feature of the service contemplated to be rendered to the government by my detectives, is that of entering the rebel lines, and endeavoring to obtain accurate information of the nature of their defences, the number of troops under their command at various points, etc.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1624"/>In order to give efficiency to this movement, operations should be commenced in <placeName key="tgn,7013352" n="1.000 12" reg="baltimore, baltimore independent city, maryland">Baltimore</placeName> as well as at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1625"/><gap/> </p> 
<p>Considering the amount of labor to be done and the necessity of immediate action on my part, in case these plans are to be carried out, I purpose concentrating my entire detective force of <hi rend="italics">both sexes</hi> into this work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1626"/><gap/> </p> 
<p> The amount of force necessary to carry out such an undertaking as I have indicated, will necessarily be very large, and the assumption of disguises and characters by my operatives, will be a very important item in itself, etc., etc., etc.</p></body></text> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1627"/>My views were carried out just as they were set <pb id="p.249" n="249"/> forth in this letter, and I was soon hard at work in my efforts to <quote>regulate</quote> the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1628"/>It was too true that a great majority of the local police were disloyal, and could not be depended upon to faithfully discharge their duties to the government that employed them; therefore, in addition to my other work, I exerted myself to the utmost in aiding the municipal authorities to reorganize and discipline the police of the district.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1629"/>Many personal incidents worthy of note occurred during this period, but there was <num value="1">one</num> which I recall at this moment with a laugh at my own expense-an incident in which I was reluctantly compelled to occupy the wrong side of a guard-house over night, and instead of capturing a prisoner became a prisoner myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1632"/>During the earlier stages of the rebellion, a number of Southern sympathizers were domiciled in the city of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and among the number were many ladies of refinement and wealth, from the <rs>South</rs>, who had been leaders of fashion and of society in the brilliant days of previous administrations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1633"/>Many of these ladies were extremely fascinating in their manners, and being gifted with great personal beauty and with rare conversational qualities, they had gathered around them a brilliant circle of acquaintances, to whom they dispensed regal hospitalities and most delicate courtesies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1634"/>When the war broke out, these ladies thoroughly identified themselves with the cause of the <rs>South</rs>, and upon all occasions were unreserved in the expression of opinions favorable to the rebels, and of fervent hopefulness for the eventual success of the disunionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1635"/>But little attention was paid to these <hi rend="italics">grand dames</hi> of the old regime, as it was not deemed possible <pb id="p.251" n="251"/> that any danger could result from the utterances of non-combatant females, nor was it considered chivalrous that resolute measures should be adopted toward those of the weaker sex.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1636"/>That this policy was a mistaken <num value="1">one</num> was soon fully proved, and when it was discovered that these fine ladies were secretly giving information to the enemy, it was deemed of great importance that such means should be adopted as would prevent their treasonable actions from being made valuable to the opponents of the government, and who were seeking its overthrow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1637"/>From information received from reliable sources, it was shown that the rebel authorities were as fully conversant with the plans of the <rs>Union</rs> commanders as they were themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1638"/>That they knew of the position of every regiment and brigade, and the contemplated movements of the commanders, and the time of proposed action, far in advance of any publicity being given to them, and when the utmost secrecy was the only true passport to victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1639"/>Indeed, it was openly boasted that the secret information given to the rebel generals had been mainly the cause of the defeat of our armies at <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1640"/>Upon these facts being fully proven, the government resolved to effectually prevent a continuance of these practices, and that if they were persisted in, the guilty parties should either be confined or exiled to the more congenial climate of Dixie.

<p>My department was in its infancy when the event occurred which I am about to relate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1642"/>I had secured a house in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and had gathered around me a number of resolute, trustworthy men and discreet women, who were devoted to the cause of their country, but were scarcely in such a condition as to move properly or with any systematized regularity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1643"/>I had not been many days in the city when <num value="1">one</num> afternoon I was called upon by <persName n="Scott,the Honorable,Thomas,A.,," id="n0172.0017.00252.00751" reg="default:Scott,Thomas,A.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">the Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, who was then acting as the <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Secretary of War">Assistant-Secretary of War</rs>, who desired my services in watching a lady whose movements had excited suspicion, and who, it was believed, was engaged in corresponding with the rebel authorities, and furnishing them with much valuable information.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1646"/>She had now become an avowed hater of the <pb id="p.253" n="253"/> Union, and it was feared, from her previous association with officers in the army, that she was using her talents in procuring information from them which would be immediately communicated to the rebel government at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1649"/>It was a <num value="2">two</num>-story and basement brick building, the parlors of which were elevated several feet above the ground, and entrance was obtained by ascending a flight of steps in the center of the edifice.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1656"/>The entire day had been dark, gloomy and threatening; clouds had been gathering in the heavens, and everything indicated the imminence of a severe storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1657"/>As I left my headquarters, a slight shower of rain was falling, which I knew was but the precursor of a storm more violent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1658"/>On arriving at the designated locality I found everything to be as they had already been described to me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1664"/>The darkness and storm, while decidedly uncomfortable, were of some benefit to us, as but few people were abroad, and these paid no attention to passing events, seeming to be only too anxious to reach their destination and to escape the pitiless rain.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>The parlor windows, through which the lights were gleaming, were too high from the ground to permit <pb id="p.256" n="256"/> me to see within, and summoning the <num value="2">two</num> men who were awaiting instructions I made use of their strong, broad shoulders in a manner quite novel to me, and quite ludicrous, no doubt, to a passer-by who did not understand the situation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>Ranging the <num value="2">two</num> men side by side under the broad windows in front of the house, I removed my boots and was soon standing upon their shoulders and elevated sufficiently high to enable me to accomplish the object I had in view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1669"/>I was now on a level with the windows, and noiselessly raising the sash and turning the slats of the blinds I obtained a full view of the interior of the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1670"/>The furniture was rich and luxurious, valuable pictures hung upon the walls, and several pieces of statuary and various articles of artistic ornamentation were arranged about the apartment, but to my disapointment, it was unoccupied.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1671"/>I was about to give expression to my chagrin at this discovery, when a warning <quote>Sh!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>from <num value="1">one</num> of my sturdy supporters induced me to be silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1673"/>Some <num value="1">one</num> was approaching the house, and hastily clambering down from my perch, we hid ourselves under the stoop which led up to the front door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1674"/>Scarcely had we ensconced ourselves in this convenient shelter when we heard the footsteps of the newcomer, and to our satisfaction, he stopped in front of the house, and ascending the steps rang the bell and in a short time was admitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/><pb id="p.257" n="257"/></p> 
<p>By this time we were drenched to the skin-the rain had fallen in copious showers and during all the time we had been exposed to its dampening influences --but paying but little heed to this, we again took our position in front of the window, and I was soon remounted upon the shoulders of my operatives, prepared to take notes of what transpired.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1676"/>As the visitor entered the parlor and seated himself-awaiting the appearance of the lady of the house, I immediately recognized him as an officer of the regular army, whom I had met that day for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1677"/>He was a Captain of infantry and was in command of <num value="1">one</num> of the stations of the <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">Provost-Marshal</rs>, and not desiring to divulge the real name of the gentleman, who has since died, I will call him <persName n="Ellison,Captain,,,," id="n0172.0017.00257.00759" reg="mostcommon:Ellison,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Ellison</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1678"/>He was a tall, handsome man of a commanding figure and about <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> of age. He had removed his cloak, and as he sat there in his blue uniform, and in the full glare of the gaslight, he looked a veritable ideal soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1679"/>As I watched him closely, however, I noticed that there was a troubled, restless look upon his face; he appeared ill at ease and shifted nervously upon his chair, as though impatient for the entrance of his hostess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1680"/>In a few moments <persName n="Greenhow,Mrs.,,,," id="n0172.0017.00257.00760" reg="nearbymention:Greenhow,Rose,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Greenhow</surname></persName> entered and cordially greeted her visitor, who acknowledged her salutations with a courtly bow, while his face lighted up with pleasure as he gazed upon her. <pb id="p.258" n="258"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1681"/>Just at this moment I again received a warning from my supporters, and hastily jumping to the ground, we hid ourselves until the pedestrians had passed out of sight and hearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1682"/>When I resumed my station the <rs>Captain</rs> and <persName n="Greenhow,Mrs.,,,," id="n0172.0017.00258.00761" reg="nearbymention:Greenhow,Rose,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Greenhow</surname></persName> were seated at a table in the rear part of the room, and their conversation was carried on in such low tones that, in consequence of the storm that was still raging, I could not catch but fragmentary sentences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1683"/>At last, however, accustoming myself to the noise, I heard enough to convince me that this trusted officer was then and there engaged in betraying his country, and furnishing to his treasonably-inclined companion such information regarding the disposition of our troops as he possessed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1684"/>Presently, he took from an inner pocket of his coat a map which, as he held it up before the light, I imagined that I could identify as a plan of the fortifications in and around <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and which also designated a contemplated plan of attack.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1685"/>My blood boiled with indignation as I witnessed this scene, and I longed to rush into the room and strangle the miscreant where he sat, but I dared not utter a word, and was compelled to stand by, with the rain pouring down upon me, and silently witness this traitorous proceeding.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1686"/>After watching their movements for some time, during which they would frequently refer to the map before them, as though pointing out particular points <pb id="p.259" n="259"/> or positions, I was again compelled to hide myself under the shelter of the convenient stoop, and when I resumed my position the room was empty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1687"/>The delectable couple had disappeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1688"/>I waited impatiently for more than an hour, taking occasional glimpses into the room and watching for their re-appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1689"/>At the end of that time they re-entered the parlor arm in arm, and again took their seats.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1690"/>Again came the warning voice, and again I hastily descended, and as the retreating figures disappeared ill the distance, I could hear the front door open and the step of the traitor <rs>Captain</rs> above me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1691"/>With a whispered good-night, and something that sounded very much like a kiss, he descended the steps, and then, without paying any attention to the fact that I was without shoes, I started in pursuit of him, and through the blinding mist and pelting storms kept him in view as he rapidly walked away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1692"/>It was then about <time value="12:30oclock">half-past 12 o'clock</time>, and the storm evinced no sign of a discontinuance,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1693"/>I was not sufficiently acquainted with the city at that time to tell in what direction he was going, but I determined to ascertain his destination before I left him. I was compelled to keep pretty close to him, owing to the darkness of the night, and several times I was afraid that he would hear the footsteps of the man who accompanied me-mine I was confident would not be detected as, in my drenched stockings, I crept along as steathily as a cat. Twice, I imagined <pb id="p.260" n="260"/> that he turned around as though suspecting he was followed, but as he did not stop I reassured myself and plodded on. I could not, however, disabuse my mind of the fear that I had been seen, I could not relax my vigilance, and I resolved to take my chances of discovery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1694"/>I knew who my man was, at all events, and now I must ascertain where he was going.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1695"/>As we reached the corner of <address><street n="Pennsylvania avenue">Pennsylvania avenue</street></address> and <address><street n="15 Street">Fifteenth street</street></address> I imagined that I saw a revolver glistening in his hand, but it was too dark for me to determine that fact with any degree of certainty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1696"/>At this point he passed a guard on duty, and quickly passed into a building immediately in advance of me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1697"/>This movement was so unexpected, that I had no time to turn back, and I was so close to him that it would have been very unwise to have done so, but I was more surprised when, as I reached the building into which the <rs>Captain</rs> had disappeared, I was suddenly confronted by <num value="4">four</num> armed soldiers, who rushed suddenly out upon me, with fixed bayonets pointed at my breast.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1698"/><quote>Halt, or I fire!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1699"/>called out the officer of the guard.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1700"/>Realizing that an attempt at resistance or escape would be both foolish and useless, I attempted to make an explanation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1701"/>All to no purpose, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1702"/>I informed them that I had been out late and had lost my way, but they refused to listen, and ordered my companion <pb id="p.261" n="261"/> and myself to march at once into the guardhouse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1703"/>I endeavored to make the best of my misfortune, and entering the building we seated ourselves and awaited developments.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1704"/>After waiting for about half an hour, I was informed that my presence was required by the <rs>Captain</rs>; and the guard conducted me up-stairs to his room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1705"/>As I entered, I found myself face to face with <persName n="Ellison,Captain,,,," id="n0172.0017.00261.00762" reg="mostcommon:Ellison,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Ellison</surname></persName>, who was pacing excitedly up and down the floor; stopping immediately in front of me, he glared fiercely at me for some minutes without uttering a word.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1706"/>I was a sorry figure to look at, and as I surveyed my weather-soaked and mud-stained garments, and my bare feet, I could scarcely repress a laugh, although I was deeply angered at the sudden and unexpected turn affairs had taken.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1707"/><quote>What is your name?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1708"/>imperatively inquired the <rs>Captain</rs>, after he had fully recovered himself, and had taken his seat at a table which stood in the room.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1711"/><quote>I have nothing further to say,</quote> I coolly replied, <quote>and I decline to answer any further questions.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1712"/><quote> Ah!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1714"/>Very well, sir, we will see what time will bring forth.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1715"/>He endeavored to impress me with his importance and played restlessly with the handles of <num value="2">two</num> revolvers <pb id="p.262" n="262"/> that lay before him on the table, but I saw too plainly through his bravado, and I knew that the scoundrel was really alarmed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1716"/>Finding that he could not compel me to answer his questions, he turned to the sergeant and ordered: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1717"/></p> 
<p>Take this man to the guard-house, but allow no <num value="1">one</num> whatever to converse with him; we will attend further to his case in the morning.</p></quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1718"/>I made a profound bow to the discomfited officer as I departed, to which he replied with an oath, and then I was conducted down-stairs and placed among the other prisoners.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1719"/>I found myself in a mixed and incongruous assembly indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1720"/>Most of my fellow-prisoners were stupidly drunk, and lay about the floor like logs; others were laughing and singing, while some were indulging in wild threats against the men who arrested them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1721"/>Here I found my companion, who, representing himself as a Southern man had already become acquainted with <num value="2">two</num> secessionists, who were laughing and talking about what they would have to tell when they obtained their release.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1722"/>He soon ingratiated himself with these men, and before daylight had obtained from them a revelation of certain matters that subsequently proved of great value to us in our operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1723"/>As for myself, my feelings can better be imagined than described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1724"/>Inwardly chafing against the unfortunate <pb id="p.263" n="263"/> and disagreeable position in which I found myself, I was deeply concerned regarding the situation of affairs at the residence of <persName n="Greenhow,Mrs.,,,," id="n0172.0017.00263.00764" reg="nearbymention:Greenhow,Rose,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Greenhow</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1725"/>I had given no definite orders to my men, and they would be doubtful as to what course to pursue until they heard from me, and here was I a prisoner in the hands of the man against whom I had grave charges to prefer, and whom I had detected in treasonable correspondence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1726"/>Added to this, my wet garments and the cold atmosphere of the room in which I was confined, affected me with a degree of chilliness that was distressing in the utmost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1727"/>I shook like an aspen, and my teeth for a time chattered like castanets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1728"/>It may be imagined that the hilarity of my fellow-prisoners had but little charm for me, until at length <num value="1">one</num> of the guards very kindly brought me a blanket and an overcoat, which I wrapped about me, and soon began to feel more comfortable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1729"/>Despite the aggravating circumstances under which I suffered, I could not refrain from smiling at the ridiculous appearance I must have presented as I stood before the irate <rs>Captain</rs> who had caused my arrest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1730"/>My hat was battered down over my face, and my clothing was spattered with mud from head to foot, and were dripping with water as I stood there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1731"/><num value="1">One</num> might more readily imagine that I had been fished out of the <rs>Potomac</rs> than that I was the chief of the secret service of the government, in the performance of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1732"/><pb id="p.264" n="264"/></p> 
<p>By the <rs>Captain</rs>'s orders I was prevented from conversing with my fellow-prisoners, so I turned my attention to the guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1733"/>My chief desire was to apprise <persName n="Scott,Mister,,,," id="n0172.0017.00264.00765" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Thomas,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> of my captivity, as early as possible, in order that my release could be effected without unnecessary delay, and I therefore applied myself to the entertainment of my jailer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1734"/>The soldier who had charge of me I soon found to be a jolly, kind-hearted fellow, and I amused him immensely by relating some ridiculous anecdotes which I had heard, and before the time came for him to be relieved I had entirely won his favor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1735"/>Seizing a favorable opportunity I asked him if he would deliver a note for me after his time for standing guard had expired, at the same time offering to repay him for his trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1736"/>To this he readily assented, and by the dim light afforded us I managed to scribble a few hasty lines to the <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Secretary of War">Assistant Secretary of War</rs>, informing him of my imprisonment, and requesting him to order my release as soon as possible, and in a manner which would not excite the suspicion of <persName n="Ellison,Captain,,,," id="n0172.0017.00264.00766" reg="mostcommon:Ellison,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Ellison</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1737"/>At about <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time> the guards were changed, and my messenger departed upon his mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1738"/>He was fortunate enough to find the servants of <persName n="Scott,Mister,,,," id="n0172.0017.00264.00767" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Thomas,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> astir, and informing them that his message was of extreme public importance, he had it delivered to the <rs>Secretary</rs> in his chamber at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1739"/>At <time value="7oclock">seven o'clock</time> the guard returned, and coming to the door, <pb id="p.265" n="265"/> he conversed a few minutes with the soldier who had succeeded him, when I called out: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1742"/>replied the man, with a sly wink, and then I knew that my note had been safely delivered, and my liberation simply a question of time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1743"/>At about <time value="8:30oclock">half-past 8 o'clock</time> the sergeant of the guard came to the door with a paper in his hand, and called out: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1746"/>We responded to our names, and following the sergeant, were again taken to the room occupied by <persName n="Ellison,Captain,,,," id="n0172.0017.00265.00770" reg="mostcommon:Ellison,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Ellison</surname></persName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1749"/>The <rs>Captain</rs> led the way, and in the company of <num value="4">four</num> soldiers, we left the place, arriving in a few minutes at the residence of <persName n="Scott,Mister,,,," id="n0172.0017.00265.00771" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Thomas,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1750"/>He was awaiting our arrival, and as we entered the room he ordered the guard to release me, and directed me to accompany him to his room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/>I followed him immediately, <pb id="p.266" n="266"/> and as the door closed behind us, he burst into a hearty laugh at my uncouth and unkempt appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1752"/>I was a sorry spectacle indeed, and as I surveyed myself in the mirror, I joined in his merriment, for a more realistic picture of a <quote>drowned rat</quote> I never beheld.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1753"/>I at once detailed what had transpired on the preceding night, and as I related the interview which I had witnessed between <persName n="Ellison,Captain,,,," id="n0172.0017.00266.00772" reg="mostcommon:Ellison,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Ellison</surname></persName> and <persName n="Greenhow,Mrs.,,,," id="n0172.0017.00266.00773" reg="nearbymention:Greenhow,Rose,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Greenhow</surname></persName>, his brow became clouded, and starting to his feet, he paced the room rapidly and excitedly.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>Sometimes he would be accompanied by <num value="1">one</num> or more of his intimate associates, and these occasions were not without profit, for when thus accompanied, although necessarily prevented from reaching my office, he was enabled to increase his acquaintance with the traitorous element of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and finally was enabled to unmask several guilty ones whose loyalty had never been impeached or suspected.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2059"/>Motions were made, resolutions were adopted, and various duties assigned to volunteer committees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2060"/>The proceedings grew more and more interesting to the detective as they progressed, and it was not long before he began to feel considerable surprise, if not <pb id="p.294" n="294"/> alarm, at the unexpected revelations which were made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2061"/>It became evident to him that these conspirators had by some means succeeded in placing themselves in direct communication with the <rs>Confederate</rs> leaders, and that a gigantic plot was now in preparation to make a united and irresistible movement against <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2062"/>Nearly <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> Baltimoreans, it was alleged, were prepared to rise in arms at a moment's notice, and join the rebel army, whenever such a movement might seem feasible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2063"/>It appeared, also, that the <name>Baltimoreans</name> were not alone in this plot against the government, but that branches of their organization existed in a number of the outlying towns, and that the secessionists of the entire State were working harmoniously together for the accomplishment of <num value="1">one</num> great purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2064"/>There was no lack of arms, for these had already been secured, but their place of concealment was known only to a few and they were not to be brought to light until they should be needed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2065"/>The main portion of the plot seemed to be well matured, and was most perfect in its details.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2066"/>The arrival of the rebel army in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> was expected in a very short time, as they had the promises of the <rs>Southern</rs> commanders themselves that they would soon cross the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2067"/>Their coming was to be the signal for a simultaneous uprising of all the secessionists in the <rs>Western</rs> and Southern portions of the <rs>State</rs>, who were to unite in a movement that <pb id="p.295" n="295"/> could scarcely fail to carry everything before it. There were also deep-laid schemes by which the <rs>Federals</rs> were to be kept in ignorance of the real designs of the <rs>Confederates</rs>, until too late to avert the blow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2068"/>The extent of the conspiracy rather startled <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0172.0019.00295.00890" reg="nearbymention:Webster,Timothy,,,"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>, although some of the projects sounded rather visionary, and he made up his mind to consult with me at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2069"/>Accordingly, the very next day, he proceeded to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and was closeted with me for several hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2070"/>As soon as he had explained the situation, I devised a plan of procedure, and gave him full instructions as to the manner in which he should proceed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2071"/>The great object, of course, was to break up the organization, and defeat the conspiracy in a manner that would not compromise <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0172.0019.00295.00891" reg="nearbymention:Webster,Timothy,,,"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>; but it was not deemed prudent to go about this with any inordinate haste.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2072"/>I advised <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0172.0019.00295.00892" reg="nearbymention:Webster,Timothy,,,"><surname>Webster</surname></persName> to continue attending the meetings, in the character of an active conspirator; to learn all he could, and report to me as often as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2073"/>In the meantime, I would send him <num value="2">two</num> other operatives, and he was to secure their admission into the secret society, as members thereof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2074"/>In a week or <num value="2">two</num> the final act in the little drama would be introduced by <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> making a confidant of <persName n="McPhail,Mister,,,," id="n0172.0019.00295.00893" reg="mostcommon:McPhail,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>McPhail</surname></persName>, the deputy <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">Provost-Marshal</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7013352" n="1.000 12" reg="baltimore, baltimore independent city, maryland">Baltimore</placeName>, and then confronting the conspirators with a company of armed soldiers.

He attended the midnight meetings regularly, and gained much information concerning the plans and movements of the <rs>Southern</rs> commanders, which proved of incalculable value to the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2076"/>The <num value="2">two</num> operatives soon contrived to join the society, not through <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0172.0019.00296.00895" reg="nearbymention:Webster,Timothy,,,"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>'s recommendation, as that was to be avoided, if possible, but by making the acquaintances of men whom he pointed out to them, and representing themselves as secessionists who were capable of keeping their own counsel.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2077"/>This done, the rest was comparatively easy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2078"/>By the rules of the society, no <num value="1">one</num> could enter the secret chamber of the conspirators without passing <num value="2">two</num> guards, and giving sundry pass-words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2079"/>These guards were appointed by the <rs>Chief</rs> from those who volunteered for the positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2080"/>At stated periods, new passwords were arranged, by which every man was required to answer the questions of the guards, and any <num value="1">one</num> who failed to commit these to memory sufficiently to satisfy these sentinels that he was a member of the society, found himself barred out of the meeting.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2081"/>Our plan worked to perfection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2082"/>There came a night when my <num value="2">two</num> operatives were on duty, as guards, they having volunteered their services at the last preceding meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2083"/>This was the night set <pb id="p.297" n="297"/> apart for the surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2084"/>It had been announced that <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0172.0019.00297.00896" reg="nearbymention:Webster,Timothy,,,"><surname>Webster</surname></persName> would speak that night, and it had been arranged with the guards, that a certain part in his speech should be taken as the signal for the grand finale that had been decided upon.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2085"/>The hour of midnight approached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2086"/>The old building in which the secret conclaves were held was shrouded in silence and darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2087"/>At intervals <num value="1">one</num> or more dark figures might have been seen to enter the covered archway leading thereto, and pass through the gate into the narrow court.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2088"/>Then, <num value="1">one</num> at a time, they approached a certain door, and after a signal rap, and a low, muttered conversation with the guards, they passed in and ascended the dimly-lighted stairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2089"/>Another brief dialogue with the inside guard, and they entered the council-chamber, where they dropped their mysterious manner, and were ready to answer to their names at the calling of the roll.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2090"/>The clock struck <num value="12">twelve</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2091"/>The sound rang through the apartment in solemn, measured tones, and as the <num value="12" type="ordinal">twelfth</num> stroke was still vibrating in the air, all the doors, even those communicating with the ante-rooms, were promptly locked, no <num value="1">one</num> being admitted after that hour.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2092"/>The meeting was opened after the regular form, and the business disposed of without interruption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2093"/>When the time which was set apart for addresses arrived, <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0172.0019.00297.00897" reg="nearbymention:Webster,Timothy,,,"><surname>Webster</surname></persName> was called upon for his speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2094"/>He ascended the platform with a serious expression on <pb id="p.298" n="298"/> his face, and after thanking his fellow-knights for the honor conferred upon him, he launched forth into a stirring address, the treasonable nature of which was calculated to fire the <rs>Southern</rs> blood of his hearers, and to add much to his own popularity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2095"/>As the speaker appeared to warm up with his subject he lifted his voice and exclaimed: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2096"/></p> 
<p>The dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs> is <num value="1">one</num> of the inevitable necessities of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0172.0019.00298.00898" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:5"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s election, and it will be our mission to strike directly at the heart of the <orgName n="Abolition party" type="party">abolition party</orgName>, and bury its foul carcass beneath the smoking ruins of <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington city</placeName>!</p></quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2097"/>This was the signal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2098"/>The words had no sooner passed the lips of the speaker, than a startling noise, like that of a battering-ram being applied to <num value="1">one</num> of the ante-room doors, cut short the speech, and caused every man present to spring to his feet in astonishment and alarm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2099"/>Bang! bang! bang! sounded the heavy blows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2100"/>The door burst open with a crash, and a stream of blue-coated soldiers, all fully armed, came pouring into the council-chamber, and quickly deployed around <num value="3">three</num> sides of the room, effectually cutting off the retreat of the inmates before they could make a movement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2101"/>The sudden and unexpected appearance of these intruders had a paralyzing effect upon the conspirators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2102"/>Had so many ghosts confronted them they could not have been more surprised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2103"/>Horrified consternation was depicted on every blanched face; <pb id="p.299" n="299"/> startled eyes looked wildly around for some avenue of escape, and exclamations of terror or baffled rage broke from many white lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2104"/>Some of the most desperate seemed for a moment to entertain thoughts of breaking through the line of soldiers and reaching the door, but no such mad attempt was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2105"/><persName n="McPhail,,,,," id="n0172.0019.00299.00899" reg="mostcommon:McPhail,nomatch:0"><surname>McPhail</surname></persName> stepped forward with a revolver in each hand, and in a low, thrilling voice, said: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2109"/>His advice did not go unheeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2110"/>They surrendered as gracefully as possible under the circumstances, and resigned themselves to the custody of their armed foes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2111"/>The chamber in which they had maliciously plotted the overthrow of the government became the scene of their own downfall, and it was with dejected countenances that they submitted to the inevitable, and permitted themselves to be marched in a body before the <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">Provost-Marshal</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2112"/>It was not observed, however, until they were being removed, that <persName n="Webster,,Timothy,,," id="n0172.0019.00299.00900" reg="default:Webster,Timothy,,,"><foreName>Timothy</foreName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName> had somehow contrived to make good his escape.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2113"/>The leading spirits of this conspiracy-those who did the actual plotting, and who were known to be the arch traitors and prime movers in the secret enterprise &mdash; were taken to <placeName key="tgn,7018023" n="1.000 10" reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi">Fort McHenry</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2114"/>The rest, after taking the oath of allegiance, were released.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2116"/>As they did not show themselves in that city again, however, they never were made the victims of the terrible vengeance which some of their late associates swore to bring down upon their luckless heads at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2117"/>As for <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0172.0019.00300.00901" reg="nearbymention:Webster,Timothy,,,"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>, instead of being suspected of any complicity in the betrayal, he was congratulated upon his fortunate and remarkable escape from the fate which befell his unfortunate brother knights.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2119"/>The organization, which had so carefully planned the destruction of the <rs>Union</rs> at a single blow, was completely broken up.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2126"/>She was a lady of eminent respectability and <pb id="p.302" n="302"/> refinement, and much esteemed by all who knew her, but this did not render it less advisable, under the circumstances, to have all her movements watched, and her house constantly shadowed by detectives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2127"/>Her pleasant residence at <num value="288">No. 288</num> <quote>I</quote> street, was therefore placed under strict surveillance, and its inmates followed whenever they went out for a walk or drive, while all visitors at the house were invariably shadowed when they went away.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2128"/>There was an old negro servant, known as <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Gallus</foreName></persName>, who went to and from the house oftener than any <num value="1">one</num> else, on errands for the family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2130"/>Accordingly, I gave orders to have him brought to my office, if it could be done without opposition on his part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2131"/>The friendship I bore for the colored race, and my long experience as an <orgName n="Underground Railroad" type="railroad">underground railroad</orgName> conductor, had given me such an insight into the character of the negro, that I believed I could gain his confidence and good &mdash; will if I should meet him.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2253"/>He went alone and on foot this time, as he desired to make some notes and calculations, which he was unable to do in the presence of others without running an unnecessary risk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2254"/>It was a fine, brisk morning, <pb id="p.317" n="317"/> the air was slightly tinged with the coolness of approaching winter, and the spy occupied the entire forenoon in strolling leisurely from point to point, apparently with the single object of idling away a few leisure hours.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2256"/>About noon he came upon a scene, which, though characteristic of the time and place, was rather a novel sight to a Northern man, and he stopped to view it with considerable interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2257"/>In a sunny spot near the river bank about a dozen negro laborers were gathered, their surroundings showing that they had just left off work for the enjoyment of their allotted hour of rest, at <time value="12pm">noon</time>. Having finished their mid-day repast, they were now filling their time by indulging in a species of amusement peculiar to their race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2258"/>On a pine log sat a jolly-looking old negro, whose hair was white as snow and whose face was black as ebony, grinning, and rolling his head from side to side, while he patted <quote><persName n="Juba,,,,," id="n0172.0021.00317.00959" reg="mostcommon:Juba,nomatch:0"><surname>Juba</surname></persName></quote> with great energy and skill, on his knees, chest and head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2259"/>The other darkies were dancing to the <quote>music,</quote> and apparently enjoying the sport to an unlimited degree.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2260"/>The detective was amused at the spectacle, but this feeling gave way to <num value="1">one</num> of surprise and curiosity, as he looked more intently at the white-haired old <pb id="p.318" n="318"/> man who was acting as <hi rend="italics">musician</hi>. There was something strikingly familiar in those black, smiling features.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2261"/>Surely this was not the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time he had seen that face, or witnessed that tremendous grin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2262"/>Where-had he met this darky before?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2263"/>Suddenly his recollection was quickened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2264"/>The person in question was none other than <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Gallus</foreName></persName>, the servant of <persName n="Morton,ex-Governor,,,," id="n0172.0021.00318.00960" reg="mostcommon:Morton,Chase,,,:5"><roleName n="ex-Governor">ex-Governor</roleName> <surname>Morton</surname></persName>, whom he had seen in my office at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, on the day that I had questioned him about his mistress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2265"/>This fact was clear enough to <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0172.0021.00318.00961" reg="nearbymention:Webster,Timothy,,,"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>, but somewhat surprising, withal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2266"/>He remembered that <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Gallus</foreName></persName> had, on that occasion, represented the <name>Mortons</name> as very indulgent slave-owners, who never permitted him to perform any hard labor; yet here he was, in the role of a common workman, employed upon the fortifications around <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2267"/>Whatever had caused this change, however, it did not appear to weigh heavily upon the old darky, for at this moment he was in the very ecstasy of delight, as he patted inspiration into the nimble feet of his companions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2268"/>The other darkies danced until their faces shone with perspiration, and the manner in which their loose-jointed limbs swung and wriggled, suggested the idea that those members were hung on pivots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2269"/>They leaped and vaulted, and flung their heels in the airs, as if they were so many jumping-jacks and <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Gallus</foreName></persName> was pulling the string.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2270"/>The latter hummed snatches of plantation melodies <pb id="p.319" n="319"/> as he warmed up to his work, and finally he sung a series of characteristic verses, of which the following are a sample: <quote rend="blockquote"><lg type="stanza"><l>Did you ebber see a woodchuck lookina at a coon-fight?</l> <l><persName><foreName>Linkum</foreName></persName> am a-comina by'm-bye;</l> <l>Did you ebber see a niggah gal dancina in de moonlight?</l> <l>Glory, glory, glory hallelujerum!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2786"/>He strolled about the village, noting carefully every <num value="1">one</num> whom he met, and, feeling comparatively secure, started to return to the hotel.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2787"/>Turning the corner of a street he came suddenly face to face with a peddler, who addressed him in a rich <name>Irish</name> brogue and inquired the way to the tavern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2788"/><persName n="Scobell,,,,," id="n0172.0025.00373.01249" reg="nearbymention:Scobell,John,,,"><surname>Scobell</surname></persName> gave him the required information and stood watching the fellow as he ambled off in the direction indicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2790"/>He resolved <pb id="p.374" n="374"/> to keep an eye upon his movements and endeavor to discover, if possible, whether the man was a genuine peddler, or a spy, who had adopted that disguise to conceal his true character.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2792"/>These observations were sufficient to put <persName n="Scobell,,,,," id="n0172.0025.00374.01251" reg="nearbymention:Scobell,John,,,"><surname>Scobell</surname></persName> upon the alert at once, and convinced him that the man was not what he appeared to be.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2793"/>Following slowly he watched him until he reached the hotel and entered the bar-room, where, laying aside his pack, he ordered his dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2794"/><persName n="Scobell,,,,," id="n0172.0025.00374.01252" reg="nearbymention:Scobell,John,,,"><surname>Scobell</surname></persName> entered the room immediately behind him, and passing through it, he made his way to the kitchen, where the landlady was superintending the preparations for a most savory dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2795"/>Calling her aside, he informed her of the peddler's arrival and of his suspicions regarding him, cautioning her to convey the news to his missus before they met at the table.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2796"/>In a few minutes dinner was announced, and the boarders, to the number of <num value="15">fifteen</num>, including <persName n="Lawton,Mrs.,,,," id="n0172.0025.00374.01253" reg="nearbymention:Lawton,Carrie,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Lawton</surname></persName> and the peddler, with the landlady at the head, gathered around the long table in the low, old-fashioned dining-room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2797"/>The lively clatter of the knives and forks soon attested the vigor with which they attacked the viands set before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2798"/>The peddler ate <pb id="p.375" n="375"/> his meal it silence, undisturbed by the general conversation going on around him, and <persName n="Lawton,Mrs.,,,," id="n0172.0025.00375.01254" reg="nearbymention:Lawton,Carrie,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Lawton</surname></persName> noticed that he was keenly watching her whenever an opportunity occurred to do so, as he thought, unobserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2799"/>She, however, affected entire unconsciousness of the scrutiny she was subjected to, and kept up an animated conversation with the landlady upon various trivial topics until the meal was finished.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2802"/>She accordingly sent for <persName n="Scobell,,,,," id="n0172.0025.00375.01258" reg="nearbymention:Scobell,John,,,"><surname>Scobell</surname></persName>, and together they decided that he should carefully watch the movements of the peddler, and if nothing of a suspicious nature transpired, they would renew their journey after nightfall.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2804"/>He remarked to the landlady, with the same rich <pb id="p.376" n="376"/> brogue which <persName n="Scobell,,,,," id="n0172.0025.00376.01260" reg="nearbymention:Scobell,John,,,"><surname>Scobell</surname></persName> had observed, that business was dull, and that he would have to walk to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2806"/>The peddler lighted a short-stemmed clay pipe, and swinging his pack over his shoulder, set off at a rapid pace on the road to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2808"/>Sauntering along until he had gained the shelter of a belt of timber to his left, he then increased his pace until he was almost abreast of the peddler, though entirely concealed from view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2809"/>He was now satisfied that with a little effort he could keep his man in sight, and he concluded not to pass him, as he had at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intended, but to follow him until he saw him on his way to the rebel capital.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2810"/>When they were about <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> from the village, the peddler suddenly left the road and turned into the woods, leading directly to the banks of the river, which at this point were remarkably high and steep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2811"/>This movement was entirely unexpected by my operative, and his only recourse was to drop hastily <pb id="p.377" n="377"/> behind a tree to prevent being seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2812"/>He was not discovered, however, although the peddler, after entering the timber, gazed carefully around him, as if to see whether he was being followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2813"/>Apparently satisfied with his survey he resumed his walk, in happy ignorance of the fact that a pair of gleaming eyes were not far distant, noting his every movement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2814"/>Waiting until he had gone a sufficient distance to render it safe, <persName n="Scobell,,,,," id="n0172.0025.00377.01262" reg="nearbymention:Scobell,John,,,"><surname>Scobell</surname></persName> rose slowly from the ground and stealthily followed his footsteps until the peddler paused at the edge of the bluff, which ran down into the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2815"/>Here he tightened the strap of his pack, and after another hasty glance behind him, he began the descent of the bluff, with the aid of the stout stick which he carried with him. The bank was almost perpendicular, and was covered with a heavy undergrowth of young timber and brush, which made the journey rather a hazardous undertaking.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2816"/><quote> Wonder if he's going to swim to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> with that pack on his shoulders,</quote> said <persName n="Scobell,,,,," id="n0172.0025.00377.01263" reg="nearbymention:Scobell,John,,,"><surname>Scobell</surname></persName> to himself, as he wonderingly watched these strange movements of the peddler.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2817"/>Fully determined to see the end of this mysterious maneuver, but recognizing the necessity of exercising the utmost caution in his advance, <persName n="Scobell,,,,," id="n0172.0025.00377.01264" reg="nearbymention:Scobell,John,,,"><surname>Scobell</surname></persName> slowly and noiselessly made his way to the spot where the peddler had vanished as completely from his view as if he had sunk into the bowels of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2818"/><pb id="p.378" n="378"/> Advancing to within a few feet of the edge of the bluff, he threw himself upon his hands and knees, and drew himself forward until he could overlook the steep descent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2819"/>He could see nothing of the peddler, however, for the dense growth of bushes completely obstructed his view, but he could readily discern the marks of footprints in the soft soil, which had been made by him in his descent to the bottom.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2820"/>Here was a dilemma.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2821"/>He had lost his man, and he dared not follow directly after him, as the peddler might be lying in ambush, and an encounter might be fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2822"/>After a few moments' consideration, he concluded to walk along the bluff a short distance and endeavor to find another path by which he might descend, and thus avoid the peddler, if he was waiting to surprise him. About a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> further on he came upon a well-beaten path, and here he began his descent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2823"/>Everything was as quiet as the grave around him, and he reached the base of the cliff in safety, but without seeing anything of the man he was after.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2824"/>Passing up along the lane by the river a short distance, he discovered a narrow path leading in the direction which the peddler had taken, and showing the mark of recent footprints.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2825"/>Passing cautiously along this path a short distance, he saw that the high bluffs were gradually giving to more level banks, and that a little further on the stream made a sharp detour to the right, and swept out into the open and level country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2826"/><pb id="p.379" n="379"/></p> 
<p>In the bend of the river, and on the same side, he noticed a small cabin, half hidden by a clump of trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2827"/>Surmising that the peddler had entered this cabin, he resolved to hide himself and watch for a few minutes, hoping that the man would soon make his appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2828"/>He had scarcely taken a position where he could unobservedly note all that was going on, when a man, whom he at once recognized as the peddler, made his appearance at the door, and stood anxiously gazing around, as though expecting some <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2829"/>He still maintained his disguise, and appeared to be alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2830"/>Returning into the cabin, and after a few minutes, to the surprise of <persName n="Scobell,,,,," id="n0172.0025.00379.01265" reg="nearbymention:Scobell,John,,,"><surname>Scobell</surname></persName>, another individual made his appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2831"/>This new-comer, while about the same size as the peddler, was a very different-looking person indeed, for instead of the red hair and florid complexion, he noticed that this man had a closely-cropped head of black hair, while his complexion was dark and swarthy.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2834"/>The fellow, after apparently satisfying himself that the coast was clear, proceeded to a small stable that stood in the rear of the cabin, and almost on the edge of the river bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2986"/>At a given signal the boat was sunk into the river, about half a mile below the scow, and shortly afterwards it began to make its way under the water towards it.

<p><num value="1">One</num> morning, while the army was on the advance up the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>, I was strolling about the camp, when I encountered a group of soldiers gathered around <num value="1">one</num> of their number, who appeared to be entertaining them immensely with his droll anecdotes and dry witticisms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3013"/>Approaching closer, I became <num value="1">one</num> of the crowd that surrounded the narrator, and listened to an amusing incident admirably told, which had happened to him a day or <num value="2">two</num> before while out with a scouting party.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3014"/>He was a man about <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> of age, of medium height, strongly and compactly built, and with a good, firm, intelligent face, over which he had the most perfect control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3015"/>So perfect was his command over his facial expression that he could make his hearers roar with laughter, while he, to use a homely phrase, would <quote>never crack a smile.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3016"/>I noticed on joining the little crowd that had gathered around him, that the fellow stuttered amazingly, which fact, together with his imperturbable gravity, <pb id="p.405" n="405"/> seemed to be the secret of his always having a good audience about him to listen to his stories and to enjoy his droll humor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3017"/>I was struck with the man's appearance at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sight and at once concluded that, unless I was much deceived in him, he was a man whom I could use to good advantage, and I determined to ascertain who he was and where he belonged.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3018"/>Turning to a soldier at my side, I inquired the man's name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3019"/>Looking at me as though surprised at my ignorance, he answered: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3020"/></p> 
<p>Why, that's <q direct="unspecified">Stuttering <persName><foreName>Dave</foreName></persName>,</q> the drollest, smartest man in this regiment, and <num value="1">one</num> of the best fellows you ever met.</p></quote></p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3025"/>That day I called upon the <rs>Colonel</rs> of the regiment to which the man belonged, and informed him of my wishes, which, if agreeable to him, I would ask him to send <quote>Stuttering <persName><foreName>Dave</foreName></persName></quote> to my quarters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3026"/>Shortly after sundown he came, and to my astonishment, I found that his stuttering propensity had entirely disappeared, and that he conversed with me with surprising ease and intelligence, and a quiet earnestness that betokened a solid and well-informed man. The fact was that stuttering with him was only a favorite amusement, and so naturally was it <pb id="p.406" n="406"/> simulated, that no <num value="1">one</num> would suspect he was shamming or that he was anything else but a confirmed stutterer of the most incorrigible type.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3027"/>In the interview which followed he signified his willingness to enter the secret service, and a day or <num value="2">two</num> later he was detailed to my force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3028"/>Here he served with such ability and credit that he was shortly discharged from his regiment altogether, and for the rest of the war was <num value="1">one</num> of my most faithful and valued operatives.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3035"/>No <num value="1">one</num>, to have seen him, would have imagined that he was an emissary of the secret service, and they would little have suspected that the stuttering, harmless-looking fellow who was hawking his wares, knew aught about military affairs, or the plans and movements of an army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3036"/>It was in the fast deepening twilight of a beautiful evening, and but a few days after he had left the <rs>Union</rs> lines, that a party of rebel soldiers, weary and hungry with the toilsome march of the day, were resting around a camp-fire, engaged in the preparations of their evening meal.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3037"/>While thus employed, they were approached by a strange-looking individual, who walked right into their midst, and without, ceremony, flung down his pack and seated himself among them.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3055"/>The fellow looked at him in surprise, but failed to detect any evidence of an intended sarcasm in the immovable gravity of his face, so mentally concluding that the peddler was a fool and <num value="1">one</num> of nature's own at that, he dropped the conversation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3056"/>By this time the meal was ready, and <persName><foreName>Dave</foreName></persName>, being invited to join them, gladly assented, and fell to with an appetite that showed how thoroughly he enjoyed the repast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3057"/>Supper over, the party spent the evening in chatting and telling yarns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3058"/>The detective opened his pack, and displaying his goods, soon disposed of quite a large quantity, in return for which he demanded, and would take, nothing but silver or <pb id="p.409" n="409"/> gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3059"/>When <quote>taps</quote> were called, he turned in with the party, and placing his pack under his head for a pillow, he soon slept soundly, until reveille in the early morning aroused him from his slumbers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3060"/>Having eaten his breakfast, he sauntered through the camp, taking keen notice of the number of troops, and finding out all he could concerning their intended plans and movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3061"/>During the day, he did a thriving business with his small stock of notions, and was everywhere followed by a crowd, who were attracted by his droll humor and witty sayings.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3062"/>On <num value="1">one</num> of these occasions, and while he was driving some lively bargains with the soldiers that were gathered around him, he was approached by an officer, who slapped him familiarly on the shoulder and exclaimed: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3067"/><quote>Are you subject to fits?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3068"/>the officer now asked, as a sympathetic look came over his face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3070"/><quote> Where do you live?</quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3072"/><quote>On t-t &mdash; the other s-s-side of the river,</quote> he answered.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3073"/><quote> What is your name?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3074"/><quote>They c-c-call me <placeName reg="Fort St">St</placeName>-St-stuttering <persName><foreName>Dave</foreName></persName>,</quote> replied the detective, with an idiotic grin.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3075"/>The officer now turned and walked away, feeling no longer any interest in the fellow, except to pity his condition; and thoroughly satisfied that there was no harm in him, and that he was utterly unfit for a soldier.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3076"/>Well pleased to have shaken off the curious officer as easily as he had, <persName><foreName>Dave</foreName></persName> now turned again to the soldiers and resumed his occupation of dickering with the crowd about him; having concluded his business here, he ambled off to another part of the grounds where a large quantity of ammunition was stored in the wagons.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3077"/>Instantly, an idea occurred to him which he resolved to carry out if possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3078"/>It was to undertake the dangerous feat of firing the ammunition, and depriving his enemies of that much destructive material at all events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3079"/>He lost all interest in disposing of his goods for a time, and proceeded to make a careful examination of the grounds about the wagons, and formed his plans for carrying out his project that very night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3080"/><pb id="p.411" n="411"/></p> 
<p>He soon decided that by laying a train of powder from the wagons and running it to a safe distance, he could readily set fire to it, and make his escape in the confusion that would follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3081"/>At <time value="12am">midnight</time>, therefore, he stole around to the wagons and quietly commenced his work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3082"/>He had taken the precaution that afternoon, to supply himself with a quantity of powder fuses, by rolling the powder up loosely in long strips of rags.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3083"/>Placing these in position to connect with the ammunition in the wagons, and laying his train from <num value="1">one</num> to another, the next thing was to lay a long train, that would enable him after firing it to get out of harm's way before the explosion occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3084"/>Having completed his arrangements, he now took himself off, to wait until the whole camp should be quietly wrapped in slumber, before he started his <quote>fireworks,</quote> as he called them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3085"/>About midnight, had the sentinel on guard at the wagons containing the ammunition been awake, and looking sharply about him, instead of dozing at his post, he might have observed a man stealthily steal up to the stores, and silently and quickly disappear into the woods beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3086"/>Fortunately, however, for our friend, and the enterprise he had on hand, he only snored quietly and peacefully against a neighboring tree, little dreaming of the surprise that was in store for him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3087"/>A few minutes later, a long, quick flash of light <pb id="p.412" n="412"/> darted along the ground, which was immediately followed by a loud, stunning report, and the murky darkness was illumined with a brilliant, flaming light, and great volumes of smoke.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3088"/>Instantly the entire camp was aroused, and the half-dressed and fully-frightened soldiers came rushing to the scene, which was now only a scattered pile of burning ruins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3089"/>How it occurred, no <num value="1">one</num> knew, or could tell aught about it, and wild conjectures were freely indulged in as to the probable cause of the disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3090"/>In the meantime, the only man in the world who could tell anything about the affair, was traveling as fast as his legs could carry him in the direction of the <rs>Union</rs> camp.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3091"/>In a few days he made his appearance at my headquarters, and related the success of his journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3092"/>I could not refrain from laughing heartily at his peculiar and independent system of warfare, but advised him to be more careful in the future as to how he tampered with the stores of the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3093"/>I was not disappointed as to the ability of the man, however, and for months he served me faithfully and well, needing but little instruction, and always performing his work to the entire satisfaction of every <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3094"/>He at times adopted various disguises, but generally depended upon his own natural shrewdness, and his natural adaptiveness for the role of an itinerant peddler to carry him through successfully.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3095"/>He was always fortunate in his trips, and, so far <pb id="p.413" n="413"/> as I knew, his identity was never discovered, and in the peddler who stuttered and <quote>sometimes had fits,</quote> the rebels never recognized an emissary of the <rs>Secret Service</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3649"/>From this time, I heard nothing further from him directly, and for weeks was utterly ignorant of his movements or condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3650"/>I began to grow alarmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3651"/>Hitherto, his visits had not occupied more than <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4weeks" type="date">four weeks</measure>, and he had always succeeded in escaping suspicion, and evading being detained by either <pb id="p.492" n="492"/> force through which he would necessarily be obliged to pass.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3653"/>My anxiety was equally shared by <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0172.0035.00492.01604" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,B.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, with whom <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0172.0035.00492.01605" reg="nearbymention:Webster,Timothy,,,"><surname>Webster</surname></persName> was a great favorite, and who placed the utmost reliance upon his reports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3654"/><num value="1">One</num> evening, early in <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>, the <rs>General</rs> called upon me, and advised the sending of <num value="1">one</num> messenger, or <num value="2">two</num>, for the sole purpose of hunting up <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0172.0035.00492.01606" reg="nearbymention:Webster,Timothy,,,"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>, or discovering some trace of him. I informed him that I had already considered the necessity of some such action, and was upon the point of submitting the matter for his approval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3655"/>Finding the <rs>General</rs> thus fully in accord with the proposition, I at once selected <num value="2">two</num> of my men for this important mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3656"/>After mature consideration, I decided upon despatching <persName n="Lewis,,Price,,," id="n0172.0035.00492.01607" reg="default:Lewis,Price,,,"><foreName>Price</foreName> <surname>Lewis</surname></persName> and <persName n="Scully,,John,,," id="n0172.0035.00492.01608" reg="default:Scully,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Scully</surname></persName> upon this delicate quest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3657"/>My reasons for this selection, were that both <persName n="Scully,,,,," id="n0172.0035.00492.01609" reg="nearbymention:Scully,John,,,"><surname>Scully</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lewis,,,,," id="n0172.0035.00492.01610" reg="nearbymention:Lewis,Price,,,"><surname>Lewis</surname></persName> had been connected with other operations in <placeName key="tgn,7013352" n="1.000 12" reg="baltimore, baltimore independent city, maryland">Baltimore</placeName>, in company with <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0172.0035.00492.01611" reg="nearbymention:Webster,Timothy,,,"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>, and had thus been enabled to form the acquaintance of a great number of secessionists in that city, some of whom had gone South, while others, who remained at home, had influential friends in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3658"/>During these operations, both <persName n="Lewis,,,,," id="n0172.0035.00492.01612" reg="nearbymention:Lewis,Price,,,"><surname>Lewis</surname></persName> and <persName n="Scully,,,,," id="n0172.0035.00492.01613" reg="nearbymention:Scully,John,,,"><surname>Scully</surname></persName> had pretended the most earnest and sincere <pb id="p.493" n="493"/> sympathy for the cause of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and were known as ardent secessionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3659"/>This, I concluded, would materially assist them after reaching <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, particularly if they should be fortunate enough to meet any of their old <placeName key="tgn,7013352" n="1.000 12" reg="baltimore, baltimore independent city, maryland">Baltimore</placeName> associates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3660"/>They had also been engaged upon various investigations through the <rs>Southern States</rs>, and especially in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, where they had rendered good service in the early campaigns in that section of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3661"/>I had, therefore, no doubt of their ability to perform the task assigned to them, and felt perfectly satisfied that they would perform their duties to the best of that ability.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3662"/>Requesting their presence in my private office, I broached the matter to them, and submitted the question of their undertaking this task to their own election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3663"/>Upon operations of this kind, where there was danger to be incurred, where a man literally took his life into his own hands, and where death might be the result of detection, I invariably placed the question upon its merits, before the person selected for the mission, and then allowed him to decide for himself, whether he would voluntarily undertake its accomplishment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3664"/>I did this for various reasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3665"/>In the first place, I felt very loath to peremptorily order a man upon an enterprise where there was every possibility of danger, for in the event of fatal result, I should be disposed to reproach myself for thus endangering the <pb id="p.494" n="494"/> lives of those under my command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3666"/>It is true, that under their terms of service, and by virtue of the authority vested in me, I had the undoubted right to issue such order; but I always preferred that my men should voluntarily, and without urging, signify their willingness to undertake hazardous missions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3667"/>Again, I have invariably found, that the ready and cheerful officer performs the most acceptable service, and that the absence of fear or hesitation are sure passports to success; while on the other hand, should there be timidity or unwillingness, or a disposition to avoid danger, success is rarely, if ever, attained.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3668"/>It is but just, however, to state that during my entire connection with the secret service of the government, I never found any )f my men disinclined to undertake an operation that was delegated to them; but on the contrary, I always experienced the utmost cheerfulness and ready support from those who so valiantly served under my orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3669"/>Nor was I disappointed in the present instance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3670"/>On presenting the case, with all its attendant dangers, to <persName n="Lewis,,Price,,," id="n0172.0035.00494.01614" reg="default:Lewis,Price,,,"><foreName>Price</foreName> <surname>Lewis</surname></persName> and <persName n="Scully,,John,,," id="n0172.0035.00494.01615" reg="default:Scully,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Scully</surname></persName>, both of them signified, without the slightest hesitation, their voluntary desire to go to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and to make the inquiries, which were considered of so much importance by both <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0172.0035.00494.01616" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,B.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> and myself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3671"/>But few instructions, and very little preparation, were required for this journey, and in the afternoon both men were prepared to start.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3672"/>I did not deem it advisable <pb id="p.495" n="495"/> to provide them with any goods, as was sometimes the case, in order to furnish an excuse for their blockade-running experiences, for the reason that their journey would be much delayed, owing to the impassability of many of the roads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3673"/>I did, however, cause a letter to be written, apparently by a rebel spy, then in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and which was directed to <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0172.0035.00495.01617" reg="nearbymention:Webster,Timothy,,,"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3674"/>This letter introduced the <num value="2">two</num> men to <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0172.0035.00495.01618" reg="nearbymention:Webster,Timothy,,,"><surname>Webster</surname></persName> as friends of the <rs>South</rs>, and informed him that his old route back was no longer a safe <num value="1">one</num>, owing to the presence of Federal troops in that locality, and advising him to select some other and less hazardous <num value="1">one</num> on his return to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3675"/>I did this to guard against their being suspected and detained after reaching the rebel lines, as, upon presenting this, they would at once be known as Southern emissaries, and given safe conduct to the capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3676"/>Provided with this letter, and with full verbal instructions as to their manner of proceeding, they started from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> late on the evening of the <dateStruct value="-02-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3677"/>As an additional safeguard, I sent along with them an operative by the name of <persName n="Scott,,William,H.,," id="n0172.0035.00495.01619" reg="default:Scott,William,H.,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, who was well acquainted with the various Federal commanders, and who was to see them safely across the <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Potomac river</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3678"/>The <num value="3">three</num> men departed in good spirits, and, though fully conscious of the danger before them, thoroughly resolved to successfully accomplish what they had undertaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3679"/><pb id="p.496" n="496"/></p> 
<p>Prior to despatching these men, I had some misgivings that there might be still remaining in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> some of those families who, while residing in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, had been suspected of sympathizing with, or furthering the cause of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and whose papers had been seized, and themselves transported beyond the lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3680"/>Among the most noted of these were the families of <persName n="Phillips,Mrs.,,,," id="n0172.0035.00496.01620" reg="mostcommon:Phillips,Lew,,,:2"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, and of <persName n="Morton,Mrs.-Ex-Governor,,,," id="n0172.0035.00496.01621" reg="nearbymention:Morton,Chase,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.-Ex-Governor">Mrs. Ex-Gov.</roleName> <surname>Morton</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, who had been residing in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> for a short time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3681"/>To satisfy myself upon this point, I made extensive inquiries from deserters, refugees and contrabands, and learned, from a variety of sources, that <persName n="Phillips,Mrs.,,,," id="n0172.0035.00496.01622" reg="mostcommon:Phillips,Lew,,,:2"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> had gone to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, and that <persName n="Morton,Mrs.,,,," id="n0172.0035.00496.01623" reg="nearbymention:Morton,Chase,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Morton</surname></persName> and her family had departed for their home in <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3682"/>Believing my information to be reliable, I felt reassured, and then the men were selected.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3683"/>While these men were making their way to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0172.0035.00496.01624" reg="nearbymention:Webster,Timothy,,,"><surname>Webster</surname></persName> was suffering excruciating pain, confined to his bed, and unable to move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3814"/>At length <num value="1">one</num> was decided upon which promised to secure the object of their desires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3815"/>In <num value="1">one</num> corner of the yard in which they took their daily exercise, there was a large pile of ashes and garbage, which had been accumulating for a long time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3816"/>It was resolved that <num value="1">one</num> of their number should be buried under this rubbish, while several of the other prisoners engaged the old jailer in animated conversation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3817"/>The man selected for this purpose was a good, brave fellow, who was formerly a sailor, and had lately been a member of an <orgName n="Artillery Company" type="company">artillery company</orgName> from New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3818"/>His name was <persName n="Stanton,,Charles,,," id="n0172.0036.00514.01730" reg="default:Stanton,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName>, and he had come into the <rs>South</rs> upon his own inclination, and for the <rs>Quixotic</rs> purpose of obtaining command of a gunboat of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and then attempting to run it through to the <rs>Union</rs> lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3819"/>He had, however, been suspected, and remanded to prison, where he had remained without a trial, and without hope of release, for several months.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3820"/>The prisoners were all turned out for their usual <pb id="p.515" n="515"/> exercise in the yard, on the evening which had been agreed upon; and in accordance with their arranged plan, several of the prisoners surrounded the old turnkey, and engaged him in an earnest discussion, while others set actively to work to dig the grave of <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0172.0036.00515.01731" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Charles,,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> in the ashes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3821"/>In order that he might not be unbearably uncomfortable, his body only was covered with the contents of the ash-heap, while his head and shoulders were concealed from view by some straw, which <num value="1">one</num> of the men brought from his cell for that purpose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3822"/>In the jail, at this time, there were a number of negroes, who had been captured while attempting to make their way to the <rs>North</rs>, and although these faithful blacks were aware of the attempted escape, and knew full well that they were not included in the movement, their efforts were none the less active in behalf of the white men who were struggling for liberty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3823"/>They had been informed of the attempted escape, from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and had kept the matter a profound secret, at the same time rendering such service as they were capable of to the whites.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3824"/>Everything worked to their entire satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3825"/>The turnkey was unsuspicious; the grave was made without discovery, and <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0172.0036.00515.01732" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Charles,,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> was carefully concealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3826"/>In a few minutes afterwards the call for retiring was heard, and the men, with throbbing hearts, rushed in a mass toward the door of the corridor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3827"/><pb id="p.516" n="516"/> This was done in order to escape the counting of their number, in case the old man should attempt to do so. They passed quickly into their cells, and were not required to be counted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3828"/>Thus far, all had been done as successfully as could be hoped for, or expected; no suspicions were excited, nor was their missing comrade called for. It had been the custom of the old man to make a tour of the cells after the prisoners had retired, to see if they were all there before he went away for the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3829"/>In order to overcome this possibility of detection, a figure had been made of straw, stuffed into the garments of the men, and laid upon the bed, in order to look as much like a human being as possible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3830"/>This precaution proved to be a good <num value="1">one</num>, for just before the time of closing up the prison arrived, the glimmer of the old turnkey's lantern was seen in the corridor, and shortly after, his face appeared at the door, as he eagerly scanned the occupants of the various cells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3831"/>Apparently satisfied with his scrutiny, the jailer went his way, the heavy outside doors were closed and locked, and the retreating footsteps of the old man could be distinctly heard.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3832"/>The critical moment had at last arrived, and they awaited in breathless silence the appearance of <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0172.0036.00516.01733" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Charles,,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3833"/>Fortune favored them in a peculiar manner this evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3834"/>As the old man was passing the pile of ashes under which <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0172.0036.00516.01734" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Charles,,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> was concealed, he noticed the unusual appearance of the straw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3835"/><pb id="p.517" n="517"/> Stopping for a moment, he drew a match from his pocket, lighted it, and then walked toward the heap as though with the intention of setting fire to it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3837"/>If the old man had succeeded in igniting the straw, under which he was concealed, detection would have followed instantly, and no doubt serious injury would have been inflicted upon the brave fellow, who had willingly suffered the discomforts of his unpleasant confinement for the purpose of assisting his comrades to escape.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3838"/>No sooner had the gate closed upon the jailor, than he crawled nimbly out from his place of concealment, and hastily made his way to the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3839"/>He at once began his operations upon the lock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3840"/>The appearance of <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0172.0036.00517.01736" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Charles,,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> at the door was the signal for the others, and in less than an hour the locks upon the cell doors had been removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3842"/>This barrier resisted all their efforts, and it was at last decided that the lock must be removed by main force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3843"/>This was a proceeding which necessitated a great deal of noise, and they were in an agony of apprehension lest their clamor, should attract the attention of <pb id="p.518" n="518"/> people passing on the outside, and thus lead to their detection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3844"/>To prevent this, the colored men, without any solicitation or instruction, came to the rescue in a very important, though unexpected manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3845"/>They commenced to sing in concert, at the top of their voices, snatches of plantation and camp-meeting melodies, which effectually drowned the sound of their blows, and enabled them to work without fear of detection.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3846"/>The lock at last yielded to their combined efforts, and the men issued silently forth into the darkness of the night, breathing once more the stimulating atmosphere of hope and promised liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3847"/>Only the wall around the prison yard was now to be surmounted, and with the aid of some old planks that were lying around, they succeeded in reaching the top, after which they noiselessly dropped themselves to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3848"/>Although this wall was very high, they all reached <hi rend="italics">terra firma</hi> in safety, and with <num value="1">one</num> impulse breathed a prayer of thankfulness for the success which had thus far attended their efforts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3849"/>Silently, and walking in couples, at long distances apart, they started out to leave the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3850"/>The sky was clear, and the moon was shining brightly overhead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3851"/>The stars were twinkling merrily, as though enjoying the success which had attended these brave, patient men, in their labor and toil of days and weeks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3852"/>This was on the <dateStruct value="-03-18"><day reg="18">eighteenth</day> day of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, and <pb id="p.519" n="519"/> Martial law had been proclaimed some time previously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3854"/>Great haste was therefore necessary, in order to leave the city before that hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3855"/>With only the stars for their guide, they set out in a northerly direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3856"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> of the men was acquainted with the country, and their journey was all the more perilous on that account.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3858"/>Across this swamp their way led through quagmires and deep pools, and was dangerous in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3859"/>Sometimes waist deep in the soft mud and water, and scrambling over slipping places which furnished insecure footholds, and threatened instant danger from falling back into the pools through which they had made their way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3860"/>The air was cold and frosty, and their wet garments clung to them like ice; their limbs trembled; their teeth chattered with the cold, and their condition was really a pitiable <num value="1">one</num> indeed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3861"/>At length they reached the woods upon the opposite side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3862"/>Here they were obliged to stop and rest, completely exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3866"/>Their sufferings became intense, and at length, finding it impossible to endure the freezing atmosphere longer, they determined to build a fire, regardless of the consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3867"/>Proceeding further into the wood, they gathered some boughs, and soon the cheerful blaze afforded them sufficient heat to dry their frozen clothing and to warm their benumbed and freezing bodies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3878"/>It was of no avail, however; the leafless timber afforded them no protection, and during the continuance of the storm the poor, tired and almost exhausted fugitives were exposed to the pitiless blast.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4419"/>There were <num value="1000000">millions</num> upon <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars to be expended; and as the points of construction neared each other, and the twin bands of iron crept along the earth's surface like <num value="2">two</num> huge serpents, spanning mighty rivers, penetrating vast mountains, and trailing through majestic forests, creeping slowly but surely towards each other, there was always the greatest dread at the most advanced points, which, like the heads of serpents, always contained danger and death; and the vast cities of a day that then <pb id="p.588" n="588"/> sprang into existence, and melted away like school-children's snow-houses, were the points where such wild scenes were enacted as will probably never again occur in the history of railroad building.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4420"/>Everything contributed to make these places typical of Babelic confusion, or Pandemoniac contention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4421"/>Foreigners were told of the exhaustless work, and the exhaustless wealth, of this new country which was being so rapidly developed, and they came; men --brave men, too &mdash; who had been on the wrong side during the late irritation, and who had lost all, having staked all on the result of the war, saw a possible opportunity of retrieving their fortunes rapidly, and they came; the big-headed youth of the village whose smattering of books at the academy, or the seminary, had enlarged his brain and contracted his sense so that he was too good for the common duties and everyday drudgeries which, with patience, lead to success, learned of the glory and grandeur of that new land, and he came; the speculating shirk and the peculating clerk came; the almond-eyed sons of the <name>Orient</name> in herds-herds of quick-witted, patient, plodding beings who could be beaten, starved, even murdered-came; the forger, the bruiser, the counterfeiter, the gambler, the garroter, the prostitute, the robber, and the murderer, each and every, came; there was adventure for the adventurous, gold for the thief, waiting throats for the murderer; while the few respectable people quickly became discouraged, and <pb id="p.589" n="589"/> fell into the general looseness of habits that the loose life engendered, and gradually grew reckless as the most reckless, or quickly acquiesced in the wild orgies or startling crimes which were of common occurrence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4422"/>In fact, as in the human system, when any portion of it becomes diseased and all the poison in the blood flows to it, further corrupting and diseasing it until arrested by a gradual purification of the whole body, or by some severe treatment, so from every portion of the country flowed these streams of morally corrupt people, until nearly every town west of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, or east of the mountains, along these lines, became a terror to honest people, and continued so until an irresistible conflict compelled a moral revulsion, sometimes so sweeping and violent as to cause an application of that unwritten, though often exceedingly just law, the execution of which leaves offenders dangling to limbs of trees, lamp-posts, and other convenient points of suspension.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4423"/>As a rule, in these places, every man, whatever his business and condition, was thoroughly armed, the question of self-defense being a paramount <num value="1">one</num>, from the fact that laws which governed older communities were completely a dead letter; and the law of might, in a few instances made somewhat respectable by a faint outline of ruffianly honor, alone prevailed, until advancing civilization and altered conditions brought about a better state of society; so that in these reckless crowds which pushed after the constantly changing <pb id="p.590" n="590"/> termini of the approaching roads, any instrument of bloodshed was considered valuable, and stores where arms and ammunition could be secured did quite as large a trade as those devoted to any other branch of business; while so outrageous was the price extorted for these instruments of aggression or defense, that they have often been known to sell for their weight in gold; and just as, during the war, the army was followed by enterprising traders who turned many an honest penny trafficking at the heels of the weary soldiers, so the same class of people were not slow to take advantage of such opportunities for gigantic profits which, though often lessened by the many risks run in such trading, were still heavy enough to prove peculiarly attractive.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4424"/>As a consequence, there were many firms engaged in this particular business, but probably the heaviest was that of Kuhn Brothers, who were reported to be worth upwards of <measure n="100000dollars" type="currency">one hundred thousand dollars</measure>, which had principally been made along the line of the read, and who, with headquarters at <placeName reg="Cheyenne, Laramie, Wyoming" key="tgn,7013965">Cheyenne</placeName>, had established various <quote>stores</quote> at different points as the <rs>Union Pacific</rs> was pushed on, always keeping the largest stock at the most advanced point, and withdrawing stocks from the paper cities which had been left behind, though only in those towns which had not been altogether destroyed by the periodical exodus occasioned by each change of terminus.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4425"/>For this reason the firms were obliged to entrust <pb id="p.591" n="591"/> their business to the honesty of many different employees, who were subject to the vitiating influences and temptations, which were unusual and severe under the circumstances already mentioned, while the distances between the points, and the scarcity of secure means of safely keeping the large sums of money which would occasionally unavoidably accrue at certain points, left Kuhn Brothers, in many instances, really dependent on those dependent on them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4426"/>In this condition of affairs, and after a slight defalcation had occurred at <num value="1">one</num> of their smaller stores in the spring of <dateStruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></dateStruct>, the firm were seeking a man whom they could place in actual charge of <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of their establishments at the larger towns, and give a sort of general supervision over the others, when the senior member of the firm, being in <placeName reg="Laramie, Albany, Wyoming" key="tgn,7013874">Laramie</placeName>, casually met a young gentleman, who happened to be able to do him so great a favor that the incident led to a close friendship and ultimate business relations, eventually resulting in this narrative of facts.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4427"/>It was a pleasant <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> evening, and <persName n="Kuhn,Mister,,,," id="n0172.0040.00591.02071" reg="mostcommon:Kuhn,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Kuhn</surname></persName> had decided to returned to <placeName reg="Cheyenne, Laramie, Wyoming" key="tgn,7013965">Cheyenne</placeName> in order to secure a proper man for the superintendency nearer home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4428"/>He was to have left <placeName reg="Laramie, Albany, Wyoming" key="tgn,7013874">Laramie</placeName> for the <rs>East</rs> at a late hour of the evening and, being at a loss how to pass the intervening time, strolled out from the hotel with no particular destination in view and his mind fully occupied with the cares of his business, <pb id="p.592" n="592"/> only occasionally noticing some peculiarity or strange sight more than usually striking among the <num value="1000">thousands</num> of weired things, to which his frontier business had compelled him to become accustomed, when suddenly he found himself in front of a mammoth dance-house, and, yielding to a momentary impulse of curiosity, turned into the place with the stream of gamblers, adventurers, greasers, and, in fact, everybody respectable or otherwise, who, so far from civilization, found such a place peculiarly attractive.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4429"/>The dance-house was a sort of hell's bazaar, if the term may be allowed-and it is certainly the <num value="1">one</num> most befitting it-and was really no <quote>house</quote> at all, being merely a very large board enclosure covered with a gigantic tent or series of tents, bedecked with flags and gaudy streamers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4430"/>The entrance fee to this elegant place of amusement was <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar</measure>, and you had only paid an initiatory fee when you had gained admission.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4431"/>On either side as you entered were immense bars, built of the roughest of boards, where every kind of liquid poison was dispensed at the moderate sum of <measure n="25cents" type="currency">twenty-five cents</measure> a drink, <num value="5">five</num>-cent cigars selling at the same price, and the united efforts of <num value="0.5">a half</num>-dozen murderous looking bar-tenders at each side were required to assuage the thirst of the quite as murderous looking crowd that swayed back and forth within the space evidently prepared for that purpose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4432"/>Beyond this point, and to either side, as also <pb id="p.593" n="593"/> down the center for some distance, could be found almost every known game of chance, dealt, of course, <quote>by the house,</quote> while surrounding the lay-outs were every description of men crazed with drink, flushed with success, or deathly pale from sudden ruin; while everywhere the revolver or the bowie intimated with what terrible swiftness and certainty any trifling dispute, rankling grudge, or violent insult would be settled, <num value="1">one</num> way or the other, and to be marked by the mere pitching of an inanimate form into the street!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4433"/>After these attractions came a stout partition which had evidently been found necessary, for beyond it there was the strikingly strange heaven of a mushroom city &mdash; a vast department where there were music and women; and it seemed that the <quote>management</quote> of this grand robbers' roost had shrewdly calculated on the fact that if a poor fool had not been swindled out of every dollar he might have had before he reached this point, those <num value="2">two</num> elements, all powerful for good or evil the world over, would wring the last penny from him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4434"/>Here was another but a finer bar, where more time was taken to prepare a drink and drug a man with some show of artistic excellence, and where <measure n="0.5dollars" type="currency">a half dollar</measure> was changed for a single measure of poison; women,--shrewd, devilish women who could shoot or cut, if occasion required, with the nicety and effect of a man,--<quote>steering</quote> every person giving token of having money in his possession to the more <pb id="p.594" n="594"/> genteelly gotten up <quote>lay-outs,</quote> and acting in the same capacity, only with far more successful results, as the ordinary <quote>ropers &mdash; in</quote> of any large city; a wild, discordant orchestra that would have been hooted out of the lowest of the <quote>varieties</quote> east of the <rs>Missouri</rs>; but in this place, and to these ears, so long unused to the music of the far-away homes beyond the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, producing the very perfection of enchanting harmonies; but above all, and the crowning attraction before which every other thing paled and dwindled to insignificance, a score of abandoned women, dancing and ogling with every manner of man, robbing them while embracing, cheering and drinking with them, and in every way bedeviling them; the whole forming a scene viler than imagination or the pen of man can conceive or picture; grouping of wild orgies and terrible debaucheries, such as would put <persName n="Lucifer,,,,," id="n0172.0040.00594.02072" reg="mostcommon:Lucifer,nomatch:0"><surname>Lucifer</surname></persName> to a blush, and compel a revolution in the lowest depths of <persName n="Hades,,,,," id="n0172.0040.00594.02073" reg="mostcommon:Hades,nomatch:0"><surname>Hades</surname></persName>.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4438"/>The person who had thus prevented the merchant's being robbed, and had also possibly saved his life, was a tall, comely young man of about <measure n="28years" type="date">twenty-eight years</measure> of age, and with a complexion as fair as a woman's, pleasant, though determined, blue eyes, and a long, reddish, luxuriant beard, all of which, with a decidedly military cut to his gray, woollen garments, and long fair hair falling upon his shoulders-the whole crowned, or rather slouched over, by a white hat of extraordinary width of brim, gave him the appearance of an ex-<orgName n="Confederate Officer" type="org">Confederate officer</orgName>, and right good fellow, as the term goes, perfectly capable of caring for himself wherever his fortune, or misfortune, might lead him * which proved the case as he turned and confronted the desperadoes, who had immediately <pb id="p.596" n="596"/> followed him in a threatening manner, and whom he stood ready to receive with a navy revolver half as long as his arm, mysteriously whipped from some hiding-place, in each steady hand.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4439"/>A critical examination of the man as he stood there, and a very casual survey of him, for that matter, would have instantly suggested the fact to an ordinary observer that a very cool man at the rear ends of <num value="2">two</num> navy revolvers huge enough to have been mounted for <orgName n="Light Artillery" type="artillery">light-artillery</orgName> service, was something well calculated to check the mounting ambition on the part of most anybody to punish him for the character of the interference shown ; and the leader of the gang contented himself with remarking, <quote>See here, <persName n="Harry,Captain,,,," id="n0172.0040.00596.02075" reg="mostcommon:Harry,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Harry</surname></persName>, if it wasn't you, there'd be a reck'ning here; lively, too, I'm tellina ye!</quote></p>
