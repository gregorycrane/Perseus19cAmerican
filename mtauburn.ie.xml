<head>History of <placeName reg="Mount Auburn, Athens, Ohio" key="tgn,2526994">Mount Auburn</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>The celebrity attained by <placeName reg="Mount Auburn, Athens, Ohio" key="tgn,2526994">Mount Auburn</placeName>, pronounced by <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> travellers the most beautiful Cemetery in existence, and which, perhaps, without assuming too much, may be called the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Pere,,,,," id="n0211.0001.00003.00001" reg="mostcommon:Pere,nomatch:0"><surname>Pere</surname></persName> la Chaise</hi> of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>,--the extraordinary natural loveliness of the spot,--the admirable character of the establishment which is there maintained,--the fact that this was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> conspicuous example of the kind in our country,--these, with many others we might mention, are considerations strongly in favor of putting on record a more accurate and complete history of its origin and progress than has yet been given to the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Nor need we suppose that such an account will concern only the numerous class of individuals, chiefly belonging to our own vicinity, whose interest in this Cemetery is yet of the deepest and most delicate character,--that which kindred feel in the dust and monuments of kindred, and in the ground, whatever and wherever it may be, in whose bosom they expect their own remains may repose, when the great debt of nature shall be paid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/><pb id="p.4" n="4"/></p> 
<p>A feeling of less immediate and intimate application than this, but of the same kind, has evidently been for some years increasing and extending throughout the <rs>American</rs> community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>In no small degree it is probably a result of the formation of the establishment at <placeName reg="Mount Auburn, Athens, Ohio" key="tgn,2526994">Mount Auburn</placeName> itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Something more and better than the mere love of novelty, or the ordinary admiration of what is admirable, is certainly at its foundation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>It shows itself in works that speak louder than any language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Our Cemetery has become, within the few years of its existence, a model for all similar institutions in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and more of these have been founded within the last half dozen years, than during the whole <measure n="2centuries" type="date">two centuries</measure> that preceded them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>At this moment, associations in several of our principal cities and towns are engaged in such undertakings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>It is well known that applications are continually made from these parties, for information relating to <placeName reg="Mount Auburn, Athens, Ohio" key="tgn,2526994">Mount Auburn</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The multitudes of foreigners and other strangers, who frequent the northern metropolis during the travelling season, experience the same want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>For them there is no resort of recreation (using that word in its just philosophical sense) in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> or its vicinity, equally satisfactory with this <quote>pleasant though mournful</quote> spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Nothing more perhaps is needed to complete their enjoyment of it, than a better knowledge than can at present be easily obtained, of the causes and sources to which they are indebted for the pleasure it gives them, of the principles upon which the establishment is conducted, and of the means by which its yet unrivalled perfections may be emulated in every section of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/><pb id="p.5" n="5"/></p> 
<p>In drawing up this account, which we propose to render as practically useful as may be, we have sought to fortify our authenticity by references to original and official documents, for the introduction of which we are confident the reader will require of us no apology beyond what is implied in this explanation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The subject is not of a character to excite the meditative mind for the moment to a mood of matter-of-fact enquiry, but it is certain, on the other hand, that a sentimental history &mdash; if such a thing might be &mdash; is not what is wanted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The considerations of a general nature which <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> led to the adoption of measures for the foundation of the establishment at <placeName reg="Mount Auburn, Athens, Ohio" key="tgn,2526994">Mount Auburn</placeName>, are such as are already familiar, we must presume, to such of our readers as have reflected on the subject at all. In the address delivered at its consecration by <persName n="Story,Mister-Justice,,,," id="n0211.0001.00005.00002" reg="nearbymention:Story,Joseph,,,"><roleName n="Mister-Justice">Mr. Justice</roleName> <surname>Story</surname></persName>, they are expressed with equal force and beauty; as also in the <name>Reports</name> of Committees of the <rs>Massachusetts Horticultural Society</rs>, published in <dateStruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></dateStruct>, and written by some of our most distinguished citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>These papers will be incorporated in this history, or added to it, in due course; meanwhile it is proper to remark that not only sentiments and reflections similar to those which these publications express had long been entertained by many members of this community, but certain incipient steps towards the putting of such designs in execution had been taken, some years, at least, prior to the actual result now well known to the public.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The earliest meeting on the subject of the <rs type="place">Cemetery</rs>, so far as we have been able to ascertain, was held in</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The design of a Cemetery somewhere in the vicinity of the city met with unanimous approval, and <persName n="Bond,Mister,,,," id="n0211.0001.00006.00011" reg="nearbymention:Bond,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Bond</surname></persName> and <persName n="Tappan,Mister,,,," id="n0211.0001.00006.00012" reg="nearbymention:Tappan,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Tappan</surname></persName> were appointed a Committee to make enquiries, and report a suitable piece of ground for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The Committee were unsuccessful in their enquiries, and never reported, nor was the subject ever actively revived in any way by these immediate parties.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The next movement was in <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct>, when <persName n="Bigelow,Doctor,,,," id="n0211.0001.00006.00013" reg="nearbymention:Bigelow,Jacob,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Bigelow</surname></persName>, having obtained from <persName n="Brimmer,,George,W.,," id="n0211.0001.00006.00014" reg="default:Brimmer,George,W.,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Brimmer</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, the offer of <quote>Sweet <placeName reg="Auburn, Cayuga, New York" key="tgn,7013343">Auburn</placeName>,</quote> for a Public Cemetery, at the price of <measure n="6000dollars" type="currency">six thousand dollars</measure>, communicated the fact to the officers of the <rs>Massachusetts Horticultural Society</rs>, and engaged their co-operation as private individuals in a great effort to accomplish the object in view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>A meeting of members of that Society was held on the <dateStruct value="-11-23"><day reg="23">twenty-third</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>, by invitation of <persName n="Bigelow,Mister,,,," id="n0211.0001.00006.00015" reg="nearbymention:Bigelow,Jacob,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Bigelow</surname></persName> and <persName n="Gray,Mister,John,C.,," id="n0211.0001.00006.00016" reg="default:Gray,John,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Gray</surname></persName>, to discuss the plan of a Cemetery to be connected with an <quote>Experimental Garden</quote> of the <name>Society</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The following article, which appeared about this time in the <orgName n="Daily Advertiser" type="newspaper">Daily Advertiser</orgName>, (attributed to the pen of the distinguished gentleman who acted as secretary of some of the meetings above referred to) conveys so complete an idea of the reasoning and spirit that animated the movements now described, in which this establishment had its beginning, that, although not an official document strictly, it may be considered indispensable to a satisfactory account of these proceedings, and we therefore, as well as for the sake of the style of the paper itself, insert it entire: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/></p> 
<p>The spot, which has been selected for this establishment, has not been chosen without great deliberation, and a reference to every other place in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, which has been named for the same purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>In fact, the difficulty of finding a proper place has been for several years the chief obstacle to the execution of this project.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The spot chosen is as near <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> as is consistent with perfect security from the approach of those establishments, usually found in the neighborhood of a large town, but not in harmony with the character of a place of burial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It stands near a fine sweep in <placeName key="tgn,1122705" n="1.000 1" reg="Charles River, Massachusetts, United States, North and Central America">Charles River</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It presents every variety of surface, rising in <num value="1">one</num> part into a beautiful elevation, level in others, with intermediate depressions, and a considerable part of the whole covered with the natural growth <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> of wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>In fact, the place has long been noted for its rural beauty, its romantic seclusion and its fine prospect; and it is confidently believed, that there is not another to be named, possessing the same union of advantages.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>It is proposed to set apart a considerable portion of this delightful spot, for the purpose of a burial place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Little will be required from the hand of art to fit it for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Nature has already done almost all that is required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Scarcely any thing is needed but a suitable enclosure; and such walks as will give access to the different parts of the enclosed space, and exhibit its features to the greatest advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>It is proposed, (as it appears from the report above cited) to divide the parts of the tract, best adapted to that purpose, into lots, containing <num value="200">two hundred</num> or more square feet, to be used by individuals becoming proprietors of them, for the purposes of burial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>It will be at the option of those interested to build tombs of the usual construction on these lots, or to make graves in them, when occasion may require; identifying the lot by a single monument, or the graves by separate stones, or leaving the whole without any other ornament, than the green turf and the overshadowing trees.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>By the act of the <name>Legislature</name>, authorizing the <rs>Horticultural Society</rs> to establish this Cemetery, it is placed under the protection of the <name>Laws</name>, and consecrated to the perpetual occupancy of the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>A formal act of dedication with religious solemnities, will impart to it a character of sanctity; and consecrate it to the sacred purposes for which it is destined.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>It is a matter of obvious consideration, that with the rapid increase of the <rs type="place">City of Boston</rs>, many years cannot elapse, before the deposit of the dead within its limits must cease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>It is already attended with considerable difficulty and is open to serious objection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The establishment now contemplated presents an opportunity for all, who wish to enjoy it, of providing a place of burial for those, for whom it is their duty to make such provision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The space is ample affording room for as large a number of lots as may be required, for a considerable length of time; and the price at which they are now to be purchased, it is believed, is considerably less than that of tombs, in the usual places of their construction.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Although no <num value="1">one</num>, whose feelings and principles are sound, can regard without tenderness and delicacy the question, where he will deposit the remains of those, whom it is his duty to follow to their last home, yet it may be feared, that too little thought has been had for the decent aspect of our places of sepulture or their highest adaptation to their great object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Our burial places are in the cities crowded till they are full, nor, in general, does any other object, either in town or country, appear to have been had in view in them, than that of confining the remains of the departed to the smallest portion of earth that will hide them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Trees, whose inexpressible beauty has been provided by the hand of the <name>Creator</name>, as the great ornament of <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> the earth, have rarely been planted about our grave yards; the enclosures are generally inadequate and neglected, the graves indecently crowded together, and often, after a few years, disturbed; and the whole appearance as little calculated as possible to invite the visits of the seriously disposed, to tranquilize the feelings of surviving friends, and to gratify that disposition which would lead us to pay respect to their ashes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Nor has it hitherto been in the power even of those, who might be able and willing to do it, to remedy these evils, as far as they are themselves concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Great objections exist to a place of sepulture in a private field; particularly this, that in a few years, it is likely to pass into the hands of those who will take no interest in preserving its sacred deposit from the plough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>In the public grave yard it is not always in the power of an individual, to appropriate to a single place of burial, space enough for the purposes of decent and respectful ornament.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The proposed establishment seems to furnish every facility for gratifying the desire, which must rank among the purest and strongest of the human heart; and which would have been much more frequently indicated, but for the very serious, and sometimes insuperable obstacles of which we have spoken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Here it will be in the power of every <num value="1">one</num>, who may wish it, at an expense considerably less than that of a common tomb or a vault beneath a church, to deposit the mortal remains of his friends; and to provide a place of burial <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> for himself,--which while living he may contemplate without dread or disgust; <num value="1">one</num> which is secure from the danger of being encroached upon as in the grave yards of the city; secluded from every species of uncongenial intrusion; surrounded with every thing that can fill the heart with tender and respectful emotions:beneath the shade of a venerable tree, on the slope of the verdant lawn, and within the seclusion of the forest ;--removed from all the discordant scenes of life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Such were the places of burial of the ancient nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>In a spot like this, were laid the remains of the patriarchs of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>In the neighborhood of their great cities the ancient <rs>Egyptians</rs> established extensive cities of the dead; and the <name>Greeks</name> and <name>Romans</name> erected the monuments of the departed by the road side; on the approach to their cities, or in pleasant groves in their suburbs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>In modern times, the <name>Turkish</name> people are eminent for that respectful care of the places of sepulture, which forms an interesting trait of the oriental character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>At the heed and foot of each grave, a cypress tree is planted, so that the grave yard becomes in a few years, a deep and shady grove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>These sacred precincts are never violated; they form the most beautiful suburbs to the cities, and not unfrequently when the city of the living has been swept away by the political vicissitudes, frequent under that government, <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> the <rs type="place">Grove of Cypress</rs> remains,--spreading its sacred shelter over the city of the dead.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>In the <rs type="place">City of Boston</rs>, the inconveniences of the present modes of burial are severely felt, and it is as a becoming appendage, an interesting ornament of the town, that this Cemetery should be regarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>When it shall be laid out, with suitable walks and the appropriate spots shall begin to be adorned with the various memorials, which affection and respect may erect to the departed, what object in or near <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> will be equally attractive?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>What would sooner arrest the attention of the stranger; whither would a man of reflection and serious temper sooner direct his steps?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Had such a Cemetery, with prophetic forethought of posterity, been laid out in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> settlement of the country, and all our venerated dead,--the eminent in church and state-been deposited side by side, with plain but enduring monuments, it would possess already an interest of the most elevated and affecting character.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The vicinity of our venerable University suggests an interesting train of associations, connected with this spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>It has ever been the favorite resort of the students.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>There are hundreds now living, who have passed some of the happiest hours of the happiest period of their lives, beneath the shade of the trees in this secluded forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>It will become the place of burial for the <rs type="place">University</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Here will the dust of the young men, who <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> may be cut off before their academic course is run, be laid by their classmates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Here will be deposited those who may die in the offices of instruction and government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Nor is it impossible, that the several class associations, which form a beautiful feature of our college life, may each appropriate to themselves a lot, where such of their brethren as may desire it, may be brought back to be deposited in the soil of the spot where they passed their early years.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>The establishment contemplated will afford the means of paying a tribute of respect, by a monumental erection, to the names and memory of great and good men, whenever or wherever they have died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Its summit may be consecrated to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, by a Cenotaph inscribed with his name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Public sentiment will often delight in these tributes of respect, and the place may gradually become the honorary mausoleum for the distinguished sons of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>This design, though but recently made public, has been long in contemplation; and, as is believed, has been favored with unusual approbation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Let us take an affectionate and pious care of our dead;--let us turn to some good account, in softening and humanizing the public feeling, that sentiment of tenderness toward the departed, which is natural and ineradicable in man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/></p> 
<p>It is a part of the original design of this establishment, though not an obligatory <num value="1">one</num>, that interments shall be made in single or separate graves, rather than in tombs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>The abundant space afforded by the extensiveness of the tract which has been purchased, precludes the necessity of constructing vaults for the promiscuous concentration of numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>It is believed that the common grave affords the most simple, natural and secure method by which the body may return to the bosom of the earth, to be peacefully blended with its original dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Whatever consolation can be derived from the gathering together of members of the same families, is provided for by the appropriation of lots, each sufficient for a family, while the provision that the same spot or grave shall not be twice occupied for interment, secures to the buried an assurance of undisturbed rest, not always found in more costly constructions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>On the same subject another consideration may be added.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>It is desired that the place may become beautiful, attractive, consoling,--not gloomy and repulsive, <pb id="p.35" n="35"/> that what the earth has once covered it shall not again reveal to light,--that the resources of art shall not be wasted in vain efforts to delay or modify the inevitable courses of nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>It is hoped, therefore, that any sums which individuals may think it proper to devote to the improvement of the place of sepulture of themselves and their friends, may be expended above the surface of the earth,--not under it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>When the <rs>Massachusetts Horticultural Society</rs> was organized, it was confidently anticipated, that, at no very distant period, a Garden of Experiment would be established in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>; but to arrive at such a pleasing result, it was deemed expedient that our efforts should <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> be directed to the accomplishment of objects which would not require very extensive pecuniary resources; that we should proceed with great caution, and by a prudential management of our means, gradually develope a more complete and efficient system for rendering the institution as extensively useful as it was necessary and important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>Public favor was to be propitiated by the adoption of such incipient measures as were best calculated to encourage patronage, and insure ultimate success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>With these views, the labors of the <name>Society</name> have been confined to the collection and dissemination of intelligence, plants, scions, and seeds, in the various departments of Horticulture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>An extensive correspondence was therefore opened with similar associations in this country and in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, as well as with many gentlemen who are distinguished for their theoretical attainments, practical information, and experimental researches, in all the branches of rural economy, on this continent, and other portions of the globe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/><pb id="p.37" n="37"/></p> 
<p>The kind disposition, which has been generally evinced, to advance the interest of the <name>Society</name>, has had a salutary and cheering influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>A liberal offer of co-operation has been promptly tendered in both hemispheres, and great advantages are anticipated from a mutual interchange of good offices.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>A library of considerable extent has been formed, containing many of the most celebrated <name>English</name> and <name>French</name> works on Horticulture, several of which are magnificent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The apartments for the accommodation of the <name>Society</name> have been partially embellished with beautiful paintings of some of our choice native varieties of fruits; and by weekly exhibitions, during <measure n="8months" type="date">eight months</measure> of the year, of fruits, flowers, and esculent vegetables ;--by awarding premiums for proficiency in the art of gardening, and the rearing of new, valuable, or superior products;--by disseminating intelligence, and accounts of the proceedings of the <name>Society</name> at its regular and special meetings, through the medium of the <orgName n="New England Farmer" type="newspaper">New England Farmer</orgName>; and by an annual festival, and public exhibition of the various products of Horticulture, an interest has been excited, and a spirit of inquiry awakened, auspicious to the <rs>Institution</rs>, while a powerful impulse has been given to all the branches of rural industry, far beyond our most sanguine hopes.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>For the accommodation of the <rs>Garden</rs> of Experiment and Cemetery, at least <measure n="70acres" type="area">seventy acres</measure> of land are deemed necessary; and in making the selection of a site, it was very important that from <num value="40">forty</num> to <measure n="50acres" type="area">fifty acres</measure> should be well or partially covered with forest-trees and shrubs, which could be appropriated for the latter establishment; that it should present all possible varieties of soil, common in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> ;--be diversified by hills, valleys, plains, brooks, and low meadows, and bogs, so as to afford proper localities for every kind of tree and plant that will flourish in this climate;and be near to some large stream or river, and easy of access by land and water ;--but still sufficiently retired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/><pb id="p.41" n="41"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>As a large portion of the ground is now covered with trees, shrubs and wild flowering plants, avenues and walks may be made through them, in such a manner as to render the whole establishment interesting and beautiful, at a small expense, and within a few years, and ultimately to offer an example of landscape or picturesque gardening, in conformity to the modern style of laying out grounds, which will be highly creditable to the <name>Society</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>The streams, and parcels of bog and meadow-land may be easily converted into ponds, and variously formed sheets of water, which will furnish appropriate positions for aquatic plants, while their borders may be planted with Rhododendrons, Azaleas, several species of the superb <rs>Magnolia</rs>, and other plants, which require a constantly humid soil, and decayed vegetable matter, for their nourishment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>On the <rs>Southeastern</rs> and <rs>Northeastern</rs> borders of the tract can be arranged the nurseries, and portions selected for the culture of fruit-trees and esculent vegetables, on an extensive scale; there may be arranged the <name>Arboretum</name>, the <rs type="place">Orchard</rs>, the <name>Culinarium</name>, Floral department, <placeName reg="Melon-grounds">Melon-grounds</placeName> and Strawberry beds, and Green-houses.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>The remainder of the land may be devoted to the <rs type="place">Cemetery</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>By means of a more extensive correspondence with eminent Horticulturists it is certain that many valuable, rare, and beautiful plants may be obtained, not only from all parts of our own country, but other regions of the globe, which could be naturalized to the soil and <pb id="p.42" n="42"/> climate of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>This can be efficiently undertaken, so soon as a Garden of Experiment is formed, but it would be almost useless to procure large collections of seeds or plants, until we are enabled to cultivate them under the immediate direction of the <name>Society</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Accounts of the experiments which may be made, should be periodically reported and published; and seeds, buds, cuttings, and uncommon varieties of rooted plants may be distributed among the members of the <name>Society</name>, and be sold for its benefit, in such manner as may be found most expedient, to render the garden the most extensively useful in all its relations with the wants, comforts and pleasures of life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Such an establishment is required for <quote> collecting the scattered rays of intelligence, and blending them with the science and accumulating experience of the times,</quote> and then diffusing them far and wide, to cheer and enlighten the practical Horticulturist in his career of agreeable and profitable industry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>The occasion, which brings us together, has much in it calculated to awaken our sensibilities, and cast a solemnity over our thoughts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>We are met to consecrate these grounds exclusively to the service and repose of the dead.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>The duty is not new; for it has been performed for countless <num value="1000000">millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>The scenery is not new; for the hill and the valley, the still, silent dell, and the deep forest, have often been devoted to the same pious purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>But that, which must always give it a peculiar interest, is, that it can rarely occur except at distant intervals; and, whenever it does, it must address itself to feelings intelligible to all nations, and common to all hearts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>The patriarchal language of <measure n="4000years" type="date">four thousand years</measure> ago is precisely that to which we would now give utterance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>We are <quote>strangers and sojourners</quote> here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>We have need of <quote>a possession of a burying-place, that we may bury our dead out of our sight.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>Let us have <quote>the field, and the cave which is therein; and all the trees, that are in the field, and that are in the borders round about;</quote> and let them <quote>be made sure for a possession of a burying-place.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>It is the duty of the living thus to provide for the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>It is not a mere office of pious regard for others; <pb id="p.66" n="66"/> but it comes home to our own bosoms, as those who are soon to enter upon the common inheritance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>If there are any feelings of our nature, not bounded by earth, and yet stopping short of the skies, which are more strong and more universal than all others, they will be found in our solicitude as to the time and place and manner of our death; in the desire to die in the arms of our friends; to have the last sad offices to our remains performed by their affection; to repose in the land of our nativity; to be gathered to the sepulchres of our fathers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>It is almost impossible for us to feel, nay, even to feign, indifference on such a subject.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>Poetry has told us this truth in lines of transcendant beauty and force, which find a response in every breast:--<quote rend="blockquote"><lg type="couplet"><lg type="stanza"><l>For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,</l> <l>This pleasing, anxious being e'er resigned,</l> <l>Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,</l> <l>Nor cast <num value="1">one</num> longing, lingering look behind?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>It is in vain that Philosophy has informed us, that the whole earth is but a point in the eyes of its Creator,nay, of his own creation; that, wherever we are,abroad or at home,--on the restless ocean, or the solid land,--we are still under the protection of His providence, and safe, as it were, in the hollow of his hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>It is in vain that Religion has instructed us, that we are <pb id="p.67" n="67"/> but dust, and to dust we shall return ;--that whether our remains are scattered to the corners of the earth, or gathered in sacred urns, there is a sure and certain hope of a resurrection of the body and a life everlasting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>These truths, sublime and glorious as they are, leave untouched the feelings of which I have spoken, or, rather, they impart to them a more enduring reality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>Dust as we are, the frail tenements which enclose our spirits but for a season, are dear, are inexpressibly dear to us. We derive solace, nay, pleasure, from the reflection, that when the hour of separation comes, these earthly remains will still retain the tender regard of those whom we leave behind;--that the spot, where they shall lie, will be remembered with a fond and soothing reverence ;--that our children will visit it in the midst of their sorrows; and our kindred in remote generations feel that a local inspiration hovers round it.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>Let him speak, who has been on a pilgrimage of health to a foreign land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>Let him speak, who has watched at the couch of a dying friend, far from his chosen home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>Let him speak, who has committed to the bosom of the deep, with a sudden, startling plunge, the narrow shroud of some relative or companion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>Let such speak, and they will tell you, that there is nothing which wrings the heart of the dying,--aye, and of the surviving,--with sharper agony, than the thought, that they are to sleep their last sleep in the land of strangers, or in the unseen depths of the ocean.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>Such are the natural expressions of human feeling, as they fall from the lips of the dying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>Such are the reminiscences that forever crowd on the confines of the passes to the grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>We seek again to have our home there with our friends, and to be blest by a communion with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>It is a matter of instinct, not of reasoning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>It is a spiritual impulse, which supersedes belief, and disdains question.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>But it is not chiefly in regard to the feelings belonging to our own mortality, however sacred and natural, that we should contemplate the establishment of repositories of this sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>There are higher moral purposes, and more affecting considerations, which belong to the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>We should accustom ourselves to view them rather as means, than as ends; rather as influences to govern human conduct, and to moderate human suffering, than as cares incident to a selfish foresight.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>It is to the living mourner &mdash; to the parent, weeping over his dear dead child &mdash; to the husband, dwelling in his own solitary desolation &mdash; to the widow, whose heart is broken by untimely sorrow &mdash; to the friend, who misses at every turn the presence of some kindred spirit &mdash; it is to these, that the repositories of the dead bring home thoughts full of admonition, of instruction, and, slowly but surely, of consolation also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>They admonish us, by their very silence, of our own frail and transitory being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>They instruct us in the true value of life, and in its noble purposes, its duties, and its destination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>They spread around us, in the reminiscences of the past, sources of pleasing, though melancholy reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/><pb id="p.69" n="69"/></p> 
<p>We dwell with pious fondness on the characters and virtues of the departed; and, as time interposes its growing distances between us and them, we gather up, with more solicitude, the broken fragments of memory, and weave, as it were, into our very hearts, the threads of their history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>As we sit down by their graves, we seem to hear the tones of their affection, whispering in our ears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>We listen to the voice of their wisdom, speaking in the depths of our souls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>We shed our tears; but they are no longer the burning tears of agony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>They relieve our drooping spirits, and come no longer over us with a deathly faintness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>The <rs>Egyptians</rs> gratified their pride and soothed their grief, by interring them in their Elysian fields, or embalming them in their vast catacombs, or enclosing them in their stupendous pyramids, the wonder of all succeeding ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>The <rs>Hebrews</rs> watched with religious care over their places of burial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>They selected, for this purpose, ornamented gardens, and deep forests, and fertile valleys, and lofty mountains; and they still designate them with a sad emphasis, as the <quote>House of the living.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>The ancient <rs>Asiatics</rs> lined the approaches to their cities with sculptured sarcophagi, and mausoleums, and other ornaments, embowered in shrubbery, traces of which may be seen among their magnificent ruins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>The <rs>Greeks</rs> exhausted the resources of their exquisite art in adorning the habitations of the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>They discouraged interments within the limits of their cities; and consigned their reliques to shady groves, in the neighborhood of murmuring streams and mossy fountains, close by the favorite resorts of those who were engaged in the study of philosophy and nature, and called them, with the elegant expressiveness of their own beautiful language, Cemeteries,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>The cypress is planted at the head and foot of every grave, and waves with a mournful solemnity over it. These devoted grounds possess an inviolable sanctity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>The ravages of war never reach them; and victory and defeat equally respect the limits of their domain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>So that it has been remarked, with equal truth and beauty, that while the cities of the living are subject to all the desolations and vicissitudes incident to human affairs, the cities of the dead enjoy an undisturbed repose, without even the shadow of change.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>But I will not dwell upon facts of this nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>They demonstrate, however, the truth, of which I have spoken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>They do more; they furnish reflections suitable for our own thoughts on the present occasion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>If this tender regard for the dead be so absolutely universal, and so deeply founded in human affection, why is it not made to exert a more profound influence on our lives?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>Why do we not enlist it with more persuasive energy in the cause of human improvement?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>Why do we not enlarge it as a source of religious consolation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/><pb id="p.72" n="72"/> Why do we not make it a more efficient instrument to elevate Ambition, to stimulate Genius, and to dignify Learning?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>Why do we not connect it indissolubly with associations, which charm us in Nature and engross us in Art?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>Why do we not dispel from it that unlovely gloom, from which our hearts turn as from a darkness that ensnares, and a horror that appalls our thoughts?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>To many, nay, to most of the heathen, the burying-place was the end of all things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>They indulged no hope, at least no solid hope, of any future intercourse or re-union with their friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>The farewell at the grave was a long, an everlasting farewell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>At the moment, when they breathed it, it brought to their hearts a startling sense of their own wretchedness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>Yet, when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> tumults of anguish were passed, they visited the spot, and strewed flowers, and garlands, and crowns around it, to assuage their grief, and nourish their piety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>They delighted to make it the abode of the varying beauties of Nature; to give it attractions, which should invite the busy and the thoughtful, and yet, at the same time, afford ample scope for the secret indulgence of sorrow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>Why should not Christians imitate such examples?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>They have far nobler motives to cultivate moral sentiments and sensibilities; to make cheerful the pathways to the grave; to combine with deep meditations on human mortality the sublime consolations of religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>We know, indeed, as they did of old, that <quote>man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>But that home is not an everlasting home; and the mourners may not weep as those, who are <pb id="p.73" n="73"/> without hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>What is the grave to us, but a thin barrier dividing Time from Eternity, and Earth from Heaven?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>What is it but <quote>the appointed place of rendezvous, where all the travellers on life's journey meet</quote> for a single night of repose?-<quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>Why then should we darken with systematic caution all the avenues to these repositories?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>Why should we deposit the remains of our friends in loathsome vaults, or beneath the gloomy crypts and cells of our churches, where the human foot is never heard, save when the sickly taper lights some new guest to his appointed apartment, and <quote>lets fill a supernumerary horror</quote> on the passing procession?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>Why should we measure out a narrow portion of earth for our graveyards in the midst of our cities, and heap the dead upon each other with a cold, calculating parsimony, disturbing their ashes, and wounding the sensibilities of the living?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>Why should we expose our burying-grounds to the broad glare of day, to the unfeeling gaze of the idler, to the noisy press of business, to the discordant shouts of merriment, or to the balefil visitations of the dissolute?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>Why should we bar up their approaches against real <pb id="p.74" n="74"/> mourners, whose delicacy would shrink from observation, but whose tenderness would be soothed by secret visits to the grave, and holding converse there with their departed joys?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>Why all this unnatural restraint upon our sympathies and sorrows, which confines the visit to the grave to the only time in which it must be utterly useless-when the heart is bleeding with fresh anguish, and is too weak to feel, and too desolate to desire consolation?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>It is painful to reflect, that the <rs type="place">Cemeteries</rs> in our cities, crowded on all sides by the overhanging habitations of the living, are walled in only to preserve them from violation, and that in our country towns they are left in a sad, neglected state, exposed to every sort of intrusion, with scarcely a tree to shelter their barrenness, or a shrub to spread a grateful shade over the new-made hillock.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>These things were not always so among Christians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>They are not worthy of us. They are not worthy of Christianity in our day. There is much in these things that casts a just reproach upon us in the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>There is much that demands for the future a more spiritual discharge of our duties.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>Our Cemeteries rightly selected, and properly arranged, may be made subservient to some of the highest purposes of religion and human duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>They may preach lessons, to which none may refuse to listen, and which all, that live, must hear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>Truths may be there felt and taught in the silence of our own meditations, more persuasive, and more enduring, than ever flowed from human lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>The grave hath a voice of eloquence, nay, of superhuman eloquence, which speaks <pb id="p.75" n="75"/> at once to the thoughtlessness of the rash, and the devotion of the good; which addresses all times, and all ages and all sexes; which tells of wisdom to the wise, and of comfort to the afflicted; which warns us of our follies and our dangers; which whispers to us in accents of peace, and alarms us in tones of terror; which steals with a healing balm into the stricken heart, and lifts up and supports the broken spirit; which awakens a new enthusiasm for virtue, and disciplines us for its severer trials and duties; which calls up the images of the illustrious dead, with an animating presence for our example and glory; and which demands of us, as men, as patriots, as christians, as immortals, that the powers given by <name n="God" type="God">God</name> should be devoted to his service, and the minds created by his love, should return to him with larger capacities for virtuous enjoyment, and with more spiritual and intellectual brightness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>It should not be for the poor purpose of gratifying our vanity or pride, that we should erect columns, and obelisks, and monuments to the dead; but that we may read thereon much of our own destiny and duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>We know that man is the creature of associations and excitements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>Experience may instruct, but habit, and appetite, and passion, and imagination, will exercise a strong dominion over him. These are the <name>Fates</name> which weave the thread of his character, and unravel the mysteries of his conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>The truth, which strikes home, must not only have the approbation of his reason, but it must be embodied in a visible, tangible, practical form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>It must be felt, as well as seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>It must warm, as well as convince.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/><pb id="p.76" n="76"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>The feeling, thus expressed, has a deep foundation in the human mind; and, as it is well or ill-directed, it will cover us with shame, or exalt us to glory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>The deeds of the great attract but a cold and listless admiration, when they pass in historical order before us like moving shadows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>It is the trophy and the monument, which invest them with a substance of local reality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>Who, that has stood by the tomb of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0211.0007.00076.00271" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> on the quiet Potomac, has not felt his heart more pure, his wishes more aspiring, his gratitude more warm, and his love of country touched by a holier flame?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>Who, that should see erected in shades, like these, even a cenotaph to the memory of a man like <persName n="Buckminster,,,,," id="n0211.0007.00076.00272" reg="mostcommon:Buckminster,nomatch:0"><surname>Buckminster</surname></persName>, that prodigy of early genius, would not feel that there is an excellence over which death hath no power, but which lives on through all time, still freshening with the lapse of ages?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>But passing from those, who by their talents and virtues have shed lustre on the annals of mankind, to cases of mere private bereavement, who, that should deposit in shades, like these, the remains of a beloved friend, would not feel a secret pleasure in the thought, that the simple inscription to his worth would receive the passing tribute of a sigh from <num value="1000">thousands</num> of kindred hearts?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>That the stranger and the traveller would linger on the spot with a feeling of reverence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>That they, the very mourners themselves, when they should revisit it, would find there the verdant sod, and the fragrant flower, and the breezy shade?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>That they might there, unseen, except of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, offer up their prayers, or indulge <pb id="p.77" n="77"/> the luxury of grief?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>That they might there realize, in its full force, the affecting beatitude of the scriptures: <quote>Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>Surely, surely, we have not done all our duty, if there yet remains a single incentive to human virtue, without its due play in the action of life, or a single stream of happiness, which has not been made to flow in upon the waters of affliction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>Considerations like those which have been suggested, have for a long time turned the thoughts of many distinguished citizens to the importance of some more appropriate places of sepulture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>There is a growing sense in the community of the inconveniences and painful associations, not to speak of the unhealthiness of interments, beneath our churches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>The tide, which is flowing with such a steady and widening current into the narrow peninsula of our metropolis, not only forbids the enlargement of the common limits, but admonishes us of the increasing dangers to the ashes of the dead from its disturbing movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>Already in other cities, the church-yards are closing against the admission of new incumbents, and begin to exhibit the sad spectacle of promiscuous ruins and intermingled graves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>We are, therefore, but anticipating at the present moment, the desires, nay, the necessities of the next generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>We are but exercising a decent anxiety to secure an inviolable home for ourselves and our posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>We are but inviting our children and their descendants, to what the <rs>Moravian Brothers</rs> have, with such exquisite propriety, designated as <quote>the <rs type="place">Field</rs> of Peace.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/><pb id="p.78" n="78"/></p> 
<p>A rural Cemetery seems to combine in itself all the advantages which can be proposed to gratify human feelings, or tranquillize human fears; to secure the best religious influences, and to cherish all those associations which cast a cheerful light over the darkness of the grave.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>And what spot can be more appropriate than this, for such a purpose?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>Nature seems to point it out with significant energy, as the favorite retirement of the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>There are around us all the varied features of her beauty and grandeur &mdash; the forest-crowned heights; the abrupt acclivity; the sheltered valley; the deep glen; the glassy glade; and the silent grove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>Here are the lofty oak, the beach, that <quote>wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,</quote> the rustling pine, and the drooping willow;--the tree, that sheds its pale leaves with every autumn, a fit emblem of our own transitory bloom; and the evergreen, with its perennial shoots, instructing us that <quote>the wintery blast of death kills not the buds of virtue.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>Here is the thick shrubbery to protect and conceal the new-made grave; and there is the wild-flower creeping along the narrow path, and planting its seeds in the upturned earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>All around us there breathes a solemn calm, as if we were in the bosom of a wilderness, broken only by the breeze as it murmurs through the tops of the forest, or by the notes of the warbler pouring forth his matin or his evening song.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>Ascend but a few steps, and what a change of scenery to surprise and delight us. We seem, as it were in an instant, to pass from the confines of death to the bright and balmy regions of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>Below us flows the winding <rs>Charles</rs> with its rippling current, like the stream of time hastening to the ocean of eternity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>In the distance, <pb id="p.79" n="79"/> the city,--at once the object of our admiration and our love,--rears its proud eminences, its glittering spires, its lofty towers, its graceful mansions, its curling smoke, its crowded haunts of business and pleasure, which speak to the eye, and yet leave a noiseless loneliness on the ear. Again we turn, and the walls of our venerable University rise before us, with many a recollection of happy days passed there in the interchange of study and friendship, and many a grateful thought of the affluence of its learning, which has adorned and nourished the literature of our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>Again we turn, and the cultivated farm, the neat cottage, the village church, the sparkling lake, the rich valley, and the distant hills, are before us through opening vistas; and we breathe amidst the fresh and varied labors of man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>There is, therefore, within our reach, every variety of natural and artificial scenery, which is fitted to awaken emotions of the highest and most affecting character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>We stand, as it were, upon the borders of <num value="2">two</num> worlds; and as the mood of our minds may be, we may gather lessons of profound wisdom by contrasting the <num value="1">one</num> with the other, or indulge in the dreams of hope and ambition, or solace our hearts by melancholy meditations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>Who is there, that in the contemplation of such a scene, is not ready to exclaim with the enthusiasm of the poet, <quote rend="blockquote"><lg type="couplet"><l>Mine be the breezy hill, that skirts the down,</l> <l>Where a green, grassy turf is all I crave,</l> <l>With here and there a violet bestrown,</l> <l>Fast by a brook, or fountain's murmuring wave,</l> <l>And many an evening sun shine sweetly on my grave!</l></lg></quote> <pb id="p.80" n="80"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>And we are met here to consecrate this spot, by these solemn ceremonies, to such a purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>The Legislature of this Commonwealth, with a parental foresight has clothed the <rs>Horticultural Society</rs> with authority (if I may use its own language) to make a perpetual dedication of it, as a <placeName reg="Rural Cemetery">Rural Cemetery</placeName> or Burying-Ground, and to plant and embellish it with shrubbery, and flowers, and trees, and walks, and other rural ornaments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>And I stand here by the order and in behalf of this Society, to declare that, by these services, it is to be deemed henceforth and forever so dedicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/><placeName reg="Mount Auburn, Athens, Ohio" key="tgn,2526994">Mount Auburn</placeName>, in the noblest sense, belongs no longer to the living, but to the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>What a multitude of thoughts crowd upon the mind in the contemplation of such a scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>How much of the future, even in its far distant reaches, rises before us with all its persuasive realities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>Take but <num value="1">one</num> little narrow space of time, and how affecting are its associations!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>Within the flight of <num value="0.5">one half</num> century, how many of the great, the good, and the wise, will be gathered here!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>How many in the loveliness of infancy, the beauty of youth, the vigor of manhood, and the maturity of age, will lie down here, and dwell in the bosom of their mother earth!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>The rich and the poor, the gay and the wretched, the favorites of <num value="1000">thousands</num>, and the forsaken of the world, the stranger in his solitary grave, and the patriarch surrounded by the kindred of a long lineage!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>How many will here bury their brightest hopes, or blasted expectations!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>How many bitter tears will here be shed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>How many agonizing sighs will here be heaved!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>How many trembling <pb id="p.81" n="81"/> feet will cross the pathways, and returning, leave behind them the dearest objects of their reverence or their love!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>And if this were all, sad indeed, and funereal would be our thoughts; gloomy, indeed, would be these shades, and desolate these prospects.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>But-thanks be to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>--the evils, which he permits, have their attendant mercies, and are blessings in disguise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>The bruised reed will not be laid utterly prostrate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>The wounded heart will not always bleed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>The voice of consolation will spring up in the midst of the silence of these regions of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>The mourner will revisit these shades with a secret, though melancholy pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>The hand of friendship will delight to cherish the flowers, and the shrubs, that fringe the lowly grave, or the sculptured monument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>The earliest beams of the morning will play upon these summits with a refreshing cheerfulness; and the lingering tints of evening hover on them with a tranquilizing glow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>Spring will invite thither the footsteps of the young by its opening foliage; and Autumn detain the contemplative by its latest bloom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>The votary of learning and science will here learn to elevate his genius by the holiest studies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>The devout will here offer up the silent tribute of pity, or the prayer of gratitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>The rivalries of the world will here drop from the heart: the spirit of forgiveness will gather new impulses; the selfishness of avarice will be checked; the restlessness of ambition will be rebuked; vanity will let fall its plumes; and pride, as it sees <quote>what shadows we are, and what shadows we pursue,</quote> will acknowledge the value of virtue as far, immeasurably far, beyond that of fame.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>But that, which will be ever present, pervading these shades, like the noon-day sun, and shedding cheerfulness <pb id="p.82" n="82"/> around, is the consciousness, the irrepressible consciousness, amidst all these lessons of human mortality, of the higher truth, that we are beings, not of time but of eternity-<quote>that this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality</quote> --that this is but the threshold and starting-point of an existence, compared with whose duration the ocean is but as a drop, nay the whole creation an evanescent quantity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>Let us banish, then, the thought, that this is to be the abode of a gloom, which will haunt the imagination by its terrors, or chill the heart by its solitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>Let us cultivate feelings and sentiments more worthy of ourselves, and more worthy of christianity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>Of the design of this we have spoken before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>It has met with general favor; but the material has not escaped criticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>Many persons are dissatisfied with even a good wooden imitation of stone; they would like stone itself much better; and we do not hesitate to adopt that opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>For certain strictures on the inscription which will be noticed over the porch of the entrance, we entertain less respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/><hi rend="italics"></hi> <quote><hi rend="italics">Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall return to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> who gave it</hi>,</quote> is the verse;--a selection, we need not remind the reader, from the Old Testament, and a happy illustration, it seems to us, (as has been remarked) of the fact that the holy men of old were no strangers to the consolations and hopes of the doctrine of the soul's immortality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>It has been said that the inscription has not enough in it of that cheerfulness with which the christian should look to the future, and which the gospel is so eminently adapted to encourage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>It appears to us, on the contrary, that the import of these words looks obviously enough to the great distinction, that while the body of man must moulder into dust, his soul shall survive the grave, and live forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/><pb id="p.84" n="84"/></p> 
<p>On another point, the author of an elaborate and beautiful essay in <num value="1">one</num> of our quarterly publications, throws out some intimations, respecting the justice of which there may be various opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>He suggests that the appearance of cultivated flowers in the enclosure is not at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> entirely in keeping with the associations of the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>Every thing that is not indigenous to the spot, seems as though it must be of an unnatural or sickly nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>There may be some reason, he says, for placing a particular flower or shrub at the grave of a friend; but the rearing of flowers for mere ornament, or for any other purpose than the <num value="1">one</num> just specified, seems like life amidst corruption, or the intrusion of art amidst the wildness of nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>All who have made themselves acquainted, even superficially, with the character and career of this distinguished individual will feel, at the sight of the name on the marble, a mingled emotion of admiration and sorrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>Whether they may believe, or not, in the theory of which he was the advocate, they will not deny him the tribute due to those signal virtues, talents, and labors, whose merit was in no degree dependent on either the soundness or success of the system to which he was so much devoted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>Of <hi rend="italics">this</hi>, various opinions are and will be entertained, but not of his professional accomplishments, of his spirit as a philosophical enquirer, or his excellencies as a man. Many undisputed services he rendered also to the cause of science, and to that, at the same time, of humanity at large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>He gave, for example, wherever he went, a fresh impulse to just and liberal views of education, and of the vast importance of its general diffusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>In all his studies, in all his pursuits, he aimed, indeed, at the utmost good <pb id="p.90" n="90"/> of his species.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>He was a philanthropist, no less than a philosopher,--a lover of his race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>Truly was it said of him, at the time of his decease, by <num value="1">one</num> who knew him well-<quote>There was <num value="1">one</num> thing which he thought <hi rend="italics">most</hi> needful for us, and for all men to learn and study; and another, which of all things he deemed the most important to accomplish or to strive after.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>If we sum up all that he taught us of the harmony and variety of our physical organization, of the temperaments, the animal, intellectual, and moral faculties, was not all this instruction given for a single object to teach us, or rather, induce us to study, the <hi rend="italics">nature of man</hi> And if we think over all he taught of education, of natural morality and religion, we find that the practical end of all his inquiries was the <hi rend="italics">improvement</hi> and <hi rend="italics">happiness of man</hi>.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>From the same authority we learn that, being asked what peculiar effect he thought his system had had on his own mind-he said, that without it he would have been a misanthrope; that the knowledge of human nature had taught him to love, respect and pity his fellow-beings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>Those, adds this writer, who attended his lectures will never forget how his countenance was lighted up with joy whenever he spoke of a trait of kindness evinced by any being, whether he was looking up at the noble head of <placeName key="tgn,7014255" n="1.000 28" reg="oberlin, lorain, ohio">Oberlin</placeName>, or pointing at the skull of a little dog that had been remarkable for his kindly disposition; and how the light of his countenance suddenly changed into darkness, and his voice almost failed him, when with averted looks and hand he pointed at the portrait of the man who murdered his own mother.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>That this kindliness was eminently characteristic of <pb id="p.91" n="91"/> <persName n="Spurzheim,,,,," id="n0211.0008.00091.00276" reg="nearbymention:Spurzheim,Gaspar,,,"><surname>Spurzheim</surname></persName>, is well known to all who enjoyed his acquaintance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>A warm and wide-embracing benevolence was at the foundation of all his philosophy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>His views were intended at least to be practically useful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>Nor was it in sentiment alone that this spirit appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/><persName n="Spurzheim,,,,," id="n0211.0008.00091.00277" reg="nearbymention:Spurzheim,Gaspar,,,"><surname>Spurzheim</surname></persName> was not <num value="1">one</num> of those philanthropists whose goodness evaporates in lectures,--who satisfy their consciences and their hearts by talking and writing, and gaining some reputation, and giving an impulse perhaps to other men. His was a character full of energy and execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>He was restless to <hi rend="italics">do</hi> the good he thought of and talked of. He was anxious for actual reform wherever it was needed, and willing to lead himself in the work, cost what it might.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>No appeal, indeed, of any description, where the heart was concerned, was ever made to him in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/><quote>He always,</quote> continues his biographer, <quote>chose for himself, in preference, the performance of that duty which required the greater effort and self-denial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>It is certainly not going too far if we say that his anxious desire to fulfil his engagements in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> and in <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, was the chief cause of his death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>Though oppressed by indisposition, and contrary to the entreaties of his medical friends, he continued to lecture; and once in his last sickness, he started up with the intention to dress himself, to go to <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>All who have attended his course remember the unwearied kindness with which he was wont to hear and answer any question that was put to him at the close of his lecture by any <num value="1">one</num> of his hearers, even when he was quite exhausted.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>It is an interesting trait, added in another connection to this account of him, that he never would allow any <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.92" n="92"/> who was truly desirous of studying his system, to be excluded from his lectures by poverty; and was always glad in such a case to give tickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>He intrusted several of his friends, we are told, with a number of tickets for such persons as they knew to be desirous of studying Phrenology, and too poor to attend his lectures; and he added the special request that their names might not be mentioned to him, lest their feelings should be hurt by the favor he had bestowed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>We have alluded to his spirit as a philosophical inquirer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>In this respect it may be that justice is not universally rendered him. It was his fortune to encounter prejudice of various kinds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>Some, who gave him credit for benevolent intentions, yet considered him almost a mono-maniac, in regard to phrenology at least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>This mistake arose from ignorance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>He could not have endured or encountered a tithe of what he did but for this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>A sober enthusiast, however a candid, reasonable enthusiast, he certainly was. As the grand end he aimed at was man's good, so the grand means to that end, in his estimate, was <hi rend="italics">truth</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>In <num value="1">one</num> of his works he proposes the question, <quote>What should be the aim of every description of study?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>He answers, <quote>The establishment of truth, and the attainment of perfection;</quote> and he quotes the saying of <persName><foreName>Confucius</foreName></persName>, <quote>Truth is the law of heaven, and perfection is the beginning and end of all things.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>If you do not find it true to nature, have done with phrenology; but if it be true, you cannot learn it <num value="1">one</num> minute too soon.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>Of the particular denominational tenets of <persName n="Spurzheim,,,,," id="n0211.0008.00093.00280" reg="nearbymention:Spurzheim,Gaspar,,,"><surname>Spurzheim</surname></persName> we are not informed, but his biographer has much to say of the general religious temper of his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>This was infused, too, into his philosophy as well as his conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>We are told that the great aim of all his inquiries into human nature, was, to search out the will of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in the creation of man. Obedience to His laws he considered as the highest wisdom, and most expansive freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>In speaking of theories of man's invention, he remarked, <quote>We say a great deal, and we think we do a great deal; we would be wise above what is given, and work upon the works of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; but it is all nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>Thy will be done!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>The Father is always overlooked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>We look to him perhaps amid great trials and on great occasions; but not in smaller things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>We say, <quote>they are too little.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>It is this in which we err. Can anything that concerns his children, be too little for a Father .</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>It is in every way characteristic of this illustrious man that while he resided in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, he spent a great part of his time in visiting our public institutions, our hospitals, prisons, house of industry, churches, and schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>He was also present at the public exhibitions of our university, and showed a hearty interest in every effort at improvement, in individuals and in the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>His heart was with us in every attempt at improving our laws, at keeping up the purity of morals in the community, reforming the vicious, raising the condition of the poor, and particularly in the <pb id="p.94" n="94"/> education of the young, in which he was desirous of aiding us by the results of his own observation and reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>At the same time <quote>his modesty and his habits of patient investigation prevented him from judging hastily of what he noticed.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>We have been led, almost inadvertently, into these sketches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>The subject has a charm in it. It is the contemplation of human nature in its best estate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>If any other apology than this were necessary for such a tribute, the reader might be reminded of <persName n="Spurzheim,,,,," id="n0211.0008.00094.00281" reg="nearbymention:Spurzheim,Gaspar,,,"><surname>Spurzheim</surname></persName>'s celebrity as a public man. Hence no little curiosity concerning him,--a curiosity not always gratified by an impartial statement of facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>Nor can we forget that he came among us an advocate, however mistaken, for great and sacred interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>In these he labored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>To these he devoted himself as a victim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>We are told that the great exertions which <persName n="Spurzheim,Doctor,,,," id="n0211.0008.00094.00282" reg="nearbymention:Spurzheim,Gaspar,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Spurzheim</surname></persName> made during his residence in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, proved at last too powerful even for his strong and vigorous constitution, which seemed more energetic in proportion to his labors, while it was actually sinking under them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>Besides his course on the anatomy of the brain, which he delivered at the <orgName n="Medical School" type="school">Medical School</orgName>, he lectured every day, alternately, at the <rs>Boston Athenaeum</rs>, and at <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>His great physical and mental effort during the delivery of his lectures, was obvious from the large drops that rolled down his face, forming a striking contrast with the easy, calm, systematic, persuasive and sportive character of his delivery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>But these efforts brought on an exhaustion of his system, which was rendered dangerous by his frequent rides at night, when returning home from his lectures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>At <num value="1">one</num> of his last lectures in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> (the <pb id="p.95" n="95"/> beautiful discourse on charity and mutual forbearance) while he was diffusing light and warmth among his hearers, he was seen suddenly shivering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>From that time his illness increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>lie grew more feverish, but he continued to lecture, contrary to the entreaties of his friends, saying, that he would not disappoint his hearers, and that the exertion would help him to throw off his indisposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>From the beginning of his course the number of his hearers had been continually increasing with every lecture; at last he exchanged his lecture-room at the <name>Athenaeum</name> for the large hall in the <rs type="place">Temple</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>He had finished his course in this city with the exception of <num value="1">one</num>; and in order to prevent any uncertainty with regard to the place where he was to give his concluding lecture, and desirous of consulting the wishes of his hearers, before he left the hall, he inquired of them, <quote>In what place shall we meet next time?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>He knew not that there was no human voice which could rightly answer that question.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>Few things have interested me more, in my rambles about the world, and especially over the old countries, than the visits I have made to grave-yards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>In <hi rend="italics">this</hi> country, the traveller, however much his mind may be so disposed, can depend but little on such sources of enjoyment and edification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>It is a sad fault of us <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0211.0009.00193.00530" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>, that, for the most part, we neglect the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>We are inclined, <hi rend="italics">generally</hi>, I know, to disparage external appearances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1036"/>We have a contempt for ceremonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/>We are a hard, practical people, intensely absorbed in business, surrounded by circumstances which accustom us to the livelier kinds of excitement, educated and impelled in every way to undervalue and lose sight of what may be called the graces of civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/>These peculiarities, the evidence and influence of which are plainly perceptible through every department of action and sphere of life among us, are to be <pb id="p.194" n="194"/> accounted for easily enough ;--no explanation need be given of them here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1039"/>Nor will the reader require to be reminded of the better qualities with which, in the usual order of things, and as a matter almost of moral necessity, they are commonly connected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/>Still, however, the feeling in question &mdash; the want of feeling, I am tempted to call it-must be set down against us as a <quote>fault.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>Undeniable at least it is, that <num value="1">one</num> of the most attractive and prepossessing of all the minor virtues of a community,--the gentler graces I have spoken of as neglected by ourselves &mdash; is a thoughtful and tender care for the departed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/>I will not enlarge on this subject, so far as <hi rend="italics">we</hi> are concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1043"/>Much, in illustration of my meaning, and in confirmation of the justice of these general strictures, might be said concerning the condition in which the grave-yards of this country are too frequently kept;--of their repulsiveness in too many cases, of their unattractiveness in almost all. But the details would be sadly disagreeable; and if, in the course of these sketches of mine, I can hope to suggest to any mind any impression which may help ever so little to improve the state of things I refer to, I trust that what has already been said directly to the purpose, with the allusions which may occur in the sequel, will be sufficient for the end. I bear in mind, too, that an improvement is already going on. We are not, in our mortuary observances, quite so heathenish as we have been;--so <hi rend="italics">Turkish</hi>, I was going to say, but that would be a libel which a comparatively amiable people do not deserve;--so altogether <quote>practical,</quote> that is the <rs>American</rs> version of this characteristic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/>The feeling in which the beautiful establishment at <pb id="p.195" n="195"/> <placeName reg="Mount Auburn, Athens, Ohio" key="tgn,2526994">Mount Auburn</placeName> originated, and the spirit which has sustained it so well, are consolatory symptoms of a better era of public sentiment about to dawn; and that example itself has done very much to bring on the more <quote>perfect day.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/>Let us hope that it will do still more; that its sweet influence will go forth through the whole length and breadth of the land; that every new establishment which is raised around us, in generous emulation of this, may be a fresh helper, a resistless pleader like itself, in this good cause of the heart; and that so the time may be duly hastened, when even the pilgrim who comes from other climes to visit us, may read, wherever he wanders, on the face of the soil, the character and praise of the living generation in the works which shall indicate their remembrance of those that have passed away.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>Let us hope for these things, I say. And meanwhile we may borrow a leaf, as I hinted before, from the Old World's journal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>Who that has roamed over those countries in anything like a leisurely way, or at all as a traveller should, whom aught animates beyond this restless, rankling, eternal thirst for helter-skelter business and filthy lucre, but has a memory richly stored, for the rest of his life-time, even out of the grave-yards alone?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/>A memory!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1049"/>aye, and a heart, too ;--stored with loveliest images of thought,--with feelings that are a ceaseless fountain to refresh the soul,--with pictures of sweet, sequestered scenes reposing in the mind's meditations, all beautiful as in nature itself,sunny and still as the little lakes of the hills,--haunting and soothing <num value="1">one</num>'s spirit evermore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1050"/><placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, most of all, is full of these resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1052"/>There is a hearty homeliness in the <rs>English</rs> character, with all its faults, which delights in these outward observances of affectionate respect for the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1053"/>If the <quote>old countrymen</quote> are not remarkable for a quick sensibility, there is nevertheless a permanent and steady ardor in their temperament, which <quote>wears well.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1054"/>They may not form hasty attachments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1055"/>They are slow to cultivate a common acquaintance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1056"/>Even the <quote>sociable</quote> spirit which seems to be due to the indifferent circle <num value="1">one</num> daily meets with, seems often a drudgery to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/>But they have hearts, nevertheless, and these are <quote>in the right place ;</quote> --none the less so for the lack of that superficially social and almost physical effervescence of emotion and expression which has obtained for some nations the credit of being more amiable, while in fact they are only more sprightly, and perhaps at the same time more vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1058"/>Among no people, at all events, are instances of persevering fidelity in friendship between the living more numerous; and it is the same feeling, the same substantial, homely, hearty character, which, in equal proportion, manifests itself, in a <num value="1000">thousand</num> most touching though simple forms of association between the departed generation and those who survive them, through all the humblest hamlets of the land.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>I remember a spot among the <rs type="place">Cumberland hills</rs> that might have inspired even poetry like this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>It was the little church, (and church-yard) of <placeName key="tgn,7010158" n="1.000 1" reg="borrowdale,cumbria,england,united kingdom,europe">Borrowdale</placeName>;--the smallest building of its class in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, it is stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>Another such picture the pedestrian may have to think of, who, sauntering along the hedge-lined bye-ways of the lovely <placeName reg="Isle of Wight, England, United Kingdom" key="tgn,7011430">Isle of Wight</placeName>, suddenly stays his steps, unconsciously, to gaze over into the sweet, small garden of graves clustering all round the humble but exquisite Church of St. Lawrence; some of them, on the upper side of the mountain-slope, nearly as high as the moss-grown roof of the building, over which <num value="1">one</num> sees, from the road-side, a glimpse of the lonely sea, spread out <pb id="p.201" n="201"/> at the base of the mountain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>Nothing can exceed the beauty of the proportions of this ancient edifice, miniatural as it is. The slope of the hill it is set on is so steep that the road just mentioned is cut into it like a groove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>On the upper side, a cliff towers up over <num value="1">one</num>'s head, almost perpendicularly, some <measure n="100feet" type="distance">hundred feet</measure>, yet everywhere, from the moisture of the climate, and the richness of the soil that still clings to the rocks, mantled with a soft, silky robe of the sweetest verdure the eye ever saw, brightly spotted with clusters of flowers, and small shrubs flourishing out from the crevices, and sometimes laden with vines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>Below the church, the scene grows wilder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>The hill-side shows, far up from the water-mark, traces of the fierce power of the element which sleeps now so quietly at its feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/><placeName reg="Huge sea">Huge sea</placeName>-stained points of crags peer out grimly on every side; the vegetation is withered, and disappears, as we wind farther down by the dizzy foot-path the egg-hunters have trodden; and now breaks out upon us, in its full volume, that terrible thunder of the surge of even these slumbering waves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/>But it is a thunder that comes only in mellowed music to him who saunters, as I did, in the noiseless avenues of the little sanctuary in the niche of the hill-side above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>Many a time I stayed my steps to listen to this murmur, as borne on the gusts of the <quote>sweet sea air, sweet and strange,</quote> it swelled and fell at intervals, like spirit-voices whispering to those who lay beneath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/>It was in this grave-yard I noticed a humble heap piled over the remains of <num value="1">one</num> whose annals, as the modest marble at its head recorded them, touched my heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1105"/>It was a young, beautiful girl.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>She came to this neighborhood, I think, from <placeName reg="Wales, United Kingdom, Europe" key="tgn,7002443">Wales</placeName>, probably for the restoration of health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1130"/>The <rs>Moravians</rs> believe so, at least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1131"/>They appreciate justly, too, the moral influence, the religious science, of a grave-yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1132"/>They do not deem it either decent to leave it neglected, or necessary to make it frightful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/>The little village, which I visited <num value="1">one</num> Sabbath morning, is embosomed in trees, and surrounded with the famed emerald verdure of the country on every side ;--divided into a small, harmonious arrangement of shaded streets, that, but for the neat rows of cottages, and regular beds of flowers on either hand, look more like natural lanes;--<quote>remote from cities,</quote> in a word;--serene, peaceful, beautiful as a <quote>thought of Paradise.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1134"/>I attended service in the little church, and afterwards walked through the grave-yard which lies on the table-land of a gentle green swell behind it, skirted with flourishing and flowery hedges, and spotted over, in hollow and heap, with checks of a mellow <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> sunshine, sifted through branches of leaning trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1138"/>Yes, and it fills us with hope, it moves us to prayer, even to think of such a spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1139"/>What quietness, what beauty of visible nature, what harmony of rural sounds, what soothing emblems, in a word, of precious and glorious spiritual speculations, and what stirring yet soothing monitors to christian philosophy and to holy emotion were mingled with all the more customary and palpable minutiae of the scene!-Would that <hi rend="italics">my</hi> dust, too, might lie at last in some such <quote>grave-yard of the <name>Patriarchs</name>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1140"/>Oh! leave me not to the noisomeness of a burial in the city;--I like not the thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1141"/>Let the birds sing over me, if they will, and the green <pb id="p.206" n="206"/> grass spring in the sunshine, and the violet and primrose flourish and glow in its midst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1142"/>I would have the place no terror, at least, to those in whose kind memory I still might live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1143"/>I would have it to console and cheer; to rouse, gently, to solemn but not gloomy meditation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1144"/>The poorest village in the land, with all its rude obscurity, might easily be rich enough for this, --richer than countless wealth can make the more than deadly dwelling-place of him whose bones are shelved away in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> or in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> vaults.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1150"/>Aye, and to other feelings, I fear, less in unison with that which is, or should be, the reigning spirit of the place;--perhaps to some but too well adapted to counteract it;--to sensations, to mere excitement, more than to feelings, in the better sense of the word, at all. On this point I have intimated my impressions already, in speaking of the style of the <rs type="place">Cathedrals</rs> and other places of the kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1151"/>I would not be deemed insensible to the just worth of the associations now in question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1152"/>More dignity there certainly is in these, than in mere external decorations; and yet,--I acknowledge it freely,--I would not have the dust of <placeName reg="Auburn, Lee, Alabama" key="tgn,7013342">Auburn</placeName> to groan <pb id="p.207" n="207"/> with such a load of the <num value="1">one</num>, scarcely more than of the other.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1153"/>He who has visited the <rs type="place">Parisian Cemetery</rs> whose <foreign lang="fr">&eacute;clat</foreign> imposes on the imagination much more, let me say, than it can on the eyes-knows full well the expense at which the increase of its honors and the influence of its antiquity have been obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1154"/>He who has <hi rend="italics">not</hi> been there, can easily conceive what I mean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1155"/>I will not dwell on such a theme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1156"/>The more it is considered, however, the less disposed, I am sure, we shall be,--with all our awe and admiration at what is so fine and so famous in the <quote>splendid</quote> Cemeteries of the Old World &mdash; the less disposed we shall be, on the whole, to envy them anything of either the moral or he material grandeur they possess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1157"/>So long, at least, as we can multiply <placeName reg="Mount Auburns">Mount Auburns</placeName> around us, it surely must be so. I know it is not sound philosophy to anticipate what we may not like when it comes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1158"/>It is most unwise to burthen ourselves with the expected troubles of future generations, who doubtless will not only take the liberty to judge of their own condition for themselves, but will find something-many things --to make amends for whatever evil it may include.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1159"/>And yet, for such as incline to be discontented with the historical poverty of <placeName reg="Mount Auburn, Athens, Ohio" key="tgn,2526994">Mount Auburn</placeName>,--for such, still more, as commit the error of confounding this want (a comparative want) of mere <hi rend="italics">classical</hi> with <num value="1">one</num> of <hi rend="italics">moral</hi> character, in its wider sense,--for those, most especially, if any indeed there are, who covet the paraphernalia which intellect, and industry, and wealth and pride have certainly accumulated so richly round the burial-places of even the truly great and good, as well <pb id="p.208" n="208"/> as the illustriously insignificant or obnoxious dead of other lands,--for these, it may be well to consider how much better and fitter an establishment is <placeName reg="Mount Auburn, Athens, Ohio" key="tgn,2526994">Mount Auburn</placeName>, for the purposes its founders and friends had in view when they reared it, than <foreign lang="fr"><persName n="Pere,,,,," id="n0211.0009.00208.00537" reg="mostcommon:Pere,nomatch:0"><surname>Pere</surname></persName> la Chaise</foreign>, or anything of the sort, could possibly be in its place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1160"/>How much better to muse in for the living, or to sleep in for the dead, than some few ages hence it may become, when opulence, and luxury, and fashion, and all the whims of humanity, and all the workings of time, shall have made it more like the great show-place of the gay and vain French Capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1161"/>Then indeed there will be over it a halo of glory; but will its charm for the heart remain the same?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1162"/>Future generations may be prouder of it than we are, but can they be as fond?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1163"/>Will not the musing moralist of those days, sometimes, weary of sensations and splendor, turn or seek to turn back in imagination to this uncrowded quietude and primitive simplicity-this glistering turf, --these cool, sweet-winding avenues and paths-this green, fresh beauty of the woods?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1164"/>Will he not think how once, with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> flush of the spring's verdure, and how again in the summer's sultry hours, the denizens of the city's populous streets <hi rend="italics">here</hi> at least could wrap themselves so soon in solitude and bloom?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1165"/>How <hi rend="italics">here</hi>, even those to whom trial and toil had made the world a weariness for the time, might learn, from the depths of nature, in intervals of solemn but refreshing meditation, to look forth with complacency, and renew themselves as they looked, through the tree-tops of the mountain-summit, on many a glorious vision of what had seemed to them before <pb id="p.209" n="209"/> no better than a <quote>foul and pestilential congregation of vapors?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1166"/>How <hi rend="italics">here</hi>, the mourner, left alone with his Maker and <hi rend="italics">His</hi> works,--save only these modest monuments of sacred sorrow, and faith, and love, so precious to the soul,--might find himself at length consoled by the soothing ministrations of nature, and made, by all the mighty though gentle influences of reason, of religion, awakened to new life within him, a wiser and even a happier being than before?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1167"/>Yes, such surely will be some of the reflections and the regrets of future generations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1168"/>Let it be ours to appreciate what we possess. </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1190"/>The tomb is not so interesting as the grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1191"/>It savors of pride in those who can now be proud no longer; of distinction, where all are equal; of a feeling of eminence even under the hand of the great leveller of all our dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1192"/>And how useless to us are all the ensigns of magnificence that can be piled up above our bed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1193"/>What though a sepulchral lamp throw its light up to the princely vaults under which my remains repose!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1194"/>They would rest as quietly were there no lamp there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1195"/>The sleeping dust fears nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1196"/>No dreams disturb it. It would not mark the neglect, should the sepulchral lamp be suffered to expire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1197"/>It will not complain of the neglect, should it never be lighted again.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1198"/>And why should my cold clay be imprisoned with so much care Why thus immured, to keep it, as it would seem, from mingling with its kindred clay?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1199"/>When <quote>that which warmed it once</quote> animates it no <pb id="p.218" n="218"/> more, what is there in my dust, that it should be thus jealously guarded?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1200"/>Is it lovely now in the eyes of those who may have once loved me?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1201"/>Will my children, or the children of my children, visit my vaulted chamber?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1202"/>They may, indeed, summon the courage to descend into my still abode, and gaze by torch-light upon the black and mouldering visage, which, not their memory, but my escutcheon, not their love, but their pride, may tell them is the face of their father; and this may eloquently remind them how soon the builder of the house of death must take up his abode in it; how soon the dust that we have, must mingle with the dust that we are; but still there is a feeling of horror in the atmosphere of the tomb, which chills all that is affectionate and tender in the emotions that lead them into it, and is anything but favorable to the moral uses to which the living may convert the dwellings of the dead; uses that will be secured by every daughter of affliction, of whom it may be said, as it was said of the sorrowing <rs>Mary</rs>, <quote>She goeth unto the <hi rend="italics">grave</hi> to weep there.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1203"/>Yes; though all whom I have loved or venerated sleep within its walls, I retreat from the tomb, the moment that I can do it without impiety, or even with decency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1204"/>But I am differently affected when, with the rising sun, or by the light of the melancholy moon, I go alone to my mother's grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1205"/>There I love to linger; and, while there, I hear the wind sigh over <num value="1">one</num> who often sighed for me. I breathe an air refreshed by the grass that draws its strength from the bosom from which I drew mine; and, in the drops of dew that tremble upon it, I see the tears that so often bedewed her eyes as she <pb id="p.219" n="219"/> breathed forth a prayer that her children might cherish her memory, and escape from the pollutions of the world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1206"/>Yes; to the lover of nature, in its simplicity, the grave is more interesting and more instructive than the tomb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1207"/>It speaks in a voice as full of truth, and more full of tenderness, to those who visit it to indulge their griefs, or to hold spiritual converse with the sainted spirits that are gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1208"/>And if the spirit that, while on earth, was loved by us, does not, when it leaves the earth, lose all interest in its crumbling tenement, would <hi rend="italics">it</hi> not rather see the child of earth clasped again to the sweet bosom of its mother, to be again incorporated with her substance, to assume again a form attractive and lovely, to become again the recipient of light, an object of admiration, and a conscious medium of enjoyment, than that it should lie and moulder away in darkness and silence &mdash; a cause of offence to strangers, and a source of terror to those whom it still loves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1209"/>Rather than see our own clay thus dwelling in coldness and solitude, neither receiving enjoyment nor imparting it, would not our spirits, purged from all vanity and pride, be pleased to know that it was starting forth again into life and loveliness; that it was moving again in the fair light of heaven, and bathed in its showers; that it was giving forth the perfume of the rose, or blushing with its great beauty; or, that, having clothed the oak with its robe of summer, it was throwing a broad shade over the home of our children; or that, having once more felt the frost of death, it was falling withered upon their graves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1210"/>The grave, when visited thoughtfully and alone, <pb id="p.220" n="220"/> cannot but exert a favorable moral influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1211"/>It has already been remarked that it speaks in a voice full of tenderness and of truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1212"/>Its instructions reach not the ear, indeed, but they do reach the heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1213"/>By it, the departed friend is recalled in all but a visible presence, and by it, <quote>he, being dead, yet speaketh.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1214"/>At such a time, how faithfully will the grave of your friend remind you of the pleasant moments when you were conversing with him in the living tones of affection and truth!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1215"/>when you were opening your hearts to each other, and becoming partakers, each of the other's hopes and purposes and cares; when with a generous confidence those secret things were shown to <num value="1">one</num> another, which were locked up in the heart from all the world beside!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1216"/>Will the grave of your friend allow you to forget his single-heartedness in serving you; his unsullied honor; his plighted faith; his readiness to expose himself to danger that he might save you from it; and the calmness with which, when he perceived that his hold on life was breaking away, he gave up life's hopes, and, turning his eyes for the last time to the light, and looking up, for the last time, to the faces of those who loved him, he bade farewell to all, and gave up his spirit to the disposal of his <name n="God" type="God">God</name>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1217"/>Is all this forgotten, when you stand by his grave?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1218"/>Does not his very grave speak to you?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1219"/>Does it not bear its testimony to the value of youthful purity and truth, and of the power of an humble confidence in the <rs>Most High</rs>, to give dignity to the character of the young, and to disarm Death of the most dreadful of his weapons, even when he comes for his most dreadful work &mdash; to cut off life in the beauty of its morning?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1220"/><pb id="p.221" n="221"/> Does there not come up from his grave a voice, like that which comes down from the skies &mdash; a voice not meant for the ear, but addressed to the heart, and felt by the heart as the kindest and most serious tones of the living friend were never felt?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1221"/>And the children of sorrow &mdash; they whose hands have prepared a resting place for their parents in the <quote>Garden of graves,</quote> shall go to that garden and find that their hearts are made better by offering there the sacrifice of filial piety, or by listening there to the rebuke which a guilty ear will hear coming forth from the dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1222"/>The leaf that rustles on his father's grave shall tell the undutiful son of disquiet sleep beneath it. The gray hairs of his father went down to the grave, not in sorrow alone, but in shame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1223"/>The follies of his son made them thus go down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1224"/>Son of disobedience, that tall grass, sighing over thy father's dust, whispers a rebuke to thee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1225"/>It speaks of thy waywardness when a child; of thy want of filial reverence in maturer years; of thy contempt for a parent's counsels; and of thy disregard of his feelings, his infirmities, and his prayers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1226"/>It will be well for thee if the grave, by its rebuke, shall so chasten thee for thine iniquity, that thine own soul, when called away, may meet thy father and thy <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in peace.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1227"/>How different is the language of thy father's grave to thee, my brother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1228"/>Does it not recall the many hours to thy remembrance, which were given to his service?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1229"/>Were not his thin locks decently composed, in death, by thine own hand?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1230"/>Did not his dim eye turn to thee in <quote>the inevitable hour</quote> as to the pleasant light of the sun?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1231"/>Did he not, with his last grasp, take hold of thy <pb id="p.222" n="222"/> hand, and did not his pressure of thy hand tell thee, when his tongue could not, that it was <hi rend="italics">that</hi> which had upheld and comforted him in his decaying strength; and was it not his last prayer that thou mightest be blest in thine own children as he had been blest in his?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1232"/>He has gone to his rest and his reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1233"/>But his sepulchre is green, and at thy coming, though it gives him not to thy embrace, it restores him to thy grateful remembrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1234"/>His counsels are again addressed to thine ear. His upright life is still before thine eye. His devotion to thine own highest interests sinks down, with new weight, into the depths of thy heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1235"/>Thou catchest again the religious tones of his morning and evening prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1236"/>They speak of peace to the venerated dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1237"/>They are full of hope and consolation to the living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1238"/>They tell how <quote>blessed are the dead that die in the <rs>Lord</rs>,</quote> how sweetly <quote>they rest from their labors,</quote> and how happy it is for them that <quote>their works do follow them.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1239"/>And thou, my sister, why dost thou go forth alone to visit thy mother's grave?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1240"/>Will she recognise thy footfall at the door of her narrow house?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1241"/>Will she give thee a mother's welcome, and a mother's blessing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1242"/>Her blessing shall indeed meet thee there, though not her welcome; for <hi rend="italics">there</hi> shall gather round thee the sacred remembrances of her care and her love for thee; the remembrance of her gentle admonitions, her patience and faithfulness; of her spirit of forbearance and meekness under provocation, and of that ever wakeful principle of industry, neatness and order, which always made her home so pleasant to those whom she loved; and <hi rend="italics">there</hi> shall visit thee, like <num value="1">one</num> of <pb id="p.223" n="223"/> the spirits of the blest, the thought of her own blessed spirit, as it rose in fervent prayers for the welfare and salvation of those who were given to her charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1243"/>She will speak to thee there, again, as she often spoke in life, of the hour that is coming, when thou, who didst once sleep upon her bosom, shalt sleep by her side, being gathered to the great congregation of the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1244"/>She will speak to thee, from her grave, of the worth of innocence, of the importance of chastening the extravagance of thy young hopes, and of looking thoughtfilly and seriously upon the world as a scene of trying duties and severe temptations, of the countless evils that join hand in hand and follow on in the train of a single folly, and of the momentous bearing of thy present course upon thy peace in this life, and upon thy condition when thy dust shall be mingling with hers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1245"/>Then, <quote rend="blockquote"><lg type="couplet"><l>Let Vanity adorn the marble tomb</l> <l>With trophies, rhymes, and scutcheons of renown,</l> <l>In the deep dungeon of some gothic dome,</l> <l>Where night and desolation ever frown.</l> <l>Mine be the breezy hill that skirts the down,</l> <l>Where a green grassy turf is all I crave,</l> <l>With here and there a violet bestrown,</l> <l>Fast by a brook, or fountain's murmuring wave;</l> <l>And many an evening sun shine sweetly on my grave.</l></lg></quote> </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1328"/>In a little time longer, while summer was still in its prime, the fairy structure of the <rs type="place">Temple</rs> arose on the summit of the knoll, amid the solemn shadows of the trees, yet often gladdened with bright sunshine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1329"/>It was built of white marble, with slender and graceful pillars, supporting a vaulted dome; and beneath the centre of this dome, upon a pedestal, was a slab of dark-veined marble, on which books and music might be strewn.

<p>The flowers that spring up on the sunny side of hillocks, beneath remnants of snow-banks, are very small and entirely scentless, and the little beauty which is imputed to them, is chiefly from contrast with the desolation and coldness in which they are found.</p></quote> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1372"/>The death of a friend who never spared a fault of my character, nor found a virtue which he did not praise, had cast a gloom over my mind, which no previous deprivation had produced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1373"/>I remember how <pb id="p.247" n="247"/> sceptical and heart-smitten-(not heart-broken-the broken heart always believes)-I stood at his grave, while the clergyman touched too little on his virtues, and proclaimed,with a humble confidence, that he would spring from the tomb to an immortality of happiness; and suggested the promises of Scripture, and argued with logical precision, from texts and analogies, that my friend should rise from the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1374"/>Despondency is not more the child than the parent of unbelief,--deep grief makes us selfish, and the naturally timid and nervous lose that confidence in promises, including their own particular wish, which they yield to them when the benefit of others is alone proposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1375"/>A little learning is dangerous in such matters; I suffered a mental argument upon the probability of an event which I so much desired, to displace the simple faith which would have produced comparative happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/>Those who have contended with, and at length yielded to this despondency, alone know its painful operation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1377"/>Occupied with thoughts resulting from such an unpleasant train of mind, I followed into a burying ground, in the suburbs of the city, a small train of persons, not more than a dozen, who had come to bury <num value="1">one</num> of their acquaintance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1378"/>The clergyman in attendance was leading a little boy by the hand, who seemed to be the only relative of the deceased in the slender group.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1379"/>I gathered with them round the grave, and when the plain coffin was lowered down, the child burst forth in uncontrollable grief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1380"/>The little fellow had no <num value="1">one</num> left to whom he could look for affection, or who could address him in tones of parental kindness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1381"/><pb id="p.248" n="248"/> The last of his kinsfolk was in the grave, and he was alone.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1382"/>When the clamorous grief of the child had a little subsided, the clergyman addressed us with the customary exhortation to accept the monition, and be prepared; and, turning to the child, he added: <quote>She is not to. remain in this grave forever; as true as the grass which is now chilled with the frost of the season, shall spring to greenness and life in a few months, so true shall your another come up from that grave to another life, to a life of happiness, I hope.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1383"/>The attendants shovelled in the earth upon the coffin, and some <num value="1">one</num> took little <persName><foreName>William</foreName></persName>, the child, by the hand, and led him forth from the lowly tenement of his mother.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1384"/>Late in the ensuing spring, I was in the neighborhood of the same burying-ground, and seeing the gate open, I walked among the graves for some time, reading the names of the dead, and wondering what strange disease could snatch off so many younger than myself --when, recollecting that I was near the grave of the poor widow, buried the previous autumn, I turned to see what had been done to preserve the memory of <num value="1">one</num> so utterly destitute of earthly friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1385"/>To my surprise, I found the most desirable of all mementos for a mother's sepulchre:--little <persName><foreName>William</foreName></persName> was sitting near the head of the now sunken grave, looking intently upon some green shoots that had come forth, with the warmth of spring, from the soil that covered his mother's coffin.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1386"/><persName><foreName>William</foreName></persName> started at my approach, and would have left the place; it was long before I could induce him to tarry; and, indeed, I did not win his confidence, until I <pb id="p.249" n="249"/> told him that I was present when they buried his mother, and had marked his tears at the time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1387"/><quote> Then you heard the minister say, that my mother would come up out of this grave,</quote> said little <persName><foreName>William</foreName></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1388"/><quote>I did.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1389"/><quote>It is true, is it not?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1390"/>asked he, in a tone of confidence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1391"/><quote>I most firmly believe it,</quote> said I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1392"/></p> 
<p><quote>Believe it,</quote> said the child-<quote>believe it &mdash; I thought you knew it &mdash; I know it.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/><quote>How do you know it, my dear?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1394"/><quote>The minister said, that as true as the grass would grow up, and the flowers bloom in spring, so true would my mother rise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1395"/>I came a few days afterward, and planted flower-seed on the grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1396"/>The grass came green in this burying-ground long ago; and I watched every day for the flowers, and to-day they have come up too-see them breaking through the ground!-by and by mammy will come again.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1397"/>A smile of exulting hope played on the features of the boy; and I felt pained at disturbing the faith and confidence with which he was animated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1398"/><quote>But, my little child,</quote> said I, <quote>it is not here that your poor mother will rise.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1399"/><quote>Yes, here,</quote> said he, with emphasis-<quote>here they placed her, and here I have come ever since the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blade of grass was green this year.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1400"/>I looked around, and saw that the tiny feet of the child had trod out the herbage at the grave-side, so constant had been his attendance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1401"/>What a faithful watch-keeper!-What mother would desire a richer <pb id="p.250" n="250"/> monument than the form of her only son, bending tearful, but hoping, over her grave?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1402"/><quote>But, <persName><foreName>William</foreName></persName>,</quote> said I, <quote>it is in another world that she will arise,</quote> --and I attempted to explain to him the nature of that promise which he had mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1403"/>The child was confused, and he appeared neither pleased nor satisfied.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1404"/><quote> If mammy is not coming back to me &mdash; if she is not to come up here, what shall I do?-I cannot stay without her.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1405"/><quote>You shall go to her,</quote> said I, adopting the language of the <name>Scripture</name>-<quote>you shall go to her, but she shall not come again to you.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1406"/><quote>Let me go, then,</quote> said <persName><foreName>William</foreName></persName>, <quote>let me go now, that I may rise with mammy.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1407"/><quote><persName><foreName>William</foreName></persName>,</quote> said I, pointing down to the plants just breaking through the ground, <quote>the seed which is sown there, would not have come up, if it had not been ripe; so you must wait till your appointed time, until your end cometh.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1408"/><quote><hi rend="italics">Then</hi> I shall see her?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1409"/><quote>I surely hope so.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1410"/><quote>I will wait, then,</quote> said the child, <quote>but I thought I should see her soon &mdash; I thought I should meet her <hi rend="italics">here</hi>.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1411"/>And he did. In a month, <persName><foreName>William</foreName></persName> ceased to wait; and they opened his mother's grave, and placed his little coffin on hers &mdash; it was the only wish the child expressed in dying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1412"/>Better teachers than I had instructed him in the way to meet his mother; and young as the little sufferer was, he had learned that all labors and hopes of happiness, short of Heaven, were profitless and vain. </p></div2>
