<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>to understand correctly the popular feeling in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> at the beginning of the <rs>War</rs> between the <name>States</name>, it is necessary to look back more than a generation prior to that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>It may be said that the political contest between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> began, or at least assumed definite form, with the application of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> for admission into the <rs>Union</rs>, and that the feeling of hostility in the <rs>North</rs> engendered by that contest, toward the <rs>State</rs>, has grown with the lapse of time to the present day. During the <num value="70">seventy</num> odd years which have passed, the habit of misrepresenting the <rs>State</rs> and its people has become fixed and ineradicable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>In <dateStruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></dateStruct> <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> sought admission into the <rs>Union</rs> on terms entirely in accordance with the requirements of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> and the precedents established in the admission of other States&mdash;<placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> and <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> in the <rs>South</rs>, and <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName>, <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName> and <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> in the <rs>North</rs>&mdash;with the difference that the former recognized the institution of domestic slavery, and the latter did not. But in each instance the people of the <rs>State</rs> seeking admission had decided the <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> question for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>The territorial laws of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> recognized slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>On that account the <rs>Northern</rs> members of Congress refused to admit it. The Southern members favored its admission, holding that the people of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> had a right to determine the question as they pleased when they came to frame their State constitution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>In this the <rs>North</rs> was manifestly the aggressor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Its position had no warrant in the <rs>Constitution</rs>, in the laws or in the precedents bearing on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The contest that followed was prolonged and violent, but finally the <rs>State</rs> was admitted in <dateStruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></dateStruct>, as the result of the adoption of a compromise&mdash;known as the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>, the principal provisions of which were that <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> should be admitted as a slaveholding State, but after that time there should be no slavery north of the line of <num value="36">36</num> degrees and <measure n="30minutes" type="date">30 minutes</measure>, while in States south of that line, formed out of territory embraced in the <rs>Louisiana</rs> purchase, slavery might or might not exist as the people determined in organizing State governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>In this way the immediate question at issue was settled, not in accordance with the law, or the constitutional right of the people organizing new States to make their own laws, but by drawing an arbitrary line across the country from east to west, and giving those on <num value="1">one</num> side the right of self-government, and denying it to those on the other side.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>This arrangement was not satisfactory to the people of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, because it imposed upon them conditions on entering the <rs>Union</rs> which had not been imposed on the people of other States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>But it put a stop to the agitation of the slavery question for a generation, as far as the admission of new States was concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>In the meantime, however, it became more and more a political issue, attended with a growing feeling of bitterness on both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>But it did not assume practical form again until <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>, organized out of a part of the territory <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> acquired from <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> chiefly by the blood and courage of Southern soldiers, asked admission into the <rs>Union</rs>, when it was revived in more than its original spirit of sectional violence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>As a result of this agitation the <orgName n="Missouri Legislature" type="legislature">Missouri legislature</orgName> adopted resolutions affirming the rights of the <name>States</name> as interpreted by Southern statesmen, and instructing its senators in Congress to co-operate with the senators of the other Southern States in any measures they might adopt as a defense against the encroachments and aggressions of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/><persName n="Benton,Senator,Thomas,H.,," id="n0252.0001.00005.00002" reg="default:Benton,Thomas,H.,,"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Benton</surname></persName> refused to obey these instructions and appealed to the people of the <rs>State</rs> in vindication of his course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>He was serving his <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> term in the <name>Senate</name>, and his hold on the people of the <rs>State</rs> was very strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>But notwithstanding his great ability and popularity, he was beaten for re-election to the <name>Senate</name> and was afterward successively defeated for governor and for representative in Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The resolutions of instructions remained unrepealed on the statute-book until after the war. They were a protest against the indignity put upon the <rs>State</rs> in the terms imposed upon it in its admission to the <rs>Union</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The events that followed the passage by Congress of the <rs>Kansas</rs>-<placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> bill still further aggravated public sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>A struggle began in <placeName key="tgn,7007254" n="1.000 16" reg="kansas">Kansas</placeName> between the partisans of the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> for the political control of the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>, which was carried on with great and constantly increasing bitterness on both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> it was a legitimate contest between actual settlers, but it soon became <num value="1">one</num> of fraud and violence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Emigrant aid societies were formed in the <rs>North</rs>, which sent men by the hundreds and <num value="1000">thousands</num> into the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>, with the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> in <num value="1">one</num> hand and a <persName n="Sharpe,,,,," id="n0252.0001.00005.00003" reg="mostcommon:Sharpe,nomatch:0"><surname>Sharpe</surname></persName>'s rifle in the other, who manifested their fanaticism and lawlessness by denouncing the <rs>Union</rs> as <q direct="unspecified">a league with hell,</q> the <rs>Constitution</rs> as <q direct="unspecified">a covenant with death,</q> and the national flag as <q direct="unspecified">a flaunting lie.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>They were organized to plunder <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> and kill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Missourians, as well as settlers from other Southern States, went into the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> in large numbers to maintain their own rights as defined in the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the laws, and the rights of the <rs>South</rs> as a joint owner in the common territory of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>To some extent the national authorities attempted to preserve the peace, and kept the combatants apart, but the struggle was really the beginning of the war that followed with all its attendant train of evils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/><placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> suffered more from the pilfering propensities of these armed bands of Northern emigrants than from their fighting capacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Their efforts were directed chiefly to abducting slaves from their <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> owners, but they did not disdain other crimes and other species of property when opportunity offered.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Thus <placeName key="tgn,7007523" n="1.000 133" reg="missouri">Missouri</placeName>, from the time it became a State&mdash;indeed, from before that time&mdash;was deeply involved in the struggle between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>, and was frequently the scene of the most heated part of the struggle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The experiences of its people in the settlement of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> had forced upon them a knowledge of what Northern supremacy meant, as far as they and the people of the <rs>South</rs> were concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>These things ought to have solidified public sentiment and made the <rs>State</rs> practically a unit when the time for action came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>To some extent they did, or rather would have done so, if the <rs>Southern</rs> leaders in the <rs>State</rs> had had a conception of the nature of the crisis that confronted them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>But they were politicians, men shrewd enough in their way, who knew the written and unwritten laws of party management thoroughly, while war and revolution were entirely beyond their mental range, and consequently they delayed, hesitated and frittered away their strength, laboriously doing nothing, until the storm burst upon them and found them totally unprepared.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>At the presidential election in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> cast its electoral vote for <persName n="Douglas,,Stephen,A.,," id="n0252.0001.00006.00004" reg="default:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><foreName>Stephen</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It was the only <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> State that did so. The total vote was <num value="165000">165,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Of these, <num value="58801">58,801</num> were given to the <name>Douglas</name> electors; <num value="58373">58,373</num> to the <rs>Bell</rs> electors; <num value="31317">31,317</num> to the <name>Breckinridge</name> electors; and <num value="17165">17,165</num> to the <rs>Lincoln</rs> electors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The vote, however, did not correctly represent the sentiment of the people of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/><persName n="Jackson,,Claiborne,F.,," id="n0252.0001.00007.00005" reg="default:Jackson,Claiborne,F.,,"><foreName>Claiborne</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was the regular Democratic nominee for governor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>He was a good man, in a personal sense, and thoroughly loyal to the institutions of the <rs>State</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>But as a matter of policy he declared his intention early in the campaign to support <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0252.0001.00007.00006" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> for <rs type="role2">President</rs>, thereby giving him the appearance of being the nominee and representative of the party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The more pronounced Southern men, the <rs>Breckinridge Democrats</rs>, refused to follow his lead, and nominated <persName n="Jackson,,Hancock,,," id="n0252.0001.00007.00007" reg="default:Jackson,Hancock,,,"><foreName>Hancock</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> for governor, with a fill electoral ticket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>No doubt <persName n="Jackson,,Claiborne,F.,," id="n0252.0001.00007.00008" reg="default:Jackson,Claiborne,F.,,"><foreName>Claiborne</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> thought he was acting for the best interests of the <rs>State</rs> and the cause to which he was strongly attached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>But he was not. His precipitate movement in favor of <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0252.0001.00007.00009" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> divided Southern men and produced discord among them, when it was desirable above all things that they should be united and should act together in harmony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> great mistake made by the <rs>Southern</rs> leaders in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, and it was followed with fatal consistency by others that brought many disasters on the people of the <rs>State</rs>, and possibly changed the whole current of American history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The supporters of <persName n="Breckinridge,,,,," id="n0252.0001.00007.00010" reg="mostcommon:Breckinridge,John,C.,,:2"><surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName>, of <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0252.0001.00007.00011" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> and of <persName n="Bell,,,,," id="n0252.0001.00007.00012" reg="nearbymention:Bell,William,H.,,"><surname>Bell</surname></persName> were in the main opposed to the sectional purposes of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, to the election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0252.0001.00007.00013" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, to the policy of the coercion of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, and when the test came would have been united in regard to the position <rs>Missouri</rs> should take.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>But dissensions and antagonisms were created among them by bad management.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The vote showed the <name>Republicans</name> were out. numbered <num value="9">nine</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Their strength was mainly in <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName> and the counties along the south side of the <rs>Missouri</rs> <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> river between <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName> and <placeName reg="Jefferson City, Cole, Missouri" key="tgn,7013811">Jefferson City</placeName>, in which, as well as in <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, there was a large element of Germans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The seeds of Republicanism had been sown in the <rs>State</rs> by <persName n="Benton,,Thomas,H.,," id="n0252.0001.00008.00014" reg="default:Benton,Thomas,H.,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Benton</surname></persName>, when he appealed to the people against the instructions of the legislature <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>In the contest which ensued his friends had established an organ in <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName> to advocate his cause, and his supporters, under the leadership of <persName n="Blair,,Francis,P.,," id="n0252.0001.00008.00015" reg="default:Blair,Francis,P.,,"><foreName>Francis</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Blair</surname>, <genName n="junior">Jr.</genName></persName>, had been organized into a party and were a compact and fanatical force in the bodypol-itic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/><persName n="Blair,,,,," id="n0252.0001.00008.00016" reg="nearbymention:Blair,Francis,P.,,"><surname>Blair</surname></persName> was a man of great strength of character, and a fearless and sagacious party leader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>In the politics of the <rs>State</rs> he was an outlaw, and in the stormy period preceding the war he was more or less a revolutionist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>He had nothing to lose and everything to gain by a bold course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Besides this, circumstances favored him. When <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0252.0001.00008.00017" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> made up his cabinet, his brother, <persName n="Blair,Judge,Montgomery,,," id="n0252.0001.00008.00018" reg="default:Blair,Montgomery,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <foreName>Montgomery</foreName> <surname>Blair</surname></persName>, was appointed postmaster-general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Thus <persName n="Blair,,Frank,,," id="n0252.0001.00008.00019" reg="default:Blair,Frank,,,"><foreName>Frank</foreName> <surname>Blair</surname></persName> was the unquestioned leader of a considerable and well-organized party in the <rs>State</rs>, with the resources of the <rs>Federal</rs> government practically at his disposal as far as <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> was concerned, and was well fitted by nature and experience to play a bold part in the terrible drama of war and revolution which was impending.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Notwithstanding the comparative insignificance of the <rs>Republican</rs> vote in the <rs>State</rs>, the contest was not as unequal as it appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/><persName n="Blair,,,,," id="n0252.0001.00008.00020" reg="nearbymention:Blair,Frank,,,"><surname>Blair</surname></persName> knew the elements with which he had to deal as well as his opponents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>He knew, besides, what the policy of the <rs>Federal</rs> government would be, and what support he could depend on. Both sides were getting ready to strike a decisive blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>But the <rs>Southern</rs> leaders were playing an open hand, while he was playing a secret <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The State occupied a precarious position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>It was surrounded on <num value="3">three</num> sides by Northern States, which were organizing and arming their citizens to invade it. The troops of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, <placeName reg="Iowa" key="tgn,7007253">Iowa</placeName> <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> and <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> were almost as much at <persName n="Blair,,,,," id="n0252.0001.00009.00021" reg="nearbymention:Blair,Frank,,,"><surname>Blair</surname></persName>'s disposal as those he was actively but secretly organizing in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Both sides were waiting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The Southern leaders did not know what they wanted to do, and consequently were not doing anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>As politicians they were shirking the responsibility of action, and waiting for some overt act on the part of the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Their attitude and policy suited <persName n="Blair,,,,," id="n0252.0001.00009.00022" reg="nearbymention:Blair,Frank,,,"><surname>Blair</surname></persName> exactly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>He was waiting, too, but at the same time he was working with a definite idea and aim. He was exerting to the utmost his great powers as a political intriguer to cause misunderstandings and dissensions among his opponents throughout the <rs>State</rs>, and organizing, arming and drilling his forces in <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>In fact, he was getting them ready to commit the overt act for which his opponents were waiting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>All he wanted was time, and they were giving him time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>At that period <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName> was not only the commercial but the financial and political center of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The banks, the great commercial houses and the manufacturing establishments were located there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The railroads centered there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>The newspapers that most strongly influenced the thought of the people and most nearly controlled their action were published there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>All of these agencies were combined and were used openly or covertly against the integrity of the <rs>State</rs> and the <rs>Southern</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The Democrat, the old <placeName reg="Benton, Scott, Missouri" key="tgn,2058027">Benton</placeName> organ, which was established in the first place through the influence of <persName n="Blair,,,,," id="n0252.0001.00009.00023" reg="nearbymention:Blair,Frank,,,"><surname>Blair</surname></persName>, and was still controlled by him, was unreservedly for the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> and the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The <rs>Bulletin</rs> was ultra-Southern, but it was newly established, of limited circulation and influence, and was short-lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The Republican, the oldest paper in the <rs>State</rs> and probably the leading paper of the <rs type="place">Mississippi valley</rs>, was the organ of the bankers, the merchants, the manufacturers, the property owners and business men of the city, and, to a great extent, of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>The position of the <name>Democrat</name> <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> and the <name>Bulletin</name> was defined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>That of the <rs>Republican</rs> was not. Nominally it was Southern in feeling and policy, but really it changed its course with every change in the situation, and while talking of the rights of the people and the honor of the <rs>State</rs>, was playing into the hands of the enemies of both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>It was an enemy in the camp of the <rs>Southern Rights</rs> men, and did their cause all the harm it could.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>During this period of doubt and delay, Missourians had an object lesson at home that might have taught them a world of wisdom, if they had chosen to learn the lesson.
