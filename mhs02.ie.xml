<p>No mention is made of this suit in the records of the <orgName n="General Court" type="misc">General Court</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>In <dateStruct value="1879--"><year reg="1879">1879</year></dateStruct>, when the old drawbridge was removed to prepare for the foundations of the present stone bridge, a portion of an ancient structure was found on the north side of the river, and the removal of this old structure disclosed the methods of its construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, there was laid in the mud at right angles with the river, and a little below low-water mark, a quantity of brush nearly a foot in thickness, cut about <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> in length; then on this brush, laid lengthwise the river, were large elm logs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Then on these logs was built the abutment of the bridge, composed of logs roughly squared by the axe, laid in courses, each course laid in an opposite direction from the <num value="1">one</num> on which it rested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>This abutment was about <measure n="10feet" type="distance">10 feet</measure> in width, and was found to be in a perfect state of preservation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>From what is known of the preservation of wood in tidal waters we may be justified in believing that this old structure was the work of <persName n="Cradock,Governor,,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00011" reg="nearbymention:Cradock,Mathew,,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Cradock</surname></persName>'s agent in those early days.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It is probable that the same method of construction was followed the entire length of the northerly abutment, as the bridge extended some <measure n="70feet" type="distance">70 feet</measure> northerly from the <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> present line of the river, the river having been filled in since the bridge was built.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>There is a remarkably soft bottom to the river on the westerly side of the bridge; in driving piles for the present stone bridge <num value="1">one</num> was driven <measure n="64feet" type="distance">64 feet</measure> below low-water mark, and it settled <measure n="6inches" type="distance">6 inches</measure> under the last blow of the hammer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>This soft bottom runs diagonally across the river; while about <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the north abutment extends over this soft place, only about <measure n="6feet" type="distance">6 feet</measure> of the pier is so situated, and there are no traces of it under the south abutment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>This bridge, as will be hereinafter shown, was both rude and weak in its construction, in need of frequent repairs, and, from the peculiar circumstances connected with its care and maintenance, a source of constant annoyance, not only to the inhabitants of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 29" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>, but also to the inhabitants of the neighboring towns, as well as to the <rs>Great</rs> and <orgName n="General Court" type="misc">General Court</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>All printed authorities have heretofore fixed the date of the commencement of this bridge as being in the year <dateStruct value="1638--"><year reg="1638">1638</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>On a plan of <persName n="Winthrop,Governor,,,," id="n0334.0002.00003.00012" reg="mostcommon:Winthrop,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Winthrop</surname></persName>'s <placeName reg="Ten Hills farm">Ten Hills farm</placeName>, dated <dateStruct value="-8-"><month reg="8">the 8th month</month></dateStruct> (<dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>), <dateStruct value="1637--"><year reg="1637">1637</year></dateStruct>, is shown a bridge across <placeName reg="Mistick river">Mistick river</placeName> at the place now occupied by the present bridge; there is a singular fact connected with the location of this bridge, which would seem to indicate that if not commenced earlier than the year <dateStruct value="1637--"><year reg="1637">1637</year></dateStruct> (as we believe it to have been) it was at least in contemplation as early as the year <dateStruct value="1631--"><year reg="1631">1631</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It was in that year that <persName n="Winthrop,Governor,,,," id="n0334.0002.00003.00013" reg="mostcommon:Winthrop,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Winthrop</surname></persName> received the grant of land known as the <rs type="place">Ten Hills farm</rs>, and the northwest corner of this grant was located exactly at the southeast corner of the bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Could this have been accidental, or was it by design?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>As early as the year <dateStruct value="1629--"><year reg="1629">1629</year></dateStruct> there were settlers on both sides of the <placeName reg="Mistick river">Mistick river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>On the north side <persName n="Cradock,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0002.00003.00014" reg="nearbymention:Cradock,Mathew,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cradock</surname></persName>'s men had established themselves, and on the south side <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName>'s territory was being located <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>As these and other settlements in the <name>Colony</name> grew, it must have been early evident that the ford at <placeName reg="Mistick">Mistick</placeName>, with the water in the river from o to <measure n="2feet" type="distance">2 feet</measure> deep twice in <measure n="24hours" type="date">24 hours</measure>, would be inadequate to the wants of the growing towns, especially as <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 29" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> was in the line of travel between the <name>north</name> and <name>south</name> shores of <placeName reg="Massachusetts Bay, Massachusetts, United States" key="tgn,7007518">Massachusetts bay</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>It is entirely within the bounds of possibility to believe that the site of this bridge was selected as early as the year <dateStruct value="1631--"><year reg="1631">1631</year></dateStruct>, if not before.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>This decision of the town to build with a draw was no doubt influenced by the fact that a shipyard had already been established above the bridge, and as early as the year <dateStruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></dateStruct> a ship of <num value="370">370</num> tons burden had been built there.

<p>The smallness of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 29" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>'s appropriation prevents its library from doing as much good as it otherwise could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1053"/>It has for some time sent carefully selected collections of books each month to the public schools, with very gratifying results as shown in the better class of books called for by the children when they come to the library.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1054"/>But it is to be regretted that for lack of funds it cannot supply its patrons with many books in the fields of art, literature, and science well worth the reading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1055"/>Few people are aware how much more valuable is even the smallest library with an exhaustive catalogue of its contents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1056"/>In the report of the <orgName n="Education Bureau" type="bureau">Bureau of Education</orgName>, speaking of the <rs>Boston Public Library</rs>, the writer says that <q direct="unspecified">its peculiar advantage lies less in the great number of its books than in the fact that exhaustive catalogues guide the student to just the book he wants; he is not compelled to swell the statistics of circulation by taking out <num value="10">ten</num> books that were not wanted in order to find the volume of which he stands in need.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/>During the last <num value="9">nine</num> or <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> the effect of the modern library movement has been more manifest in this place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1058"/>The progress of the library up to <dateStruct value="1890--"><year reg="1890">1890</year></dateStruct>, as can be seen, was slow, and the trustees felt that something more was needed to make the people acquainted with the wealth of literature at their command, and to have the library do the most effective work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1059"/>Up to this date the library of about <num value="15000">15,000</num> volumes had not been classified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1060"/>Some attempt had been made to furnish extra books for the use of the <orgName n="High School" type="school">High School</orgName> pupils, but very little reference work, on any special subject in a library, can be advantageously done with books arranged only according to size, and new measures were necessarily taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1061"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> change made under the new conditions was to remove the open-work screen between the library and the people; then upon shelves in the delivery room were put the newer and more desirable books to allow the patrons to handle and to make their selection from them instead of from the catalogue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1062"/>Gradually people were admitted to <pb id="p.90" n="90"/> the stack-room to make their choice from any part of the library.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1063"/>The age limit of <measure n="14years" type="date">14 years</measure> for admission to the privileges of the library was abolished and a careful selection of books for young people was made; the idea being not only to stimulate a reading habit in the young people, but to introduce them to the best in literature.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1064"/>These radical changes had a corresponding effect upon the use of the library; the circulation of books for home use having increased from a little over <num value="28000">28,000</num> in <dateStruct value="1890--"><year reg="1890">1890</year></dateStruct> to <num value="71456">71,456</num> in <dateStruct value="1897--"><year reg="1897">1897</year></dateStruct>, and again more room was found to be indispensable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1065"/>As the result of an appropriation made by the city in that year, supplemented by the generosity of <num value="1">one</num> of the library trustees, a new, commodious, well-lighted, well-ventilated stack-room was built, with a present capacity for <num value="30000">30,000</num> volumes, and room in the future for <num value="30000">30,000</num> more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1066"/>The old part of the library was enlarged and very much improved, and is devoted to the reading and reference room, a librarian's room, a delivery room, and a good-sized, sunny, children's room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1067"/>From the patronage in this department we are assured that the younger people find the library a pleasant place to come to. It has been the aim to make the people feel an ownership in the library; all unnecessary restrictions have been removed; the red tape has been cut in many places; no personal cards for the patrons to care for or lose; no weary waiting while books are charged; no long lists of books an absolute necessity; the privilege of <num value="2">two</num> books to each person has been granted; and the number which any person can have for reference or study limited only by the supply at our command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>In all ways is it the desire to make the library seem like a home library.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1069"/>But the most satisfying, the most necessary, the most effective work is that done with the schools and the younger people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1070"/>A lack of sufficient funds, the last year, has very much restricted this important work, but we have great hope for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/>The value and importance of a child's early reading can hardly be overestimated; <pb id="p.91" n="91"/> cultivate in the children a taste for good reading, patriotism, love of truth and beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/>The choice should be not of books written down to children, but the purity of their English should be <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> considerations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1076"/>The plan has been to send a selection of <num value="12">twelve</num> books to every schoolroom in the city, these books to be used by the children in the school, or to be taken home by them at the discretion of the teacher; thus, by making the <num value="59">fifty-nine</num> school-rooms so many branch libraries, every part of the city is represented in our patrons; at the end of <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure> these books are replaced by another set. By this choice selection not only is the reading of the young people improved, but they learn to have a higher ideal in their own choice; thus preparing themselves to become better citizens and able to take their part in the future welfare of the community.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1305"/>His favorite discourses he often repeated at home; and in his later years he delivered them wholly <hi rend="italics">memoriter</hi> whenever he preached on exchange, so that they became generally celebrated in the neighboring parishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1323"/>He sometimes committed to memory parts of his sermons with which he had taken peculiar pains, or which he thought peculiarly important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1324"/>When he came to deliver these he would deliberately take off his spectacles, and either lay them on the pulpit cushion or hold them in <num value="1">one</num> hand; then with an altered and subdued voice, and with a sort of gathering up of his whole person, he would say, <quote>My brethren,</quote> and then followed the earnest appeal, or the powerful statement, or the vivid description.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1326"/>The truth was, he was originally a man of strong and somewhat rough nature, who abhorred disguise, pretence, and quackery of all sorts,&mdash; open, bold, and uncompromising, thinking much of realities and little of conventional standards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1327"/>He had rough impulses, and spoke blunt words; but I am sure that what might appear to be unkindness or rudeness was in reality the result of uncalculating, spontaneous honesty of soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1330"/>With no little perturbation I complied, and as I read, he would say to some of my youthful crudities of thought or expression, <quote>That won't do; you must alter that.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1498"/>A passage may well be quoted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1499"/><persName n="Jameson,Doctor,,,," id="n0334.0012.00129.00905" reg="nearbymention:Jameson,J.,F.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Jameson</surname></persName> is seeking for an explanation of certain shortcomings in the research and publication work of many of our historical societies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1500"/>He says:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1501"/><q direct="unspecified">In the first place, should we not all agree that our older historical societies have often seemed to conceive of their respective fields and duties in too narrow, and even parochial, a sense?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1502"/>The reason for their existence is, of course, local history, and they win their public support, their money, and their members by devoting themselves to local history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1503"/>But there are some topics of local history which are purely local and nothing else, and there are those which, while no less important to the history of the locality, are also of significance with respect to the larger life of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1504"/>The <orgName n="Historical Society" type="society">historical society</orgName> which devotes itself to the former when it might be doing something to elucidate the latter fails of the best part of its mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1505"/>Is a subject in the history of <pb id="p.130" n="130"/> the locality more worthy of the society's time and money because nobody outside of the locality can by any possibility be expected to take an interest in it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1506"/>On the contrary, it is just these subjects which deaden historical societies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1507"/>If the <rs>State</rs> or the locality has any importance whatever which should make it worth while to have its history studied it is because it has played some part in the life of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1508"/>This is the thing to work at. <hi rend="italics">Hoc opus, hic labor</hi>. Every <num value="1">one</num> knows that <num value="1">one</num> of the leading defects of American historical writing has been that the writers knew too little of other history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1509"/>So it is with local history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1510"/>Neither men nor societies can hope to deal with it rightly unless their minds are full of American history at large and quick to see the relations of their tasks to that which explains them and gives them meaning. . . . With increase of intercommunication purely local feeling has become less acute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1511"/>The number of people who care a rush whether the <rs type="place">Blue Boar Tavern</rs> stood in <address><street n="1 Street">First street</street></address> or in <address><street n="2 Street">Second street</street></address>, or who can excite themselves over silly questions of local priority in this or that small achievement, has grown considerably smaller and is constantly diminishing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1512"/>Meanwhile the number of persons who have read a considerable amount of general American history or who take an intelligent interest in it has greatly increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1513"/>It is to these people that societies must, in the long run, make their appeal for pecuniary and other support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1514"/>It is highly probable that by avoiding fussy antiquarianism and looking chiefly at the larger aspects of local history they would accomplish the difficult feat of serving both <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and <placeName reg="Mammon">Mammon</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1515"/>Not a few of our historical societies consist of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="300">three hundred</num> sustaining members, who like to help in keeping up such an institution, and who are not without interest in American history, but who never attend the meetings, which have become the exclusive property of a few fossilized antiquarians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1516"/>Would not fresh life be brought in if the society were to perceive clearly that its field of <pb id="p.131" n="131"/> work is, rightly stated, <hi rend="italics">American history locally exemplified</hi>?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1517"/></p> 
<p>Thus much for the case as stated by <num value="1">one</num> of our leading historical scholars and teachers, and a practical man withal, who, as may be seen, looks at the question from the business side, as well as from that of sound learning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1518"/>Provincialism is a thing that the modern spirit in history will not tolerate, and local historical societies must keep clear of it if they would march with the spirit of the age and the ages.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1519"/>The <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 29" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> <orgName n="Historical Society" type="society">Historical Society</orgName> cannot be charged with sinning in these directions to any extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1520"/>It is young and it has been conducted through its early organization period with energy, discretion, and breadth of view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1521"/>But because it is young and has a name to make, these considerations of possible policies are pertinent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1522"/>It may be said to have passed the experimental stage and to have become an institution with serious work to do. Its members are studying local history, a library is being collected, and a regular publication is closing its <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> volume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1523"/>The obvious subjects for research, the apparent opportunities, are becoming exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1524"/>In finding new ones the wider view should guide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1525"/>This society has an opportunity to take a place in the front rank of active exemplars of all that is best in historical work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1526"/>The history of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 29" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> runs with that of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1527"/>It has been in the movement of the grand old Commonwealth from the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1528"/>This young society enters a rich field at a time when the full meaning of history is becoming understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/>It has no dry-as-dust policy saddled upon it from past generations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1530"/>In its programs of work, the character of its publications, and the development of its library it may study the best examples and create its own traditions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1531"/>The relation of a local <orgName n="Historical Society" type="society">historical society</orgName> to its community should be as to the past that of a teacher and recorder, and as to the present and future that of an <pb id="p.132" n="132"/> inspiration; for it is characteristic of the new spirit in history that it looks forward as well as backward, and regards the past in its vital relation to the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1532"/>The mistake is often made of regarding that which is farthest distant in point of time as of most interest and value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1533"/>This again is the view of the antiquarian and not of the real historian, who knows no such distinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/>The earliest period in the colonial history of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> has been much more thoroughly exploited than that equally important half century of development that preceded the <name>Revolution</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/>We do not do justice to our mission if we forget that we are making history now, and that while the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> business of the <rs>Medford</rs> <orgName n="Historical Society" type="society">Historical Society</orgName> is to rescue past records before they are entirely lost, it is also and equally its business to see that ample material is properly preserved for later historians to study without obscurity all the phases of its history now enacting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/>It seldom does harm for the institution, like the individual, to magnify its office, and the mission of the local <orgName n="Historical Society" type="society">historical society</orgName> will broaden and deepen the longer it is studied in the true spirit of history. </p><closer><signed><persName n="Start,,Edwin,A.,," id="n0334.0012.00132.00906" reg="default:Start,Edwin,A.,,"><foreName>Edwin</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName>  <surname>Start</surname></persName>.</signed></closer></body></text> </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1634"/><pb id="p.138" n="138"/></p> 
<p>The Board recommend the <rs type="place">Primary Schools</rs> to your particular attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1635"/>They are deeply impressed with the importance of thorough elementary instruction in early childhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1636"/>Wherever this has been neglected and children have gone into the large, <rs type="role2">Master</rs>'s Schools, but ill grounded in the rudiments of education, they have been under great disadvantages which have seldom or never been overcome in after life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1637"/>Great care therefore is necessary in selecting competent and faithful teachers for the <rs type="place">Primary Schools</rs>, where the foundation of all good learning is laid and habits of study commonly determined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1638"/>In order to accomplish these objects the better, the <rs>Committee</rs> recommend that these Schools should in future be kept <measure n="9months" type="date">nine months</measure> in the year instead of <num value="6">six</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1639"/>While they express their satisfaction with the good they have done the past year, they are of opinion that a longer duration would make them proportionately more useful.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1640"/>The <num value="2">two</num> <placeName reg="Grammar Schools">Grammar Schools</placeName> appear, at least, as well as in any previous year, in many respects better, although nearly <num value="40">forty</num> of the best scholars have been removed from them to the <orgName n="High School" type="school">High School</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1641"/>The very encouraging condition of these Schools, notwithstanding the above temporary disadvantage, may be attributed in a great measure to the following causes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1642"/><num value="1">1</num>. We have had able teachers who were deeply interested in the improvement of the schools under their care, and the pupils themselves have been undoubtedly excited to greater diligence by the hope of qualifying themselves for the higher School.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1643"/><num value="2">2</num>. The scholars being more nearly on an equality in age and advancement than they formerly were, it is easier to maintain good order among them by applying methods of government adapted to their years and standing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1644"/><num value="3">3</num>. The limited number of their Studies allows the <name>Masters</name> more time to give them thorough instruction; <pb id="p.139" n="139"/> for they can be formed into fewer and larger classes and taught with more ease and success than they could be, if the more advanced pupils, pursuing different branches of education, were gathered into the same Schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1645"/>The advantage arising from division of labor is well known to all who have any experience in the work of instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1646"/>Accordingly we find that in many towns large enough to afford the expense, separate Schools are established for writing and arithmetic only.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1647"/>The Board are of opinion that the experiment of a <orgName n="High School" type="school">High School</orgName> has so far been as successful as could have been reasonably expected, notwithstanding the disadvantage of a change in Instructors, occasioned by the appointment of the <rs type="role" reg="Master-1">first Master</rs> to an office in the <rs type="place">University</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1648"/>It will be considered that most of the <name>Scholars</name> in this school are but little more than <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> of age, and have been in it too short a time to have advanced to the higher studies, nevertheless its progress has been so considerable and its present condition and habits are so satisfactory, as to justify the belief that it will at no distant period, fulfil the most sanguine expectations of its friends.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/><num value="1">1</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/>On this subject however your Com are enabled with satisfaction to say, that our schools are constantly yielding to this principle of wholesome discipline.&mdash;And that the cases where corporeal punishment has been resorted to&mdash;are decreasing in the full ratio of that&mdash;submission</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1693"/>That after careful examination of all our public schools, we are happy to state that our system of schools, which, <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> ago was a mere matter of theory, and doubtful experiment, is now in the full tide of successful operation,&mdash;Improving not the <hi rend="italics">minds</hi> only&mdash;but the morals&mdash;the habits&mdash;the manners&mdash; and the hearts even, of all the rising generation who choose to avail themselves of their benefits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1694"/>It is a <hi rend="italics">fact</hi> well attested by your Com&mdash;the teachers and others, That cases of <hi rend="italics">lying</hi>, so common to children especialy when <hi rend="italics">uninstructed</hi>, have been few, &amp; far between.&mdash;That <hi rend="italics">Vulgar &amp; obscene</hi> expressions are of rare occurence in and about our schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1695"/>And <hi rend="italics">profanity</hi> that wicked &amp; debasing crime which a few years ago stalked abroad with unblushing front, has mostly not to say entirely shrunk from the light, that <hi rend="italics">mental &amp; moral</hi> cultivation is sheding around our public schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1696"/>And the few <hi rend="italics">exceptions</hi> which your Corn have been called to notice are from that class of <hi rend="italics">large boys</hi> who from necessity in some cases&mdash;but from choice in most, have attended school but a small portion of their time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1697"/>By way of illustration we mention with regret the cases of <num value="2">two</num> large boys who for wilful disrespect to the <name>Teacher</name>&mdash;and disobedience of the rules of the school, have been&mdash;The <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num>, suspended</hi> for <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure>&mdash;The other expelled until he should be willing to change entirely his course.&mdash;and yield implicitly to the rules &amp; dicipline of the school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1698"/>These boys have not returned: Nor is it desirable they should on any other terms&mdash; than those of thorough reformation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1699"/>Much as we regret <pb id="p.145" n="145"/> to see even <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi> youth growing up in ignorance&mdash; wilfulness&mdash;&amp; Sloth, (Those&mdash;fruitful sources of misery &amp; crime:) we heartily acquiesce in that great and truly republican principal of Law&mdash;That the rights &amp; privileges of the many should never be sacrificed to the interest or caprice of the few.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1913"/>Ethelwald, for a moment, observed my attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1915"/>My quick answer was: <quote>What then am I?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1916"/></quote> <quote>When your hair is gray,</quote> he returned, <quote>mine will be white, and in that thought there is comfort.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1917"/>Such a speech from such a creature, how could I do otherwise than feel it as I did,</q> says Idomen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1918"/>Unfortunately there is nothing in the context to tell us just how she did feel it, and it seems difficult to imagine why she should seem so hysterical about it. Between ordinary mortals it would appear a very trivial speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1919"/>From an Ethelwald it must have conveyed to the sensitive soul of Idomen some mysterious overpowering thrill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1920"/>She is invited to dine at a neighboring manor-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1921"/><q direct="unspecified">At table Ethelwald was beside me; I could not eat; pleasure had risen too high.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1922"/></p> 
<p>Ethelwald, however, could eat. Idomen seems more surprised than the reader at this fairly well-recognized peculiarity of mortal man. She watched him <q direct="unspecified">as his white hand passed to his lips, the white morsel of bird on the fork of silver,</q> and thought: <q direct="unspecified">Does he indeed nourish himself with food, and has he blood like mortals?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1923"/></p> 
<p>Idomen is now, of course, free to marry Ethelwald.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1924"/>They meet often, and correspond with each other, but there seem to be strange misunderstandings and quite unnecessary reserves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1925"/>Idomen, woman-like, constantly blames herself, but it is the impression of the reader that Ethelwald did not urge his suit with the warmth of the ordinary lover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1926"/>Probably because he lived so near that <pb id="p.164" n="164"/> sphere where there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1927"/>He tells her at <num value="1">one</num> time: <q direct="unspecified"> <quote>My fortune is small; if I go to <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> promotion may follow.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1928"/>I would have gone with him to the ends of the earth; this I felt, but told him not; some adverse power restrained my tongue.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1929"/>Might not some of the <q direct="unspecified">adverse power</q> come from the simple fact that Ethelwald forgot to ask her?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1930"/>He says he will bring her his picture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1931"/><q direct="unspecified">Have you got it?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1932"/>I ask with emotion; but something invisible restrained me, and I claimed not his promise in words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1933"/><q direct="unspecified">Was not this the crisis of my destiny, and did not my evil fate prevail?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1934"/>Ethelwald writes to Idomen, but <q direct="unspecified">came no more like a <name n="God" type="God">god</name> of Grecian mythology to diffuse light and summer through my lone and wintry habitation.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1935"/>Finally she sends back to him music, papers, gloves, and every little proof of kindness that the beautiful <rs>Ethelwald</rs> had brought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1936"/>Ere a day had passed came an answer from Ethelwald: <q direct="unspecified">With a feeling, haply, like that of the savage warrior of the woods, whose death-song is composed, I broke the seal of this paper, traced by the hand of <num value="1">one</num> far dearer and more charming to me than life to the hunter of the forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1937"/>After telling me his absence had been entirely the result of unavoidable circumstances, <quote>How could you for a moment,</quote> he continues, believe a report which would prove me, if true, a false friend, base in feeling and in character?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1938"/>Ought you not <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to have considered?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1939"/>Everything once mine you have returned!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1940"/>Have I deserved this at your hands?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1941"/>You say, let us not meet again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1942"/>I will not visit you if you desire it not, but if we meet by accident, I cannot be so inconsistent as not to continue to evince for you the regard I have felt and expressed.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1943"/>To the unprejudiced reader this seems the letter of an indifferent friend, a lukewarm lover&mdash;not quite free, even, from that conceited self-love which poses as a martyr, instead of welcoming the burden of the responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1944"/><pb id="p.165" n="165"/></p> 
<p>Not so thinks Idomen; she says: Thus wrote Ethelwald, a seraph in mind as in form, under circumstances where any other man would have shown both pique and resentment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1945"/><q direct="unspecified">All excuse and self-complaisance forsook me. I felt as if unworthy of heaven or earth.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1946"/>And the exasperated reader is inclined to agree with her. From this time on, Idomen gives herself up to despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1947"/>She fully resolves on death, and is constantly devising means to be free from the world and its evils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1948"/>She tries laudanum and arsenic, but finds in them only sickness, and not the death she seeks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1949"/>Her uncle in <placeName reg="Cuba, Allegany, New York" key="tgn,2068750">Cuba</placeName> dies, leaving her some property, and she resolves to return to that dearly-loved land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1951"/><q direct="unspecified">A word or promise must have united our destinies, but neither word nor promise was spoken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1952"/>Something both wished to impart seemed struggling to burst from our lips; but neither had the power of utterance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1954"/></p> 
<p>And so they part never to meet again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1955"/>Ethelwald writes and asks her address, promising a full explanation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1956"/>She answers: <q direct="unspecified">I go, perhaps never to return.

<p>She finds a secluded home in <placeName reg="Cuba, Allegany, New York" key="tgn,2068750">Cuba</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1960"/>A neighboring planter who had wished to marry her, urged by jealousy or some worse passion, told her that her present way of living was not only ruinous to herself, but disgraceful to her child, and to all her relatives in <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1961"/>This so affected the sensitive mind of Idomen that she was stricken with fever; and in a moment of frenzy evaded her attendants and threw herself into the <rs type="place">River</rs> Yumuri, flowing through her lands.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1962"/>As a story, <q direct="unspecified">Idomen</q> will find readers, to-day, only among the curious or among those who, like ourselves, are interested in whatever belongs to the <rs>Medford</rs> of long ago. It cannot, however, be considered merely as a story.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1964"/>As an autobiography it has a pathetic interest, and taken in connection with the meagre account we have of her life, brings the personality of its author more clearly before us. Though written in the stilted phraseology of a bygone time, full of morbid sentimentality and forced situations, it is undoubtedly the heart-history of a Medford woman, ambitious, sensitive, denied the expression of that passionate love and self-sacrificing devotion which filled her soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1965"/>As such it is worthy of our deepest sympathy and most reverent interest.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2046"/>It was, in brief, to invite each member of the <name>Society</name> to join <num value="1">one</num> or more of the standing committees and assist in the work of such committees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2047"/>As a farther step towards vitalizing the committees it was proposed that each <num value="1">one</num> of them should have certain <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> evenings assigned to it for report and discussion of its work or of some phase thereof.
