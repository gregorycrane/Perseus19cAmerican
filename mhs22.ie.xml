<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/> 
<text><body> 
<p><emph>E</emph>IGHTY-<measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> ago <placeName>Medford</placeName> had a population of about <num value="2000">two thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Allowing an average of <num value="5">five</num> to a dwelling would give <num value="400">four hundred</num> structures for human habitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>But the average family of those days was larger, and <num value="300">three hundred</num> is the more likely number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>These varied in type from the few survivors of the earliest days, the low-studded, <num value="2">two</num>-storied, <num value="4">four</num>-room house, to which a lean &mdash; to may have been added, if not originally thus built, or the <num value="1">one</num>&mdash;and <num value="2">two</num>-story gambrel roofs with roomy attics, to those more modern and pretentious, erected after ship-building began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>The exceptions were the <name>Royall</name>, <placeName>Peter Tufts</placeName>, <persName n="Wade,Major,,,," id="n0334.0002.00000.00001" reg="nearbymention:Wade,Dudley,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Wade</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hastings,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00000.00002" reg="mostcommon:Hastings,nomatch:0"><surname>Hastings</surname></persName> houses, with the country seat of <persName n="Brooks,,Peter,C.,," id="n0334.0002.00000.00003" reg="default:Brooks,Peter,C.,,"><foreName>Peter</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName>, the finest and newest of all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>But at that time there was erected <num value="1">one</num> that was, and still is, unique in design, substantial in construction, on an eligible and commanding location, that is worthy of more than a passing notice, and should hold in the estimation of <persName n="Medford,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Medford,nomatch:0"><surname>Medford</surname></persName> people the same place that the original Bulfinch State house does in that of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>We refer to the residence of <persName n="Magoun,,Thatcher,,," id="n0334.0002.00000.00005" reg="default:Magoun,Thatcher,,,"><foreName>Thatcher</foreName> <surname>Magoun</surname></persName>, now the public library building.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Who knows the name of its architect, or yet the master builder that erected it, or even any workman that wrought in its construction?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The old house holds its secrets well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Who knows the make &mdash; up of those massive circular walls, or the year, or years (for work was not hurriedly done in those days) of its erection?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Prior to its time no <num value="1">one</num> in <placeName>Medford</placeName>, that we know of, had ventured the construction of a house with circular rooms, save that of <persName n="Touro,,Abraham,,," id="n0334.0002.00000.00006" reg="default:Touro,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Touro</surname></persName>, and that in but <num value="1">one</num> particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>But here <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> we find a combination of <num value="2">two</num> adjacent circles of <measure n="26feet" type="distance">twenty-six feet</measure> placed under <num value="1">one</num> roof of the most substantial kind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>We have been led to make these observations and queries for the information, not only of ourselves, but for those of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>'s people who may take interest therein.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Soon after coming to <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> we noticed its peculiarity, and remember it as it was ere the terrace and lofty portico were added by the owner to <q direct="unspecified">the mansion house of my honored father.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>We are quoting the words of his letter to the selectmen relative to his gift of it to the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Familiar with its exterior, yet with <num value="1">one</num> exception (soon after its opening for library use), we were never within its walls till after the construction of the brick stack-room and the attendant changes within.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The men who refitted it for library use have passed on, and we can find no <num value="1">one</num> to intelligently answer our queries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>We have desired to add a trustworthy description of this unique building to the archives of the <name>Society</name> for the <name>Preservation</name> of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> Antiquities, in reply to query and request made in <orgName n="Boston Transcript" type="newspaper">Boston <hi rend="italics">Transcript</hi></orgName> of <dateStruct value="-05-30"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="30">30</day></dateStruct> (last), as well as to our local history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>So we turn to such sources of information as we have at hand.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>A tradition has been current that it was built in the same year and by the same builder as was the <name>Gray</name> mansion next west from it, and that early in the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>That, however, upon consideration is highly improbable, as <persName n="Magoun,,Thatcher,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00007" reg="default:Magoun,Thatcher,,,"><foreName>Thatcher</foreName> <surname>Magoun</surname></persName> (born <dateStruct value="1775-06-17"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="17">17</day>, <year reg="1775">1775</year></dateStruct>, in <placeName reg="Pembroke, Plymouth, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050383">Pembroke, Mass.</placeName>) was but <measure n="27years" type="date">twenty-seven years</measure> of age when he came to <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></dateStruct> and commenced the business of ship-building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> residence was near his ship-yard on old <address><street n="Ship street">Ship street</street></address>, corner of <address><street n="Park street">Park</street></address>, and it was near the close of his active career that he erected this house, which was in some respects superior to any in town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>His son <persName n="Thatcher,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00008" reg="mostcommon:Thatcher,nomatch:0"><surname>Thatcher</surname></persName> had already purchased the estate across and further up <address><street n="High street">High street</street></address> (in <dateStruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></dateStruct>) when the elder <rs>Magoun</rs> purchased of <persName><foreName>Nathaniel</foreName></persName> <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> <rs type="role2">Bishop</rs>, on <dateStruct value="1833-10-05"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg="5">5</day>, <year reg="1833">1833</year></dateStruct>, <q direct="unspecified">a certain piece of land with a dwelling house,</q> having a frontage on <address><street n="High street">High street</street></address> of <q direct="unspecified"><num value="7">seven</num> rods and <num value="22">twenty-two</num> links, to land of <persName n="Gray,Mrs.,,,," id="n0334.0002.00003.00009" reg="mostcommon:Gray,Eliza,,,:2"><roleName n="Mrs.">Widow</roleName> <surname>Gray</surname></persName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/></p> 
<p>The record of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> ships shows that he built his last ships in <dateStruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></dateStruct>, <num value="1">one</num> in each year, and that after <dateStruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></dateStruct> the building at the <name>Magoun</name> ship-yard was by others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It would appear that the <q direct="unspecified">mansion-house</q> was commenced at about the time of his retirement, about <dateStruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></dateStruct>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>But for the eastern chimney being a little out of place, (probably the fault of the delineator) the view is an excellent <num value="1">one</num>, and valuable as evidence of the original building.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>In this view the words <q direct="unspecified">Public Library</q> appear on the frieze of the portico, which indicates that the view was secured subsequent to <dateStruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It is a matter of regret that no files of either the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> journal</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Medford Chronicle</hi> were preserved by their publishers, for to such we would naturally refer for information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>In the early seventies (probably &lsquo;<num value="74">74</num>) the younger <rs>Magoun</rs> had put the building in <q direct="unspecified">the most perfect repair</q> and added the terrace and portico.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Early in <dateStruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></dateStruct> the selectmen of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> were informed by <persName n="Magoun,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0002.00004.00020" reg="nearbymention:Magoun,Thatcher,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Magoun</surname></persName>, by letter dated <dateStruct value="1875-01-22"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg="22">22</day>, <year reg="1875">1875</year></dateStruct>, of his intention to donate to the town the <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Mansion House">Mansion House</placeName></q> of his <q direct="unspecified">late honored father</q> for a library building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>A copy of this letter was published in the <hi rend="italics">Medford Chronicle</hi> at the time and may be found in the annual reports of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>He stated in the letter&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The style of the <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Mansion House">Mansion House</placeName>,</q> certainly in its exterior, appears to me to be admirably adapted for the purpose proposed; and my idea is, that the front or main building, above and below should all be used for library purposes as it is well arranged for that purpose.</p></quote> He also offered the town the sum of <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">$1,000</measure> for bookcases and furnishing, and after adding suggestions as to the utilization of the rear portion of the building, stated his intention of inserting <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The building was formally opened for its new use on <dateStruct value="1875-06-20"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="20">20</day>, <year reg="1875">1875</year></dateStruct> (the <name>Usher</name> history says <dateStruct value="1873--"><year reg="1873">1873</year></dateStruct>, manifestly an error in proof-reading), <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> after the <num value="100" type="ordinal">hundredth</num> anniversary of the birth of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <persName n="Magoun,,Thatcher,,," id="n0334.0002.00004.00022" reg="default:Magoun,Thatcher,,,"><foreName>Thatcher</foreName> <surname>Magoun</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>We do not recall ever hearing the coincidence mentioned, <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> and have had curiosity whether or not the donor might not have had in mind even when he made the addition to the front, its being a centenary memorial of his father, who was the founder of the <rs>Medford</rs> industry of ship-building, had been a leading business man, and the largest tax-payer in the old town.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>We have said this building is unique in design.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Geometry demonstrates that the circle contains the largest area that can be enclosed by a given amount of exterior boundary line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>But in actual building practice, when wood is the material used, the cost far exceeds the advantage gained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>However, we have no thought that <persName n="Magoun,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0002.00005.00023" reg="nearbymention:Magoun,Thatcher,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Magoun</surname></persName> had that in mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>He was a ship-builder, and accustomed to curved lines, both in theory and practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>We have often thought he may have been his own architect, as we find those <q direct="unspecified">wooden walls</q> are as thick as those of a ship&mdash;<num value="16">sixteen</num> or <measure n="17inches" type="distance">seventeen inches</measure>. No wooden house of that day, or this, exceeds <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="7">seven</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The foundation walls conform to the circular form within and the rectangular without, the cellar having windows only where the circle joins the outer straight lines.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The <num value="6">six</num> great pillars, of the <name>Ionic</name> order, which form a colonnade outside the enclosing walls, are nearly <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> in diameter at their bases, and support the entablature and cornice that is purely classic in design.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>They rest upon a granite foundation with a flagging resembling soap-stone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>These columns are doubtless built around sizable timbers strong enough in themselves to support the roof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>In all their details of bases, fluting and capitals they are architecturally and proportionately correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The entablature rests honestly upon the voluted capitals and on the impinging circles of the walls, and is correct in every detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The original gables are perfectly plain, with no windows or openings into the attic, and their cornices are carried a little higher than the main roof, which is covered with slates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>These were imported from <placeName reg="Wales, Hampden, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050790">Wales</placeName>, as at that time few slate quarries had been opened here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The windows are long and of <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> <num value="15">fifteen</num> panes in the lower story, which is <measure n="11feet" type="distance">eleven feet</measure> high, and their splayed openings have recessed pockets into which the panelled shutters fold back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The ceilings of these <num value="4">four</num> large rooms are heavily corniced, and all the door and window openings have a moulded trim enriched with carved center and corner blocks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>In the lower story such doors as were in curved partitions were made to conform to the curve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The entrance hall took a segment of <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure> off each circle, making a straight side of <measure n="15feet" type="distance">fifteen feet</measure> in each room in which were wide doors of <num value="2">two</num> leaves on the lower floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The entrance hall had a heavy panelled door, with transom and side-lights, and a window at the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The latter is shown in the enlarged photograph which is preserved in the library.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>This was secured by the forethought of former <persName n="Eddy,President,,,," id="n0334.0002.00006.00024" reg="mostcommon:Eddy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Eddy</surname></persName> of the <orgName n="Historical Society" type="society">Historical Society</orgName>, prior to the alterations made at the erection of the brick stack-room, and shows the fine old stairway as originally built.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>As yet we have found no <num value="1">one</num> to tell us of the mode of construction of those circular walls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The alterations made <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> ago (by workmen from out of town) may or may not have revealed it to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The windows set deeply into the walls from without and more so within, and suggest that the circular walls may be of rough brick-work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>If not, they may be of planks, sawed in segments and spiked or <q direct="unspecified">trunnelled,</q> <num value="1">one</num> upon another, as was the circular house of <persName n="Robinson,,Enoch,,," id="n0334.0002.00006.00025" reg="default:Robinson,Enoch,,,"><foreName>Enoch</foreName> <surname>Robinson</surname></persName> on <placeName key="possibilities=81" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Prospect hill</placeName> in <placeName reg="Somerville, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050602">Somerville</placeName>.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> 
<p>There are several dwellings in <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, built before the <rs>Civil War</rs>, whose walls and partitions were thus laid up with fencing pales.</p></note> On the exterior they are sheathed vertically with narrow boards whose edges are devoid of heading or rounded corners, and their joining is now, after the lapse of so many years of exposure, barely noticeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>There is apparent sincerity of construction, in that no attempt is made to imitate a lintel over the windows, only a narrow plinth of wood at the flagging, and no cornice or moulding at the top. <pb id="p.7" n="7"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>There is a tradition that <persName n="Magoun,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0002.00007.00026" reg="nearbymention:Magoun,Thatcher,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Magoun</surname></persName> had the front portion erected in its classic architectural style <q direct="unspecified">to please his wife,</q> and that he built the <q direct="unspecified">L</q> at the rear <q direct="unspecified">to live in and to suit himself.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Certainly there was a contrast, in that it was perfectly plain, with low-studded rooms, <q direct="unspecified">like a ship's cabin,</q> and these were the ones mostly used.

<head>What shoddy is.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/> 
<text><body> 
<p>In the popular conception, shoddy typifies that which is undesirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>The word is a synonym of inferiority, subterfuge and deceit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>The public is accustomed to condemn where it does not understand, and it seems desirable that some light should be shed to clear up this misconception in the use of shoddy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>The word shoddy is derived from <hi rend="italics">shod</hi>, meaning a parting or separation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>Before cloth can be woven the wool must <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> be spun into yarn which is either woolen or worsted, depending both on process and the raw materials used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>Worsted yarn must be made from virgin wool which is combed so the fibres lie parallel along the length of the yarn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>Such yarn can be utilized in a fabric where strength and durability are desired rather than warmth and imperviousness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>Woolen yarn is made from wool fibres, and instead of combing, the process of carding is used, which interlaces, mixes and crisscrosses the fibre to the maximum possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>Such a yarn is more lofty, and permits felting and locking of the individual strands of yarn when they are woven, thereby producing a cloth which is less porous than worsted cloth but not necessarily so strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>It is not only desirable that woolen cloth be made from yarn which has both long and short fibres, but it is essential that such be the case if a compact, airtight fabric is to be produced, the longer fibre providing the strength and the shorter ones filling up the spaces and binding the contiguous yarns in a piece of cloth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> by-product of a worsted mill is <hi rend="italics">noils</hi>. These are short wool fibres combed out of wool to be spun into a worsted yarn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>Noils form the most important raw <pb id="p.39" n="39"/> stock in a woolen mill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>As the wool progresses through its various stages in the manufacture of cloth, minor wastes appear, such as card waste, flyings, and strippings, and although this wool fibre has not been subjected to wear and tear of usage, it can be only utilized in a woolen mill, as it is neither virgin wool nor noils and is classed as shoddy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>Real shoddy, however, as it is understood, consists of fragments of cloth or other wool material which has to be picked preparatory to its use on woolen cards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>As may be noted, its date is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year of the corporation's existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>Probably <dateStruct value="-12-2"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="2">2</day></dateStruct> was a cold morning, but the <num value="4">four</num> directors that had breakfast were fortified (or thought they were), by the modest allowance of <num value="1">one</num> pint of bitters, ere they set out on the rocky road by <placeName reg="Spot Pond, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1119320">Spot Pond</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>But they came back with reinforcements, for <hi rend="italics"><num value="9">nine</num></hi> sat down to dinner, and, strange to say, only <hi rend="italics"><num value="4">four</num></hi> bowls <pb id="p.49" n="49"/> of toddy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>We have been asked <q direct="unspecified">What was flip?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>Well, it was <hi rend="italics">hot</hi> stuff, so was toddy; but flip was heated by the insertion of a red hot poker into the contents of the mug when served to the guest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>We fail to note any difference in the price of <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Ginn,,,,," id="n0334.0020.00049.00300" reg="mostcommon:Ginn,nomatch:0"><surname>Ginn</surname></persName></q> and brandy in the raw, but the director who indulged in <hi rend="italics">brandy</hi> toddy was taxed <measure n="5cents" type="currency">five cents</measure> more than for the decoction from gin.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>It is too late to rectify mistakes (for the innkeeper has been dead a century), but he forgot to insert in charge column <measure n="3dollars" type="currency">three dollars</measure> for <num value="3">three</num> toddys and <num value="6">six</num> dinners, and made a slight error in his footing.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>He may have been an adviser or engineer, and so a guest of the directors.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>Possibly the final entry may explain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>By that entry it appears that the innkeeper had a separate bill against the turnpike <hi rend="italics">company</hi>, and had erroneously charged <measure n="6dollars" type="currency">six dollars</measure> to the company on <dateStruct value="-02-3"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg="3">3</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>For want of any such bills, we are led to infer that the directors of the <rs type="place">Andover Turnpike</rs> paid collectively their own expenses, and the company those of the clerk and <persName n="Warner,Colonel,,,," id="n0334.0020.00050.00302" reg="mostcommon:Warner,Jonathan,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Warner</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1172"/>It is thought best to give in this, the following statement, thus of permanent record:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1173"/><dateStruct value="1915-01-"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1915">1915</year></dateStruct>, found our society (even after extra effort made), with a deficit of about <measure n="116dollars" type="currency">$116</measure> in current and publication expenses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1174"/>Our old home was still in serious need of repair, though much had recently been expended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1175"/>As no other plan seemed feasible, the society had by vote decided to sell the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1176"/>The new administration found itself confronted with new and serious conditions immediately after the closing meeting of the season by its sale and our consequent removal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1177"/>It had occupied the <rs type="place">Lydia Maria Child house</rs> almost from its start, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> as tenant, and later becoming proprietor, having paid therefor <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">$1,000</measure>, and mortgaging for <measure n="3000dollars" type="currency">$3,000</measure> at a low rate of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1178"/>This mortgage the purchaser assumed and later paid, the society receiving <measure n="1500dollars" type="currency">$1,500</measure> for its equity in the property.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1179"/>As the above <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">thousand dollars</measure> was <hi rend="italics">donated to the society; for that specific purpose</hi>, an equal amount was deposited on interest for a similar use, leaving <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure>, from which resultant expenses of sale and new expenses of administration had to be met. As the <hi rend="italics">new</hi> item of rent was itself in excess of the society's income, it was evident that matters could not long thus continue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1180"/>Various plans of relief were proposed, none of which on examination proved advisable, until in <dateStruct value="1916-06-"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1916">1916</year></dateStruct>, the directors recommended the society to acquire a permanent home by the purchase of land and erection of a building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1181"/>This was adopted by the society by vote, and the matter referred to the directors for execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1182"/>with but <num value="1">one</num> restriction, <hi rend="italics">viz</hi>., that no work be begun until <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">$1,000</measure> had been pledged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1183"/>This was strictly observed; but in the meantime circumstances had arisen that required a change of location and of plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1184"/>This entailed added expense and loss of several weeks of time most favorable for construction work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1185"/><pb id="p.81" n="81"/></p> 
<p>The directors assumed responsibility and the society by vote approved their action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1186"/>The building committee of <num value="5">five</num> was soon reduced to <num value="3">three</num> by the serious and continued illness of <num value="2">two</num> of its number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1187"/>It had already chosen <num value="1">one</num> of its number (who had prepared the plans) superintendent of construction, who erected the building at absolute cost for the society, though in the stress of increasing difficulty, it is not yet wholly complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1188"/>It was deemed advisable to move into it at the earliest possible time, and in <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> this was done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1189"/>Like some other tenants who find it <q direct="unspecified">cheaper to move than pay rent,</q> we had then a <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> unpaid bill which our landlord kindly waited for until we were enabled by our <dateStruct value="-01-01"><occasion>new year's</occasion></dateStruct> dues to pay the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1190"/>At this time most of the pledges made to the <orgName n="Building Fund" type="fund">building fund</orgName> had been paid in and expended upon the work, and with the little in sight, for a time little was done other than by the superintendent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1191"/>In the price of materials (when purchased) he found at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> a little advance over estimates given a few weeks before, but nothing like that which has come later.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1192"/>As time elapsed, the turmoil of war in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> involved America, and the raising of funds for our needs could make no headway amid the drives for Liberty Loans, Red Cross, Y.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1193"/>Our incurred bills were made no larger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1194"/><hi rend="italics">Some</hi> were reduced a little, as <hi rend="italics">occasional</hi> contributions were made, while our patient creditors waited our action.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1195"/>In <dateStruct value="1918-12-"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1918">1918</year></dateStruct>, an effort was made to secure <measure n="2000dollars" type="currency">$2,000</measure> to complete the building and pay all outstanding bills.

As part of the money <pb id="p.82" n="82"/> had been received without conditions, it was the wish of the other creditor (whose account was <hi rend="italics">not a balance but his entire bill</hi>) that the minor bills be paid, and the effort to raise the other <num value="1000">thousand</num> continued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1199"/>At this juncture came an <hi rend="italics">insistent</hi> demand for <hi rend="italics">immediate</hi> settlement of <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi> creditor's claim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1200"/>Upon this, <num value="1">one</num> of the directors immediately volunteered to take the matter of settlement in hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1201"/>His action resulted in a contribution to the fund by each <hi rend="italics">creditor</hi>, of a sum equalling <num value="45">45</num>% of his claim, whereupon every claim was settled in full, as shown by the treasurer's vouchers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1202"/>By the foregoing it will be seen that the new home of the society on <address><street n="Governors avenue">Governors avenue</street></address> stands today with no encumbrance of debt, through the <hi rend="italics">kind forbearance of creditors for <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> and their generous assistance at last</hi>. This was preceded by the <hi rend="italics">conservation of earlier gifts</hi>, and the generous aid of comparatively <hi rend="italics">few</hi>, and those mainly of our membership.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1203"/>We could wish the <hi rend="italics">final</hi> result <hi rend="italics">otherwise attained</hi>, as we began the enterprise in good faith, and with perhaps an over-confidence in the <hi rend="italics">public spirit</hi> of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1204"/>Our final pledges were expected to pay <hi rend="italics">all</hi> bills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1205"/>Had the society been subjected to a suit at law by <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi> creditor, <hi rend="italics">all others</hi> must have suffered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1206"/>As a matter of fact, <hi rend="italics">all</hi> readily acceded to that director's suggestion, and to them our thanks are due, and to all others who have aided in our work for the interests of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1207"/>It has been done without the instrumentality of a so-called <q direct="unspecified">construction</q> which means destruction loan.
