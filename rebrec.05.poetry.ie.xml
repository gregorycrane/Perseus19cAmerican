<milestone unit="sentence" n="1184"/>The history of this brave man, during the past few months, has been <num value="1">one</num> of strange adventures and escapes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1187"/>This revived him, and he discovered that the vessel had been abandoned and was on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1188"/>Making a great effort, he threw himself into the river, and swam ashore, where he took refuge in the swamp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1189"/>Danger followed him even here, for, as <num value="1">one</num> of the vessels blew up, a piece of iron, weighing some <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="300l." type="pounds"><num value="300">three hundred</num> pounds</measure>, struck within <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> of him, having been hurled that distance by the force of the explosion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1197"/>The odd turns made in the throat, and the curious rhythmic effect produced by single voices chiming in at different irregular intervals, seem almost as impossible to place on score as the singing of birds or the tones of an Aeolian harp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1198"/>The airs, however, can be reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1199"/>They are too decided not to be easily understood, and their striking originality would catch the ear of any musician.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1200"/>Besides this, they are valuable as an expression of the character and life of the race which is playing such a conspicuous part in our history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1201"/>The wild, sad strains tell, as the sufferers themselves never could, of crushed hopes, keen sorrow, and a dull daily misery which covered them as hopelessly as the fog from the rice-swamps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1244"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day that the fleet arrived I and my sister, and a great many others, were wending our way to the levee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1245"/>On our way we met a gentleman acquaintance of ours, who asked us if we were going to get some sugar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1246"/>I felt quite indignant; but as I was in an amiable mood then, I forgave him with all my heart, as I had no wish to be angry only with those hateful secessionists, who were destroying all the sugar and cotton, and burning the ships and steamboats that had been left standing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1247"/>If I had had the power over those who proposed it, I would have taken them all, women and men, and placed them in the burning ships, and there let them remain until secession and secessionists were consumed by the flames.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1249"/><quote>Be merciful unto him that showeth mercy.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1250"/>The next persons we met were a lady and gentleman &mdash; the lady appearing to be quite delighted at the sight of the cotton and ships burning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1251"/>There were a great many others who had come to see the fleet &mdash; some with joyful hearts, once again to behold that time-honored flag, as it was unfurled to the breeze; others came for curiosity, and others with feelings of hate burning in their hearts, because they knew they were conquered, or would be in a short time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1252"/>They foolishly depended upon some traitors to drive out the enemy when they came; but the cowards made good their escape when they heard that the fleet had arrived, leaving their dupes to take care of themselves the best way they could, telling them how vain is the help of man in an unjust cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1253"/>We were often stopped in our progress by the burning of the wharves and piles of cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1254"/>We had gone a good distance, when right before us lay piles of cotton burning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1255"/>We had our choice, either to return back the way we came, or jump across the cotton-piles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1256"/>At last we came to the conclusion that we would do the jumping; so we selected a pile that we thought had been well burnt out, and my sister made the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> leap, and as soon as she was over she exclaimed, <quote>O my!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1257"/>But that was hot!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1258"/>and told me that I had better find some other place to jump; but I wanted to have some experience in jumping cotton-piles, so over I went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1259"/>When I was over I exclaimed with my sister--<quote>O my!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1260"/>But that was hot!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1261"/>and looking round to see what could have caused such heat, we saw the piles of cotton that we had jumped across burning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1262"/>What appeared to have been all ashes to us, we found out by experience was a little too hot to be only ashes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1263"/>We shook our dresses well, so as to make sure that there were no sparks on them, and went on our way rejoicing; but we made up our minds that the next time we jumped cotton-piles, we would look before we leaped.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1264"/>In looking at the ship burning, there was a young lady standing before us, who seemed quite unconscious about her dress burning, until told by us. Then there was another old lady, who was so absorbed in looking at the fleet, that she did not take notice of where she stood; and, being at the edge of the wharf, where it had been burnt, the plank gave way, and she was precipitated into the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1265"/>Fortunately, she caught hold of another portion of the wharf, and <num value="2">two</num> men assisted her out. No harm was done, but she was pretty much scared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1266"/>Nothing of importance happened to us, until we noticed that <num value="1">one</num> of the gunboats was coming towards our side of the river, (for the fleet was in the <pb id="p.45" n="45"/>middle of the river.)

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1267"/>It landed near the <rs type="place">St. Mary's Market</rs>; so we took our position before the gunboat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1268"/>As we were running along, <num value="3">three</num> women who were behind us made some remarks, <num value="1">one</num> of which I overheard: she said that all persons who seemed glad to see the <rs>Yankees</rs> ought to be punished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1270"/>They looked at me, as much as to say I was not worth answering, and we passed on. While we were standing before the gunboat, we waved our handkerchiefs towards the men on the boat, when <num value="1">one</num> of the officers lifted his cap and bowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1271"/>This attracted the attention of the <num value="3">three</num> women, who had come up to us, when the eldest of them touched my sister on the shoulder, and said, <quote>Do you mean to say that you are waving your handkerchief at them?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1272"/>pointing to the men on the gunboat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1273"/>My sister said it was none of her business, and I said: <quote>Certainly.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1274"/>Then she said: <quote>You had better go to them.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1275"/>I said I would if the boat came near enough, so that I could get in. The <num value="2">two</num> younger ones called us rebels, and giving us a disdainful look, passed out of sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1276"/>You may be assured I was quite surprised on being addressed so unexpectedly; but, for all that, we were ready to answer them or any other person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1277"/>While the gunboat was leaving the wharf, we still continued waving our pocket handkerchief and bidding them good-by.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1278"/>A man said to my sister: <quote>Give me the handkerchief and I will wave it for you.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1279"/>My sister thanked him, and said she could wave it herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1280"/>She knew it was his intention to throw it into the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1281"/>As we came further on, we noticed <num value="2">two</num> young girls, <num value="1">one</num> of them waving a small confederate flag, and calling out to them--<quote>Go back, you dirty <name>Yankee</name> devils; go back where you came from.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1282"/>I asked, <quote>Where are the dirty (not <persName n="Yankee,,,,," id="n0091.0167.00045.00533" reg="mostcommon:Yankee,nomatch:0"><surname>Yankee</surname></persName>, but) secession devils?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1283"/>and echo answered, there; and looking around I saw that it was those <num value="2">two</num> young girls, the <num value="1">one</num> still holding the flag and calling them names, and the other <num value="1">one</num> assisting her.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1345"/>I must record a little adventure, pleasing and interesting, I had day before yesterday near <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1346"/>My last spoke about the continued firing between pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1347"/>To such an extent was it carried, so incessant the firing day and night, that nothing short of a battle would alarm the camp, whereas a single gun should be the signal for the long-roll.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1348"/>But within the last <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> a change for the better has taken place.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1349"/>On Monday our regiment was sent to the fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1350"/>It is the custom for the various battalions to take their turn in staying at the breastworks for <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>, forming a sort of reserve picket; and from each regiment so stationed <num value="2">two</num> companies are sent to the outposts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1351"/>It fell to our lot to go out. The company we relieved informed us that the rebels were disposed to be friendly; and with instructions from the field-officer not to fire unless fired upon, or the enemy attempted to advance, we set to work to watch the movements of our neighbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1352"/>The enemy's pickets were in the edge of a wood about <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> from us, and my post--<num value="1">one</num> of the best for observation &mdash; similarly situated in another wood, with a level between us. For some time we looked closely without being able to see any of them, as they were disposed to be shy. We, on the contrary, exposed ourselves to their view, which had the effect of making them bolder, and occasionally a rebel passed from <num value="1">one</num> tree to another and levelled a field-glass at us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1353"/>I waved a handkerchief, which was answered from the other side, and tacitly understood to mean no firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1354"/>An hour later <num value="1">one</num> of our Southern friends waved a handkerchief and shouted: <quote>Meet me half-way.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1355"/><quote>All right ;</quote> and arming myself with a newspaper, profusely illustrated with pictures incidental to the capture of <placeName key="tgn,7014214" n="1.000 21" reg="new orleans, orleans, louisiana">New-Orleans</placeName>, I started out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1356"/>After shaking hands and exchanging the customary salutations, we proceeded to talk about the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1366"/><rs type="role">Mr.</rs> <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> wanted to know why we did not make the attack; they were anxiously waiting for us, and confident of victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1367"/>I said that they could not be more eager for the battle or more sure of success, than ourselves; that to us every thing appeared to be ready, but we were not supposed to know <persName n="Halleck,General,,,," id="n0091.0178.00049.00557" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Halleck</surname></persName>'s plans.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1368"/>We talked together some <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure>, both of us very wary about giving contraband information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1370"/>I gave him the pictorial, and asked for a Memphis paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1371"/>He had none, but promised to send me over <num value="1">one</num>, if he could procure it during the day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1374"/>However, being fearful that the rebels might learn something from us if such intercourse was allowed, he ordered us not to go out again, but to let any rebel that wished it to come over all the way. I had reason to regret this very much, as in the afternoon my friend, the doctor, came half-way with the promised paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1375"/>We gave him to understand that it was against our orders to leave the post, and if he would come all the way we would do him no harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/>He said he had a very late paper, but could not be induced to come farther than the neutral ground, and returned, much to our disappointment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1377"/>After the interview of the morning all apprehension from danger from bullets from either side was at an end, and the sentinels on both sides paced their beats without so much as thinking to seek cover.
