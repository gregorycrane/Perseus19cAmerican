<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Our chief difficulty was the want of arms and munitions of war.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>In the interval between the election and the inauguration of <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0295.0002.00001.00004" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, when <num value="1">one</num> Southern State after another was withdrawing from the <rs>Union</rs>, men's minds were full of rapidly passing political events, and much doubt was felt as to whether there would be a war; certainly but few looked forward to war on so great a scale, or to be waged for so many years, as actually took place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>As soon as it became clear to the authorities of the newly established <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>' government that an armed conflict was inevitable, they must have been alarmed at the terrible lack of material preparation for it at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>In the arsenals of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> within Confederate limits there were <num value="120000">120,000</num> muskets (for the most part altered from flint-lock to percussion), besides some <num value="12000">12,000</num> or <num value="15000">15,000</num> rifles, and with some arms belonging to the individual States, it may be set down that about <num value="150000">150,000</num> serviceable fire-arms for infantry were available.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>There were a considerable number of heavy sea-coast guns at the fortified sea ports, and others were seized on board men-of-war at <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> and among the stores of the <rs>Norfolk</rs> navy yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>But there was no serviceable <orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">field artillery</orgName> except a few old iron guns of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct> and a few more modern pieces belonging <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> to the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>There was scarcely any gun powder save <measure n="60000l." type="pounds"><num value="60000">60,000</num> pounds</measure>, mainly old cannon powder, at <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>And there were practically no arms for cavalry, no fixed ammunition nor <rs n="percussion caps" type="product">percussion caps</rs>, no accoutrements&mdash;cartridge boxes, knapsacks, haversacks, etc.&mdash;no saddles and bridles, no artillery harness, no adequate stores of shoes, nor of <rs n="horse shoe" type="product">horse-shoes</rs>, nor provision of the many minor articles of equipment required by an army in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Of special machinery for ordinance use there was none save that for the manufacture of small arms at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>This was saved, though somewhat damaged by fire, when the armory was abandoned by the U. S. officers in charge; this machinery was removed to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond, Va.</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Fayetteville, Cumberland, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014292">Fayetteville, N.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, all arms and ordinance supplies of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were claimed by the several seceding States, in which they were found, and no little delay was caused by the necessity for negotiating their transfer to the custody of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> steps towards provision for ordnance needs were taken by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName> while it was still at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>, Ala. <rs type="role">Col.</rs> (afterwards <rs type="role">Genl.</rs>) <persName n="Gorgas,,Josiah,,," id="n0295.0002.00002.00005" reg="default:Gorgas,Josiah,,,"><foreName>Josiah</foreName> <surname>Gorgas</surname></persName>, who had been an ordnance officer in the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>For a few weeks the supplies bought by <persName n="Semmes,Captain,,,," id="n0295.0002.00002.00008" reg="nearbymention:Semmes,Raphael,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Semmes</surname></persName> came South through the as yet unbroken channels of commerce, but naturally this very soon ceased, before any important results had been attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Originally furnished with a credit of <measure n="10000l." type="pounds">&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure> only, he very soon made contracts to the extent of nearly <num value="50">fifty</num> times that sum. <pb id="p.3" n="3"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The seat of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName> having been moved to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 21" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, <persName n="Gorgas,Colonel,,,," id="n0295.0002.00003.00010" reg="nearbymention:Gorgas,Josiah,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Gorgas</surname></persName> was, in the spring of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, busily engaged in organizing his work and arranging for the ordnance demands of the large forces which were being rapidly mustered into service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>He had to look to <num value="3">three</num> sources of supply: arms, etc., already on hand, importation from abroad and manufacture within the bounds of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The arms already on hand came forward chiefly in the hands of the men who <orgName type="regiment" key="1Volunteer">first volunteer</orgName>ed and were equipped as far as possible by the <name>States</name> from which the regiment came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>In response to a call for private arms, a good many <num value="1000">thousand</num> shot guns and old sporting rifles were turned in, and served to some extent to satisfy the impatience of men eager to take the field until better provision could be made for them, or they provided for themselves on some of the battle fields of the early part of the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The importation of arms and ordnance supplies of all kinds from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> through the blockade soon assumed great importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Most of the mercury used in the early part of the war for making the fulminating mercury of <rs n="percussion caps" type="product">percussion caps</rs> was obtained from <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, and after the <q direct="unspecified">Trans-<placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName></q> region had become isolated from the rest of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> and had in the main to look out for its own supplies, much material of various kinds was obtained from <placeName key="tgn,7005560" n="1.000 10" reg="Mexico,North and Central America">Mexican</placeName> sources across the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>, though the long distances to be covered without railroads seriously limited this traffic.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>In arranging for the manufacture of arms and munitions at home, there were set on foot establishments of <num value="2">two</num> different <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> kinds&mdash;those which are intended to be permanent, built and equipped for their special purpose and intended to concentrate work on a large scale&mdash;and those of a more temporary character, capable of yielding results in the shortest time, and intended to meet the immediate demands of the war with such resources as the country then afforded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of the permanent works undertaken was a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class powder mill, the erection and equipment of which were placed in charge of <persName n="Rains,Colonel,G.,W.,," id="n0295.0002.00004.00014" reg="default:Rains,G.,W.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Rains</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, who had been an officer of the <orgName type="mil" key="USRegular">U.

The site selected was a large piece of land on the line of the canal at <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta, Ga.</placeName>, where work was begun in <dateStruct value="1861-09-"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>All of the massive machinery was constructed in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, the largest parts, the heavy incorporating rollers and pans, being made at the <orgName n="Tredegar Works" type="works">Tredegar Works</orgName> at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 21" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Powder began to be produced in <dateStruct value="1862-04-"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, and the works continued in successful operation up to the end of the war, furnishing all the gunpowder needed, and of the very best quality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The statement may seem startling in view of the difficulties under which this establishment was built up, but it is no exageration to say that it was amongst the finest and most efficient powder mills in the world at the time, if not the very best in existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The erection of a central ordnance laboratory for the production of artillery and small arms ammunition and the innumerable minor articles of ordnance equipment was decided upon in <dateStruct value="1862-09-"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, and placed in my charge, and work was begun a few weeks later.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>A tract of about <measure n="145acres" type="area">145 acres</measure> was purchased near <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon, Ga.</placeName>, and enclosed, a branch track was run out from the <orgName n="Macon and Western Railroad" type="railroad">Macon and Western R.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The line of the <num value="3">three</num> main buildings, connected with each other, had a frontage of about <measure n="1200feet" type="distance">1200 feet</measure>, the middle building being about <measure n="600feet" type="distance">600 feet</measure> long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The design which I prepared for the establishment, and which was approved by <persName n="Gorgas,Colonel,,,," id="n0295.0002.00004.00015" reg="nearbymention:Gorgas,Josiah,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Gorgas</surname></persName>, included about <num value="40">40</num> other detached buildings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The main buildings were practically complete at the close of the war, and some of the smaller ones has been begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>All of the brick was made at a yard which I opened at another point near <placeName key="tgn,7013980" n="1.000 4" reg="macon, bibb, georgia">Macon</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Orders were sent to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> for a large and various assortment <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> of special machinery for making <rs n="percussion caps" type="product">percussion caps</rs>, friction primers, pressed bullets, etc., etc., and for several large <rs n="steam engines" type="product">steam engines</rs> to furnish motive power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>A large instalment of this machinery, including the largest pair of engines, had reached <placeName key="tgn,7005064" n="1.000 3" reg="bermuda">Bermuda</placeName> when blockade running practically came to an end, near the close of the war. The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> permanent establishment projected was a large central armory, which was to be equipped with a thoroughly modern plant of machinery for making small arms, and to which would have been removed the machinery temporarily in operation at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 21" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName reg="Fayetteville, Cumberland, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014292">Fayetteville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>This was put in charge of <persName n="Burton,Lieutenant-Colonel,J.,H.,," id="n0295.0002.00005.00016" reg="default:Burton,J.,H.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieut.-Col.</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Burton</surname></persName>, who had had experience at the government factory at <placeName reg="Enfield, England, United Kingdom" key="tgn,7018914">Enfield, in England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It was determined to place this armory also at <placeName key="tgn,7013980" n="1.000 4" reg="macon, bibb, georgia">Macon</placeName> <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Ga.</placeName>, where <num value="1">one</num> of the temporary arsenals had already been established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The buildings were begun in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, and they were pushed forward, but they were not nearly as far advanced as those of the laboratory when arrested by the end of the war. <persName n="Burton,Colonel,,,," id="n0295.0002.00005.00017" reg="nearbymention:Burton,J.,H.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Burton</surname></persName> went abroad to contract for the necessary machinery, chiefly with the firm of <persName n="Greenwood,,,,," id="n0295.0002.00005.00018" reg="mostcommon:Greenwood,nomatch:0"><surname>Greenwood</surname></persName> &amp; Batley, at <placeName reg="Leeds,Leeds,England,United Kingdom,Europe" key="tgn,7010442">Leeds, England</placeName>, and a good deal of work had been done towards filling the large contracts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The work of preparing ordnance supplies for the immediate demands of the armies in the field had to be scattered at a number of different places throughout the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The railroads were not very amply equipped at the outbreak of the war, and were grievously over-burdened in operation, so that it would have been impossible to transport material to any single point from great distances or to secure like transportation over long lines for finished products.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It was, moreover, uncertain how far any particular place could be counted upon as secure from molestation by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>And there was not time for the removal of machinery and appliances from the places at which they were to be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Hence the various temporary ordnance works grew up about existing foundries, machine shops, railroad repair shops, etc., and at the few small U. S. arsenals and ordnance depots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The chief of these in the early part of the war were at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond, Va.</placeName>, <placeName reg="Fayetteville, Cumberland, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014292">Fayetteville, N.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>As a natural consequence there was serious trouble at the arsenals and in the field, from confusion in regard to ammunition&mdash;trouble which was made worse by the gauges in use in the ordnance shops, which were not very accurate and often did not agree among themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>This fact primarily led to my becoming connected with the ordnance corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>Beside the immediate work of the <orgName n="Ordnance Bureau" type="bureau">Ordnance Bureau</orgName>, it had to undertake a great number of most onerous outside tasks rendered necessary by the disorganized condition of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>While indispensable help was obtained from the railroads, they had in turn to be helped, and largely, in making repairs to their rolling stock and tracks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>In fact, a silent partnership grew up, and materials and labor had to be used almost in common for a common end. It is easy to see how vitally necessary it was that the railroads should be kept going; but few people now seem to be aware how nearly exhausted at the close of the war the railroad system of the <rs>South</rs> had become.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Almost every yard of siding that could be spared had been taken up to patch the main lines, less important roads had been despoiled to help out the greater ones, fractional parts of wrecked locomotives <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> had been built up into new ones of more or less feeble constitution, cars had been mended until they would hardly hold together, and it may not unreasonably be doubted whether, aside from sources of weakness, this alone might not in a few months more at furthest have put an end to the maintenance of <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>To keep up the all-important importations through the blockake, the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">Ordnance Department</orgName> purchased, as has been stated, its own blockade running steamers, beside contracting largely with private adventurers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>It also erected at <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> a steam compress for preparing cotton bales for shipment, and it arranged through its agents for the purchase of cotton in the interior, and for its transport by railroad to the ports whence it was to go abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>And, not only had ordnance officers everywhere great difficulty in securing and keeping their workmen, but they had largely to concern themselves with feeding, clothing and housing them, both the men themselves and not infrequently their wives and children, who were in many cases refugees from parts of the country in possession of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>As an example, several mechanics trained in working the percussion cap machines of the <rs>Atlanta</rs> arsenal had been brought from <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>&mdash;some of them with their families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>On the whole it is perhaps remarkable that there were so few serious accidents and disasters in dealing with dangerous <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> explosive agents, but there were some such with sad consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>Quite early in the war there was a destructive explosion in a building at <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson, Miss.</placeName>, in which small-arms' cartridges were being made, and some <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num> poor girls were killed, portions of their bodies and clothing being thrown up among the branches of trees standing near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>Later a similar accident at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 21" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, in <num value="1">one</num> of the shops on an island in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, due, it was believed, to careless handling of a tray of friction primers, caused the death of a number of women and girls and grievous burning of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>It made a deep impression on the people of the city at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>There were at least <num value="2">two</num> explosions of fulminating mercury; <num value="1">one</num> at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 21" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and <num value="1">one</num> at <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName>; in each of these but a single man, I believe, was injured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>The march of great events caused this to be scarcely noticed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Among the trials and tribulations of ordnance officers some little account was to be taken of occasional desertion of workmen, and occasional reminders of the need for guarding against treachery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>There was not much trouble of this sort, but it was now and then spoken of, and at <num value="1">one</num> time, I remember, there was no small uneasiness felt as to the fidelity of a rather important mechanic at the <rs>Richmond</rs> arsenal.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>I have been led to read again some of the discussions which were so rife after the war as to the causes of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0295.0006.00074.00785" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,A.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>These again caused me to review the whole campaign in the light of the official reports and correspondence which have since been published, and the result of these investigations in connection with the facts of which I was personally cognizant are embodied in the following pages.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>Popular interest in the <rs n="Battle of Gettysburg" type="battle">battle of Gettysburg</rs> has suffered no abatement from the lapse of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>In popular imagination the shouts of the contending hosts, and the echoes of musketry and <pb id="p.75" n="75"/> artillery still resound through the valleys and linger upon the opposing heights.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>To the military student of the campaign, the tactical movements on either side, the manner in which the troops were brought into action, the nature of the ground, the strength of the several positions, and how each of them bore on the final result, furnish on a large scale rich material for the study of the art of war. Notwithstanding the volumes which have been devoted to the subject, no writer has yet appeared, able to paint the picture in all its fullness, tracing with bold sweep the general outlines, and deftly filling in its multitudinous details.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>Historical truth evolves itself slowly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>In the diary of <persName n="Wells,the Honorable,Gideon,,," id="n0295.0006.00075.00786" reg="default:Wells,Gideon,,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">the Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Gideon</foreName> <surname>Wells</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs>, now being published, he records that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0295.0006.00075.00787" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was extremely dejected at <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0295.0006.00075.00788" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,A.,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s escape after the battle, and much displeased that <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n0295.0006.00075.00789" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName> did not press <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0295.0006.00075.00790" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,A.,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> vigorously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>The average <rs>Northerner</rs>, however, while he failed, as did <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0295.0006.00075.00791" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, to realize how close the <rs>Union</rs> army had been to defeat, was quite willing when success was assured to forget the panic which swept the country ahead of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0295.0006.00075.00792" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,A.,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s invading army when it made its swift march to the <rs>Susquehanna</rs>, and was too elated over the result to care to go much into the inquiry how it all came about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>This feeling to some extent, affected the subsequent investigation before a <orgName n="Congress committee" type="committee">Committee of Congress</orgName> upon the conduct of the war.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>In the <rs>South</rs> it was different; the increasing exigencies of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName> and its narrowing resources, left it no time during the remainder of its existence, to institute inquiries into the cause of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0295.0006.00075.00793" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,A.,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s failure, and at the conclusion of hostilities, the people were too much engaged in their efforts to repair the waste of war, to think of the past and its mistakes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/><pb id="p.76" n="76"/> Still, with the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">army of Northern Virginia</orgName> and among its officers and men, from the day their faces were turned again to the <rs>Potomac</rs>, the causes of the failure have been a theme of repeated, and sometimes angry, discussion.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>When the magnanimity of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0295.0006.00076.00794" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,A.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> prompted him, at the end of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> day, to assume the responsibility for the disaster, it allayed for the time any disposition to fix the responsibility elsewhere, and so long as he lived, his influence was felt in restraining heated discussions, which he discouraged as productive of no good, and the effect of which would be to alienate from each other those who had been comrades in arms.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>The subject, however, was of such a nature, its discussion could not be finally suppressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>The <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 13" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName> failure touched too keenly the pride of the army and the reputation of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0295.0006.00076.00795" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,A.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, to permit silence on the part of his followers when it was believed by many that the responsibility rested upon other shoulders than his own.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>The most serious controversy, however, growing out of the campaign has been over the conduct of <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n0295.0006.00077.00806" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> on the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> days of the battle, and his alleged tardiness and failure to co-operate cordially with the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1736"/>We were generally hungry, slept often, <rs type="season">winter</rs> and <rs type="season">summer</rs>, in the open air on the ground, got no pay that we could buy anything with, were scantily clad and were apt to be killed, sooner or later in battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1744"/>Now you would like to know if the men whom I have described justified the burning of your town, in their individual capacity, irrespective of the orders from headquarters, under which they acted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1745"/>I must say to you frankly that they did, and I never heard <num value="1">one</num> dissenting voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1746"/>And why did we justify so harsh a measure?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1747"/>Simply because we had long come to the conclusion that it was time for us to burn something in the enemy's country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1748"/>In the campaign of the preceding year, when our whole army had passed through your richest section of country, where the peaceful homes and fruitful fields only made the contrast with what he had left the more significant, many a man whose home was in ruins chafed under the orders from <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0295.0008.00155.01967" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, which forbade him to touch them, but the orders were obeyed, and we left the homes and fields as we found them, the ordinary wear and tear of an <orgName n="Army of Occupation" type="army">army of occupation</orgName> alone excepted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1749"/>We had so often before our eyes the reverse of this wherever your army swept through <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, that we were thoroughly convinced of the justice of a stern retaliation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1750"/>It is no pleasure to me to have to recall the scenes of those days, nor do I do so in any spirit of vindictiveness, but I simply tell the truth in justification of an act which <persName n="Hoke,Mister,,,," id="n0295.0008.00155.01968" reg="mostcommon:Hoke,Jacob,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hoke</surname></persName> claims was without justification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>I must be frank enough to say that I think the reason the tribute demanded of you was not paid was because you people had no idea that the rebels would carry out their threat to burn; nor was this confidence shaken until the smoke and flames began to ascend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>I know that this is directly in the teeth of <persName n="Hoke,Mister,,,," id="n0295.0008.00156.01972" reg="mostcommon:Hoke,Jacob,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hoke</surname></persName>'s tribute to the patriotism of his fellow-townsmen, that sooner than pay money to the rebels they saw their homes laid in ashes; but he is himself a little illogical, for he gives greater condemnation to a cruel enemy for burning out a helpless people after they had shown to them that the banks had removed their deposits, and it was impossible for them to get the money demanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>Had your people believed that the town was actually in danger I think they could have raised enough money to have avoided the catastrophe.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/>Why this confidence of security?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/>It grew out of the position taken by your people during the war; that we were rebels, soon to be conquered; and that whatever cruelties were inflicted upon the homes of these rebels were in the nature of penalties for rebellious conduct; and that such like acts would never dare to be attempted against loyal men. It was further strengthened by the fact that when the whole Rebel Army was in your State, no atrocities were committed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>I saw this confidence, almost amounting to contempt, on our march to your town itself, when the negotiations, preliminary to the fire, were in progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1765"/><pb id="p.157" n="157"/> I happened with a comrade or <num value="2">two</num>, to get behind the command on the march to the town, and, in passing through a village of some size (I think it was <placeName key="tgn,2090680" n="1.000 51" reg="mercersburg, franklin, pennsylvania">Mercersburg</placeName>), the knots of men on the corners poked fun at our appearance, and jeered us, and, never seemed to consider that the men upon whom they expended their fun had pistols and sabres in their belts and might use them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>The strange part of the matter to us was to see ablebodied young men out of service&mdash;a sight never seen in the <rs>South</rs> during the war. In <placeName key="tgn,2087107" n="1.000 167" reg="chambersburg, franklin, pennsylvania">Chambersburg</placeName> itself, it seemed impossible to convince your people that we were in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1780"/>Some of the men became inflamed with liquor, but I believe they were few.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/>Our regiment was camped nearest the river, and the company to which I belonged was nearest the river of all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1819"/>Farther on down the road, where the shouts of combat had aroused the other <pb id="p.161" n="161"/> portion of the brigade, and they had time to rally to some extent, there was fighting, and some of our men were killed, and I saw some of <persName n="Averill,,,,," id="n0295.0008.00161.01984" reg="mostcommon:Averill,nomatch:0"><surname>Averill</surname></persName>'s wounded brought to the rear, but our rout was complete and irretrievable and the rallies, as I afterward heard, were without vigor on our part.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1829"/>The answer is a simple <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1830"/>It was through the carelessness of our commanding officer, and was inexcusable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1831"/>It happened in this way, and I am again in position to give the exact facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1832"/>When we camped in the little valley, a detail was called on for picket duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1833"/>That duty fell to the lot of <persName n="Bonn,Lieutenant,Samuel,G.,," id="n0295.0008.00161.01985" reg="default:Bonn,Samuel,G.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <foreName>Samuel</foreName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <surname>Bonn</surname></persName>, of my company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1835"/>This was the only guard between <persName n="Averill,,,,," id="n0295.0008.00161.01986" reg="mostcommon:Averill,nomatch:0"><surname>Averill</surname></persName> <pb id="p.162" n="162"/> and our sleeping men, it must be remembered, that when this little band went on the outpost they were worn out with the fatigue of the nearly incessant marching for the <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> previous days and nights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1836"/>So wearied were the men that after that <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> night's duty, <persName n="Bonn,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0295.0008.00162.01987" reg="nearbymention:Bonn,Samuel,G.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Bonn</surname></persName> sent word to camp and begged to be relieved, stating that his men were absolutely unfit for duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1837"/>I take it for granted this message was sent to headquarters, but whether it was or no it was an unjustifiable piece of cruelty to keep those wearied men on duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1838"/>His appeal was unheeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/>He told men, after the surprise was over, that the men on the outpost actually went to sleep upon their horses and that, in addition to all this, no provisions was made for their rations.</p>

After the line was formed, we were ordered to divest ourselves of all baggage, and to carry nothing but our arms and ammunition and a canteen of water, this being done, we headed towards the cemetery, and when arrived at the mouth of the covered way, used to protect our men when relieving picket, we marched up that covered way until we reached an angle, we then left the ditch, flanked to the right and marched a short distance down a ravine until nearly opposite the point where the mine was sprung, and were ordered to lie down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2327"/>The next line were white men, and so great was their desire to keep the negroes in front of them as a sort of breastwork, they lost sight of us until we were only a short distance from them, and I believe every shot took effect, as they were as thick in the breastworks as they could stand, and it was almost impossible to miss a man; but the <name>Yanks</name> were determined we should not have it all our way, and before we reached the breastworks they poured a volley into us, and about <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of our little brigade went down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2328"/>Notwithstanding all this, we pushed to the front, and reaching the ditch, in we went with empty muskets, depending on the bayonet and breech of the gun, and a regular hand to hand encounter took place.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2331"/>The <rs>Yanks</rs> fought bravely to maintain the foothold they had gained, but the powers of the <rs>Southern</rs> soldier were too much for them at that particular time, knowing as we did, that if they succeeded in carrying out their designs, our friends in the city would fare but common, and with us it was to do or die; and in an incredibly short time the breastworks to the left of the <name>Crater</name> for some distance occupied by the enemy were taken back and hostilities for a few moments ceased, but the end is not yet, the breastworks to the right of the <name>Crater</name> were still in the enemy's hands, and <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0295.0016.00205.02501" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> said they must be taken back.

My feet had not more than touched the ground when they rose up and stood before me. Just then the man that killed the sergeant stooped down and picked up a musket, evidently with the intention of killing me. I took in the situation at once, took hold of the <num value="2">two</num> men in front of me, and kept them so close together it was impossible for him to kill me without endangering the lives of his own men. Just at that moment, our men were jumping in the ditch like frogs; <num value="1">one</num> of them jumped in just behind me, and I sung out to him at the top of my voice to kill the man in front of me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2341"/>It has been said that drowning men will catch at a straw, so you can readily imagine my feelings while facing death, but I never lost presence of mind during the terrible ordeal to which I was subjected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2925"/>The <num value="1">one</num> thing in my personal history touching the war which I recall with most delight and hold in my supremest pride and satisfaction before all else, is, the ardor with which I took up arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2926"/>This ardor was not the mere ebullient force of passionate excitement, but the inspiration of unquestioning conviction that our duty to ourselves, to posterity, to our State, imperiously demanded that we should at all hazards and whatever might be the outcome, take up arms in defence of our rights as a free, <pb id="p.258" n="258"/> independent and liberty-loving people and to repel any invasion of our soil by hostile forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2927"/>You recall the glow of this ardor &mdash;you felt it&mdash;it burned in every true heart of the <rs>South</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2929"/>It was a bitter alternative that was presented to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, either to submit unresistingly and unconditionally to the determined and persistent encroachments on her equality under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, or to withdraw herself from the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">Union of the States</orgName> which she had been chiefly instrumental in forming and which for that reason, she, more than all the other States, loved pre-eminently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2930"/>She did all she could to avert this alternative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2931"/>She sent her most illustrious citizens to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> to implore for adjustment, for peace and for the perpetuity of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2932"/>Their petition was most haughtily disregarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2933"/>Notwithstanding this, she, through her people in solemn convention assembled, repressing all resentment, still stood majestically calm, though deeply moved, with her hand on the bond of the <rs>Union</rs>, refusing to untie it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2934"/>Put to this alternative, she resumed her delegated rights and sovereignty.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2941"/>You remember the profound interest and emotion of that hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2942"/>It stifled all light feelings, and gave to each brow a thoughtful aspect, and to each eye a depth of light which comes only when the heart is weighted with great moving concern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2943"/>Men pressed in silence each others hands, and spoke in tones subdued by the solemnity and intensity of their inexpressible feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2944"/>All knew that when that long roll once sounded, it would thrill the land, and that it would not cease to be heard, day or night, until silenced in victory or defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2945"/>The long roll beat; and the vulcan sounds of destruction in the navy yard, and the flames of burning buildings and blazing ships told that an unproclaimed war had commenced.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2946"/>Comrades, is it all a dream?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2947"/>Sometimes to me and doubtless sometimes to you, absorbed and environed as we are by the present, the war seems a mystical and mysterious thing, and we feel that its reality is in some way slipping from us. If in us who were its active participants there be such tendency, what must it be in those who are taking our places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2948"/>It is on account of this tendency to lose the reality and meaning of the great war that I have dwelt on this part of my theme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2949"/>And I cannot allow this occasion to pass without availing myself of it&mdash;the occasion of the organization of <q direct="unspecified">Sons of Veterans,</q> who are now before me&mdash;to say to them: Believe and know that your State and your fathers in taking up arms, were right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2950"/>Fail never to know and learn to know that the posterity of no race or people have inherited from their fathers such a legacy of true patriotism, such sublime devotion to duty, such imperishable wealth of arms as you have received from yours, and let the precious memory of this ennoble you, enrich your spirit, and make you the worthy inheritors of their fame and glory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2951"/>The personal reminisence of the war which I next most value and cherish is the feeling with which we made that memorable <pb id="p.260" n="260"/> charge at <placeName key="tgn,2489907" n="1.000 203" reg="malvern hill, charles city, virginia">Malvern Hill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2953"/>It can never be indifferent to note the feelings with which a soldier enters his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2954"/>Of all things battle is the most terrible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2955"/>And to us all life is the dearest thing, and the love of life is by nature made the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> law of our being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2956"/>We instinctively shrink from imperilling our lives, and yet with what glad shout we have seen soldiers rush into the fiercest battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2957"/>What a glorious thing is manhood!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2958"/>How <name n="God" type="God">God</name>-like is the devotion of man to duty&mdash;to a cause&mdash;in cheerfully giving up life to its service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2959"/>What a noble and master passion is patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2960"/>How it exalts and glorifies man. To have once felt it propitiates <num value="1">one</num>'s self-esteem and makes us ever a hero to ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2961"/>Shall I say it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2962"/>Yes, for it can be equally said of each of you who were there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2963"/>I have ever seemed to myself to have been a hero at <placeName key="tgn,2489907" n="1.000 203" reg="malvern hill, charles city, virginia">Malvern Hill</placeName>&mdash;if to be a hero is to feel the loftiest enthusiasm of patriotism&mdash;to disdain danger&mdash;to stand in the raging storm of shot and shell with a glad sense of duty and privilege to be there, and to be unreservedly willing to meet death for the good of <num value="1">one</num>'s country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2964"/>All this you felt with me on that memorable charge.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2968"/>Brave and chivalrous in spirit, ardent and devoted to duty, graceful in deportment, manly in character, true and proud in self-respect, he commanded the admiration and love of all who knew him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2969"/>He fell while gallantly leading his company on this charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2974"/>Let us recall the part which our own regiment, the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA9">Ninth Virginia</orgName>, took in this memorable charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2976"/>On arriving our regiment was detached from the <name>Brigade</name> to guard a strategic point and did not rejoin it until after the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2977"/>From <time value="10am">10 A. M.</time> to <time value="5pm">5 P. M.</time> we lay exposed to the shells of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2978"/>At this hour we were sent for and conducted to a deep wooded ravine which ran along the very edge of the open field on which the enemy had made a stand, and where they had planted many batteries and massed a great body of infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2979"/>When we took our position in the ravine we found that <persName n="Magruder,General,,,," id="n0295.0024.00261.03255" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Magruder</surname></persName> was there in command with a considerable force, all lying down in successive lines on the steep sloping side of the ravine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2981"/>The day was fast declining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2982"/>The deep shade of the majestic trees with which the valley was filled and the smoke of the enemy's guns brought on twilight dimness before the close of the day. As we lay in close rank, we marked the flash of exploding shells that kissed the brow of the ravine and lit it up with a wierd light, while the incessant firing of the massed batteries filled the air with constant roar and deafening crash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2983"/>At <num value="1">one</num> time, as the sun approached the horizon, the air seemed to change; it gained a new elasticity&mdash;a clearer ring, so that from the sound of the enemy's artillery you would have thought that they were approaching nearer to us. <persName n="Magruder,General,,,," id="n0295.0024.00261.03263" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Magruder</surname></persName> must have also thought so, for he gave direction that some men should ascend the brow of the hill and see if the enemy were advancing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2984"/>The enemy had not and were not advancing, but from an elevation in the open field they poured from their batteries a living fire and a constant flow of shells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2985"/><pb id="p.262" n="262"/></p> 
<p>The scene was solemn and grandly inspiring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2986"/>We felt that the very genius of battle was astir, and the martial spirit was thoroughly aroused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2987"/>All waited with impatience for the order to charge&mdash;that order which whenever given either fires the heart or pales the face of the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2988"/>At last <persName n="Magruder,,,,," id="n0295.0024.00262.03264" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,nomatch:0"><surname>Magruder</surname></persName> gives the order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2990"/>Then <persName n="Wright,,,,," id="n0295.0024.00262.03266" reg="mostcommon:Wright,A.,R.,,:1"><surname>Wright</surname></persName> repeats the order to his brigade, and as quick as thought his men spring forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2991"/>Then came from <persName n="Armistead,General,,,," id="n0295.0024.00262.03267" reg="mostcommon:Armistead,Lewis,A.,,:2"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Armistead</surname></persName>: <q direct="unspecified"><orgName type="regiment" key="VA9">Ninth Virginia</orgName>, charge!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2992"/>The men arose with a shout &mdash; a joyous shout that rose above the din of battle and with a passionate enthusiasm we rushed forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2993"/>Danger seemed to be banished from every bosom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2994"/>Victory and glory absorbed every other feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2995"/>We rushed on and forward to within a short distance of the crown of the hill on which the enemy was massed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2996"/>On us was concentrated the shell and cannister of many cannon and the fire of compact masses of infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2997"/>It was murderous and a useless waste of life to go further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2998"/>Our regiment was halted and it took position in line with other troops which had preceeded us in the charge along and under the slope of the field, and here held its ground until the morning disclosed that the enemy had left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2999"/>This gallant charge immortalized the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA9">Ninth Virginia</orgName> and gave it a fame which it was its pride ever after to maintain in all the great battles in which it was engaged.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3000"/>On this charge there came to me a new experience&mdash;a common experience on the battlefield&mdash;that of being wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3001"/>When our regiment had taken its position just described by moving to the right, I found myself on its extreme left standing up on an open field in the face of the enemy a short distance off with a storm of shot and shell literally filling the air. I remember as I stood there I looked upon the enemy with great admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3002"/>They were enveloped in the smoke of their guns and had a shadowy appearance, yet I could easily discern their cross belts, and I watched them go through the regular process of loading and firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3003"/>They seemed to be firing with as much steadiness and regularity as if on dress parade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3004"/>It was a grand <pb id="p.263" n="263"/> sight, and I was impressed with their courage and discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3005"/>I had not then learned the wisdom and duty of a soldier to seek all allowable protection from danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3006"/>I had a foolish pride to be and to appear fearless&mdash;as if it were a shame to seem to do anything to avoid danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3007"/>I remember that immediately on my right a soldier had sheltered himself behind a low stump.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3008"/>While silently approving his conduct in this respect yet apprehending he might only shelter himself, I said to him, <q direct="unspecified">Do not fail to fire on the enemy.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3009"/>I had scarcely uttered these words when I heard and felt that sounding thud of the minie ball which became so familiar to our soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3010"/>My left arm fell to my side and the blood streamed from my throat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3011"/>I staggered and would have fallen had not <num value="2">two</num> members of the <rs>Old Dominion Guard</rs> stepped quickly up and caught me and bore me off the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3012"/>I was shot through the throat, through the shoulder and through the arm. And I to-day wear <num value="6">six</num> scars from wounds then received, scars more prized by me than all the ribbons and jeweled decorations of kingly grant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3014"/>It was in these words, which I have ever since borne freshly and sacredly in my memory: <q direct="unspecified">Tell my friends at home that I did my duty.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3015"/>These words expressed all that was in me at that moment-friends, they express all that is in my life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3016"/>Well do I remember that supreme moment, how I was without fear, and was perfectly willing to die&mdash;to die the death of the patriot,&mdash;and how then came upon me the tender thought of home and of home friends, and all my earthly aspirations concentrated into the <num value="1">one</num> wish that my memory might be kindly linked to the recognition that I gave my life honorably and bravely in duty to myself, to my country, and to my <name n="God" type="God">God</name>. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3066"/>In this position our flags were plainly visible over the standing wheat, to the battery west of us, but the rail piles and the men lying behind them were hid from their view; and, evidently thinking that the regiment had changed front, they now diverted their fire in that direction.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3071"/>The deep R. R. cut to the north had proved a barrier to the advance of the enemy from that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3212"/>In an address, which I delivered in after years, (embodied in the pamphlet repeatedly referred to in this paper), I alluded to this gallant Confederate in rather intemperate language, which subsequently, when my war-time animosities had finally died out, I regretted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3244"/>Such a life inured him to hardships, but it was probably also through it that he acquired a taste for strong drink, and on rare occasions he was liable to indulge beyond the point of safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3248"/>Especially is this incumbent upon me, because in his official report he ignored (unknowingly it may be), the desperate struggle of my men to save the colors and retrieve his own mistake in neglecting to recall them; then, too, his report is so misleading and at variance with facts, that it leaves room for the false claim of a recapture that has done endless mischief; not only putting a stigma on my regiment, but doing great wrong to the actors in our color drama, tending to rob them of their laurels, and, what is worse yet, expose them to the shafts of slander.</p>

<p>In the above quotation H. gives <num value="3">three</num> different versions of <q direct="unspecified">the recapture canard,</q> too contradictory in several essentials to ensure their credence in a court of law. In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, as given in his official report, when the incidents of the battle were fresh in his memory, the recapture and return of the colors is claimed to have taken place during Wisters charge, north of the pike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3296"/>In the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> version given <measure n="43years" type="date">43 years</measure> after the battle, he says the colors were <q direct="unspecified">not far from where the <rs>Reynold</rs>'s monument is,</q> <pb id="p.291" n="291"/> and curiously locates the color guards <q direct="unspecified">close by at the N.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3297"/></p> 
<p>Why the color guards should be posted at the N. W. corner of the barn, (south of the pike), while the colors were north of the pike, is a question that would puzzle a Philadelphia lawyer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3298"/>They could not have been <q direct="unspecified">close by</q> the colors, for the barn is <measure n="50yards" type="distance">50 yards</measure> away from the pike in a direct line, and how could the color guards protect the colors <num value="100">100</num> to <measure n="120yards" type="distance">120 yards</measure> away?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3299"/>In this version of H's story, the recapture must have taken place south of the pike; and, strange as it seems, he now believes that it was our color guards who got the flag; which flag, whether State or National, he does not say. It is strange that the enemy should take only <num value="1">one</num> flag when they could just as easily have picked up both; strange, that if it was my men who recaptured <q direct="unspecified">the flag,</q> as H. now believes, that they should bring it to him; strange, that when ordered to take it to <persName n="Dwight,Colonel,,,," id="n0295.0027.00291.03465" reg="mostcommon:Dwight,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Dwight</surname></persName> with H's compliments, that they were sent back to the rail pile again, for there is where they were an hour or so after, as is proved by affidavits, corroborated by Confederate reports; strange, that not <num value="1">one</num> man of the <orgName n="Color Company" type="company">Color Company</orgName> (nor of the regiment as far as I could ever learn), knows anything personally about such a capture, recapture and return of the colors; strange, that the force of the enemy that stole down on our left, (as H. says), struck our colors and carried them along south across the pike, is not mentioned in any official report on either side, not even in that of his own; strange, that in the spring of <dateStruct value="1906--"><year reg="1906">1906</year></dateStruct>, H. should consider this flag question so profitless that he resolved not again to make mention of it in anything he said or wrote, but that in the following fall we find him down in <placeName reg="Puerto Rico" key="tgn,7004643">Porto Rico</placeName>, revamping the recapture claim with added emphasis to <persName n="Gamble,Captain,,,," id="n0295.0027.00291.03466" reg="mostcommon:Gamble,Ralph,E.,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Gamble</surname></persName>, and giving it a sort of a stage setting to make it more impressive.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3300"/>Strange it is, that H. wants my brave boys turned down&mdash;they, who were so faithful to their trust, and who, after being so shamefully left to their fate, gave such a splendid account of themselves, exhibiting the highest qualities of the <rs>American</rs> soldier, and adding renown to their regiment; strange, indeed, that it did not strike H. how unreasonable was such advice, which, <pb id="p.292" n="292"/> if given by an outsider to the historian of his regiment, urging him to leave out an unimportant, all mention of their brave color bearer, <persName n="Peiffer,Sergeant,,,," id="n0295.0027.00292.03467" reg="mostcommon:Peiffer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Sergeant">Sergt.</roleName> <surname>Peiffer</surname></persName>, would have aroused his (H.&apos;s) indignation, and he would have justly denounced it as the height of impertinence; yes, surprisingly strange, that H. has the effrontery to suggest to our historian that he pass over our color affair in silence and leave the stigma which his fictitious claim has placed on our regiment, without an antidote to its concealed poison.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3301"/>Stigma? Yes, the worst kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3302"/>The recapture claim, as given in H.'s official report, looks innocent enough on its face; but, as it is a well-known fact that the enemy got permanent possession of both our standards, it is equivalent to charging us with having lost our colors twice that day, a record bad enough to blacken the reputation of any regiment, no matter how severe and bloody was its fighting, or how heavy its losses.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3303"/>Strange it is, too, that H. adheres so persistently to his story, though unable to produce any evidence of its truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3721"/>I suppose this is the only occurrence of the kind on record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3722"/>While these batteries were thus engaged, I and my men became a little impatient, and <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n0295.0035.00330.03778" reg="mostcommon:Early,Jubal,A.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> passed by towards the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3723"/>He paused for a moment, and I playfully stated this to him. He replied to me good-naturedly that I need not be impatient, that there would be plenty for me to do after a while.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3724"/>Now, this undoubtedly locates <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n0295.0035.00330.03779" reg="mostcommon:Early,Jubal,A.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> on the northern side of the creek at that moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3725"/>He rode off, and I suppose an interval of <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure> elapsed, when I saw <persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n0295.0035.00330.03780" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,Stephen,W.,,:2"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName>'s men on the southern side of the creek gallantly advancing towards the enemy in the open field I have described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3727"/>In a few moments an order came to me to move across the bridge in front of me over <placeName key="tgn,2623544" n="1.000 1" reg="rock creek, menard, illinois">Rock Creek</placeName>, and follow up <persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n0295.0035.00330.03782" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,Stephen,W.,,:2"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName>'s men.

The enemy's batteries were throwing occasional shells at the bridge, and, if any of my horses had been knocked down, it would have blocked the way. The order was peremptory, and it was suggested that I should take <num value="1">one</num> piece across at a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3728"/>This was done, and this order was given by some person in authority; and while I am not certain, I think it was no less a person than <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n0295.0035.00330.03784" reg="mostcommon:Early,Jubal,A.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3729"/>I did obey this order, and in a short time had my entire battery across safely.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3730"/>After reaching the southern side, turned to the right and got into the field I have described, and there it is certain that <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n0295.0035.00330.03785" reg="mostcommon:Early,Jubal,A.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> joined me and rode with me slowly at the head of my battery, in the direction of <persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n0295.0035.00330.03786" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,Stephen,W.,,:2"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName>'s troops and the town, <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n0295.0035.00330.03787" reg="mostcommon:Early,Jubal,A.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> was silent as we rode together, most of the time, <pb id="p.331" n="331"/> his attention being absorbed by what was going on in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3731"/>He was perfectly cool, but manifested the deepest interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3732"/>He stated to me very briefly in substance, that if anything happened to <persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n0295.0035.00331.03788" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,Stephen,W.,,:2"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName>'s men, he wanted me to unlimber my battery immediately; I suppose, as a rallying point, in case such a thing became necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3733"/>When we got about the middle of the field, <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n0295.0035.00331.03789" reg="mostcommon:Early,Jubal,A.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> suddenly turned his horse towards me and in quick sharp tones, ordered me to prepare my battery for action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3736"/>Just then there seemed to be some halt or cessation, momentary in <persName n="Gordon,General,,,," id="n0295.0035.00331.03791" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,Stephen,W.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gordon</surname></persName>'s fire, which I did not understand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3738"/>I rode up, stopping my horse near him. My battery was then probably <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> in the rear of us, unlimbered and ready for action.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3739"/>While in this position <num value="1">one</num> of my sergeants rode up to me and stated that a wounded Federal officer was lying near the battery, and had expressed a wish to see me. <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n0295.0035.00331.03793" reg="mostcommon:Early,Jubal,A.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> heard this, and in a kind manner said to me: <q direct="unspecified">Go back and see what he wants.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3740"/>I did so, found lying between <num value="1">one</num> of my caissons and a gun, a Federal officer in the uniform of a lieutenant-colonel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3741"/>I got off my horse, told him I was captain of the battery, and wished to know what he wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3742"/>He stated to me in a manly way that he was helpless from the effect of his wound, and asked me to remove him to a place of safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3743"/>I immediately said to him: <q direct="unspecified">Certainly, <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>, that shall be done.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3744"/><num value="4">Four</num> of my men took him up and laid him in the corner of the fence near by. I rode over to where he was, and had some conversation with him. I raised his head and placed his overcoat under it to make him more comfortable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3745"/>At this he expressed much surprise, and intimated that he did not expect such kindness from a Confederate soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3746"/>I remonstrated with him for such a sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3747"/>He had on a handsome pair of field glasses, which he offered to me. At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> I declined them, reminding him of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0295.0035.00331.03794" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s strict orders in regard to such things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3748"/>He insisted, however, that I should take them, saying that they would be a temptation on account of their value for some Federal or Confederate who might pass by, to knock him <pb id="p.332" n="332"/> in the head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3749"/>I at last accepted the glasses as a present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3750"/>Some years afterwards I was in <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 13" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName> and related this incident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3751"/>It got to the ears of <persName n="Batchelder,Colonel,,,," id="n0295.0035.00332.03795" reg="mostcommon:Batchelder,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Batchelder</surname></persName>, who was in command there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3752"/>He informed me that the officer was <persName n="Lee,Lieutenant-Governor,,,," id="n0295.0035.00332.03796" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Governor">Lieutenant-Governor</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3755"/>I suppose all of this consumed perhaps <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure>. I had hardly reached the <rs>General</rs> when he suddenly and hurriedly started off, telling me to remain where I was until further orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3756"/>During all this time I do not remember any member of his staff, not even the courier, speaking to the <rs>General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3759"/>The wild Confederate yell was soon heard by us, indicating victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3760"/>I rode a little further with my battery, and it seemed to me, as a youthful soldier, in the confusion, that the whole Federal army was routed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3761"/>Such an impression speedily grew among my men and those about us. Much to my delight and that of my company, an order came to me to advance into the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3762"/>I had not advanced perhaps over <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards</measure> into the main street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3763"/>I think, of <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 13" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName>, when I received an order to halt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3764"/>I did so, of course, and seeing the confusion ahead of me in the street, and not knowing what would turn up, I unlimbered <num value="3">three</num> of my pieces and ordered my men to get several rounds of canister from the caisons and place them near the muzzle of the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3768"/>I could not resist the temptation to ride up myself to see what was the matter, <pb id="p.333" n="333"/> and why the battle had so suddenly stopped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3769"/>I naturally and modestly held my horse a little back from this distinguished group, but caught portions of the conversation, but too indistinctly to attempt to repeat it at this late day; but I think I cannot be mistaken when I say that both <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n0295.0035.00333.03808" reg="mostcommon:Early,Jubal,A.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> and <persName n="Gordon,General,,,," id="n0295.0035.00333.03809" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,Stephen,W.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gordon</surname></persName> were earnestly urging an immediate and further advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4044"/>They urged my mother to take her children and fly at once from the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4045"/>After resisting until the men, in despair, were almost ready to drag her from her dangerous situation, she finally consented to leave.
