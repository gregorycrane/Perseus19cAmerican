<head>Preface.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>During the summer of <dateStruct value="1881--"><year reg="1881">1881</year></dateStruct> I was a sojourner for a few weeks at a popular hotel in the <rs type="place">White Mountains</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Among the <num value="200">two hundred</num> or more guests who were enjoying its retirement and good cheer were from <num value="12">twelve</num> to <num value="20">twenty</num> lads, varying in age from <num value="10">ten</num> to <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure>. When tea had been disposed of, and darkness had put an end to their daily romp and hurrah without, they were wont to take in charge a gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>, formerly a gallant soldier in the <orgName n="Army of the Cumberland" type="army">Army of the Cumberland</orgName>, and in a quiet corner of the spacious hotel parlor, or a remote part of the piazza, would listen with eager attention as he related chapters of his personal experience in the <rs>Civil War</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Less than <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> elapsed before they pried out of the writer the acknowledgment that he too had served <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Sam</foreName></persName>; and immediately followed up this bit of information by requesting me to alternate evenings with the veteran from the <rs>West</rs> in entertaining them with stories of the war as I saw it. I assented to the plan readily enough, and a more interested or interesting audience of its size could not be desired than that knot of boys who clustered around us on alternate nights, while we related to them in an offhand way many facts regarded as too commonplace for the general histories of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>This trifling piece of personal experience led to the preparation of these sketches, and will largely account for the didactic manner in which they are written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>They are far from complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Many topics of interest are left untreated --they will readily suggest themselves to veterans; but it <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> was thought best not to expand this volume beyond its present proportions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>It is believed that what is herein written will appeal largely to a common experience among soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>In full faith that such is the case, they are now presented to veterans, their children, and the public as an important contribution of warp to the more majestic woof which comprises the history of the <rs>Great Civil War</rs> already written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>That history, to date, is a history of battles, of campaigns and of generals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>This is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attempt to record comprehensively army life in detail; in which both text and illustrations aim to permanently record information which the history of no other war has preserved with equal accuracy and completeness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>I am under obligations to many veterans for kindly suggestions and criticisms during the progress of this work, to <persName n="Houghton,,,,," id="n0006.0001.00012.00001" reg="mostcommon:Houghton,nomatch:0"><surname>Houghton</surname></persName> &amp; <placeName reg="Fort Mifflin">Mifflin</placeName> for the use of <persName n="Holmes,,,,," id="n0006.0001.00012.00002" reg="nearbymention:Holmes,Oliver,Wendell,,"><surname>Holmes</surname></persName>' <quote>Sweet little man,</quote> and especially to <persName n="Reed,Comrade,Charles,W.,," id="n0006.0001.00012.00003" reg="default:Reed,Charles,W.,,"><roleName n="Comrade">Comrade</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Reed</surname></persName>, for his many truthful and spirited illustrations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The large number of sketches which he brought from the field in <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct> has enabled him to reproduce with telling effect many sights and scenes once very familiar to the veterans of the <rs>Union</rs> armies, which cannot fail to recall stirring experiences in their soldier's life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Believing they will do this, and that these pages will appeal to a large number to whom the <rs>Civil War</rs> is yet something more than a myth, they are confidently put forth, the pleasant labor of spare hours, with no claim for their literary excellence, but with the full assurance that they will partially meet a want hitherto unsupplied. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>On the <dateStruct value="1860-11-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month>, <year>1860</year>,</dateStruct> <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n0006.0002.00015.00006" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, the candidate of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, was elected <rs type="role2">President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, over <num value="3">three</num> opponents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The autumn of that year witnessed the most exciting political canvass this country had ever seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>, which had been in power for several years in succession, split into factions and nominated <num value="2">two</num> candidates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The northern Democrats nominated <persName n="Douglas,,Stephen,A.,," id="n0006.0002.00015.00007" reg="default:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><foreName>Stephen</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, who was an advocate of the doctrine of <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Sovereignty,,Squatter,,," id="n0006.0002.00015.00008" reg="default:Sovereignty,Squatter,,,"><foreName>Squatter</foreName> <surname>Sovereignty</surname></persName></hi>, that is, the right of the people living in a Territory which wanted admission into the <rs>Union</rs> as a State to <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> decide for themselves whether they would or would not have slavery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The southern Democrats nominated <persName n="Breckenridge,,John,C.,," id="n0006.0002.00016.00009" reg="default:Breckenridge,John,C.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Breckenridge</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, at that time <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice-President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The doctrine which he and his party advocated was the right to carry their slaves into every State and Territory in the <rs>Union</rs> without any hindrance whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Then there was still another party, called by some the <hi rend="italics">Peace Party</hi>, which pointed to the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the country as its guide, but had nothing to say on the great question of slavery, which was so prominent with the other parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It took for its standardbearer <persName n="Bell,,John,,," id="n0006.0002.00016.00010" reg="default:Bell,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bell</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>; and <persName n="Everett,,Edward,,," id="n0006.0002.00016.00011" reg="default:Everett,Edward,,,"><foreName>Edward</foreName> <surname>Everett</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, was nominated as <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice-President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>This party drew its membership from both of the others, but largely from the <name>Democrats</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Owing to these divisions the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, which had not been in existence many years, was enabled to elect its candidate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The Republicans did not intend to meddle with slavery <figure id="fig.016"> 
<head>A Bell and Everett Campaigner.</head></figure> where it then was, but opposed its extension into any <hi rend="italics">new</hi> States and Territories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>This latter fact was very well known to the slave-holders, and so they voted almost solidly for <persName n="Breckenridge,,John,C.,," id="n0006.0002.00016.00012" reg="default:Breckenridge,John,C.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Breckenridge</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>But it was very evident to them, after the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> divided, that the <name>Republicans</name> would succeed, and so, long before the election actually took place, they began to make threats of seceding from the <rs>Union</rs> if <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0006.0002.00016.00013" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was elected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Freedom of speech was not tolerated <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> in these States, and northern people who were down <placeName reg="South River, Georgia, United States" key="tgn,2681709">South</placeName> for business or pleasure, if they expressed opinions in opposition to the popular political sentiments of that section, were at once warned to leave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Hundreds came North immediately to seek personal safety, often leaving possessions of great value behind them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Even native southerners who <figure id="fig.017"> 
<head>A Group of Southerners Discussing the situation.</head></figure> believed thoroughly in the <rs>Union</rs>--and there were hundreds of such &mdash; were not allowed to say so. This class of people suffered great indignities during the war, on account of their loyalty to the old flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Many of them were driven by insult and abuse to take up arms for a cause with which they did not sympathize, deserting it at the <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> earliest opportunity, while others held out to the bitter end, or sought a refuge from such persecution in the <rs>Union</rs> lines. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>As early as the <dateStruct value="-10-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, several southerners who were or had been prominent in politics met in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, and decided by a unanimous vote that the <rs>State</rs> should withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs> in the event of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0006.0002.00018.00014" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s election, which then seemed almost certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Some other States held similar meetings about the same date.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Thus early did the traitor leaders prepare the <rs>South</rs> for disunion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>These men were better known at that time as <quote>Fire-eaters.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/></p> 
<p>As soon as <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0006.0002.00018.00015" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s election was announced, without waiting to see what his policy towards the slave States was going to be, the impetuous leaders at the <rs>South</rs> addressed themselves at once to the carrying out of their threats; and <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, followed, at intervals more or less brief, by <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, seceded from the <rs>Union</rs>, and organized what was known as the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/><placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> seceded later.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The people at the <rs>North</rs> stood amazed at the rapidity with which treason against the government was spreading, and the loyal Unionloving men began to inquire where <persName n="Buchanan,President,,,," id="n0006.0002.00018.00016" reg="nearbymention:Buchanan,James,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> was at this time, whose duty it was to see that all such uprisings were crushed out; and <quote>Oh for <num value="1">one</num> hour of <persName n="Jackson,,Andrew,,," id="n0006.0002.00018.00017" reg="default:Jackson,Andrew,,,"><foreName>Andrew</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> in the <rs>President</rs>'s chair!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>was the common exclamation, because that decided and unyielding soldierPresi-dent had so promptly stamped out threatened rebellion in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, when she had refused to allow the duties to be collected at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>But that outbreak in its proportions was to this <num value="1">one</num> as an infant to a giant, and it is quite doubtful if Old Hickory himself, with his promptness to act in an emergency, could have stayed the angry billows of rebellion which seemed just ready to break over the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>But at any rate he would have attempted it, <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> even if he had gone down in the fight,--at least so thought the people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The very opposite of such a President was <persName n="Buchanan,,James,,," id="n0006.0002.00019.00018" reg="default:Buchanan,James,,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>, who seemed anxious only for his term of office to expire, making little effort to save the country, nor even willing, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that others should do so. With a traitor for his <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, the <rs>South</rs> had been well supplied with arms under the very nose of the old man. With a traitor for his <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs>, our vessels &mdash; not many in number, it is true &mdash; had been sent into foreign waters, where they could not be immediately recalled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>With a traitor as <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>, the public treasury had been emptied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Then, too, there began the seizure of arsenals, mints, custom-houses, post-offices, and fortifications within the limits of the seceding States, and still the <rs>President</rs> did nothing, or worse than nothing, claiming that the <rs>South</rs> was wrong in its acts, but that he had no right to prevent treason and secession, or, in the phraseology of that day, <quote>no right to coerce a sovereign State.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>And so at last he left the office a disgraced old man, for whom few had or have a kind word to offer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Such, briefly, was the condition of affairs when <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n0006.0002.00019.00019" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, fearful of his life, which had been threatened, entered <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> under cover of darkness, and quietly assumed the duties of his office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Never before were the people of this country in such a state of excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>At the <rs>North</rs> there were a large number who boldly denounced the <quote>Long-heeled Abolitionists</quote> and <quote>Black Republicans</quote> for having stirred up this trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>I was not a voter at the time of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0006.0002.00019.00020" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s election, but I had taken an active part in the torchlight parades of the <quote>Wide-awakes</quote> and <quote>Railsplitters,</quote> as the political clubs of the <name>Republicans</name> were called, and so came in for a share of the abuse showered upon the followers of the new <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>As fresh deeds of violence or new aggressions against the government were reported from the daily papers in the shop where I was <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> then employed, some <num value="1">one</num> who was not a <quote>Lincolnite</quote> would exclaim, in an angry tone; <quote>I hope you fellows are satisfied now. I don't blame the <rs>South</rs> an atom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>They have been driven to desperation by such lunatics as <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0006.0002.00020.00021" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,William,L.,,:1"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> and <persName n="Phillips,,,,," id="n0006.0002.00020.00022" reg="mostcommon:Phillips,nomatch:0"><surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, and these men ought to be hung for it.</quote> ... <quote>If there is a war, I hope you and every other Black Republican will be made to go and fight for the niggers all you want to.</quote> . . . <quote>You like the niggers so well you'll marry <num value="1">one</num> of them yet.</quote> .. .And, <quote>I want to see those hot-headed Abolitionists put into the front rank, and shot <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>These are mild quotations from the daily conversations, had not only where I was employed, but in every other shop and factory in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Such wordy contests were by no means <num value="1">one</num>-sided affairs; for the assailed, while not anxious for war, were not afraid of it, and were amply supplied with arguments with which they answered and enraged their antagonists; and if they did not always silence them, they <figure id="fig.020"> 
<head>A Lincoln wide awake.</head></figure> drove them into making just such ridiculous remarks as the foregoing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>If I were asked who these men were, I should not call them by name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>They were my neighbors and my friends, but they are changed men to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>There is not <num value="1">one</num> of them who, in the light of later experiences, is not heartily ashamed of his attitude at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Many of them afterwards went to the field, and, sad to say, are there yet. But this was the period of the most intemperate and abusive language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Those who sympathized with the <rs>South</rs> were, some months later, called Copperheads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0006.0002.00020.00023" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and his party were reviled by these men without any restraint except such as personal shame and self-respect <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> might impose; and these qualities were conspicuously absent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Nothing was too harsh to utter against Republicans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>No fate was too evil for their political opponents to wish them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Of course all of these revilers were not sincere in their ill-wishes, but the effect of their utterances on the community was just as evil; and the situation of the new <rs>President</rs>, at its best a perplexing and critical <num value="1">one</num>, was thus made all the harder, by leading him to believe that a multitude of the citizens at the <rs>North</rs> would obstruct instead of supporting him. It also gave the slavehold-ers the impression that a very considerable number of northern men were ready to aid them in prosecuting their treasonable schemes But now the rapid march of events wrought a change in the opinions of the people in both sections. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The leading Abolitionists had argued that the <rs>South</rs> was too cowardly to fight <figure id="fig.021"> 
<head>Nayther Av us.</head></figure> for slavery; and the <rs>South</rs> had been told by the <quote>Fire-eaters</quote> and its northern friends that the <rs>North</rs> could not be kicked into fighting; that in case war should arise she would have her hands full to keep her enemies <hi rend="italics">at home</hi> in check.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Alas! how little did either party understand the temper of the other!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>How much like that story of the <num value="2">two</num> Irishmen.--Meeting <num value="1">one</num> day in the army, <num value="1">one</num> says, <quote>How are you, <persName><foreName>Mike</foreName></persName>?</quote>

<p>Nothing could better illustrate the attitude of the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> towards each other than this anecdote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Nothing could have been more perfect than this mutual misunderstanding each displayed of the temper of the other, as the stride of events soon showed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>It was these events which opened the eyes of the <quote>Northern Doughfaces,</quote> as those who sympathized with the <rs>South</rs> were often called, to the real intent of the <name>Seceders</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>A change came over the spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>of their dreams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Patriotism, love of the <rs>Union</rs>, at last came uppermost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>They had heard it proposed to divide the old flag, giving a part to each section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>They had seen a picture of the emblem thus rent, and it was not a pleasing <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Soon the greater portion of them ceased their sneers and ill-wishes, and joined in the general demand that something be done at once to assert the majesty and power of the national government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Even <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0006.0002.00022.00027" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, who, in his inaugural address, had counselled his <quote>countrymen, <num value="1">one</num> and all, to take time and think calmly and well upon this whole subject,</quote> had come to feel that further forbearance was no virtue, and that a decent respect for this great nation and for his office as <rs type="role2">President</rs> demanded that something should be done speedily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>So on the <dateStruct value="-04-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> he issued a proclamation calling out <num value="75000">75,000</num> militia, for <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>, to suppress the <rs>Rebellion</rs>, and to cause the laws to be executed. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Having been a Massachusetts soldier, it is but natural that I should refer occasionally to her part in the opening <pb id="p.23" n="23"/> of this momentous crisis in the country's history, as being more familiar to me than the record of any other State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>It has often been asked how <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, so much farther from the <rs>National Capital</rs> than any of the other States, should have been so prompt in coming to its assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Let me give some idea of how it happened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>In <dateStruct value="1860-12-"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Schouler,Adjutant General,,,," id="n0006.0002.00023.00029" reg="mostcommon:Schouler,William,,,:1"><roleName n="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</roleName> <surname>Schouler</surname></persName> of that State, in his annual report, suggested to Governor (afterwards General) <persName n="Banks,,N.,P.,," id="n0006.0002.00023.00030" reg="expanded:Banks,Nathaniel,P.,,"><foreName>N.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Banks</surname></persName>, that as events were then occurring which might require that the militia of <placeName key="tgn,7007517" n="1.000 11" reg="massachusetts">Massachusetts</placeName> should be increased in number, it would be well for <figure id="fig.023"> 
<head>The minute man of &lsquo;<num value="61">61</num>.</head></figure> commanders of companies to forward to Headquarters a complete roll of each company, with their names and residence, and that companies not full should be recruited to the limit fixed by law, which was then <num value="101">one hundred and one</num> for infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Shortly afterwards <persName n="Andrew,,John,A.,," id="n0006.0002.00023.00031" reg="default:Andrew,John,A.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName>, now known in history as the <hi rend="italics">Great War Governor</hi> of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, assumed the duties of his office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>He was not only a leading Republican before the war, but an Abolitionist as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>He seemed to clearly foresee that the time for threats and arguments had gone <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> by, and that the time for action was at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>So on the <dateStruct value="-01-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> he issued an order (<num value="4">No. 4</num>) which had for its object to ascertain exactly how many of the officers and men in the militia would hold themselves ready to respond immediately to any call which might be made upon their services by the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>All who were not ready to do so were discharged at once, and their places filled by others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Thus it was that <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> for the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time in her history prepared her <quote>Minute men</quote> to take the field at a minute's notice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>This <rs n="General Order" type="misc">general order</rs> of the <rs>Governor</rs>'s, although a very wise <num value="1">one</num> as it proved, carried dismay into the ranks of the militia, for there were in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, as in other States, very many men who had made valiant and well disciplined <hi rend="italics">peace</hi> soldiers, who, now that <num value="1">one</num> of the real needs of a well organized militia was upon us, were not at all thirsty for further military glory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>But pride stood in the way of their frankness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>They were ashamed in this hour of their country's peril to withdraw from the militia, for they feared to face public opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>Yet there were men who had good and sufficient reasons for declining to pledge themselves for instant military service, at least until there was a more general demand for troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>They were loyal and worthy citizens, and could not in a moment cast aside or turn their back on their business or domestic responsibilities, and in a season of calmer reflection it would not have been expected of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>But the public pulse was then at feverheat, and reason was having a vacation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/><rs n="General Order 4" type="misc">General Order No. 4</rs> was, I believe, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> important step taken by the <rs>State</rs> in preparing for the crisis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>The next was the passage of a bill by the <name>Legislature</name>, which was approved by the <rs>Governor</rs> <dateStruct value="-04-3"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="3">3</day></dateStruct>, appropriating <measure n="25000dollars" type="currency">$25,000</measure> for <quote>overcoats, blankets, knapsacks, <num value="200000">200,000</num> ball cartridges, etc., for <num value="2000">two thousand</num> troops.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>These supplies were soon ready.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>The militiamen then owned their uniforms, and, as no particular kind was prescribed, no <num value="2">two</num> companies of the <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> same regiment were of necessity uniformed alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>It is only a few years since uniformity of dress has been required of the militia in <placeName key="tgn,7007517" n="1.000 11" reg="massachusetts">Massachusetts</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>But to return to that memorable <dateStruct value="-04-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>War, that much talked-of, much dreaded calamity was at last upon us. Could it really be so?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>We would not believe it; and yet daily happenings forced the unwelcome conclusion upon us. It seemed so strange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>We had nothing in our experience to compare it with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>True, some of us had dim remembrances of a Mexican war in our early childhood, but as <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> sent only <num value="1">one</num> regiment to that war, and that saw no fighting, and, besides, did not receive the sympathy and support of the people in the <rs>State</rs> generally, we only remembered that there was a Scott, and a Taylor, and a <name>Santa Ana</name>, from the colored prints we had seen displayed of these worthies; so that we could only run back in memory to the stories and traditions of the wars of the <name>Revolution</name> and <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, in which our ancestry had served, for anything like a vivid picture of what was about to occur, and this, of course, was utterly inadequate to do the subject justice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>I have already stated that <rs n="General Order 4" type="misc">General Order No. 4</rs> carried dismay into many hearts, causing the more timid to withdraw from military service at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>A great many more would have withdrawn at the same time had they not been restrained by pride and the lingering hope that there would be no war after all; but this very day (the <num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num>) came <rs n="Special Order 14">Special Order No. 14</rs>, from <persName n="Andrew,Governor,,,," id="n0006.0002.00025.00032" reg="nearbymention:Andrew,John,A.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName>, ordering the <num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num>, <num value="4" type="ordinal">Fourth</num>, <num value="6" type="ordinal">Sixth</num>, and <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 8">Eighth Regiments</orgName> to assemble on Boston Common forthwith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>This was the final test of the militiamen's actual courage and thirst for glory, and a severe <num value="1">one</num> it proved to many of them, for at this <num value="11" type="ordinal">eleventh</num> hour there was another falling-out along the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>But the moment a man's declination for further service was made known, unless his reasons were of the very best, straightway he was hooted at for his cowardice, and for a time his <pb id="p.26" n="26"/> existence was made quite unpleasant in his own immediate neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>If he had been a commissioned officer, his face was likely to appear in an illustrated paper, accompanied by the statement that he had <quote>shown the white feather,</quote> --another term for cowardice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>A reference to any file of illustrated papers of those days will show a large number of such persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Such gratuitous advertising by a generally loyal, though not always discreet press did some men gross injustice; for, as already intimated, many of the men thus publicly sketched and denounced were among the most worthy and loyal of citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>A little later than the period of which I am treating, <persName n="Holmes,,Oliver,Wendell,," id="n0006.0002.00026.00033" reg="default:Holmes,Oliver,Wendell,,"><foreName>Oliver</foreName> <foreName>Wendell</foreName> <surname>Holmes</surname></persName> wrote the following poem, hitting off a certain limited class in the community:--

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>The <dateStruct value="-04-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> was a memorable day in the history of the <rs type="place">Old Bay</rs> State,--a day made more uncomfortable by the rain and sleet which were falling with disagreeable constancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Well do I remember the day. Possessing an average amount of the fire and enthusiasm of youth, I had asked my father's consent to go out with <orgName type="company" n="Company A">Company A</orgName> of the old <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 4">Fourth Regiment</orgName>, which belonged to my native town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>But he would not give ear to any such <quote>nonsense,</quote> and, having been brought up to obey his orders, although of military age (<num value="18">18</num>), I did not enter the service in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>This company did not go with full ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>There were few that did. Several of my shopmates were in its membership.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>As <pb id="p.29" n="29"/> those of us who remained gathered at the windows that stormy forenoon to see the company go by, the sight filled us with the most gloomy forebodings. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>So the troops went forth from the towns in the shore counties of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>Most of the companies in the regiments that were called reported for duty at <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> this <figure id="fig.029">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/><num value="1">One</num> of these companies was commanded by <persName n="Martin,Captain,Knott,V.,," id="n0006.0002.00029.00038" reg="default:Martin,Knott,V.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>Knott</foreName> <foreName>V.</foreName> <surname>Martin</surname></persName>, who was engaged in slaughtering hogs when Adjutant (now <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs>) <persName n="Hinks,,E.,W.,," id="n0006.0002.00029.00039" reg="default:Hinks,E.,W.,,"><foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Hinks</surname></persName> rode up and instructed him to report on Boston Common in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Drawing the knife from the throat of a hog, the <rs>Captain</rs> uttered an exclamation which has passed into history, threw the knife with a light toss to the floor, went immediately <pb id="p.30" n="30"/> and notified his <persName n="Sergeant,Orderly,,,," id="n0006.0002.00030.00040" reg="mostcommon:Sergeant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Orderly">Orderly</roleName> <surname>Sergeant</surname></persName>, and then returned to his butchering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>In the morning he and his company were ready for business. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>But their relatives who remained at home could not look calmly on the departure of these dear ones, who were going no <num value="1">one</num> knew just where, and would return &mdash; perhaps never; so there were many touching scenes witnessed at the various railway stations, as the men boarded the trains for <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>When these <placeName key="tgn,7013997" n="1.000 22" reg="marblehead, essex county, massachusetts">Marblehead</placeName> companies arrived at that city the enthusiasm was something unprecedented, and as a new detachment appeared in the streets it was cheered to the echo all along its line of march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>The early months of the war were stirring ones for <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>; for not only did the most of the <rs>Massachusetts</rs> regiments march through her streets <hi rend="italics">en route</hi> for the seat of war, but also the troops from <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName> and <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName> as well, so that a regiment halted for rest on the <name>Common</name>, or marching to the strain of martial music to some railway station, was at times a daily occurrence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>It has always seemed to me that the <quote><measure n="3months" type="date">Three months</measure> men</quote> have never received half the credit which the worth of their services to the country deserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>The fact of their having been called out for so short a time as compared with the troops that came after them, and of their having seen little or no fighting, places them at a disadvantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>But to have so suddenly left all, and gone to the defence of the <rs type="place">Capital City</rs>, with no knowledge of what was in store for them, and impelled by no other than the most patriotic of motives, seems to me fully as praiseworthy as to have gone later under the pressure of urgent need, when the full stress of war was upon us, and when its realities were better known, and the inducements to enlist greater in some other respects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>There is no doubt whatever but what the prompt appearance of these short-term men not only saved the <rs>Capital</rs>, but that it served also to show the <rs>Rebels</rs> that the <rs>North</rs> at short call could send a large and comparatively <pb id="p.31" n="31"/> <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> <pb id="p.33" n="33"/> well equipped force into the field, and was ready to back its words by deeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>The methods by which these regiments were raised were various.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>In <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> a common way was for some <num value="1">one</num> who had been in the regular army, or perhaps who had been prominent in the militia, to take the initiative and circulate an enlistment paper for signatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>His chances were pretty good for obtaining a commission as its captain, for his active interest, and men who had been prominent in assisting him, if they were popular, would secure the lieutenancies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>On the return of the <quote><measure n="3months" type="date">Three months</measure></quote> troops many of the companies immediately re-enlisted in a body for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, sometimes under their old officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>A large <pb id="p.35" n="35"/> number of these short-term veterans, through influence at the various State capitals, secured commissions in new regiments that were organizing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>In country towns too small to furnish a company, the men would post off to a neighboring town or city, and there enlist. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>In <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, men who had seen a year's active service were selected to receive a part of the commissions issued to new organizations, and should in justice have received <hi rend="italics">all</hi> within the bestowal of governors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>But the recruiting of troops soon resolved itself into individual enlistments or this programme ;--<num value="20">twenty</num>, <num value="30">thirty</num>, <num value="50">fifty</num> or more men would go in a body to some recruiting station, and signify their readiness to enlist in a certain regiment <hi rend="italics">provided</hi> a certain specified member of their number should be commissioned captain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Sometimes they would compromise, if the outlook was not promising, and take a lieutenancy, but equally often it was necessary to accept their terms, or count them out. In the rivalry for men to fill up regiments, the result often was officers who were diamonds in the rough, but liberally intermingled with <hi rend="italics">veritable clod-hoppers</hi> whom a brief experience in active service soon sent to the rear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>This year the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> was working on a more systematic basis, and when a call was made for additional troops each State was immediately assigned its quota, and with marked promptness each city and town was informed by the <rs>State</rs> authorities how many men it was to furnish under that call.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>The war fever was not at such a fervid heat in &lsquo;<num value="62">62</num> as in the year before, and so recruiting offices were multiplied in cities and large towns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>These offices were of <num value="2">two</num> kinds, <hi rend="italics">viz</hi>.: those which were opened to secure recruits for regiments and batteries already in the field, and those which solicited enlistments in <hi rend="italics">new</hi> organizations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Unquestionably, at this time the latter were more popular. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>The former office was presided over by a line officer directly from the front, attended by <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> subordinates, all of whom had smelled powder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>The latter office might <pb id="p.36" n="36"/> be in charge of an experienced soldier recently commissioned, or of a man ambitious for such preferment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>The flaming advertisements with which the newspapers of the day teemed, and the posters pasted on the bill-boards or the country fence, were the decoys which brought patronage to these fishers of men. Here is a sample:--

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>War meetings similar to the <num value="1">one</num> called in <placeName reg="Roxbury, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015002">Roxbury</placeName> were designed to stir lagging enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>Musicians and orators blew themselves red in the face with their windy efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Choirs improvised for the occasion, sang <quote><rs type="color">Red</rs>, <rs type="color">white</rs>, and <rs type="color">blue</rs></quote> and <quote>Rallied &lsquo;Round the flag</quote> till too hoarse for further endeavor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>The old veteran soldier of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct> was trotted out, and worked for all he was worth, and an occasional Mexican War veteran would air his nonchalance at grim-visaged war. At proper intervals the enlistment roll would be presented for signatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>There was generally <num value="1">one</num> old fellow present who upon slight provocation would yell like a hyena, and declare his readiness to shoulder his musket and go, if he wasn't so old, while his staid and halffearful consort would pull violently at his coat-tails to repress his unseasonable effervescence ere it assumed more dangerous proportions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Then there was a patriotic maiden lady who kept a flag or a handkerchief waving with only the rarest and briefest of intervals, who <quote>would go in a minute if she was a man.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>Besides these there was usually a man who would make <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="50">fifty</num> (or some other safe number) to enlist, when he well understood that such a number could not be obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>And there was <num value="1">one</num> more often found present who when challenged to sign would agree to, <hi rend="italics">provided</hi> that A or B (men of wealth) would put down <hi rend="italics">their</hi> names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>I saw a man at a war meeting promise, with a bombastic flourishment, to enlist if a certain number (which <pb id="p.39" n="39"/> <pb id="p.40" n="40"/> <pb id="p.41" n="41"/> I do not now remember) of the citizens would do the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>The number was obtained; but the small-sized patriot, who was willing to sacrifice his <hi rend="italics">wife's</hi> relations on the altar of his country, crawled away amid the sneers of his townsmen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Sometimes the patriotism of such a gathering would be wrought up so intensely by waving banners, martial and vocal music, and burning eloquence, that a town's quota would be filled in less than an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>It needed only the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> man to step forward, put down his name, be patted on the back, placed upon the platform, and cheered to the echo as the hero of the hour, when a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num>, a <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> would follow, and at last a perfect stampede set in to sign the enlistment roll, and a frenzy of enthusiasm would take possession of the meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>The complete intoxication of such excitement, like intoxication from liquor, left some of its victims on the following day, especially if the fathers of families, with the sober <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> thought to wrestle with; but Pride, that tyrannical master, rarely let them turn back. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>The next step was a medical examination to determine physical fitness for service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>Each town had its physician for this work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>The candidate for admission into the army must <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> divest himself of all clothing, and his soundness or unsoundness was then decided by causing him to jump, bend over, kick, receive sundry thumps in the chest and back, and such other laying &mdash; on of hands as was thought necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>The teeth had also to be examined, and the eyesight tested, after which, if the candidate passed, he received a certificate to that effect. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>His next move was toward a recruiting station.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>There he would enter, signify his errand, sign the roll of the company or regiment into which he was going, leave his description, including height, complexion, and occupation, and then accompany a guard to the examining surgeon, where he was again subjected to a critical examination as to soundness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/><pb id="p.42" n="42"/> Those men who, on deciding to <quote>go to war,</quote> went directly to a recruiting office and enlisted, had but this simple examination to pass, the other being then unnecessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>It is interesting to note that in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> and &lsquo;<num value="62">62</num> men were mainly examined to establish their <hi rend="italics">fitness</hi> for service; in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct> and &lsquo;<num value="64">64</num> the tide had changed, and they were then only anxious to prove their unfitness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>After the citizen in question had become a soldier, he was usually sent at once to camp or the seat of war, but if he wanted a short furlough it was generally granted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>If he had enlisted in a new regiment, he might remain weeks before being ordered to the front; if in an old regiment, he might find himself in a fight at short notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>Hundreds of the men who enlisted under the call issued by <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0006.0003.00042.00055" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:3"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> <dateStruct value="1862-07-02"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="2">2</day>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, were killed or wounded before they had been in the field a week. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Any man or woman who lived in those thrilling early war days will never forget them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>The spirit of patriotism was at fever-heat, and animated both sexes of all ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Such a display of the national colors had never been seen before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Flag-raisings were the order of the day in public and private grounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>The trinity of <rs type="color">red</rs>, <rs type="color">white</rs>, and <rs type="color">blue</rs> colors was to be seen in all directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>Shopkeepers decked their windows and counters with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Men wore them in neckties, or in a rosette pinned on the breast, or tied in the button-hole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>The women wore them conspicuously also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>The bands played only patriotic airs, and <quote><persName n="Doodle,,Yankee,,," id="n0006.0003.00042.00056" reg="default:Doodle,Yankee,,,"><foreName>Yankee</foreName> <surname>Doodle</surname></persName>,</quote> <quote><rs type="color">Red</rs>, <rs type="color">white</rs>, and <rs type="color">blue</rs>,</quote> and the <orgName n="Star Spangled Banner" type="newspaper">Star-spangled banner</orgName> would have been worn threadbare if possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Then other patriotic songs and marches were composed, many of which had only a short-lived existence; and the poetry of this period, some of it excellent, would fill a large volume. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>This deed done, the responsibility of the citizen for himself ceased in a measure, and <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Sam</foreName></persName> took him in charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>A word here to make clear to the ninformed the distinction between the militia and the volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>The militia are the soldiers of the <rs>State</rs>, and their duties lie wholly within its limits, unless called out by the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in an emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Such an emergency occurred when <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0006.0004.00043.00057" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:3"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> made his call for <num value="75000">75,000</num> militia, already alluded to. The volunteers, on the other hand, enlist directly into the service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and it becomes the duty of the national government to provide for them from the very date of their enlistment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Before leaving the <rs>State</rs> these volunteers were <hi rend="italics">mustered into service</hi>. This often occurred soon after their enlistment, before they had been provided with the garb of Union soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/><pb id="p.44" n="44"/> </p> 
<p>The oath of muster, which they took with uplifted hand ran as follows:-- <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>A stockade proper is an enclosure made with posts set close together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>In stockading a tent the posts were split in halves, and the cleft sides all turned inward so as to make a clean and comely inside to the hut.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>This method took much less time and material than the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>These tents, also, are not of modern origin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>They were certainly used by <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0006.0004.00050.00068" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, and probably long before his day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>It was a common occurrence to see <num value="2">two</num> or more of these joined, being connected by ripping the central seam in the <num value="2">two</num> ends that came in contact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>By looping back the flaps thus liberated, <pb id="p.51" n="51"/> the tents were thrown together, and quite a commodious hospital was in that way opened with a central corridor running its entire length between a double row of cots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Tile smaller size of wall tent was in general use as the tent of commissioned officers, and so far as I now recall, was used by no <num value="1">one</num> else. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>But in some way many <figure id="fig.051">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Over the top an extra piece of canvas, called a fly, was stretched as additional protection against sun and rain.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>Just why it is called the shelter tent I cannot say, unless on the principle stated by <persName n="Ellis,Reverend,George,,," id="n0006.0004.00051.00070" reg="default:Ellis,George,,,"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev.</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Ellis</surname></persName> for calling the pond on Boston Common a <placeName key="possibilities=32" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Frog Pond</placeName>, <hi rend="italics">viz</hi>: because there are no frogs there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>So there is little shelter in this variety <pb id="p.52" n="52"/> of tent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>But about that later.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>I can imagine no other reason for calling it a dog tent than this, that when <num value="1">one</num> is pitched it would only comfortably accommodate a dog, and a small <num value="1">one</num> at that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>This tent was invented late in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> or early in <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Each man was provided with a <hi rend="italics">half-shelter</hi>, as a single piece was called, which he was expected to carry on the march if he wanted a tent <figure id="fig.052">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>I will describe these more fully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>A single halfshelter, it can be seen, would make a very contracted and uncomfortable abode for a man ; but every soldier was expected to join his resources for shelter with some other fellow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>It was only rarely that a soldier was met with who was so crooked a stick that no <num value="1">one</num> would chum with him, or that he cared for no chum, although I have seen a few such cases in my experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>But the rule in the army was similar to that in civil life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Every man had his chum or friend, with whom he associated when off duty, and these tented together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>By mutual agreement <num value="1">one</num> was the <quote>old woman,</quote> the other the <quote>old man</quote> of the concern.

<p>By means of the buttons and button-holes <num value="2">two</num> or more of these half-shelters could be buttoned together, making a very complete roofing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>There are hundreds of men that came from different sections of the same State, or from different States, who joined their resources in this manner, and to-day through this accidental association they are the warmest of personal friends, and will continue so while they live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>It was not usual to pitch these tents every night when the army was on the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>The soldiers did not waste their time and strength much in that way. If the night was clear and pleasant, they lay down without roof-shelter of any kind; but if it was stormy or a storm was threatening when the order came to go into camp for the night, the shelters were then quite generally pitched. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>A guy rope which went with every half-shelter was stretched between the trigger-guards of the muskets, and over this as a ridge-pole the tent was pitched in a twinkling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>Artillery men pitched theirs over a horizontal bar supported by <num value="2">two</num> uprights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>This framework was split out of fencerails, if fence-rails were to be had conveniently; otherwise, saplings were cult for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>It often happened that men would throw away their shelters during the day, and take their chances with the weather, or of finding cover in some barn, or under the brow of some overhanging rock, rather than be burdened with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>In summer, when the army was not in proximity to the enemy, or was lying <pb id="p.54" n="54"/> off recuperating, as the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> did a few weeks after the <rs n="Gettysburg Campaign" type="campaign">Gettysburg campaign</rs>, they would pitch their shelters high enough to get a free circulation of air beneath, and to enable them to build bunks or cots a foot or <num value="2">two</num> above the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>Sometimes the gables were built up to the ridge-poles with smaller logs, but just as often they were filled by an extra halfshelter, a rubber blanket, or an old <hi rend="italics">poncho</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>The chinks between the logs were filled with mud, worked to a viscous consistency, which adhered more or less tenaciously according to the amount of clay in the mixture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>It usually needed renewing after a severe storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>The chimney was built outside, after the southern fashion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>It stood sometimes at the end and sometimes in the middle of <num value="1">one</num> side of the stockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>It started from a fire-place which was fashioned with more or less skill, according to the taste or mechanical genius of the workman, or the tools and materials used, or both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>In my own company there <figure id="fig.055"> 
<head>A poncho on.</head></figure> were <num value="2">two</num> masons who had opportunities, whenever a winter camp was pitched, to practise their trade far more than they were inclined to do. The fire-places were built of brick, of stone, or of wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>If there was a deserted house in the neighborhood of the camp which boasted brick chimneys, they were sure to be brought low to serve the <rs>Union</rs> cause in the manner indicated, unless the house was used by some general officer as headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>When built of wood, the chimneys were lined with a very thick coating of mud. They were generally continued above the fireplace with split wood built cob-fashion, which was filled between and lined with the red clayey soil of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, but stones were used when abundant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/><pb id="p.56" n="56"/> </p> 
<p>Very frequently pork and beef barrels were secured to serve this purpose, being put <num value="1">one</num> above another, and now and then a lively hurrah would run through the camp when <num value="1">one</num> of these was discovered on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>It is hardly necessary to remark that not all these chimneys were monuments of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>Too often the draught was down instead of up, and the inside of some stockades resembled smokehouses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>Still, it was <quote>all in the <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>,</quote> as the boys used to say. It was all the same to the average soldier, who rarely saw fit to tear down and build anew more <pb id="p.57" n="57"/> scientifically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>The smoke of his camp-fires in warm weather was an excellent preparative for the smoking fireplace of winter-quarters. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>Many of these huts were deemed incomplete until a sign appeared over the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Here and there some <num value="1">one</num> would make an attempt at having a door-plate of wood suitably inscribed; but the more common sight was a sign over the entrance bearing such inscriptions, rudely cut or marked with charcoal, as: <quote><placeName reg="Parker House">Parker House</placeName>,</quote> <quote>Hole in the wall,</quote> <quote><persName n="Pearson,,Mose,,," id="n0006.0004.00057.00071" reg="default:Pearson,Mose,,,"><foreName>Mose</foreName> <surname>Pearson</surname></persName>'s,</quote> <quote><placeName reg="Astor House">Astor House</placeName>,</quote> <quote><persName n="Willard,,,,," id="n0006.0004.00057.00072" reg="mostcommon:Willard,Paul,,,:1"><surname>Willard</surname></persName>'s hotel,</quote> <quote><placeName key="possibilities=131" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Five points</placeName>,</quote> and other titles equally absurd, expressing in this ridiculous way the vagaries of the inmates. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>The last kind of shelter I shall mention as used in the field, but not the least in importance, was the Bomb-proofs used by both Union and Rebel armies in the war. Probably there were more of these erected in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> than in all the rest of the <rs>South</rs> combined, if I except <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, as here the opposing armies established themselves &mdash; the <num value="1">one</num> in defence, the other in siege of the <num value="2">two</num> cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>These bomb-proofs were built just inside the fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>Their walls were made of logs heavily banked with earth and having a door or wider opening on the side The interior of these structures varied in size with the number that occupied them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>Some were built on the surface of the ground, to keep them drier and more comfortable; <pb id="p.58" n="58"/> others were dug down after the manner of a cellar kitchen; but all of them were at best damp and unwholesome habitations &mdash; even where fireplaces were introduced, which they were in cool weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>For these reasons they were occupied only when the enemy was engaged in sending over his iron compliments in the shape of mortar-shells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>For all other hostile missiles the breastworks were ample protection, and under their walls the men stretched their half-shelters and passed most of their time in the <rs type="season">summer</rs> and <rs type="season">fall</rs> of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, when their lot was cast in that part of the lines nearest the enemy in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>A mortar is a short, stout cannon designed to throw shells <hi rend="italics">into</hi> fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>This is accomplished by elevating the muzzle a great deal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>But the <figure id="fig.058"> 
<head>A <measure n="13inch" type="distance">13-inch</measure> mortar.</head></figure> higher the elevation the greater the strain upon the gun. For this reason it is that they are made so short and thick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>They can be elevated so as to drop a shell just inside a fort, whereas a cannon-ball would either strike it on the outside, or pass over it far to the rear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>Mortars were used very little as compared with cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>In the siege of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, I think, they were used more at night than in the daytime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>This was due to the exceeding watchfulness of the pickets of both armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>At some periods in the siege each side was in nightly expectation of an attack from the other, and so the least provocation &mdash; an accidental shot, or a strange and unusual sound after dark &mdash; would draw the fire of the pickets, which would extend from the point of disturbance all along the line in both directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/><pb id="p.59" n="59"/> Then the main lines, both infantry and artillery, thinking it might possibly be a night attack, would join in the fire, while the familiar Rebel yell, responded to by the <rs>Union</rs> cheer, would swell louder as the din and roar increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>But soon the yelling, the cheering, the artillery, the musketry would subside, and the <orgName n="Mortar Battery" type="battery">mortar batteries</orgName> with which each fort was supplied would continue the contest, and the sky would become brilliant with the fiery arches of these lofty-soaring and more dignified projectiles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>As the mortar-shells described their majestic curves across the heavens every other sound was hushed, and the <num value="2">two</num> armies seemed to stand in mute and mutual admiration of these magnificent messengers of destruction and woe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>Sometimes a single shell could be seen climbing the sky from a Rebel mortar, but ere it had reached its destination as many as half a dozen from Union mortars would appear as if chasing each other through the air, anxious to be foremost <pb id="p.60" n="60"/> in resenting such temerity on the part of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>In this arm of the service, as in the artillery, the <rs>Union</rs> army was greatly superior to the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>These evening fusillades rarely did any damage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>So harmless were they considered that <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0006.0004.00060.00073" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:3"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and other officials frequently came down to the trenches to be a witness of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>But, harmless as they usually were to our side, they yet often enlisted our warm personal interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>The guns of my own company were several times a mark for their particular attentions by daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>At such times we would watch the shells closely as they mounted the sky. If they veered to the right or left from a vertical in their ascent, we cared nothing for them as we then knew they would go <num value="1">one</num> side of us. If they rose perpendicularly, and at the same time increased in size, our interest intensified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>If they soon began to descend we lost interest, for that told us they would fall short; but if they continued climbing until much nearer the zenith, and we could hear the creaking whistle of the fuse as the shell slowly revolved through the air, <hi rend="italics">business of a very pressing nature suddenly called us into the bomb-proofs</hi>; and it was not transacted until an explosion was heard, or a heavy jar told us that the bomb had expended its violence in the ground. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>These mortar-bombs could be seen very distinctly at times, but only when they were fired directly toward or from us. They can be seen immediately after they leave the gun if they come against the sky. Coming towards <num value="1">one</num> they appear <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> as a black speck, increasing in size as stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>Besides mortar-shells I have seen the shot and shell from <num value="12">twelve</num>-pounders in transit, but never from rifled pieces, as their flight is much more rapid. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>In the last chapter I described quite fully the principal varieties of shelter that our troops used in the war. In this I wish to detail their daily life in those tents when they settled down in camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>Enter with me into a Sibley tent which is not stockaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>If it is cold weather, we shall find the cone-shaped stove, which I have already mentioned, setting in the centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>These stoves were useless for cooking purposes, and the men were likely to burn their blankets on them in the night, so that many of the troops utilized them by building a small brick or stone oven below, in which they did their cooking, setting the stove on top as a part of the flue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>The length of pipe furnished by the government was not sufficient to reach the opening at the top, and the result was that unless the inmates bought more to piece it out, the upper part of such tents was as black and sooty as a chimney flue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>The dozen men occupying a Sibley tent slept with their feet towards the centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>The choice place to occupy was that portion opposite the door, as <num value="1">one</num> was not then in the way of passers in and out, although he was himself more or less of a nuisance to others when he came in. The tent was most crowded at meal times, for, owing to its shape, there can be no standing or sitting erect except about the centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/><pb id="p.62" n="62"/> But while there was more or less growling at accidents by some, there was much forbearance by others, and, aside from the vexations arising from the constitutional blundering of the <name>Jonahs</name> and the <name>Beats</name>, whom I shall describe later, these little knots were quite family-like and sociable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>The manner in which the time was spent in these tentsand, for that matter, in all tents &mdash; varied with the disposition <figure id="fig.062"> 
<head><persName n="Sibley,,,,," id="n0006.0005.00062.00074" reg="mostcommon:Sibley,Henry,,,:2"><surname>Sibley</surname></persName> tent.-inside view.</head></figure> of the inmates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>It was not always practicable for men of kindred tastes to band themselves under the same canvas, and so just as they differed in their avocations as citizens, they differed in their social life, and many kinds of pastimes went on simultaneously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>Of course, all wrote letters more or less, but there were a few men who seemed to spend the <hi rend="italics">most</hi> of their spare time in this occupation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>Especially was <pb id="p.63" n="63"/> this so in the earlier part of a man's war experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>The side or end strip of a hardtack box, held on the knees, constituted the writing-desk on which this operation was performed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>It is well remembered that in the early months of the war silver money disappeared, as it commanded a premium, so that, change being scarce, postage stamps were used instead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>This was before scrip was issued by the government to take the place of silver; and although the use of stamps as change was national government, yet everybody took them, and the soldiers in particular just about to leave <figure id="fig.063"> 
<head>Writing home.</head></figure> for the war carried large quantities away with them not all in the best of condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>This could hardly be expected when they had been through so many hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>They were passed about in little envelopes, containing <num value="25">twenty-five</num> and <measure n="50cents" type="currency">fifty cents</measure> in value. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>Many an old soldier can recall his disgust on finding what a mess his stamps were in either from rain, perspiration, or compression, as he attempted, after a hot march, to get <num value="1">one</num> for a letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>If he could split off <num value="1">one</num> from a welded mass of perhaps a <num value="100">hundred</num> or more, he counted himself fortunate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>Of course they could be soaked out after a while, but he would need to dry them on a griddle afterwards, they were so sticky.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>It was later than this that the postmaster-general issued an order allowing soldiers to send letters without prepayment; but, if I recollect right, it was necessary to write <pb id="p.64" n="64"/> on the outside <quote>Soldier's letter.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>I recall in this connection a verse that was said to have appeared on a letter of this kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>It ran as follows:-- <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/></p><l>Soldier's letter, nary red, </l><l>Hardtack and no soft bread, </l><l>Postmaster, please put it through, </l><l>I've nary cent, but <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> due.</l></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>There were a large number of fanciful envelopes got up during the war. I heard of a young man who had a collection of more than <num value="7000">seven thousand</num> such, all of different designs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>I have several in my possession which I found among the numerous letters written home during war-time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/><num value="1">One</num> is bordered by <num value="34">thirty-four</num> red stars-the number of States then in the <rs>Union</rs>--each star bearing the abbreviated name of a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>At the left end of the envelope hovers an eagle holding a shield and streamer, with this motto, <quote><hi rend="italics">Love <num value="1">one</num> another</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>Another <num value="1">one</num> bears a representation of the earth in space, with <quote><placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></quote> marked on it in large letters, and the <rs>American</rs> eagle above it. Enclosing all is the inscription, <quote><hi rend="italics">What <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has joined, let no man put asunder</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/><num value="0.33">A <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> has a medallion portrait of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0006.0005.00064.00075" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, under which is, <quote>A Southern man with Union Principles.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>A <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> displays a man sitting among <rs n="money bags" type="product">money-bags</rs>, on horseback, and driving at headlong speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>Underneath is the inscription, <quote><persName n="Floyd,,,,," id="n0006.0005.00064.00076" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,nomatch:0"><surname>Floyd</surname></persName> off for the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/><hi rend="italics">All that the <rs>Seceding States</rs> ask is to be let alone</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>Another has a negro standing grinning, a hoe in his hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>Then there are many bearing the portraits of early Union generals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>On others <placeName reg="Jeff Davis, Noxubee, Mississippi" key="tgn,2420078">Jeff Davis</placeName> is represented as hanged; while the national colors appear in a <num value="100">hundred</num> or more ways on a number-all of which, in a degree at least, expressed some phase of the sentiments popular at the <rs>North</rs>, The <orgName n="Christian Commission" type="commission">Christian Commission</orgName> also furnished envelopes <pb id="p.65" n="65"/> gratuitously to the armies, bearing their stamp and <quote>Soldier's letter</quote> in <num value="1">one</num> corner. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>Besides letter-writing the various games of cards were freely engaged in. Many men played for money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>Cribbage and euchre were favorite games.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>Reading was a pastime quite generally indulged in, and there was no novel so dull, trashy, or sensational as not to find some <num value="1">one</num> so bored with nothing to do that he would wade through it. I, certainly, never read so many such before or since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>The mind was hungry for something, and took husks when it could get nothing better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>A great deal of good might have been done by the <orgName n="Christian Commission" type="commission">Christian Commission</orgName> or some other organization planned to furnish the soldiers with good literature, for in that way many might have acquired a taste for the works of the best authors who would not have been likely to acquire it except under just such a condition as they were then in, viz.: a want of some entertaining pastime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>There would then have been much less gambling and sleeping away of daylight than there was. Religious tracts were scattered among the soldiers by <num value="1000">thousands</num>, it is true, and probably did some good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>I heard a Massachusetts soldier say, not long ago, that when his regiment arrived in New York <hi rend="italics">en route</hi> for the seat of war, the men were presented with <quote>a plate of thin soup and a Testament.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>This remark to me was very suggestive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>It reminded me of the vast amount of mistaken or misguided philanthropy that was expended upon the army by good <name>Christian</name> men and women, who, with the best of motives urging them forward no doubt, often labored under the delusion that the army was composed entirely of men thoroughly bad, and governed their actions accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>That there were bad men in the army is too well known to be denied if <num value="1">one</num> cared to deny it; and, while I may forgive, I cannot forget a war governor who granted pardon to several criminals that were serving out sentences in prison, if they would enlist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>But the morally bad soldiers were in the minority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>The good men should <pb id="p.66" n="66"/> have received some consideration, and the tolerably good even more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>Men are only children of an older growth; they like to be appreciated at their worth at least, and the nature of many of the tracts was such that they defeated the object aimed at in their distribution. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>Chequers was a popular game among the soldiers, backgammon less so, and it was only rarely that the statelier and <figure id="fig.066"> 
<head>Stockaded A tents.</head></figure> less familiar game of chess was to be observed on the board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>There were some soldiers who rarely joined in any games.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>In this class were to be found the illiterate members of a company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>Of course they did not read or write, and they rarely played cards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>They were usually satisfied to lie on their blankets, and talk with <num value="1">one</num> another, or watch the playing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>Yes, they did have <num value="1">one</num> pastime-the proverbial soldier's pastime of smoking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>A pipe was their omnipresent companion, and seemed to make up to them in <pb id="p.67" n="67"/> sociability for whatsoever they lacked of entertainment in other directions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>Then there were a few men in every organization, who engaged in no pastimes and joined in no social intercourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>These men were irreproachable as soldiers, it may have been, doing without grumbling everything that was expected of them in the line of military or fatigue duty, but they seemed shut up within an impenetrable shell, and would lie on their blankets silent while all others joined in the social round; or, perhaps, would get up and go out of the tent as if its lively social atmosphere was uncongenial, and walk up and down the parade or company street alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>Should you address them, they would answer pleasantly, but in monosyllables; and if the conversation was continued, it must be done in the same way. They could not be drawn out. They would cook by themselves, eat by themselves, camp by themselves on the march,--in fact, keep by themselves at all times as much as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>Guard duty was the <num value="1">one</num> occupation which seemed most suited to their natures, for it provided them with the exclusiveness and comparative solitude that their peculiar mental condition craved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>But these men were the exceptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>They were few in number, and the more noticeable on that account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>They only served to emphasize the fact that the average soldier was a sociable being. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/><num value="1">One</num> branch of business which was carried on quite extensively was the making of pipes and rings as mementos of a camp or battle-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>The pipes were made from the root of the mountain laurel when it could be had, and often ornamented with the badges of the various corps, either in relief or inlaid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>The rings were made sometimes of dried horn or hoof, very often of bone, and some were fashioned out of large gutta-percha buttons which were sent from home. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>The evenings in camp were less occupied in game-playing, I should say, than the hours off duty in the daytime; partly, <pb id="p.68" n="68"/> perhaps, because the tents were rather dimly lighted, and partly because of a surfeit of such recreations by daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>But, whatever the cause, I think old soldiers will generally agree in the statement that the evenings were the time of sociability and reminiscence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>It was then quite a visiting time among soldiers of the same organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>It was then that men from the same town or neighborhood got together <figure id="fig.068"> 
<head>Drafting.</head></figure> and exchanged home gossip.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>Each <num value="1">one</num> would produce recent letters giving interesting information about mutual friends or acquaintances, telling that such a girl or old schoolmate was married; that such a man had enlisted in such a regiment; that another was wounded and at home on furlough; that such another had been exempted from the forthcoming draft, because he had lost teeth; that yet another had suddenly gone to <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> on important business &mdash; which was a favorite refuge for all those who were afraid of being forced into the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/><pb id="p.69" n="69"/> </p> 
<p>And when the draft finally was ordered, such chucklings as these old schoolmates or fellow-townsmen would exchange as they again compared notes; <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, to think that they themselves had voluntarily responded to their country's appeal, and, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, to hope that some of the croakers they left at home might be drafted and sent to the front at the point of the bayonet, interchanging sentiments of the following character: <quote>There's A--, he was always urging others to go, and declaring he would himself make <num value="1">one</num> of the next quota.</quote> . . . <quote>Iwant to see him out here with a government suit on.</quote> . .. <quote>Yes, and there's B , who has lots of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>If he's drafted, he'll send a substitute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>The government ought not to allow any able-bodied man, even if he has got money, to send a substitute.</quote> . . . <quote>Then there's C-- , who declared he'd die on his doorstep rather than be forced into the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>I only hope that his courage will be put to the test.</quote> --Such are fair samples of the remarks these fellow-soldiers would exchange with <num value="1">one</num> another during an evening visitation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>Then, there were many men not so fortunate as to have enlisted with acquaintances, or to be near them in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>These were wont to lie on their blankets, and join in the general conversation, or exchange ante-war experiences, and find much of interest in common; but, whatever the number or variety of the evening diversions, there is not the slightest doubt that home, its inmates, and surroundings were more thought of and talked of then than in all the rest of the <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>In some tents vocal or instrumental music was a feature of the evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>There was probably not a regiment in the service that did not boast at least <num value="1">one</num> violinist, <num value="1">one</num> banjoist, and a bone player in its ranks &mdash; not to mention other instruments generally found associated with these &mdash; and <num value="1">one</num> or all of them could be heard in operation, either inside or in a company street, most any pleasant evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>The usual medley of comic songs and negro melodies comprised the greater part of the entertainment, and, if the space admitted, a jig or clog dance was stepped out on a hard-tack box or other crude platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>It was rather interesting to walk through a company street of an evening, and listen to a few words of the conversation in progress in the tents &mdash; all lighted up, unless some <num value="1">one</num> was saving or had consumed his allowance of candle.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>The camp of a regiment or battery was supposed to be laid out in regular order as definitely prescribed by Army Regulations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>These, I may state in a general way, provided that each company of a regiment should pitch its tents in <num value="2">two</num> files, facing on a street which was at right angles with the color-line of the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>This color-line was the assigned place for regimental formation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>Then, without going into details, I will add that the company officers' tents were pitched in rear of their respective companies, and the field officers, in rear of these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>Cavalry had something of the same plan, but with <num value="1">one</num> row of tents to a company, while the artillery had <num value="3">three</num> files of tents, <num value="1">one</num> to each section. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>All of this is preliminary to saying that while there was in Army Regulations this prescribed plan for laying out camps, yet the soldiers were more distinguished for their breach than their observance of this plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>Army Regulations were adopted for the guidance of the regular standing army; but this same regular army was now only a very small fraction of the <rs>Union</rs> forces, the largest portion by far--<quote>the biggest half,</quote> to use a Hibernianism &mdash; were volunteers, who could not or would not all be bound by Army <pb id="p.74" n="74"/> Regulations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>In the establishing of camps, therefore, there was much of the go-as-you-please order of procedure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>It is true that regiments commanded by strict disciplinarians were likely to and did keep pretty close to regulations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>Many others approximated this standard, but still there then remained a large residuum who suited themselves, or, rather, perhaps did not attempt to suit anybody unless compelled to by superior authority; so that in entering some camps <num value="1">one</num> might find everything betokening the supervision of a critical military spirit, while others were such a hurly-burly lack of plan that a mere plough-jogger might have been, and perhaps was, the controlling genius of the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>When troops located in the woods, as they always did for their winter cantonments, this lack of system in the arrangement was likely to be deviated from on account of trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>But to the promised topic of the chapter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>Come with me into <num value="1">one</num> of the log huts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>I have already spoken of its walls, its roof, its chimney, its fire-place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>The door we are to enter may be cut in the same end with the fire-place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>Such was often the case, as there was just about unoccupied space enough for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>But where <num value="4">four</num> or more soldiers located together it was oftener put in the centre of <num value="1">one</num> side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>In that case the fire-place was in the opposite side as a rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>In entering a door at the end <num value="1">one</num> would usually observe <num value="2">two</num> bunks across the opposite end, <num value="1">one</num> near the ground (or floor, when there was such a luxury, which was rarely), and the other well up towards the top of the walls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>I say, <hi rend="italics">usually</hi>. It depended upon circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>When <num value="2">two</num> men only occupied the hut there was <num value="1">one</num> bunk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>Sometimes when <num value="4">four</num> occupied it there was but <num value="1">one</num>, and that <num value="1">one</num> running lengthwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>There are other exceptions which I need not mention; but the average hut contained <num value="2">two</num> bunks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>The construction of these bunks was varied in character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>Some were built of boards from hardtack boxes; some of barrel-staves laid crosswise on <num value="2">two</num> poles; some men improvised <pb id="p.75" n="75"/> a spring-bed of slender saplings, and padded them with a cushion of hay, oak or pine leaves; others obtained coarse grain sacks from an artillery or cavalry camp, or from some wagon train, and by making a hammock-like arrangement of them thus devised to make repose a little sweeter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>At the head of each bunk were the knapsacks or bundles which contained what each soldier boasted of personal <figure id="fig.075"> 
<head>Inside view of a log hut.</head></figure> effects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>These were likely to be under-clothes, socks, thread, needles, buttons, letters, stationery, photographs, etc. The number of such articles was fewer among infantry than among artillerymen, who, on the march, had their effects carried for them on the gun-carriages and caissons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>But in winter-quarters both accumulated a large assortment of conveniences from home, sent on in the boxes which so gladdened the soldier's heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/><pb id="p.76" n="76"/> </p> 
<p>The haversacks, and canteens, and the equipments usually hung on pegs inserted in the logs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>The muskets had no regular abiding-place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>Some stood them in a corner, some hung them on pegs by the slings. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>Domestic conveniences were not entirely wanting in the best ordered of these rude establishments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>A hardtack box nailed end upwards against the logs with its cover on leather hinges serving as a door, and having suitable shelves inserted, made a very passable dish-closet; another such box put upside down on legs, did duty as a table &mdash; small, but large enough for the family, and useful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>Over the fire-place <num value="1">one</num> or more shelves were sometimes put to catch the <hi rend="italics">brie a brac</hi> of the hut; and <num value="3">three</num>-or <num value="4">four</num>-legged stools enough were manufactured for the inmates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>But such a hut as this <num value="1">one</num> I have been describing was rather <hi rend="italics">high-toned</hi>. There were many huts without any of these conveniences. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>A soldier's table-furnishings were his tin dipper, tin plate, knife, fork, and spoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>When he had finished his meal, lie did not in many cases stand on ceremony, and his dishes were tossed under the bunk to await the next meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>Or, if he condescended to do a little dish-cleaning, it was not of an aesthetic kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>Sometimes he was satisfied to scrape his plate out with his knife, and let it go at that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>Another time he would take a wisp of straw or a handful of leaves from his bunk, and wipe it out. When the soft bread was abundant, a piece of that made a convenient and serviceable dish-cloth and towel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>Now and then a man would pour a little of his hot coffee into his plate to cleanse it. While here and there <num value="1">one</num>, with neither pride, nor shame, nor squeamishness would take his plate out just as he last used it, to get his ration, offering no other remark to the comment of the cook than this, that he guessed the plate was a fit receptacle for the ration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>As to the knife and fork, when they got too black to be tolerated &mdash; and they had to be of a very sable hue, it should be said &mdash; there was no cleansing process so inexpensive, simple, available, and efficient <pb id="p.77" n="77"/> as running them vigorously into the earth a few times. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>For lighting these huts the government furnished candles in limited quantities: at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> long ones, which had to be cut for distribution; but later they provided short ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>I have said that they were furnished in limited quantities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>I will modify that statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>Sometimes they were abundant, sometimes the contrary; but no <num value="1">one</num> could account for a scarcity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>It was customary to charge quartermasters with peculation in such cases, and it is true that many of them were rascals; but I think they <figure id="fig.077"> 
<head>Army candlesticks.</head></figure> were sometimes saddled with burdens that did not belong to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>Some men used more light than others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>Indeed, some men were constitutionally out of everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>They seemed to have conscientious scruples against keeping rations of any description in stock for the limit of time for which they were drawn. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>As to candlesticks, the government provided the troops with these by the <num value="1000">thousands</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>They were of steel, and very durable, but were supplied only to the infantry, who had simply to unfix bayonets, stick the points of the same in the ground, and their candlesticks were ready for service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>As a fact, the bayonet shank was <hi rend="italics">the</hi> candlestick of the rank and <pb id="p.78" n="78"/> file who used that implement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>It was always available, and just <quote>filled the bill</quote> in other respects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>Potatoes were too valuable to come into very general use for this purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>Quite often the candle was set up on a box in its own drippings. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>Whenever candles failed, <hi rend="italics">slush lamps</hi> were brought into use. These I have seen made by filling a sardine box with cook-house grease, and inserting a piece of rag in <num value="1">one</num> corner for a wick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>The whole was then suspended from the ridgepole of the hut by a wire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>This wire came to camp around bales of hay brought to the horses and mules. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>The bunks were the most popular institutions in the huts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>Soldiering is at times a lazy life, and bunks were then liberally patronized; for, as is well known, ottomans, lounges, and easy-chairs are not a part of a soldier's outfit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>For that reason the bunks served as a substitute for all these luxuries in the line of furniture. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>I will describe in greater, detail how they were used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>All soldiers were provided with a woollen and a rubber blanket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>When they retired, after tattoo roll-call, they did not strip to the skin and put on night-dresses as they would at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>They were satisfied, ordinarily, with taking off coat and boots, and perhaps the vest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>Some, however, stripped to their flannels, and, donning a smoking-cap, would turn in, and pass a very comfortable night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>There were a few in each regiment who never took off anything, night or day, unless compelled to; and these turned in at night in full uniform, with all the covering they could muster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>I shall speak of this class in another connection. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>There was a special advantage in <num value="2">two</num> men bunking together in winter-quarters, for then each got the benefit of the other's blankets &mdash; no mean advantage, either, in much of the weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>It was a common plan with the soldiers to make an under-sheet of the rubber blanket, the lining side up, just as when they camped out on the ground, for it excluded the cold air from below in the <num value="1">one</num> case as it kept <pb id="p.79" n="79"/> out dampness in the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>Moreover, it prevented the escape of animal heat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>I think I have said that the half-shelters were not impervious to a hard rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>But I was about to say that whenever such a storm came on it was often necessary for the occupants of the upper bunk to cover that part of the tent above them with their rubber blankets or ponchos; or, if they did not wish to venture out to adjust such a protection, they would pitch them on the inside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>When they did not care to bestir themselves enough to do either, they would compromise by spreading a rubber blanket over themselves, and let the water run off on to the tent floor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>At intervals, whose length was governed somewhat by the movements of the army, an inspector of government property put in an appearance to examine into the condition of the belongings of the government in the possession of an organization, and when in his opinion any property was unfit for further service it was declared condemned, and marked with his official brand, I C, meaning, <hi rend="italics">Inspected Condemned</hi>. This I C became a byword among the men, who made an amusing application of it on many occasions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>In the daytime the men lay in their bunks and slept, or read a great deal, or sat on them and wrote their letters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>Unless otherwise forbidden, callers felt at liberty to perch on them; but there was such a wide difference in the habits of cleanliness of the soldiers that some proprietors of huts had, as they thought, sufficient reasons why no <num value="1">one</num> else should occupy their berths but themselves, and so, if the <num value="3">three</num>-legged stools or boxes did not furnish seating capacity enough for company, and the regular boarders, too, the r. b. would take to the bunks with a dispatch which betokened a deeper interest than that required of simple etiquette.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>This remark naturally leads me to say something of the insect life which seemed to have enlisted with the soldiers for <quote><measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> or during the war,</quote> and which required and received a large share of attention in quarters, <pb id="p.80" n="80"/> much more, in fact, than during active campaigning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>I refer now, especially, to the <hi rend="italics">Pediculus Vestimenti</hi>, as the scientific men call him, but whose picture when it is well taken, and somewhat magnified, bears this familiar outline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>Old soldiers will recognize the <hi rend="italics">picture</hi> if the <hi rend="italics">name</hi> is an odd <num value="1">one</num> to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>This was the historic <quote>grayback</quote> which went in and out before Union and Confederate soldiers without ceasing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>Like death, it was no respecter of persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>It preyed alike on the just and the unjust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>It inserted its bill as confidingly into the body of the <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">major-general</rs> as of the lowest private.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>I once heard the orderly of a company officer relate that he had picked <hi rend="italics"><num value="52">fifty-two</num> graybacks</hi> from the shirt of his chief at <num value="1">one</num> sitting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>Aristocrat or plebeian it mattered not. Every soldier seemed foreordained to encounter this pest at close quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>Eternal vigilance was <hi rend="italics">not</hi> the price of liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>That failed the most scrupulously careful veteran in active campaigning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>True, the neatest escaped the longest, but sooner or later the time came when it was simply impossible for <figure id="fig.080"> 
<head>Pediculus Vestimenti.</head></figure> even them <hi rend="italics">not to let the left hand know what the right hand was doing</hi>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>The secretiveness which a man suddenly developed when he found himself <hi rend="italics">inhabited</hi> for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time was very entertaining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>He would cuddle all knowledge of it as closely as the old <num value="40">Forty</num>-Niners did the hiding-place of their bag of gold-dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>Perhaps he would find only <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi> of the vermin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>This he would secretly murder, keeping all knowledge of it from his tent-mates, while he nourished the hope that it was the <rs>Robinson Crusoe</rs> of its race cast away on a strange shore with none of its kind at hand to cheer its loneliness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>Alas, vain delusion!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>In <measure n="99cases" type="mass">ninety-nine cases</measure> out of a <num value="100">hundred</num> this solitary <hi rend="italics">pediculus</hi> would prove to be the advance guard of generations yet to come, which, ere its capture, had been stealthily engaged in sowing its seed; and in a space of time all too brief, after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <pb id="p.81" n="81"/> discovery the same soldier would appoint himself an investigating committee of <num value="1">one</num> to sit with closed doors, and hie away to the desired seclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>There he would seat himself taking his garments across his knees in turn, conscientiously doing his (k)nitting work, inspecting every fibre with the scrutiny of a dealer in broadcloths. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>The feeling of intense disgust aroused by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> contact with these creepers soon gave way to hardened indifference, as a soldier realized the utter impossibility of keeping free from them, and the privacy with which he carried on his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <quote>skirmishing,</quote> as this <quote>search for happiness</quote> came to be called, was soon abandoned, and the warfare carried on more openly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>In fact, it was the mark of a cleanly soldier to be seen engaged at it, for there was no disguising the fact that everybody needed to do it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>In cool weather <quote>skirmishing</quote> was carried on in quarters, but in warmer weather the men preferred to go outside of camp for this purpose; and the woods usually found near camps were full of them sprinkled about times by the <num value="1000">thousands</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>Now and then a man could be seen just from the quartermaster with an entire new suit on his arm, bent on starting afresh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>He would hang the suit on a bush, strip off every piece of the old, and set fire to the <pb id="p.82" n="82"/> same, and then don the new suit of blue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>So far well; but he was a lucky man if he did not share his new clothes with other hungry <hi rend="italics">pediculi</hi> inside of a week. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/><quote>Skirmishing,</quote> however, furnished only slight relief from the oppressive attentions of the grayback, and furthermore took much time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>Hot water was the sovereign remedy, for it penetrated every mesh and seam, and cooked the <num value="1000000">millions</num> yet unborn, which <persName><foreName>Job</foreName></persName> himself could not have exterminated by the thumbnail process unaided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>So tenacious of life were these creatures that some veterans affirm they have seen them still creeping on garments taken out of <hi rend="italics">boiling water</hi>, and that only by putting salt in the water were they sure of accomplishing their destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>I think there was but <num value="1">one</num> opinion among the soldiers in regard to the graybacks; <hi rend="italics">viz</hi>., that the country was being ruined by <hi rend="italics">overproduc-tion</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>From all this it can readily be seen why no good soldier wanted his bunk to be regarded as common property. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>I may add in passing that no other variety of insect life caused any material annoyance to the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>Now and then a wood-tick would insert his head, on the sly, into some part of the human integument; but these were not common or unclean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/><pb id="p.83" n="83"/> </p> 
<p>I have already related much that the soldier did to pass away time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>I will add to that which I have already given <num value="2">two</num> branches of domestic industry that occupied a considerable time in log huts with a few, and lessvery much less indeed -with others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>I refer to washing and mending.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>Some of the men were just as particular about changing their underclothing at least once a week as they would be at home; while others would do so only under the severest pressure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>It is disgusting to remember, even at this late day, how little care hundreds of the men be-<figure id="fig.083"> 
<head>Boiling them.</head></figure> stowed on bodily cleanliness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>The story, quite familiar to old soldiers, about the man who was so negligent in this respect that when he finally took a bath he found a number of shirts and socks which he supposed he had lost, arose from the fact of there being a few men in every organization who were most unaccountably regardless of all rules of health, and of whom such a statement would seem, to those that knew the parties, only slightly <figure id="fig.083.1"> 
<head>A wood-tick.</head></figure> exaggerated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>How was this washing done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>Well, if the troops were camping near a brook, that simplified the matter somewhat; but even then the clothes <hi rend="italics">must be boiled</hi>, and for this purpose there was but <num value="1">one</num> resource--<hi rend="italics">the mess kettles</hi>. There is a familiar anecdote related of <persName n="Daniel,,,,," id="n0006.0006.00083.00099" reg="mostcommon:Daniel,nomatch:0"><surname>Daniel</surname></persName> <pb id="p.84" n="84"/> <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0006.0006.00084.00100" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>: that while he was <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>, the <rs>French Minister</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> asked him whether the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would recognize the new government of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> &mdash; I think <persName n="Napoleon,,Louis,,," id="n0006.0006.00084.00101" reg="default:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>'s.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>Enough!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>cried the minister, fully satisfied with the extended array of precedents cited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>So in regard to using our mess kettles to boil clothes in, it might be asked <quote>Why not?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>Were they not used to boil our meat and <figure id="fig.084"> 
<head>Cleaning up.</head></figure> potatoes in, to make our bean, pea, and meat soups in, to boil our tea and coffee in, to make our apple and peach sauce in?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>Why not use them as wash-boilers?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>Well, <quote>gentle reader,</quote> while it might at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> interfere somewhat with your appetite to have your food cooked in the wash-boiler, you would soon get used to it; and so this complex use of the mess kettles soon ceased to affect the appetite, or to shock the sense of propriety of the average soldier as to the eternal fitness of things, for he was often compelled by circumstances to endure much greater improprieties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>It <pb id="p.85" n="85"/> would indeed have been a most admirable arrangement in many respects could each man have been provided with an excellent Magee Range with copper-boiler annex, and set tubs near by; but the line had to be drawn somewhere, and so everything in the line of <hi rend="italics">impedimenta</hi> was done away with, unless it was absolutely essential to the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>For this reason we could not take along a well equipped laundry, but must make some articles do double or triple service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>It may be asked what kind of a figure the men cut as washerwomen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>Well, some of them were awkward and imperfect enough at it; but necessity is a capital teacher, and, in this as in many other directions, men did perforce what they would not have attempted at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>It was not necessary, however, for every man to do his own washing, for in most companies there was at least <num value="1">one</num> man who, for a reasonable recompense, was ready to do such work, and he usually found all he could attend to in the time he had off duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>There was no ironing to be done, for <quote>boiled shirts,</quote> as white-bosomed shirts were called, were almost an unknown garment in the army except in hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>Flannels were the order of the day. If a man had the courage to face the ridicule of his comrades by wearing a white collar, it was of the paper variety, and white cuffs were unknown in camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>In the department of mending garments each man did his own work, or left it undone, just as he thought best; but no <num value="1">one</num> hired it done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>Every man had a <quote>housewife</quote> or its equivalent, containing the necessary needles, yarn, thimble, etc., furnished him by some mother, sister, sweetheart, or <orgName n="Soldiers Aid Society" type="society">Soldier's Aid Society</orgName>, and from this came his materials to mend or darn with. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>Now, the average soldier was not so susceptible to the charms and allurements of sock-darning as he should have been; for this reason he always put off the direful day until both heels looked boldly and with hardened visage out the back-door, while his <num value="10">ten</num> toes ranged themselves <hi rend="italics">en echelon</hi> in <pb id="p.86" n="86"/> front of their quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>By such delay or neglect good ventilation and the opportunity of drawing on the socks from either end were secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>The task of once more restricting the toes to quarters was not an easy <num value="1">one</num>, and the processes of arriving at this end were not many in number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>Perhaps the speediest and most unique, if not the most artistic, was that of tying a string around the hole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>This was a scheme for cutting the <name>Gordian</name> knot of darning, which a few modern Alexanders put into execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>But I never heard any of them commend its comforts after the job was done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>Then, there were other men who, having arranged a checker-board of stitches over the holes, as they had seen their mothers do, had not the time or patience to fill in the squares, and the inevitable consequence was that both heels and toes would look through the bars only a few hours before breaking jail again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>But there were a few of the boys who were kept furnished with home-made socks, knit, perhaps, by their good old grandmas, who seemed to inherit the patience of the grandams <figure id="fig.086"> 
<head>A Housewife,</head></figure> themselves; for, whenever there was mending or darning to be done, they would sit by the hour, and do the work as neatly and conscientiously as any <num value="1">one</num> could desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>I am not wide of the facts when I say that the heels of the socks darned by these men remained firm when the rest of the fabric was well spent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>There was little attempt made to repair the socks drawn from the government supplies, for they were generally of <pb id="p.87" n="87"/> the shoddiest description, and not worth it. In symmetry, they were like an elbow of stove-pipe; nor did the likeness end here, for, while the stove-pipe is open at both ends, so were the socks within <measure n="48hours" type="date">forty-eight hours</measure> after putting them on. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>Cooking was also an industry which occupied more or less of the time of individuals; but when the army was in settled camp company cooks usually took charge of the rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>Sometimes, where companies preferred it, the rations were served out to them in the raw state; but there was no invariable rule in this matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>I think the soldiers, as a whole, preferred to receive their coffee and sugar raw, for rough experience in campaigning soon made each man an expert in the preparation of this beverage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>Moreover, he could make a more palatable cup for himself than the cooks made for him; for too often their handiwork betrayed some of the other uses of the mess kettles to which I have made reference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>Then, again, some men liked their coffee strong, others weak; some liked it sweet, others wished little or no sweetening; and this latter class could and did save their sugar for other purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>I shall give other particulars about this when I take up the subject of Army Rations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>It occurs to me to mention in this connection a circumstance which may seem somewhat strange to many, and that is that some parts of the army burned hundreds of cords of green pine-wood while lying in winter-quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>It was very often their only resource for heat and warmth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>People at the <rs>North</rs> would as soon think of attempting to burn water as green pine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>But the explanation of the paradox is this &mdash; the pine of southern latitudes has more pitch in it than that of northern latitudes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>Then, the heart-wood of all pines is comparatively dry. It seemed especially so South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>The heart-wood was used to kindle with, and the pitchy sap-wood placed on top, and by the time the heartwood had burned the sappy portion had also seasoned enough to blaze and make a good fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>These pines had <pb id="p.88" n="88"/> the advantage over the hard woods of being more easily worked up &mdash; an advantage which the average soldier appreciated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>Nearly every organization had its barber in established camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>True, many men never used the razor in the service, but allowed a shrubby, <figure id="fig.088"> 
<head>The camp barber.</head></figure> straggling growth of hair and beard to grow, as if to conceal them from the enemy in time of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>Many more carried their own kit of tools and shaved themselves, frequently shedding innocent blood in the service of their country while undergoing the operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>But there was yet a large number left who, whether from lack of skill in the use or care of the razor, or from want <pb id="p.89" n="89"/> of inclination, preferred to patronize the camp barber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>This personage plied his vocation inside the tent in cold or stormy weather, but at other times took his post in rear of the tent, where lie had improvised a chair for the comfort (?) of his victims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>This chair was a product of home manufacture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>Its framework was <num value="4">four</num> stakes driven into the ground, <num value="2">two</num> long ones for the back legs, and <num value="2">two</num> shorter ones for the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>On this foundation a superstructure was raised which made a passable barber's chair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>But not all the professors who presided at these chairs were finished tonsors, and the back of a soldier's head whose hair had been <quote>shingled</quote> by <num value="1">one</num> of them was likely to show each course of the shingles with painful distinctness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>The razors, too, were of the most barbarous sort, like the <quote>trust razor</quote> of the old song with which the <name>Irishman</name> got his <quote>Love oa <name n="God" type="God">God</name> Shave.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/></p> 
<p><num value="1">One</num> other occupation of a few men in every camp, which I must not overlook, was that of studying the tactics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>Some were doing it, perhaps, under the instructions of superior officers; some because of an ambition to deserve promotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>Some were looking to passing a competitive examination with a view of obtaining a furlough; and so these men, from various motives, were <quote>booking</quote> themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>But the great mass of the rank and file had too much to do with the practice of war to take much interest in working out its theory, and freely gave themselves up, when off duty, to every available variety of physical or mental recreation, doing their uttermost to pass away the time rapidly; and even those troops having nearly <hi rend="italics"><measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure></hi> to serve would exclaim, with a cheerfulness more feigned than real, as each day dragged to its close, <quote><hi rend="italics">It's only <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> and a but</hi>.</quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>In a former chapter I made the statement that <persName n="Sibley,,,,," id="n0006.0007.00090.00104" reg="mostcommon:Sibley,Henry,,,:2"><surname>Sibley</surname></persName> tents furnished quarters capacious enough for <num value="12">twelve</num> men. That statement is to be taken with some qualifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>If those men were all lying down asleep, there did not seem much of a crowd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>But if <num value="1">one</num> man of the <num value="12">twelve</num> happened to be on guard at night, and, furthermore, was on what we used to know as the <num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num> Relief guard, which in my company was posted at <num value="12">12</num>, midnight, and came off post at <time value="2am">2 A. M.</time>, when all were soundly sleeping, and, moreover, if this man chanced to quarter in that part of the tent opposite the entrance, and if, in seeking his blanket and board in the darkness, it was his luck to step on the stockinged foot of a recumbent form having a large voice, a large temper, but a small though forcible selection of <name>English</name> defiled, straightway that selection was hurled at the head of the offending even though well-meaning guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>And if, <pb id="p.91" n="91"/> under the excitement of his mishap, the luckless guard makes a spring thinking to clear all other intervening slumberers and score a home run, but alights instead amidships of the comrade who sleeps next him, expelling from him a groan that by all known comparisons should have been his last, the poor guard has only involved himself the more inextricably in trouble; for as soon as his latest victim recovers consciousness sufficiently to know that it was <hi rend="italics">not</hi> a twelvepound cannon ball that has doubled him up, and that stretcher bearers are <hi rend="italics">not</hi> needed to take him to the rear, he strikes up in the same strain and pitch and force as that of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> victim, and together they make the midnight air vocal with choice invective against their representative of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num> Relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>By this time the rest of the tent's crew have been waked up, cross enough, too, at being thus rudely disturbed, and they all come in heavily on the chorus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>As the wordy assault continues the inmates of adjoining tents who have also been aroused take a hand in it, and <quote>Shut up!</quote> --<quote><rs type="role" reg="Sergeant">Sergeant</rs> of the guard!</quote> --<quote>Go lie down!</quote> --<quote>Shoot him on the spot!</quote> --<quote>Put him in the guard-house!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>are a few of the many impromptu orders issued within and without the tent in question. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>At last the tempest in a teapot expends itself and by the time that the sergeant of the guard has arrived to seek out the cause of the tumult and enforce the instructions of the officer of the day by putting the offenders against the rules and discipline of camp under arrest, for talking and disturbance after Taps, all are quiet, for no <num value="1">one</num> would make a complaint against the culprits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>Their temporary excitement has cooled, and the discreet sergeant is even in doubt as to which tent contains the offenders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>Now, accidents will happen to the most careful and the best of men, but the soldier whom I have been describing could be found in every squad in camp &mdash; that is, a man of his kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>Such men were called <quote>Jonahs</quote> on account of their ill luck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>Perhaps this particular <persName><foreName>Jonah</foreName></persName> after getting <pb id="p.92" n="92"/> his tin plate level full of hot pea-soup was sure, on entering the tent, to spill a part of it down somebody's back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>The higher he could hold it the better it seemed to please him as he made his way to his accustomed place in the tent, and in bringing it down into a latitude where he proposed to eat it <figure id="fig.092"> 
<head>The <rs>Jonah</rs> spilling pea-soup.</head></figure> he usually managed to dispose of much of the remainder, either on his own or somebody else's blankets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>When peasoup failed him for a diversion, he was a dead shot on kicking over his neighbor's pot of coffee, which the owner had put down for a moment while he adjusted his lap-table to receive his supper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>The profuseness of the <rs>Jonah</rs>'s apologies-and they always were profuse, and undoubtedly sincere &mdash; was utterly inadequate as a balm for the wounds he made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>Anybody else in the tent might have kicked the coffee to the remotest bounds of camp with malice aforethought, and it would not have produced a tithe of the aggravation which it did to have this constitutional blunderer do it by accident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>It may be that he wished to borrow <pb id="p.93" n="93"/> your ink. Of course you could not refuse him. It may have been made by you with some ink powders sent from home &mdash; perhaps the last you had and which you should want yourself that very day. It mattered not. He took it with complacency and fair promises, put it on a box by his side and tipped the box over <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> afterward by the watch. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>Cooking was the forte of this <name>Jonah</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>He could be found most any time of day-or night, if he was a guardsmanaround the camp-fire with his little mess of something in his tomato can or tin dipper, which he would throw an air of <figure id="fig.093"> 
<head>The camp-fire before the <name>Jonah</name> appears.</head></figure> mystery around every now and then by drawing a small package from the depths of his pocket or haversack and scattering some of its contents into the brew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>But there was a time in the history of his culinary pursuits when he rose to a supreme height as a blunderer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>It was when he appeared at the camp-fire which, by the way, he never kindled himself, ready to occupy the choice places with his dishes; and after the <num value="2">two</num> rails, between which fires were usually built, had been well burdened by the <rs n="coffee pots" type="product">coffee-pots</rs> of his comrades it presented an opportunity which his evil genius was likely to take advantage of; for then he was suddenly seized with a thought of something else that he had forgotten to borrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>Turning in his haste to go to the <pb id="p.94" n="94"/> tent for this purpose he was sure to stumble over the end of <num value="1">one</num> or both of the rails, when the downfall of the coffeepots and the quenching of the fire followed as a matter of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>At just this point in his career it would be to the credit of his associates to drop the curtain on the picture; but the sequel must be told.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>The average soldier was not an especially devout man, and while in times of imminent danger he had serious thoughts, yet at other times his many trials, his privations, and the rigors of a necessary discipline <figure id="fig.094"> 
<head>The camp-fire after the <name>Jonah</name> appears.</head></figure> all conduced to make him a highly explosive creature on demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>Moreover, coffee and sugar were staple articles with the soldier, and the least waste of them was not to be tolerated under ordinary circumstances; but to have a whole line of <rs n="coffee pots" type="product">coffee-pots</rs> with their precious contents upset by the <name>Jonah</name> of the tent in his recklessness was the last ounce of pressure removed from the safety valve of his tent-mates' wrath; and such a discharge of hard names and oaths, <quote>long, loud, and deep,</quote> as many of these sufferers would deliver themselves of, if it could have been utilized against the enemy, might have demolished a regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>And the others who did not give vent to their passions by blows <pb id="p.95" n="95"/> or the use of strong language seemed to sympathize very keenly with those who did. <num value="2">Two</num> chaplains apiece to some of the men would have been none too many to hold them in check. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>I remember <num value="1">one</num> man who seemed always to have hard luck in spite of himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>He was a good soldier and meant well, but would blunder badly now and then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>His last act in the service was to plunge an axe through his boot while he was cutting wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>Unfortunately for him as it happened his foot was in it at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>On pulling it out <figure id="fig.095"> 
<head>The unlucky man.</head></figure> of the boot and looking it over he found that several of his toes had <quote>got left</quote> ; so he took up his boot, turned it upside down, and shook out a shower of toes as complacently as if that was what he enlisted for. This casualty closed his career in active service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>There were divers other directions in which the <name>Jonah</name> distinguished himself; but I must leave him for the present to direct attention to the other class of men of whom I wish to say something.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>These were the <hi rend="italics">beats</hi> of the servicea name given them by their comrades-in-arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>There were all grades of beats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>The original idea of beat was that of a lazy man or a shirk, who would by hook or by crook get rid of all military or fatigue duty that he could; but the term grew to have a broader significance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/><num value="1">One</num> of the milder forms of beat was the man who sat over the fire in the tent piling on wood all the time, and roasting out the rest of the tent's crew, who seemed to have no rights that this fireman felt bound to respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>He <pb id="p.96" n="96"/> was always cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>He wore overcoat, dress-coat, blouse, and flannels the full government allowance all at once, but never complained of being too warm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>He never took off any of these garments night or day unless compelled to on inspection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>He was most at home on fatigue duty, for he seemed fatigued from the start and moved like <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>A sprinkling of this class seemed necessary to the success of the <rs>Union</rs> arms, for they were certainly to be found in every organization. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>Another and more positive type of beat were the men who never had any water in their canteens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>Even when the army was in settled camp, water was not always to be had without going some distance for it; but these men were never known to go after any. They always managed to hang their canteen on some <num value="1">one</num> else who was bound for the spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>If, when the army was on the move, a rush was made during a temporary halt, for a spring or stream some distance away, these men never rushed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>They were satisfied to lie down and drink a supply which <figure id="fig.096"> 
<head>Going after water.</head></figure> they took their chances of begging, from some recruit, perhaps, who did not know their propensities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>If it happened to any man to be so straitened in his cooking operations as to be under the necessity of borrowing from <num value="1">one</num> of these, he was sure of being called upon to requite the favor fully as many times as his temper would endure it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>Then, as to rations, their hardtack never held out, and they were ever on the alert to borrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>It mattered not how great the scarcity, real or anticipated, they could not provide for a contingency, and their neighbors in the same squad were mean and avaricious &mdash; so the beats said &mdash; if they would not give of their husbanded resources to these profligate, improvident comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>But this class did not <pb id="p.97" n="97"/> stop at borrowing hardtack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>They were not all of them particular, and when hardtack could not be spared they would get along with coffee or sugar or salt pork; or, if they could borrow a <hi rend="italics">dollar</hi>, <quote>just for a day or <num value="2">two</num>,</quote> they would then repay it surely, because several letters from their friends at home, each <num value="1">one</num> containing money, were already overdue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>People in civil life think they know all about the imperfections of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> postal service, and tell of their letters and papers lost, miscarried, or in some way delayed, with much pedantry; but they have yet to learn the A B C of its imperfections, and no <num value="1">one</num> that I know of is so competent to teach them as certain of the <rs>Union</rs> soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>I could have produced men in <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">5</year></dateStruct>, yes &mdash; I can now &mdash; who lost more letters in <num value="1">one</num> year, <num value="3">three</num> out of every <num value="4">four</num> of which contained considerable sums of money, than any postmaster-general yet appointed is willing to admit have been lost since the establishment of a mail service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>This, remember, the loss of <num value="1">one</num> man; and when it is multiplied by the number of men just like him that were to be found, not in <num value="1">one</num> army alone but in all the armies of the <rs>Union</rs>, a special reason is obvious why the government should be liberal in its dealings with the old soldier. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>In this connection I am reminded of another interesting feature of army experience, which is of some historical value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>It was this: whenever the troops were paid off a very large majority of them wished to send the most of their pay home to their families or their friends for safe keeping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>Of course there was some risk attending the sending of it in the mails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>To obviate this risk an <quote>allotment</quote> plan was adopted by means of which when the troops were visited by the paymaster, on signing a roll prepared for that purpose, so much of their pay as they wished was allotted or assigned by the soldiers to whomsoever they designated at the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>To illustrate: <persName n="Smith,,John,,," id="n0006.0007.00097.00105" reg="default:Smith,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> had <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> pay due him at the rate of <measure n="13dollars" type="currency">$13</measure> a month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>He decided to allot <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">$10</measure> per month of <pb id="p.98" n="98"/> this to his wife at <placeName reg="Plymouth, Plymouth, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014421">Plymouth, Mass.</placeName>; so the paymaster pays him <measure n="12dollars" type="currency">$12</measure>, and the remaining <measure n="40dollars" type="currency">$40</measure> is paid to his wife by check in <placeName reg="Plymouth, Washington, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076159">Plymouth</placeName>, without any further action on the part of <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>This plan was a great convenience to both the soldiers and their families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>In this division of his income the calculation of the soldier was to save out enough for himself to pay all incidental expenses of camp life, such as washing, tobacco, newspapers, pies and biscuits, bought of <quote>Aunty,</quote> and cheese and cakes of the sutler.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>But in spite of his nice calculations the rule was that the larger part of the money allotted home was returned, by request of the sender, in small amounts of a dollar or the fraction of a dollar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>I have previously stated that at that time silver had gone out of use, it being only to be had by paying the premium on it, just as on gold, and so to take its place the government issued what was generally known as scrip, being paper currency of the denominations of <num value="50">fifty</num>, <num value="25">twenty-five</num>, <num value="10">ten</num>, <num value="5">five</num>, and, later, <num value="15">fifteen</num> and <num value="3">three</num>-cent pieces, some of which are still in circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>They were a great convenience to the soldiers and their friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>But to resume: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>If the statements made by these beats as to the amount of money they had sent for and were expecting were to be believed they must not only have sent for their full allotment, but have drawn liberally on their home credit or the charity of their friends besides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>In truth, however, the genuine beat never intended to return borrowed money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>It is currently believed by outsiders that the soldiers who stood shoulder to shoulder battling for the <rs>Union</rs>, sharing the same exposures, the same shelter, the same mess would ever afterwards be likely to stand steadfastly by <num value="1">one</num> another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>The organization of the <orgName n="Grand Army of the Republic" type="association">Grand Army of the Republic</orgName> seems to strengthen such an opinion, yet human nature remains pretty much the same in all situations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>If a man was a shirk or a thief or a beat or a coward or a worthless scoundrel generally in the army, it was because he had been educated to it before he enlisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>The leopard cannot <pb id="p.99" n="99"/> change his spots nor the <name>Ethiopian</name> his skin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>It will therefore create no great surprise when I remark that a large amount of money borrowed by <num value="1">one</num> soldier of another has never been repaid; and such is the lack of honesty and manliness on the part of these men that they can meet the old comrades of whom in those trying war days they borrowed <num value="1">one</num>, <num value="2">two</num>, <num value="5">five</num>, or <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollars</measure>, and in some cases more, without so much as a blush or betraying in any manner the slightest recognition of their long standing obligation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>Some are so worthless and brazen-faced even as to ask the same victims for more at this late day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/><num value="1">One</num> favorite dodge of the beat was to have the corporal arouse him twice or <num value="3">three</num> times before he would finally get out of his bunk; and then he would prepare to go out at a snail's pace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>Once on his beat, his next dodge was to manoeuvre so as to have the corporal of his relief do the most of his duty for him; for hardly would he have been posted before the corporal must be summoned, the beat having been seized with a desire to go to the company sink.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>That is good for half an hour out of the corporal at least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>At last the dodger reappears moving at a slow pace, and wearing the appearance of a man suffering for his discharge from service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>He retails his woes to the corporal, as he resumes his equipments, in a most doleful strain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>But the corporal is in no mood to listen after his long wait, and hastily directs his steps towards the guard-tent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>He is not allowed to remain there long, however, ere a summons reaches him from the same post, to which lie responds with excusable ill-humor and mutterings at the duplicity of the guardsman in question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>This time the patient has happened to think of some medicine at his tent which will be of benefit to him. Of course the corporal is anxious enough to have him healed, and so he again assumes the duties of the post for the shirk, who does not reappear until his last hour of duty is well on its <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> quarter, feigning in excuse that he could not find his own panacea <pb id="p.100" n="100"/> and so was obliged to go elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>Thus in <num value="1">one</num> way and another, by using the kind offices of his messmates together with those of the corporal, he would manage to get out of at least <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of his guard duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>After the <rs n="Battle of Fredericksburg" type="battle">battle of Fredericksburg</rs> a soldier belonging to a gallant regiment in <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n0006.0007.00100.00106" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,Ambrose,E.,,:1"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName>, whose courage had evidently been put to a sore test in the above engagement, resorted to the <hi rend="italics">rheumatic dodge</hi> to secure his discharge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>He responded daily to sick call, pitifully warped out of shape, was prescribed for, but all to no avail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/><num value="1">One</num> leg was drawn up so that, apparently, he could not use it, and groans indicative of excruciating agony escaped him at studied intervals and on suitable occasions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>So his case went on for <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure>, till at <figure id="fig.100"> 
<head>The Rheumatic Dodgfr.</head></figure> last the surgeon recommended his discharge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>It was approved at regimental, brigade, and division headquarters, and had reached corps headquarters when the corps was ordered to <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>At <placeName reg="Covington, Kenton, Kentucky" key="tgn,7014762">Covington</placeName> the party having the supposed invalid in charge gained access in some manner to a barrel of whiskey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>Not being a temperance man, the dodger was thrown off his guard by this <hi rend="italics">spiritual</hi> bonanza, and, taking his turn at the straw, for which entry had been made into the barrel, he was soon as sprightly on both legs as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>In this condition his colonel found him. Of course his discharge was recalled from corps headquarters, and the way of this transgressor was made hard for months afterwards. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>There was another field in which the beat played an interesting part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>I use <hi rend="italics">played</hi> with a double significance, for he never <hi rend="italics">worked</hi> if he could avoid it. It was when a detail of men was made to do some line of <hi rend="italics">fatigue duty</hi>, by which is <pb id="p.101" n="101"/> meant all the labors of the service distinct from strict military duty, such as the <quote>policing</quote> or clearing up of camp, procuring wood and water for the company, digging and fitting up of sinks (the water-closets of the army), and, in addition to these duties, in cavalry and artillery, procuring grain and forage for the horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>It was a sad fate to befall <figure id="fig.101"> 
<head>Water for the cook-house.</head></figure> a good duty soldier to get on to a detail to procure wood where every <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> or <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> man was a shirk or beat; for while they must needs bear the appearance of doing something, they were really in the way of those who could work and were willing to. Many of these shirkers would waste a great deal of time and breath maligning the government or their officers for requiring them to do such work, indignantly declaring that <quote>they enlisted to fight and not to chop wood or dig sinks.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>But it was noticeable that when the fight came on, if any of these heroes got into it, they then appeared just as willing to bind themselves by contract to cut all the wood in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, if they could only be let go just that once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>These were the men who were <quote>invincible in peace and invisible in war,</quote> as the late <persName n="Hill,Senator,,,," id="n0006.0007.00101.00107" reg="mostcommon:Hill,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, once said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>I may add here that, coming as the <pb id="p.102" n="102"/> soldiers did from all avocations and stations in life, these details for fatigue often brought together men few of whom had any practical knowledge of the work in hand; so that aside from the shirks, who <hi rend="italics">could</hi> work but <hi rend="italics">would</hi> not, there were others who <hi rend="italics">would</hi> but <hi rend="italics">could</hi> not, at least intelligently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>Still, the army was a great educator in many ways to men who cared to learn, and some of the most ignorant became by force of circumstances quite expert, in time, in channels hitherto untraversed by them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>But there was <num value="1">one</num> detail upon which our shirks, beats, and men unskilled in manual labor, such as the handling of the spade and pickaxe, appeared in all the glory of their artful dodging and ignorance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>If a man did not take hold of the work lively, whether because he preferred to shirk it or because he did not understand it, the worse for him. The detail in question was <num value="1">one</num> made to administer the last rites to a batch of deceased horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>It happened to the artillery and cavalry to lose a large number of these animals in winter, which, owing to the freezing of the ground, could not be buried until the disappearance of the frost in spring; but by that time, through the action of rain and sun and the frequent depredations of dogs, buzzards, and crows, the remains were not always in the most inviting condition for the administrations of the sexton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>Then, again, during the summer season, when the army made a halt for rest and recruiting, another sacrifice of glanders-infected and generally used &mdash; up horses was made to the <name n="God" type="God">god</name> of war. But as they were not always promptly committed to mother earth, either from a desire to show a decent respect for the memory of the deceased or for some other reason best known to the red-tape of military rule, the odors that were wafted from them on the breezes were wont to become far more <quote>spicy</quote> than agreeable, so that a speedy interment was generally ordered by the <orgName n="Military Board" type="board">military Board</orgName> of Health. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>As soon as the nature of the business for which such a detail was ordered became generally known, the fun began, <pb id="p.103" n="103"/> for a lively protest was wont to go up from the men against being selected to participate in the impending equine obsequies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>Perhaps the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> objection heard from a victim who has drawn a prize in the business is that <quote>he was on guard the day before, and is not yet physically competent for such a detail.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>The sergeant is charged with unfairness, and with having pets that he gives all the <quote>soft jobs</quote> to, etc. But the warrior of the triple <hi rend="italics">chevron</hi> is inexorable, and his muttering, much injured subordinate finally reports to the corporal in charge of the detail in front of the camp, betraying in his every word and movement a heart-felt desire for his term of service or this cruel war to be over. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>Another <num value="1">one</num> whom his sergeant has booked for the enterprise has got wind of what is to be done, so that when found he is tucked up in his bunk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>He stoutly insists that he isan invalid, and is only waiting for the next sounding of <quote>Sick call</quote> to respond to it. But his attack is so sudden, and his language and lungs so strong for a sick man, that he finds it difficult to establish his claim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>He calls on his tentmates to swear that he is telling the truth, but finds them strangely devout and totally ignorant of his ailments, for they are chuckling internally at their own good fortune in not being selected, which, if he proves his case, <num value="1">one</num> of them <hi rend="italics">may</hi> be; so, unless his plea is a pitiful and deserving <num value="1">one</num>, they keep mum. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/><num value="0.33">A <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> victim does not claim to have been selected out of turn, but nevertheless alleges that <quote>the deal is unfair, because he was on the last detail but <num value="1">one</num> made for this horse-burying business, and he does not think that he ought to be the chief mourner for his detachment, for a paltry <measure n="13dollars" type="currency">thirteen dollars</measure> a month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>Besides, there may be others who would <hi rend="italics">like</hi> to go on this detail.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>But as he is unable to name or find the man or men having this highly refined ambition he finally goes off grumbling and joins the squad. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>A <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> victim is the constitutionally high-tempered and profane man. He finds no fault with the justice of the sergeant <pb id="p.104" n="104"/> in assigning to him a participation in the ceremonies of the hour; but he had got comfortably seated to write a letter when the summons came, and, pausing only long enough to inquire the nature of the detail, he pitches his halfwrit-<num value="10">ten</num> letter and materials in <num value="1">one</num> direction, his lap-board in another, gets up, kicks over the box or stool on which he was sitting, pulls on his cap with a vehement jerk, and then opens his battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>He directs none of his unmilitary English at the sergeant &mdash; that would hardly do ; but he lays his furious lash upon the poor innocent back of <figure id="fig.104"> 
<head>The high-tempered man.</head></figure> the government, though just what <hi rend="italics">branch</hi> of it is responsible he does not pause between his oaths long enough to state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>He pursues it with the most terrible of curses uphill, and then with like violent language follows it down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>He blank blanks the whole blank blank war, and hopes that the <rs>South</rs> may win. He wishes that all the blank horses were in blank, and adds by way of self-reproach that it serves any <num value="1">one</num>, who is such a blank blank fool as to enlist, <hi rend="italics">right</hi> to have this blank, filthy, disgusting work to do. And he leaves the stockade shutting the door behind him <quote>with a wooden damn,</quote> as <persName n="Holmes,,,,," id="n0006.0007.00104.00108" reg="mostcommon:Holmes,Oliver,Wendell,,:2"><surname>Holmes</surname></persName> says, and goes off to report, making the air blue with his cursing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>Let me say for this man, before leaving him, that he is not so hardened and bad at heart as he makes himself appear; and in the shock of battle he will be found standing manfully at his post minus his temper and profanity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>There is <num value="1">one</num> more man whom I will describe here, representing another class than either mentioned, whose unlucky star has fated <hi rend="italics">him</hi> to take a part in these obsequies; but he <pb id="p.105" n="105"/> is not a shirk nor a beat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>He is the <hi rend="italics">paper-collar young man</hi>, just from the recruiting station, with enamelled long-legged boots and custom-made clothes, who yet looks with some measure of disdain on government clothing, and yet eats in a most gingerly way of the stern, unpoetical government rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>He is an only son, and was a <rs n="dry goods" type="product">dry-goods</rs> clerk in the city at home, where no reasonable want went ungratified; and now, when he is summoned forth to join the burial party, he responds at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>True, his heart and stomach both revolt at the work ahead, but he wants to be &mdash; not an angel &mdash; but a veteran among veterans, and his <figure id="fig.105">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/><quote>Fall in for your rations, company a!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>My theme is Army Rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>And while what I have to say on this subject may be applicable to all of the armies of the <rs>Union</rs> in large measure, yet, as they did not fare just alike, I will say, once for all, that my descriptions of army life pertain, when not otherwise specified, especially to that life as it was lived in the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>In beginning, I wish to say that false impression has obtained more or less currency both with regard to the quantity and quality of the food furnished the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>I have been asked a great many times whether I always got enough to eat in the army, and have surprised inquirers by answering in the affirmative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>Now, some old soldier may say who sees my reply, <quote>Well, you were lucky.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/><hi rend="italics">I</hi> didn't.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>But I should at once ask him to tell me for how long a time his regiment was ever without food of some kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>Of course, <pb id="p.109" n="109"/> I am not now referring to our prisoners of war, who starved by the <num value="1000">thousands</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>And I should be very much surprised if he should say more than <num value="24">twenty-four</num> or <measure n="30hours" type="date">thirty hours</measure>, at the outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>I would grant that he himself might, perhaps, have been so situated as to be deprived of food a longer time, possibly when he was on an exposed picket post, or serving as <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear-guard</orgName> to the army, or doing something which separated him temporarily from his company; but his case <figure id="fig.109"> 
<head>The <quote><placeName reg="Cooper shop">Cooper shop</placeName>,</quote> <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>.</head></figure> would be the exception and not the rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>Sometimes, when active operations were in progress, the army was compelled to wait a few hours for its trains to come up, but no general hardship to the men ever ensued on this account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>Such a contingency was usually known some time in advance, and the men would husband their last issue of rations, or, perhaps, if the country admitted, would make additions to their bill of fare in the shape of poultry or pork;--usually it was the latter, for the <name>Southerners</name> do not pen up their swine as do the <name>Northerners</name>, but let them go wandering about, getting their living much of the time as best they can. This <pb id="p.110" n="110"/> led some <num value="1">one</num> to say jocosely, with no disrespect intended to the people however, <quote>that every other person <num value="1">one</num> meets on a Southern street is a hog.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>They certainly were quite abundant, and are to-day, in some form, the chief meat food of that section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>But on the point of scarcity of rations I believe my statement will be generally agreed to by old soldiers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>Now, as to the <hi rend="italics">quality</hi> the case is not quite so clear, but still the picture has been often overdrawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>There were, it is true, large quantities of stale beef or salt horse &mdash; as the men were wont to call it-served out, and also rusty, unwholesome pork; and I presume the word <quote>hardtack</quote> suggests to the uninitiated a piece of petrified bread honeycombed with bugs and maggots, so much has this article of army diet been reviled by soldier and civilian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>Indeed, it is a rare occurrence for a soldier to allude to it, even at this late day, without some reference to its hardness, the date of its manufacture, or its propensity for travel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>But in spite of these unwholesome rations, whose existence no <num value="1">one</num> calls in question, of which I have seen &mdash; I must not say <hi rend="italics">eaten &mdash; large</hi> quantities, I think the government did well, under the circumstances, to furnish the soldiers with so good a quality of food as they averaged to receive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>Unwholesome rations were not the rule, they were the exception, and it was not the fault of the government that these were furnished, but very often the intent of the rascally, thieving contractors who supplied them, for which they received the price of good rations; or, perhaps, of the inspectors, who were in league with the contractors, and who therefore did not always do their duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>No language can be too strong to express the contempt every patriotic man, woman, and child must feel for such small-souled creatures, many of whom are to-day rolling in the riches acquired in this way and other ways equally disreputable and dishonorable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>I will now give a complete list of the rations served out to the rank and file, as I remember them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>They were salt pork, <pb id="p.111" n="111"/> fresh beef, salt beef, rarely ham or bacon, hard bread, soft bread, potatoes, an occasional onion, flour, beans, split pease, rice, dried apples, dried peaches, desiccated vegetables, coffee, tea, sugar, molasses, vinegar, candles, soap, pepper, and salt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>It is scarcely necessary to state that these were not all served out at <num value="1">one</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>There was but <num value="1">one</num> kind of meat served at once, and this, to use a Hibernianism, was usually <figure id="fig.111"> 
<head>The Union Volunteer Saloon, <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>.</head></figure> pork.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>When it was hard bread, it wasn't <hi rend="italics">soft</hi> bread or flour, and when it was pease or beans it wasn't rice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>Here is just what a single ration comprised, that is, what a soldier was entitled to have in <num value="1">one</num> day. He should have had <num value="12">twelve</num> ounces of pork or bacon, <hi rend="italics">or</hi> <measure n="1l." type="pounds"><num value="1">one</num> pound</measure> <num value="4">four</num> ounces of salt or fresh beef; <measure n="1l." type="pounds"><num value="1">one</num> pound</measure> <num value="6">six</num> ounces of soft bread or flour, <hi rend="italics">or</hi> <measure n="1l." type="pounds"><num value="1">one</num> pound</measure> of hard bread, <hi rend="italics">or</hi> <measure n="1l." type="pounds"><num value="1">one</num> pound</measure> <num value="4">four</num> ounces of <rs n="corn meal" type="product">corn meal</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>With every <num value="100">hundred</num> such rations there should have been distributed <num value="1">one</num> peck of beans or pease; <measure n="10l." type="pounds"><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure> of rice or hominy; <measure n="10l." type="pounds"><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure> of green coffee, <hi rend="italics">or</hi> <measure n="8l." type="pounds"><num value="8">eight</num> pounds</measure> of roasted and ground, <hi rend="italics">or</hi> <measure n="1l." type="pounds"><num value="1">one</num> pound</measure> <num value="8">eight</num> ounces of tea; <measure n="15l." type="pounds"><num value="15">fifteen</num> pounds</measure> of sugar; <measure n="1l." type="pounds"><num value="1">one</num> pound</measure> <num value="4">four</num> ounces of candles; <measure n="4l." type="pounds"><num value="4">four</num> pounds</measure> of soap; <num value="2">two</num> quarts of salt; <num value="4">four</num> <pb id="p.112" n="112"/> quarts of vinegar; <num value="4">four</num> ounces of pepper; <num value="0.5">a half</num> bushel of potatoes when practicable, and <num value="1">one</num> quart of molasses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>Desiccated potatoes or desiccated compressed vegetables might be substituted for the beans, pease, rice, hominy, or fresh potatoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>Vegetables, the <rs n="dried fruits" type="product">dried fruits</rs>, pickles, and pickled cabbage were occasionally issued to prevent scurvy, but in small quantities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>But the ration thus indicated was a camp ration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>Here is the <hi rend="italics">marching</hi> ration: <measure n="1l." type="pounds"><num value="1">one</num> pound</measure> of hard bread; threefourths of a pound of salt pork, or <num value="1">one</num> and <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> pounds of fresh meat; sugar, coffee, and salt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>The beans, rice, soap, candles, etc., were not issued to the soldier when on the march, as he could not carry them; but, singularly enough, as it seems to me, unless the troops went into camp before the end of the month, where a regular depot of supplies might be established from which the other parts of the rations could be issued, they were <hi rend="italics">forfeited</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">reverted to the government &mdash; an</hi> injustice to the rank and file, who, through no fault of their own, were thus cut off from a part of their allowance at the time when they were giving most liberally of their strength and perhaps of their very heart's blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>It was possible for company <hi rend="italics">commanders and for no <num value="1">one</num> else</hi> to receive the equivalent of these missing parts of the ration <hi rend="italics">in cash</hi> from the brigade commissary, with the expectation that when thus received it would be distributed among the rank and file to whom it belonged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>Many officers did not care to trouble themselves with it, but many others did, and &mdash; forgot to pay it out afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>I have yet to learn of the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Company">first company</orgName> whose members ever received any revenue from such a source, although the name of <hi rend="italics">Company Fund</hi> is a familiar <num value="1">one</num> to every veteran. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>The commissioned officers fared better in camp than the enlisted men. Instead of drawing rations after the manner of the latter, they had a certain cash allowance, according to rank, with which to purchase supplies from the <rs>Brigade Commissary</rs>, an official whose province was to keep stores <pb id="p.113" n="113"/> on sale for their convenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/>The monthly allowance of officers in infantry, including servants, was as follows: <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>, <num value="6">six</num> rations worth <measure n="56dollars" type="currency">$56</measure>, and <num value="2">two</num> servants; <figure id="fig.113"> 
<head>A brigade commissary at <placeName reg="Brandy Station, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2110767">Brandy Station, Va.</placeName></head></figure> <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</rs>, <num value="5">five</num> rations worth <measure n="45dollars" type="currency">$45</measure>, and <num value="2">two</num> servants; <rs type="role2">Major</rs>, <num value="4">four</num> rations worth <measure n="36dollars" type="currency">$36</measure>, and <num value="2">two</num> servants; <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, <num value="4">four</num> rations worth <measure n="36dollars" type="currency">$36</measure>, and <num value="1">one</num> servant; <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> and <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-2">Second Lieutenants</rs>, jointly, the same as <rs type="role2">Captains</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>In addition to the above, the field officers had an allowance of horses and forage proportioned to their rank. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>I will speak of the rations more in detail, beginning with the hard bread, or, to use the name by which it was known in the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>, <hi rend="italics">Hardtack</hi>. What was hardtack?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>It was a plain flour-and-water biscuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/><num value="2">Two</num> which I have in my possession as mementos measure <num value="3">three</num> and <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="8" type="ordinal">eighth</num> by <num value="2">two</num> and <measure n="7.125inches" type="distance">seven-eighths inches</measure>, and are nearly half and inch thick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>Although these biscuits were furnished to organizations by weight, they were dealt out to the men by number, <num value="9">nine</num> constituting a ration in some regiments, and <num value="10">ten</num> in others ; but there were usually enough for those who wanted more, as some men would not draw them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>While hardtack was nutritious, yet a hungry man could eat his <num value="10">ten</num> in a short time and still be hungry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>When they were poor and fit objects for the soldiers' wrath, it was due to <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.114" n="114"/> of <num value="3">three</num> conditions: <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, they may have been so hard that they could not be bitten; it then required a very strong blow of the fist to break them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>The cause of this hardness it would be difficult for <num value="1">one</num> not an expert to determine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/><figure id="fig.114"> 
<head>A hard-tack &mdash; full size.</head></figure> This variety certainly well deserved their name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>They could not be <hi rend="italics">soaked</hi> soft, but after a time took on the elasticity of gutta-percha. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> condition was when they were mouldy or wet, as sometimes happened, and should not have been given to the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>I think this condition was often due to their having been boxed up too soon after baking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>It certainly <pb id="p.115" n="115"/> was frequently due to exposure to the weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>It was no uncommon sight to see <num value="1000">thousands</num> of boxes of hard bread piled up at some railway station or other place used as a base of supplies, where they were only imperfectly sheltered from the weather, and too often not sheltered at all. The failure of inspectors to do their full duty was <num value="1">one</num> reason that so many of this sort reached the rank and file of the service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> condition was when from storage they had become infested with maggots and weevils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>These weevils were, in my experience, more abundant than the maggots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>They were a little, slim, brown bug an <num value="8" type="ordinal">eighth</num> of an inch in length, and were great <hi rend="italics">bores</hi> on a small scale, having the ability to completely riddle the hardtack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>I believe they never interfered with the hardest variety. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>When the bread was mouldy or moist, it was thrown away and made good at the next drawing, so that the men were not the losers; but in the case of its being infested with the weevils, they had to stand it as a rule; for the biscuits had to be pretty thoroughly alive, and well covered with the webs which these creatures left, to insure condemnation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>An exception occurs to me. <num value="2">Two</num> cargoes of hard bread came to <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>, and on being examined by an inspector were found to be infested with weevils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>This fact was brought to <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0006.0008.00115.00111" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,:2"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s attention, who would not allow it landed, greatly to the discomfiture of the contractor, who had been attempting to bulldoze the inspector to pass it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>The quartermasters did not always take as active an interest in righting such matters as they should have done; and when the men growled at them, of course they were virtuously indignant and prompt to shift the responsibility to the next higher power, and so it passed on until the real culprit could not be found. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>But hardtack was not so bad an article of food, even when traversed by insects, as may be supposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>Eaten in the dark, no <num value="1">one</num> could tell the difference between it and hardtack that <pb id="p.116" n="116"/> was untenanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>It was no uncommon occurrence for a man to find the surface of his pot of coffee swimming with weevils, after breaking up hardtack in it, which had come out of the fragments only to drown; but they were easily skimmed off, and left no distinctive flavor behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>If a soldier cared to do <figure id="fig.116"> 
<head>A box of hardtack.</head></figure> so, he could expel the weevils by heating the bread at the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>The maggots did not budge in that way. The most of the hard bread was made in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, and put up in boxes of <measure n="60l." type="pounds"><num value="60">sixty</num> pounds</measure> gross, <measure n="50l." type="pounds"><num value="50">fifty</num> pounds</measure> net; and it is said that some of the storehouses in which it was kept would swarm with weevils in an incredibly short time after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> box was infested with them, so rapidly did these pests multiply. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>Having gone so far, I know the reader will be interested to learn of the styles in which this particular article was served up by the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>I say <hi rend="italics">styles</hi> because I think there must have been at least a score of ways adopted to make this simple <hi rend="italics">flour tile</hi> more edible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>Of course, many of them were eaten just as they were received &mdash; hardtack <hi rend="italics">plain;</hi> then I have already spoken of their being crumbed in coffee, giving the <quote>hardtack and coffee.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>Probably more were eaten in this way than in any other, for they thus frequently furnished the soldier his breakfast and supper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>But there were <pb id="p.117" n="117"/> other and more appetizing ways of preparing them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>Many of the soldiers, partly through a slight taste for the business but more from force of circumstances, became in their way and opinion experts in the art of cooking the greatest variety of dishes with the smallest amount of capital. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>Some of these crumbed them in soups for want of other thickening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>For this purpose they served very well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>Some <figure id="fig.117"> 
<head>Frying hardtack.</head></figure> crumbed them in cold water, then fried the crumbs in the juice and fat of meat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>A dish akin to this <num value="1">one</num>, which was said to <quote>make the hair curl,</quote> and certainly was indigestible enough to satisfy the cravings of the most ambitious dyspeptic, was prepared by soaking hardtack in cold water, then frying them brown in pork fat, salting to taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>Another name for this dish was <quote>skillygalee.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>Some liked them toasted, either to crumb in coffee, or, if a sutler was at hand whom they could patronize, to butter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>The toasting generally took place from the end of a split stick, and if perchance they dropped out of it into the camp-fire, and were not recovered quickly enough to prevent them from getting pretty well charred, they were not thrown away on that account, being then thought good for weak bowels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/><pb id="p.118" n="118"/> </p> 
<p>Then they worked into milk-toast made of condensed milk at <measure n="75cents" type="currency">seventy-five cents</measure> a can; but only a recruit with a big bounty, or an old vet the child of wealthy parents, or a re-enlisted man did much in that way. A few who succeeded by hook or by crook in saving up a portion of their sugar ration spread <hi rend="italics">it</hi> upon hardtack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>The hodge-podge of lobscouse also contained this edible among its divers other ingredients; and so in various ways the ingenuity of the men was taxed to make this plainest and commonest yet most serviceable of army food to do duty in every conceivable combination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>There is an old song, entitled <title>Hard times,</title> which some <num value="1">one</num> in the army parodied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>I do not remember the verses, but the men used to sing the following chorus:-- <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/></p><lg type="couplet"><l>'Tis the song of the soldier, weary, hungry, and faint, </l><l>Hardtack, hardtack, come again no more; </l><l>Many days have I chewed you and uttered no complaint, </l><l>O Greenbacks, come again once more!</l></lg></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>It is possible at least that this song, sung by the soldiers of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>, was an outgrowth of the following circumstance and song.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>I am quite sure, however, that the verses were different. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>But I now pass to consider the other bread ration &mdash; the <hi rend="italics">loaf</hi> or <hi rend="italics">soft bread</hi>. Early in the war the ration of flour was served out to the men uncooked; but as the <num value="18">eighteen</num> ounces <pb id="p.120" n="120"/> allowed by the government more than met the needs of the troops, who at that time obtained much of their living from outside sources (to be spoken of hereafter), it was allowed, as they innocently supposed, to be sold for the benefit of the <rs>Company Fund</rs>, already referred to. Some organizations drew, on requisition, ovens, semi-cylindrical in form, which were properly set in stone, and in these regimental cooks or bakers baked bread for the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>But all of this was in the tentative period of the war. <figure id="fig.120"> 
<head>An Army oven.</head></figure> As rapidly as the needs of the troops pressed home to the government, they were met with such despatch and efficiency as circumstances would permit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>For a time, in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, the vaults under the broad terrace on the western front of the <rs>Capitol</rs> were converted into bakeries, where <num value="16000">sixteen thousand</num> loaves of bread were baked daily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>The chimneys from the ovens pierced the terrace where now the freestone pavement joins the grassy slope, and for months smoke poured out of these in dense black volumes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>The greater part of the loaves supplied to the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> up to the summer of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct> were baked in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, and at <placeName reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013920">Fort Monroe, Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>The ovens at the latter place had a capacity of <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> loaves a day. But even with all these sources worked to their uttermost, brigade commissaries were obliged to set up ovens near their respective depots, to eke out enough bread to fill orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>These were erected on the sheltered side of a hill or woods, then enclosed in a stockade, and the whole covered with old canvas. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>When the army reached the vicinity of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, the supply of fresh loaves became a matter of greater difficulty <pb id="p.121" n="121"/> and delay, which <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0006.0008.00121.00114" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,:2"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> immediately obviated by ordering ovens built at <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>A large number of citizen bakers were employed to run them night and day, and as a result <hi rend="italics"><num value="123000">one hundred and twenty-three thousand</num> fresh loaves</hi> were furnished the army daily from this single source; and so closely did the delivery of these follow upon the manipulations of the bakers that the soldiers quite frequently <figure id="fig.121">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>Soft bread was always a very welcome change from hard bread; yet, on the other hand, I think the soldiers tired sooner of the former than of the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>Men who had followed the sea preferred the hard bread.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>I began my description of the rations with the bread as being the most important <num value="1">one</num> to the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>Some old veterans may be disposed to question the judgment which gives it this rank, and claim that <hi rend="italics">coffee</hi>, of which I shall speak next, should take <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; place in importance; in reply <pb id="p.122" n="122"/> to which I will simply say that he is wrong, because coffee, being a stimulant, serves only a temporary purpose, while the bread has nearly or quite all the elements of nutrition necessary to build up the wasted tissues of the body, thus conferring a permanent benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>Whatever words of condemnation or criticism may have been bestowed on other government rations, there was but <num value="1">one</num> opinion of the coffee which was served out, and that was of unqualified approval. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>The rations may have been small, the commissary or quartermaster may have given us a short allowance, but what we <figure id="fig.122"> 
<head>Apportioning coffee and sugar.</head></figure> got was good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>And what a perfect Godsend it seemed to us at times!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>How often, after being completely jaded by a night march,--and this is an experience common to <num value="1000">thousands</num>,--have I had a wash, if there was water to be had, made and drunk my pint or so of coffee, and felt as fresh and invigorated as if just arisen from a night's sound sleep!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>At such times it could seem to have had no substitute. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>It would have interested a civilian to observe the manner in which this ration was served out when the army was in active service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>It was usually brought to camp in an oat. sack, a regimental quartermaster receiving and apportioning <pb id="p.123" n="123"/> his among the <num value="10">ten</num> companies, and the quartermaster-sergeant of a battery apportioning his to the <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="6">six</num> detachments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>Then the orderly-sergeant of a company or the sergeant of a detachment must devote himself to dividing it. <num value="1">One</num> method of accomplishing this purpose was to spread a rubber blanket on the ground,--more than <num value="1">one</num> if the company was large,--and upon it were put as many piles of the coffee as there were men to receive rations; and the care taken to make the piles of the same size to the eye, to keep the men from growling, would remind <num value="1">one</num> of a country physician making his powders, taking a little from <num value="1">one</num> pile and adding to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>The sugar which always accompanied the coffee was spooned out at the same time on another blanket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>When both were ready, they were given out, each man taking a pile, or, in some companies, to prevent any charge of unfairness or injustice, the sergeant would turn his back on the rations, and take out his roll of the company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>Then, by request, some <num value="1">one</num> else would point to a pile and ask, <quote>Who shall have this?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>and the sergeant, without turning, would call a name from his list of the company or detachment, and the person thus called would appropriate the pile specified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>This process would be continued until the last pile was disposed of. There were other plans for distributing the rations; but I have described this <num value="1">one</num> because of its being quite common. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>The manner in which each man disposed of his coffee and sugar ration after receiving it is worth noting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>Every soldier of a month's experience in campaigning was provided with some sort of bag into which he spooned his coffee; but the <hi rend="italics">kind</hi> of bag he used indicated pretty accurately, in a general way, the length of time he had been in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>For example, a raw recruit just arrived would take it up in a paper, and stow it away in that well known receptacle for all eatables, the soldier's haversack, only to find it a part of a general mixture of hardtack, salt pork, pepper, salt, knife, fork, spoon, sugar, and. coffee by the time the next halt was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/><pb id="p.124" n="124"/> A recruit of longer standing, who had been through this experience and had begun to feel his wisdom-teeth coming, would take his up in a bag made of a scrap of rubber blanket or a <hi rend="italics">poncho</hi>; but after a few days carrying the rubber would peel off or the paint of the <hi rend="italics">poncho</hi> would rub off from contact with the greasy pork or boiled meat rational which was its travelling companion, and make a black, dirty mess, besides leaving the coffee-bag unfit for further use. Now and then some young soldier, a little starchier than his fellows, would bring out an oil-silk bag lined with cloth, which his mother had made and sent him; but even oil-silk couldn't stand everything, certainly not the peculiar inside furnishings of the average soldier's haversack, so it too was not long in yielding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>But your plain, straightforward old veteran, who had shed all his poetry and romance, if he had ever possessed any, who had roughed it up and down <quote>Old Virginny,</quote> man and boy, for many months, and who had tried all plans under all circumstances, took out an oblong plain cloth bag, which looked as immaculate as the every-day shirt of a coal-heaver, and into it scooped without ceremony both his sugar and coffee, and stirred them thoroughly together. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>There was method in this plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>He had learned from a hard experience that his sugar was a better investment thus disposed of than in any other way; for on several occasions he had eaten it with his hardtack a little at a time, had got it wet and melted in a rain, or, what happened fully as often, had sweetened his coffee to his taste when the sugar was kept separate, and in consequence had several messes of coffee to drink <hi rend="italics">without</hi> sweetening, which was <hi rend="italics">not</hi> to his taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>There was now and then a man who could keep the <num value="2">two</num> separate, sometimes in different ends of the same bag, and serve them up proportionally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>The reader already knows that milk was a luxury in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>It was a new experience for all soldiers to drink coffee without milk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>But they soon learned to make a virtue of a necessity, and <pb id="p.125" n="125"/> I doubt whether <num value="1">one</num> man in <num value="10">ten</num>, before the war closed, would have used the lactic fluid in his coffee from choice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>Condensed milk of <num value="2">two</num> brands, the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Lewis,,,,," id="n0006.0008.00125.00116" reg="mostcommon:Lewis,nomatch:0"><surname>Lewis</surname></persName></hi> and <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Borden,,,,," id="n0006.0008.00125.00117" reg="mostcommon:Borden,nomatch:0"><surname>Borden</surname></persName></hi>, was to be had at the sutler's when sutlers were handy, and occasionally milk was brought in from the udders of stray cows, the men milking them into their canteens; but this was early in the war. Later, war-swept <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> afforded very few of these brutes, for they were regarded by the armies as more valuable for beef than for milking purposes, and only those survived that were kept apart from lines of march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/><figure id="fig.125"> 
<head>The milk ration.</head></figure> In many instances they were the chief reliance of Southern families, whose able-bodied men were in the <rs>Rebel</rs> army, serving both as a source of nourishment and as beasts of burden. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>When the army was in settled camp, company cooks generally prepared the rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>These cooks were men selected from the company, who had a taste or an ambition for the business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>If there were none such, turns were taken at it; but this did not often happen, as the office excused men from all other duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>When company cooks prepared the food, the soldiers, at <pb id="p.126" n="126"/> the bugle signal, formed single file at the cook-house door, in winter, or the cook's open fire, in summer, where, with a long-handled dipper, he filled each man's till with coffee from the mess kettles, and dispensed to him such other food as was to be given out at that meal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>For various reasons, some of which I have previously hinted at, the coffee made by these cooks was of a very inferior quality and unpleasant to taste at times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>It was not to be compar-<figure id="fig.126"> 
<head>The company cook.</head></figure> ed in excellence with what the men made for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>I think that when the soldiers were <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thrown upon their own resources to prepare their food, they almost invariably cooked their coffee in the tin dipper with which all were provided, holding from a pint to a quart, perhaps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>But it was an unfortunate dish for the purpose, forever tipping over and spilling the coffee into the fire, either because the coals burned away beneath, or because the <name>Jonah</name> upset it. Then if the fire was new and blazing, it sometimes needed a hand that could stand heat like a steam safe to get it when it was wanted, with the chance in favor of more than half of the coffee boiling out before it was rescued, all of which was conducive to ill-temper, so that <pb id="p.127" n="127"/> <pb id="p.128" n="128"/> <pb id="p.129" n="129"/> such utensils would soon disappear, and a recruit would afterwards be seen with his pint or quart preserve can, its improvised wire bail held on the end of a stick, boiling his coffee at the camp-fire, happy in the security of his ration from Jonahs and other casualties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>His can soon became as black as the blackest, inside and out. This was the typical coffee-boiler of the private soldier, and had the advantage of being easily replaced when lost, as canned goods were in very general use by commissioned officers and hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>Besides this, each man was generally supplied with a small tin cup as a drinking-cup for his coffee and water. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>The coffee ration was most heartily appreciated by the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>When tired and foot-sore, he would drop out of the marching column, build his little camp-fire, cook his mess of coffee, take a nap behind the nearest shelter, and, when he woke, hurry on to overtake his company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>Such men were sometimes called stragglers; but it could, obviously, have no offensive meaning when applied to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>Tea was served so rarely that it does not merit any particular description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>In the latter part of the war, it was rarely seen outside of hospitals. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most interesting scenes presented in army life took place at night when the army was on the point of bivouacking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>As soon as this fact became known along the column, each man would seize a rail from the nearest fence, and with this additional arm on the shoulder would enter the proposed camping-ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>In no more time than it takes to tell the story, the little camp-fires, rapidly increasing to hundreds in number, would shoot up along the hills and plains, and as if by magic acres of territory would be luminous with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>Soon they would be surrounded by the soldiers, who made it an almost invariable rule to cook their coffee <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, after which a large number, tired out with the toils of the day, would make their supper of hardtack and coffee, and roll up in their blankets for the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>If a march was ordered at <time value="12am">midnight</time>, unless a surprise was intended, <pb id="p.130" n="130"/> it must be preceded by a pot of coffee; if a halt was ordered in mid-forenoon or afternoon, the same dish was inevitable, with hardtack accompaniment usually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>It was coffee <hi rend="italics">at</hi> meals and <hi rend="italics">between</hi> meals; and men going on guard or coming off guard drank it at all hours of the night, and to-day the old soldiers who can stand it are the hardest coffee-drinkers in the community, through the schooling which they received in the service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>At a certain period in the war, speculators bought up all the coffee there was in the market, with a view of compelling the government to pay them a very high price for the army supply; but on learning of their action the agents of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> were ordered to purchase several ship-loads then anchored in the <placeName reg="English Channel" key="tgn,7005239">English Channel</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/><persName n="Eaton,General,,,," id="n0006.0008.00130.00120" reg="nearbymention:Eaton,Joseph,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Eaton</surname></persName> replied that while the bids had all been opened, yet they had not been made public, and the successful bidder had not been notified, so that no injustice could accrue to any <num value="1">one</num> on that account; he would therefore assume the responsibility of taking his new bid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/><pb id="p.131" n="131"/> The result was the saving of many <num value="1000">thousands</num> of dollars to the government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>I have stated that by Army Regulations the soldiers were entitled to either <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of a pound of pork or bacon or <num value="1">one</num> and <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> pounds of fresh or salt beef.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>I have also stated, in substance, that when the army was settled down for a probable long stop company cooks did the cooking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>But there was no uniformity about it, each company commander regulating the matter for his own command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>It is safe to remark, however, that in the early history of each regiment the rations were cooked for its members by persons especially selected for the duty, unless the regiment was sent at once into active service, in which case each man was immediately confronted with the problem of preparing his own food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>In making this statement I ignore the experience which troops had before leaving their native State, for in the different State rendezvous I think the practice was general for cooks to prepare the rations; but their culinary skillor lack of it &mdash; was little appreciated by men within easy reach of home, friends, and cooky shops, who displayed as yet no undue anxiety to anticipate the unromantic living provided for <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Sam</foreName></persName>'s patriot defenders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>Having injected so much, by way of further explanation I come now to speak of the manner in which, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the freshmeat ration was cooked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>If it fell into the hands of the company cooks, it was fated to be boiled <num value="24">twenty-four</num> times out of <num value="25">twenty-five</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>There are rare occasions on record when these cooks attempted to broil <hi rend="italics">steak</hi> enough for a whole company, and they would have succeeded tolerably if this particular tid-bit could be found all the way through a steer, from the tip of his nose to the end of his tail, but as it is only local and limited the amount of nice or even tolerable steak that fell to the lot of <num value="1">one</num> company in its allowance was not very large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>For this reason among others the cooks did not always receive the credit which they deserved for their efforts to change the diet or extend the variety on the <pb id="p.132" n="132"/> bill of fare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>Then, on occasions equally rare, when the beef ration drawn was of such a nature as to admit of it, <hi rend="italics">roast beef</hi> was prepared in ovens such as I have already described, and served <quote>rare,</quote> <quote>middling,</quote> or <quote>well done.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>More frequently, yet not very often, a <hi rend="italics">soup</hi> was made for a change, but it was usually boiled meat; and when this accumulated, the men sometimes fried it in pork fat for a change. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>When the meat ration was served out raw to the men, to prepare after their own taste, although the variety of its cooking may not perhaps have been much greater, yet it gave more general satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>The growls most commonly heard were that the cooks kept the largest or choicest portions for themselves, or else that they sent them to the company officers, who were not entitled to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>Sometimes there was foundation for these complaints. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>In drawing his ration of meat from the commissary the quartermaster had to be governed by his last selection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>If it was a hindquarter then, he must take a forequarter the next time, so that it will at once be seen, by those who know anything about beef, that it would not always cut up and distribute with the same acceptance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/><num value="1">One</num> man would get a good solid piece, the next a flabby <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>When a ration of the latter description fell into the hands of a passionate man, such as I have described in another connection, he would instantly hurl it across the camp, and break out with such remarks as <quote>something not being fit for hogs,</quote> <quote>always his blank luck,</quote> etc. There was likely to be a little something gained by this dramatic exhibition, for the distributor would give the actor a good piece for several times afterwards, to restrain his temper. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>The kind of piece drawn naturally determined its disposition in the soldier's <hi rend="italics">cuisine</hi>. If it was a stringy, flabby piece, straightway it was doomed to a dish of lobscouse, made with such other materials as were at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/>If onions were not in the larder, and they seldom were, the little garlic found in some places growing wild furnished a very acceptable <pb id="p.133" n="133"/> substitute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>If the meat was pretty solid, even though it <hi rend="italics">had</hi> done duty when in active service well down on the shank or shin, it was quite likely to be served as beefsteak, and prepared for the palate in <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="2">two</num> ways;--either fried in pork fat, if pork was to be had, otherwise tallow fat, or impaled on a ramrod or forked stick; it was then salted and peppered and broiled in the flames; or it may have been thrown on the coals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>This broiling was, I think, the favorite <figure id="fig.133"> 
<head>Broiling Steaks.</head></figure> style with the oldest campaigners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1020"/>It certainly was more healthful and palatable cooked in this wise, and was the most convenient in active service, for any of the men could prepare it thus at short notice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1021"/>The meat generally came to us quivering from the butcher's knife, and was often eaten in less than <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> after slaughtering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/>To fry it necessitated the taking along of a frying-pan with which not many of the men cared to burden themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>These fry-pans &mdash; Marbleheadmen called them <hi rend="italics">Creepers</hi>--were yet comparatively light, being made of thin wrought iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/>They were of different sizes, and were kept <pb id="p.134" n="134"/> on sale by sutlers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/>It was a common sight on the march to see them borne aloft on a musket, to which they were lashed, or tucked beneath the straps of a knapsack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>But there was another fry-pan which distanced these both in respect of lightness and space.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>The soldier called in his own ingenuity to aid him here as in so many other directions, and consequently the men could be seen by scores frying the food in their tin plate, held in the jaws of a split stick, or fully as often an old canteen was unsoldered and its concave sides mustered into active duty as fry-pans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>The fresh-meat ration was thoroughly appreciated by the mell, even though they rarely if ever got the full allowance stipulated in Army Regulations, for it was a relief from the salt pork, salt beef, or boiled fresh meat ration of settled camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>I remember <num value="1">one</num> occasion in the <rs n="Mine Run Campaign" type="campaign">Mine Run Campaign</rs>, during the last days of <dateStruct value="1863-11-"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, when the army was put on short beef rations, that the men cut and scraped off the little rain-bleached shreds of meat that remained on the head of a steer which lay near our line of battle at <placeName reg="Robertson's Tavern">Robertson's Tavern</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>The animal had been slaughtered the day before, and what was left of its skeleton had been soaking in the rain, but not <num value="1">one</num> ounce of muscular tissue could have been gleaned from the bones when our men left it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>The liver, heart, and tongue were perquisites of the butcher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>For the liver, the usual price asked was a dollar, and for the heart or tongue <measure n="50cents" type="currency">fifty cents</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>The <quote>salt horse</quote> or salt beef, of fragrant memory, was rarely furnished to the army except when in settled camp, as it would obviously have been a poor dish to serve on the march, when water was often so scarce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>But even in camp the men quite generally rejected it. Without doubt, it was the vilest ration distributed to the soldiers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>It was thoroughly penetrated with saltpetre, was often yellow-green with rust from having lain out of brine, and, when boiled, was <num value="4">four</num> times out of <num value="5">five</num> if not <num value="9">nine</num> times out of <num value="10">ten</num> a stench in the nostrils, which no delicate palate cared <pb id="p.135" n="135"/> to encounter at shorter range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1036"/>It sometimes happened that the men would extract a good deal of amusement out of this ration, when an extremely unsavory lot was served out, by arranging a funeral, making the appointments as complete as possible, with bearers, a bier improvised of boards or a hardtack box, on which was the beef accompanied by scraps of old harness to indicate the original of the remains, and then, attended by solemn music and a mournful procession, it would be carried to the company sink and dumped, after a solemn mummery of words had been spoken, and a volley fired over its unhallowed grave. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/>So salt was this ration that it was impossible to freshen it too much, and it was not an unusual occurrence for troops encamped by a running brook to tie a piece of this beef to the end of a cord, and throw it into the brook at night, to remain freshening until the following morning as a necessary preparative to cooking. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/>Salt pork was the principal meat ration &mdash; the main stay as it were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1039"/>Company cooks boiled it. There was little else they could do with it, but it was an extremely useful ration to the men when served out raw. They almost never boiled it, but, as I have already shown, much of it was used for frying purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/>On the march it was broiled and eaten with hard bread, while much of it was eaten raw, sandwiched between hardtack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>Of course it was used with stewed as well as baked beans, and was an ingredient of soups and lobscouse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/>Many of us have since learned to call it an indigestible ration, but we ignored the existence of such a thing as a stomach in the army, and then regarded pork as an indispensable <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1043"/>Much of it was musty and rancid, like the salt horse, and much more was flabby, stringy, <quote>sow-belly,</quote> as the men called it, which, at this remove in distance, does not seem appetizing, however it may have seemed at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/>The government had a pork-packing factory of its own in <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>, from which tons of this ration were furnished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/><pb id="p.136" n="136"/> </p> 
<p>Once in a while a ration of ham or bacon was dealt out to the soldiers, but of such quality that I do not retain very grateful remembrances of it. It was usually black, rusty, and strong, and decidedly unpopular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>Once only do I recall a lot of smoked shoulders as being supplied to my company, which were very good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>They were never duplicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/>For that reason, I presume, they stand out prominently in memory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1049"/>The bean ration was an important factor in the sustenance of the army, and no edible, I think, was so thoroughly appreciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1050"/>Company cooks stewed them with pork, and <figure id="fig.136"> 
<head>Mess kettles and A mess pan.</head></figure> when the pork was good and the stew or soup was well done and not burned,--a rare combination of circumstances,--they were quite palatable in this way. Sometimes ovens were built of stones, on the top of the ground, and the beans were baked in these, in mess pans or kettles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1051"/>But I think the most popular method was to bake them in the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1052"/>This was the almost invariable course pursued by the soldiers when the beans were distributed for them to cook.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1053"/>It was done in the following way: A hole was dug large enough to set a mess pan or kettle in, and have ample space around it besides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1054"/>Mess kettles, let me explain here, are cylinders in shape, and made of heavy <rs n="sheet iron" type="product">sheet iron</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1055"/>They are from <num value="13">thirteen</num> to <measure n="15inches" type="distance">fifteen inches</measure> high, and vary in diameter from <measure n="7inches" type="distance">seven inches</measure> to a foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1056"/>A mess pan stands about <measure n="6inches" type="distance">six inches</measure> high, and is a foot in diameter at the top. I think <num value="1">one</num> will hold nearly <num value="6">six</num> quarts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/>To resume;--in the bottom of the hole dug a flat stone was put, if it could be <pb id="p.137" n="137"/> obtained, then a fire was built in the hole and kept burning some hours, the beans being prepared for baking meanwhile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1058"/>When all was ready, the coals were shovelled out, the kettle of beans and pork set in, with a board over the top, while the coals were shovelled back around the kettle; some poles or boards were then laid across the hole, a piece of sacking or other material spread over the poles to exclude dirt, and a mound of earth piled above all; the net result of which, when the hole was opened the next morning, was the most enjoyable dish that fell to the lot of the common soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1059"/>Baked beans at the homestead seemed at a discount in comparison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1060"/>As it was hardly practicable to bake a single ration of beans in this way, or, indeed, in any way, a tent's crew either saved their allowance until enough accumulated for a good baking, or <num value="0.5">a half</num>-dozen men would form a joint stock company, and cook in a mess kettle; and when the treasure was unearthed in early morning not a stockholder would be absent from the roll-call, but all were promptly on hand with plate or coffee dipper to receive their dividends. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1065"/>Boiled potatoes were furnished us occasionally in settled camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1066"/>On the march we varied the programme by frying them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1067"/>Onions, in my own company at least, were a great rarity, but highly appreciated when they did appear, even in homceopathic quantities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>They were pretty sure to appear on the army table, fried. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1069"/>Split peas were also drawn by the quartermaster now and then, and stewed with pork by the cooks for supper, making pea-soup, or <quote>Peas on a Trencher</quote> ; but if my memory serves me right, they were a dish in no great favor, even when they were not burned in cooking, which was usually their fate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1070"/>The dried-apple ration was supplied by the government, <quote>to swell the ranks of the army,</quote> as some <num value="1">one</num> wittily said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/>There seemed but <num value="1">one</num> practicable way in which this could be prepared, and that was to stew it; thus cooked it made a sauce for hardtack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/>Sometimes dried peaches were furnished instead, but of such a poor quality that the apples, with the <num value="0.5">fifty per cent</num> of skins and hulls which they contained, were considered far preferable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1073"/>At remote intervals the cooks gave for supper a dish of boiled rice (burned, of course), a sergeant spooning out a scanty allowance of molasses to bear it company. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1074"/>Occasionally, a ration of what was known as desiccated vegetables was dealt out. This consisted of a small piece per man, an ounce in weight and <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3inches" type="distance">three inches</measure> cube of a sheet or block of vegetables, which had been prepared, and apparently <hi rend="italics">kiln-dried</hi>, as <hi rend="italics">sanitary fodder</hi> for the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1075"/>In composition it looked not unlike the large cheeses of beefscraps that are seen in the markets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1076"/>When put in soak for a time, so perfectly had it been dried and so firmly pressed that it swelled to an amazing extent, attaining to several <pb id="p.139" n="139"/> times its dried proportions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/>In this pulpy state a favorable opportunity was afforded to analyze its composition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1078"/>It seemed to show, and I think really <hi rend="italics">did</hi> show, layers of cabbage leaves and turnip tops stratified with layers of sliced carrots, turnips, parsnips, a bare suggestion of onions,they were too valuable to waste in this compound,--and some other among known vegetable quantities, with a large residuum of insoluble and <hi rend="italics">insolvable</hi> material which appeared to play the part of warp to the fabric, but which defied the powers of the analyst to give it a name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1079"/>An inspector found in <num value="1">one</num> lot which he examined <hi rend="italics">powdered glass</hi> thickly sprinkled through it, apparently the work of a Confederate emissary; but if not it showed how little care was exercised in preparing this diet for the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/>In brief, this coarse vegetable compound could with much more propriety have been put before Southern swine than Northern soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/><quote><hi rend="italics">Desecrated</hi> vegetables</quote> was the more appropriate name which the men quite generally applied to this preparation of husks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1082"/>I believe it was the <orgName type="regiment" key="32MAInfantry">Thirty-Second Massachusetts Infantry</orgName> which once had a special ration of <measure n="300boxes" type="mass">three hundred boxes</measure> of <hi rend="italics">strawberries</hi> dealt out to it. But if there was another organization in the army anywhere which had such a delicious experience, I have yet to hear of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/>I presume that no discussion of army rations would be considered complete that did not at least make mention of the whiskey ration so called.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/>This was not a ration, properly speaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/>The government supplied it to the army only on rare occasions, and then by order of the <orgName n="Medical Department" type="department">medical department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/>I think it was never served out to my company more than <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> times, and then during a cold rainstorm or after unusually hard service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>But although he belonged to the arm of the service called <quote>the eyes and ears of the army,</quote> and was no doubt a gallant soldier, he is not well posted; for men who belonged to other organizations in the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> assure me that it was served out to them much more frequently than I have related as coming under my observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>I think there can be no doubt on this point. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>The size of the whiskey allowance was declared, by those whose experience had made them competent judges, as trifling and insignificant, sometimes not more than a tablespoonful; but the quantity differed greatly in different organizations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>The opinion was very prevalent, and undoubtedly correct, that the liquor was quite liberally sampled by the various headquarters, or the agents through whom it was transmitted to the rank and file.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>While there was considerable whiskey drank by the men <quote>unofficially,</quote> that is, which was obtained otherwise than on the order of the <orgName n="Medical Department" type="department">medical department</orgName>, yet, man for man, the private soldiers were as abstemious as the officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>The officers who did not drink more or less were too scarce in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>They had only to send to the commissary to obtain as much as they pleased, <hi rend="italics">whenever</hi> they pleased, by paying for it; but the private soldier could only obtain it of this official on an order signed by a commissioned officer,--usually the captain of his company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>In fact, there was nothing but his sense of honor, his self-respect, or his fear of exposure and punishment, to restrain a captain, a colonel, or a general, of whatever command, from being intoxicated at a moment when he should have been in the full possession of his senses leading his command on to battle; and I regret to relate that these motives, strong as they are to impel to right and restrain from wrong-doing, were no barrier to many an officer whose appetite in a crisis thus imperilled the cause and disgraced himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/>Doesn't it seem strange that the enforcement of <pb id="p.141" n="141"/> the rules of war was so lax as to allow the lives of a <num value="100">hundred</num>, a <num value="1000">thousand</num>, or perhaps <num value="50">fifty</num> or a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> sober men to be jeopardized, as they so often were, by holding them rigidly obedient to the orders of a man whose head at a critical moment might be crazed with commissary whiskey?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>Hundreds if not <num value="1000">thousands</num> of lives were sacrificed by such leadership.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>I may state here that drunkenness was equally as common with the <rs>Rebels</rs> as with the <rs>Federals</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/>The devices resorted to by those members of the rank and file who hungered and thirsted for <hi rend="italics">commissary</hi> to obtain it, are numerous and entertaining enough to occupy a chapter; but these I must leave for some <num value="1">one</num> of broader experience and observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>I could name <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> men in my own company whose experience qualified them to fill the bill completely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>They were always on the scent for something to drink.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/>Such men were to be found in all organizations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>It has always struck me that the government should have increased the size of the marching ration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/>If the soldier on the march had received <measure n="1.5l." type="pounds"><num value="1.5">one and one-half</num> pounds</measure> of hard bread and <measure n="1.5l." type="pounds"><num value="1.5">one and one-half</num> pounds</measure> of fresh beef daily with his sugar, coffee, and salt, it would have been no more than marching men require to keep up the requisite strength and resist disease. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1105"/>By such an increase the men would have been compensated for the parts of rations not issued to them, or the increase might have been an equivalent for these parts, and the temptation to dishonesty or neglect on the part of company commanders thus removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>But, more than this, the men would not then have eaten up many days' rations in advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/>It mattered not that the troops, at a certain date, were provided with <num value="3">three</num>, <num value="4">four</num>, or any number of days rations; if these rations were exhausted before the limit for which they were distributed was even half reached, more must be immediately issued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>As a consequence, in every summer campaign <hi rend="italics">the troops had drawn <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="15days" type="date">fifteen days</measure> <pb id="p.142" n="142"/> marching rations ahead of time</hi>, proving, season after season, the inadequacy of this ration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/>This deficiency of active service had to be made up by shortening the rations issued in camp when the men could live on a contracted diet without detriment to the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/>But <hi rend="italics">they</hi> knew nothing of this shortage at the time,--I mean now the rank and file,--else what a universal growl would have rolled through the camps of each <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> while the commissary was <quote>catching up.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>No popular history of the war has yet treated in detail of the various indiscretions of which soldiers were guilty, nor of the punishments which followed breaches of discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>Perhaps such a record is wanting because there are many men yet alive who cannot think with equanimity of punishments to which they were at some period of their service subjected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1115"/>Indeed, within a few months I have seen veterans who, if not breathing out threatening and slaughter, like <persName n="Saul,,,,," id="n0006.0009.00143.00130" reg="mostcommon:Saul,nomatch:0"><surname>Saul</surname></persName> of <placeName key="tgn,7002623" n="1.000 1" reg="tarsus,icel ili,akdeniz kiyisi,turkiye,asia">Tarsus</placeName>, <figure id="fig.143">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1116"/>I shall not, because I cannot, name all the offences of soldiering to which punishments were affixed, as no <num value="2">two</num> <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officers</rs> had just the same violations of military discipline to deal with,--but I shall <pb id="p.144" n="144"/> endeavor in this chapter to include all those which appeal to a common experience. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1117"/>The most common offences were drunkenness, absence from camp without leave, insubordination, disrespect to superior officers, absence from roll-call without leave, turbulence after taps, sitting while on guard, gambling, and leaving the beat without relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1118"/>To explain these offences a little more in detail &mdash; no soldier was supposed to leave camp without a pass or permit from the commander of the regiment or battery to which he belonged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1119"/>A great many <hi rend="italics">did</hi> leave for a few hours at a time, however, and took their chances of being missed and reported for it. In some companies, when it was thought that several were absent without a permit, a roll-call was ordered simply to catch the culprits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1120"/>Disrespect to a superior officer was shown in many ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1121"/>Some of the more common ways were to <quote>talk back,</quote> in strong unmilitary language, and to refuse to salute him or recognize him on duty, which military etiquette requires to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1122"/>The other <figure id="fig.144"> 
<head>Carrying A log.</head></figure> offences named explain themselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1123"/>The methods of punishment were as diverse as the dispositions of the officers who sat in judgment on the cases of the offenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1124"/>In the early history of a regiment there was a guard-house or guard-tent where the daily guard were <pb id="p.145" n="145"/> wont to assemble, and which was their rendezvous when off post during their <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1125"/>But when the ranks of the regiment had become very much depleted, and the men pretty well seasoned in military duty, the guardtent was likely to be dispensed with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1126"/>In this guard-tent offenders were put for different periods of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1127"/>Such confinement was a common punishment for drunkenness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1128"/>This may not be thought a very severe penalty; still, the men did not enjoy it, as it imposed quite a restriction on their freedom to be thus pent up and cut off from the rest of their associates. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1129"/>Absence from camp or roll-call without leave was punished in various ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1130"/>There was no special penalty for it. I think every organization had what was known as a Black List, on which the names of all offenders against the ordinary rules of camp were kept for frequent reference, and when there was any particularly disagreeable task about camp to be done the black list furnished a quota for the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1131"/>The galling part of membership in the ranks of the black list was that all of the work done as <num value="1">one</num> of its victims was a gratuity, as the member must stand his regular turn in his squad for whatever other fatigue duty was required. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1132"/>Among the tasks that were thought quite interesting and profitable pastimes for the black-listed to engage in, were policing the camp and digging and fitting up new company sinks or filling abandoned ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/>A favorite treat meted out to the unfortunates in the artillery and cavalry was the burying of dead horses or cleaning up around the picket rope where the animals were tied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1134"/>In brief, the men who kept <hi rend="italics">off</hi> the black list in a company were spared many a hard and disagreeable job by the existence of a good long list of offenders against camp discipline. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1135"/>This placing of men on the black list was not as a rule resorted to by officers who cherished petty spites or personal malice, but by it they designed rather to enforce a salutary discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1136"/>Such officers had no desire to torture the erring, <pb id="p.146" n="146"/> but aimed to combine a reasonable form of punishment with utility to the camp and to the better behaved class of soldiers, and in this I think they were successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1137"/>But there was a class of officers who felt that every violation of camp rules should be visited with the infliction of bodily pain in some form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1138"/>As a consequence, the sentences imposed by these military judges all looked towards that end. Some would <hi rend="italics">buck and gag</hi> their victims; some would <hi rend="italics">stand them on a barrel</hi> for <num value="0.5">a half</num>-day or a day at a time; a favorite punishment with some was to knock out both heads of a barrel, then make the victim stand on the ends of the staves; some would compel them to wear all inverted barrel for several <figure id="fig.146"> 
<head>Bucked and Gagged.</head></figure> hours, by leaving a hole cut in the bottom, through which the head passed, making a kind of wooden overcoat; some culprits were compelled to stand a long time with their arms, extending horizontally at the side, lashed to a heavy stick of wood that ran across their backs; others were lashed to a tall wooden horse which stood perhaps <num value="8">eight</num> or <measure n="9feet" type="distance">nine feet</measure> high; some underwent the knapsack drill, that is, they walked a beat with a guardsman <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> on and <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure> off, wearing a knapsack filled with bricks or stones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1139"/>Here is an incident related by a veteran who served in the <orgName n="Department of the Gulf" type="department">Gulf Department</orgName>: <num value="1">One</num> day a captain in <orgName n="Brigade"><persName n="Phelps,General,,,," id="n0006.0009.00146.00131" reg="mostcommon:Phelps,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Phelps</surname></persName>' Brigade</orgName> put a man on knapsack drill; in other words, he filled his knapsack with bricks, and made him march with it up and down the company street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1140"/>The General had the habit of going through the camps of his brigade quite frequently, <pb id="p.147" n="147"/> and that day he happened around just in time to see the performance, but returned to his quarters apparently without noticing it. Soon, however, he sent his <rs type="role2">Orderly</rs> to the <rs>Captain</rs> with a request to come to his tent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1141"/>The <rs>Captain</rs> was soon on his way, dressed in his best uniform, probably expecting, at least, a commendation for his efficiency, or perhaps a promotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1142"/>On reaching the <rs>General</rs>'s tent, he was admitted, when, after the usual salute, the following dialogue took place :-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1143"/>General P.--<quote>Good-morning, <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1144"/></p> 
<p><rs type="role2">Captain</rs>.--<quote>Good-morning, General.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1145"/></p> 
<p>General P.-<quote>I sent for you, <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, to inquire of you what knapsacks were made for.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1146"/></p> 
<p><rs type="role2">Captain</rs>.--<quote>Knapsacks!--why, I suppose they were made for soldiers to carry their spare clothing in.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1147"/></p> 
<p>General P.-<quote>Well, <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, I passed your camp a short time ago and saw <num value="1">one</num> of your men carrying bricks in his knapsack up and down the company street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1148"/>Now, go back to your company, send that man to his quarters, and don't let me know of your ordering any such punishment again while you are in my brigade.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1149"/></p> 
<p><num value="1">One</num> regiment that I know of had a platform erected, between <num value="25">twenty-five</num> and <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure> high, on which the offender was isolated from the camp, and left to broil in the sun or soak in the rain while a guard paced his beat below, to keep away any who might like to communicate with him. <pb id="p.148" n="148"/> Some were tied up by the thumbs, with arms extended full length, and compelled to stand in that position for hours; some were put into what was known as the sweat-box.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1150"/>This was a box <measure n="18inches" type="distance">eighteen inches</measure> square, and of the full height of a man, into which the culprit was placed to stand until released.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1151"/>Some had their full offence written out on a board with chalk, and, with this board strapped to their backs, were marched up and down through camp the entire day, without rest or refreshment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1152"/>In the artillery, the favorite punishment was to lash the guilty party to <figure id="fig.148"> 
<head>Loaded knapsack.</head></figure> the spare wheel &mdash; the extra wheel carried on the rear portion of every caisson in a battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1153"/>In the cavalry, men were sometimes punished by being compelled to carry their packed saddle a prescribed time &mdash; no small or insignificant burden to men unused to a knapsack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1154"/>Sometimes the guilty parties were required to carry a heavy stick of wood on the shoulder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1155"/>I knew <num value="1">one</num> such man, who, because of this punishment, took a solemn oath that he would never do another day's duty in his company; and he never isolated on A platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1156"/>did. From that day forward he reported at sick-call, but the surgeon could find no traces of disease about him, and <pb id="p.149" n="149"/> so returned him for duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1157"/>Still the man persistently refused to do duty, claiming that he was not able, and continued to report at sick-call.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1158"/>By refusing to eat anything, he reduced himself to such a condition that he really appeared diseased, and at last was discharged, went home, and boasted of his achievement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1159"/>Sometimes double guard-duty was ordered for a man on account of an omission or act of his while on guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1160"/>This <figure id="fig.149"> 
<head>On the spare wheel.</head></figure> punishment gave him <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure> on and <num value="2">two</num> off his post or beat instead of the reverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1161"/>His offence may have been failing or refusing to salute his superior officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1162"/>It may have been that he was not properly equipped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1163"/>It may have been for being found off his beat, or for leaving it without having been properly relieved; or he may have failed in his duty when the <quote>Grand rounds</quote> appeared. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1164"/>When non-commissioned officers sinned, which they did sometimes, they were punished by being reduced to the ranks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1165"/>In some organizations gambling was not allowed, in others <pb id="p.150" n="150"/> it was carried on by both officers and privates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1166"/>In <num value="1">one</num> command, at least, where this vice was interdicted, culprits in the ranks were punished by having <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of the head shaved &mdash; a most humiliating and effective punishment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1167"/>Then <quote>back talk,</quote> as it was commonly called, which , interpreted, means answering a superior officer insolently, was a prolific cause of punishments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1168"/>It did not matter in some organizations who the officer was, from colonel or captain to the last corporal, <figure id="fig.150"> 
<head>On A wooden horse.</head></figure> to hear was to obey, and under such discipline the men became the merest puppets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1169"/>In theory, such a regiment was the perfect military machine, where every man was in complete subordination to <num value="1">one</num> master mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1170"/>But the value of such a machine, after all, depended largely upon the kind of a man the ruling spirit was, and whether he associated his inflexibility of steel with the justice of <persName n="Aristides,,,,," id="n0006.0009.00150.00132" reg="mostcommon:Aristides,nomatch:0"><surname>Aristides</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1171"/>If he did that, then was it indeed a model organization; but such bodies were rare, for the conditions were wanting to make them abundant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1172"/>The master mind was too often tyrannical and abusive, either by nature, or from having been suddenly clothed with a little brief authority over men. And often when nature, if left to herself, would have made him a good commander, an excessive use of <quote>commissary</quote> interfered to prevent, and the subordinates of such a leader, many of them appointed by his influence, would naturally partake of his characteristics; so that such regiments, instead of standing solidly on all occasions, were <pb id="p.151" n="151"/> weakened as a fighting body by a lack of confidence in and personal respect for their leaders, and by a hatred begotten of unjust treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1173"/>Hundreds of officers were put in commission through influence at court, wealth or personal influence deciding appointments that should have been made solely on the basis of merit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1174"/>At the beginning of the war it was inevitable that the officers should have been inexperienced and uninstructed in the details of warfare, but later this condition changed, and the service would have been strengthened and materially improved by promoting men who had done honorable service and shown good conduct in action, to commissions in new regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1175"/>It is true that such was the intent and partial practice in some States, but the governors, more or less from necessity, took the advice of some <num value="1">one</num> who was a warm personal friend of the applicant, so that shoulder-straps, instead of being always conferred for gallant conduct <figure id="fig.151"> 
<head>In the sweat-box.</head></figure> in the front rank, were sometimes a mark of distinguished prowess in the mule-train or the cookhouse, which seemed to maintain readier and more influential communication with the appointing power at the rear than was had by the men who stood nearest to the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1176"/>To bow in meek submission to the uneducated authority of the civilian, or to the soldier whose record was such as not to command the respect of his fellows, was the lot of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of intelligent and brave soldiers, the superiors in all respects, save that of military rank alone, of these selfsame officers; and to be commanded not to answer back, <pb id="p.152" n="152"/> when they felt that they must utter a protest against injustice, was a humiliation that the average volunteer did not fully realize when he put his name to the roll,--a humiliation which grew bitterer with every new indignity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1177"/>Punishments or rebukes administered by social inferiors were galling even when deserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1178"/>It seems ludicrous to me when I recall the threats I used to hear made against officers for some of their misdeeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1179"/>Many a wearer of shoulder-straps was to be shot by his own men in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1180"/>But, somehow or other, when the engagement came along there seemed to be Rebels enough to shoot without throwing away ammunition on Union men; and about that time too the men, who in more peaceful retreats were so anxious to shoot their own officers, could not always be found, when wanted, to shoot more legitimate <figure id="fig.152"> 
<head>On the <name>Chines</name>.</head></figure> game.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1181"/>In these days, when private soldiers are so scarce and officers so exceedingly abundant, the question might very naturally arise how the abundance came about if the officers were so often between <num value="2">two</num> fires; but what I have said will furnish a solution to the mystery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1182"/>Then, there were hundreds of officers that were to be settled with when they reached <hi rend="italics">home</hi>, and were on an equality with the private soldier so far as military rank was concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1183"/>But while there were, as I have previously intimated, a few who took their resentments out of the service with them, they were <hi rend="italics">only</hi> few in number, and it is <pb id="p.153" n="153"/> doubtful whether any of them ever executed their threatened deeds of violence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1184"/>Poor underpaid non-commissioned officers, who occupied the perplexing and uncomfortable position of go-betweens, were frequently invited by privates to strip off their chevrons and be handsomely whipped for some act annoying to said privates; but I never heard of any n. c. o. sacrificing his chevrons to any such ambitionfor various reasons, of which the fear of a thrashing was not necessarily <num value="1">one</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1185"/>There were regiments each of which, when off duty, seemed to contain at least <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="300">three hundred</num> colonels and captains, so much social freedom obtained between officers and rank and file, yet at the proper time there was just <num value="1">one</num> commander of such a regiment to whom the men looked ready to do his bidding, even to follow him into the jaws of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1186"/>These officers were not always devout men; at an earlier period in their lives some of them may have learned to be profane; some drank commissary whiskey occasionally, it may be ; but in all their dealings with subordinates, while they made rigid exactions of them as <hi rend="italics">soldiers</hi>, they never forgot that they were <hi rend="italics">men</hi>, and hence, endeavoring to be just in the settlement of camp troubles, protecting their command in the full enjoyment of all its rights <figure id="fig.153"> 
<head>A wooden overcoat.</head></figure> among similar organizations, never saying <quote>go!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1187"/>but <quote>come!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1188"/>in the hour of danger, they welded their regiment into a military engine as <pb id="p.154" n="154"/> solid and reliable as the old Grecian Phalanx.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1189"/>Punishments in such regiments were rare, for manliness and self-respect were never crushed out by tyrants in miniature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1190"/>The character of the officers had so much to do with determining the nature and amount of the punishments in the army that I consider what I have thrown in here as germane to the subject of this chapter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1191"/>It should be said, in justice to both officers and privates, that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> of the war, when the exactions of the service were new, saw <num value="3">three</num> times the number of punishments administered in the <num value="2">two</num> subsequent years; but, aside <figure id="fig.154"> 
<head>Strapped to A stick.</head></figure> from the getting accustomed to the restraints of the service, campaigning was more continuous in the later years, and this kept both mind and body occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1192"/>It is inactivity which makes the growler's paradise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1193"/>Then, in the last years of the war the rigors of military discipline, the sharing of common dangers and hardships, and promotions from the ranks, had narrowed the gap between officers and privates so that the chords of mutual sympathy were stronger than before, and trivial offences were slightly rebuked or passed unnoticed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1194"/>At the beginning of the war many generals were very fearful lest some of the acts of the common soldier should give offence to the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1195"/>This encouraged the latter to report every chicken lost, every bee-hive borrowed, every rail burnt, to headquarters, and subordinates were required to institute the most thorough search for evidence <pb id="p.155" n="155"/> that should lead to the detection and punishment of the culprits, besides requiring them to make full restitution of the value of the property taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1196"/>Our government and its leading officers, military and civil, seemed at that time to stand hat in hand apologizing to the <rs>South</rs> for invading its sacred territory, and almost appearing to want only a proper pretext to retire honorably from the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1197"/>But by the time that the <rs n="Peninsular Campaign" type="campaign">Peninsular Campaign</rs> was brought to a close this kid-glove handling of the enemy had come to an end, and the wandering shote, the hen-roosts, the <rs>Virginia</rs> fence and the straw stack came to be regarded in a sense as perquisites of the <rs>Union</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1198"/>Punishments for appropriating them after this time were much rarer, and the difficulty of finding the culprits increased, as the officers were becoming judiciously near-sighted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1199"/><hi rend="italics">Drumming out of camp</hi> was a punishment administered for cowardice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1200"/>Whenever a man's courage gave out in the face <figure id="fig.155"> 
<head>Drumming out of camp.</head></figure> of the enemy, at the earliest opportunity after the battle, he was stripped of his equipments and uniform, marched through the camp with a guard on either side and <num value="4">four</num> soldiers following behind him at <quote>charge bayonets,</quote> while a <pb id="p.156" n="156"/> fife and drum corps brought up the rear, droning out the <quote>Rogue's march.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1201"/>He was sure of being hooted and jeered at throughout the whole camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1202"/>There were no restraints put upon the language of his recent associates, and their vocabularies were worked up to their full capacity in reviling him. After he had been thoroughly shown off to the entire command, he was marched outside the lines and set free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1203"/>This whole performance may seem at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thought a very light punishment for so grave an offence, and an easy escape from the service for such men. But it was considered a most disgraceful punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1204"/>No man liked to be called a <hi rend="italics">coward</hi>, much less to be turned out of the army in that disreputable way, and the facts recorded on his regimental roll side by side with the honorable record of his fellows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1205"/>He was liable to the death penalty if found in camp afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1206"/>Many more men deserved this punishment than ever received it. There were very few soldiers put out of the service by this method.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1207"/>Sometimes an officer was assaulted by a private soldier or threatened by him. For all such offences soldiers were tried by court-martial, and sentenced to the guard-house <figure id="fig.156"> 
<head>Tied up by the thumbs.</head></figure> or to hard labor at the <rs>Rip Raps</rs> or the <rs>Dry Tortugas</rs>, with loss of pay; or to wear a ball and chain attached to their ankles for a stated period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1208"/>These offences were often committed under the influence of liquor, but frequently through temper <pb id="p.157" n="157"/> or exasperation at continued and unreasonable exactions, as the victim believed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1209"/>The penalty for sleeping at <num value="1">one</num>'s post, that is, when it was a post of danger, was death; but whether this penalty was ever enforced in our Army I am unable to state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1210"/>There is a very touching story of a young soldier who was pardoned by <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0006.0009.00157.00133" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:3"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> for this offence, through the pitiful intercession of the young man's mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1211"/>Whether it was a chapter from real life, I am in doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1212"/>I certainly never heard of a sentinel being visited with this extreme penalty for this offence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1213"/>The penalty attaching to desertion is death by shooting, and this was no uncommon sight in the army; but it did not seem to stay the tide of desertion in the least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1214"/>I have seen it stated that there was no time in the history of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>, after its organization by <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0006.0009.00157.00134" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,Antietam,,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, when it reported less than <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> its full membership as absent without leave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1215"/>The general reader will perhaps be interested in the description of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> execution of a deserter that I ever witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1216"/>It took place about the middle of <dateStruct value="1863-10-"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1228"/>When the slow and solemn round had been completed, the <pb id="p.159" n="159"/> prisoner was seated on an end of his coffin, which had been placed in the centre of the open end of the rectangle, near Ills grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1229"/>The chaplain then made a prayer, and addressed a few words to the condemned man, which were not audible to any <num value="1">one</num> else, and followed them by another brief prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1230"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">provost-marshal</rs> next advanced, bound the prisoner's eyes with a handkerchief, and read the <rs n="General Order" type="misc">general order</rs> for the execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1231"/>He then gave the signal for the shooting party to execute their orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1232"/>They did so, and a soul passed into <figure id="fig.159"> 
<head>Death of A deserter.</head></figure> eternity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1233"/>Throwing his arms convulsively into the air, he fell back upon his coffin but made no further movement, and a surgeon who stood near, upon examination, found life to be extinct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1234"/>The division was then marched past the corpse, off the field, and the sad scene was ended. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1235"/>I afterwards saw a deserter from the <orgName type="division" n="Division 1">First Division</orgName> of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2">Second Corps</orgName> meet his end in the same way, down before <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, in the summer of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1236"/>These were the only exhibitions of this sort that I ever witnessed, although there were others that took place not far from my camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1237"/>The artillery was brigaded by itself in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, and artillerymen <pb id="p.160" n="160"/> were not then compelled to attend executions which took place in the infantry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1238"/>Here is a story of another deserter and spy, who was shot in or near <placeName key="tgn,7012924" n="1.000 259" reg="indianapolis, marion, indiana">Indianapolis</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1239"/>He had enlisted in the <orgName type="regiment" key="71INInfantry">Seventy-First Indiana Infantry</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1240"/>Not long afterwards he deserted and went over to the enemy, but soon reappeared in the <rs>Union</rs> lines as a Rebel spy. While in this capacity he was captured and taken to the headquarters of <persName n="Carrington,General,Henry,B.,," id="n0006.0009.00160.00138" reg="default:Carrington,Henry,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Carrington</surname></persName>, who was then in command of this military district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1241"/>He indignantly protested his innocence of the charge, but a thorough search for evidence of his treachery was begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1242"/>His coat was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> taken and cut into narrow strips and carefully scrutinized, to assure that it contained nothing suspicious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1243"/><num value="1">One</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, the rest of his garments were examined and thrown aside, until at last he stood naked before his captors with no evidence of his guilt having been discovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1244"/>He was then requested to don a suit of clothes that was brought in. This he did, and then triumphantly demanded his release.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1245"/>But the <rs>General</rs> told him to keep cool, as the search was not yet completed; that full justice should be done him whether guilty or innocent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1246"/>Taking up the trousers again, the <rs>General</rs> noticed that <num value="1">one</num> of the spring-bottoms was a little stiffer than the other, and on further investigation with his scissors, sure enough, carefully sewed in under the buckram, found a pass from the <rs>Rebel</rs> <persName n="Smith,General,Kirby,,," id="n0006.0009.00160.00139" reg="default:Smith,Kirby,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Kirby</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1247"/>At this discovery the culprit dropped on his knees, and begged for his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1248"/>He was tried by court-martial, and sentenced to be hanged-hanging is the penalty for treason, shooting being considered too honorable a death for traitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1249"/>But <persName n="Carrington,General,,,," id="n0006.0009.00160.00140" reg="nearbymention:Carrington,Henry,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Carrington</surname></persName>, wishing the influence of the execution to be exerted as a check against desertion, which was very common, decided that he should be shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1250"/>It is customary to detail the shooting squad from the company to which the deserter belongs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1251"/>But so enraged were the members of this man's company at his offence that they sent a <pb id="p.161" n="161"/> <hi rend="italics">unanimous</hi> request that the entire company might act as firing party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1252"/>This request was refused, however, and a detail of <num value="15">fifteen</num> men made for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1253"/>But whereas it is usual for the sergeant in charge of such a detail to load the muskets himself, putting blank cartridges into <num value="1">one</num>, <num value="2">two</num>, or <num value="3">three</num> of the muskets, on this occasion the men were allowed to load for themselves, and when the surgeon examined the lifeless body he found <hi rend="italics"><num value="15">fifteen</num> bullets</hi> in it, showing that each <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="15">fifteen</num> men had felt it to be his duty to shoot his former comrade, and that he had conscientiously acted up to that duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1254"/>Shocking and solemn as such scenes were, I do not believe that the shooting of a deserter had any great deterring ilfluence on the rank and file; for the opportunities to get away safely were most abundant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1255"/>Indeed, any man who was base enough to desert his flag could almost choose his time for doing it. The wife of a man in my own company brought him a suit of citizen's clothing to desert in, which he availed himself of later; but citizen's clothes, even, were not always necessary to ensure safety for deserters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1256"/>When a man's honor failed to hold him in the ranks, his exit from military life in the <rs>South</rs> was easy enough. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1257"/>I have been asked if all deserters captured were shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1258"/>No; far from it. There were times in the war when the death penalty for this offence was entirely ignored, and then it would be revived again with the hope of diminishing the rapid rate at which desertions took place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1259"/>Desertion was the most prevalent in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, when the town and city governments hired so many foreigners, who enlisted solely to get the large bounties paid, and then deserted, many of them before getting to the field, or immediately afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1260"/>They had no interest in the cause, and could not be expected to have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1261"/>These men were called bounty-jumpers, and, having deserted, went to some other State and enlisted again, to secure another bounty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1262"/>In this manner many of them obtained hundreds of dollars without being detected; but <pb id="p.162" n="162"/> many more were apprehended, and suffered for it. I knew of <num value="3">three</num> such being shot at <num value="1">one</num> time, each having taken <num value="3">three</num> bounties before they were finally captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1263"/>The greater part of these bounty-jumpers came from <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1264"/>A large number of reliable troops were necessary to take these men from the recruiting rendezvous to the various regiments which they were to join. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1265"/>The mass of recaptured deserters were put to hard labor on <orgName n="Government works" type="works">government works</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1266"/>Others were confined in some penitentiary, to work out their unexpired term of service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1267"/>I believe the penitentiary at <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName> was used for this purpose, as was also the <rs type="place">Old Capitol Prison</rs> in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1268"/>Many more were sent to the <rs>Rip Raps</rs>, near <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1269"/>On the <dateStruct value="1865-03-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year>1865</year>,</dateStruct> <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0006.0009.00162.00141" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:3"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> issued a proclamation offering full pardon to all deserters who should return to their respective commands within <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure>, that is, before <dateStruct value="1865-05-10"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="10">10</day>, <year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, with the understanding that they should serve out the full time of their respective organizations, and make up all time lost as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1270"/>A large number whose consciences had given them no peace since their lapse, availed themselves of this proclamation to make amends as far as possible, and leave the service with a good name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1271"/>This act was characteristic of the <rs>Emancipator</rs>'s matchless magnanimity and forgiving spirit, but scarcely deserved by the parties having most at stake. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1272"/>I have already intimated that death by hanging was a punishment meted out to certain offences against military law. <num value="1">One</num> of these offences was desertion to the enemy, that is, going from our army over to the enemy, and enlisting in his ranks to fight on that side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1273"/>In the autumn of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>--near <placeName reg="Fort Welch">Fort Welch</placeName>, I think it was &mdash; I saw <num value="3">three</num> military criminals hanged at the same moment, from the same gallows, for this crime against the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1274"/>They were members of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 6">Sixth Corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1275"/>There was less ceremony about this execution than that of the deserter, whose end I more fully described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1276"/>The condemned men were all foreigners, <pb id="p.163" n="163"/> and rode to the gallows in an ambulance attended by a chaplain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1277"/>The ambulance was well guarded in front, in rear, and on the flanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1278"/>The gallows also was strongly guarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1279"/>If I recollect aright, the troops were not ordered out to witness the spectacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1280"/>Nevertheless, <num value="1000">thousands</num> of them from adjoining camps lined the route, and, standing around the gallows, saw the prisoners meet their fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1281"/>No loyal heart gave them any sympathy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1282"/>In <dateStruct value="1864-04-"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, I saw a man hanged for a different offence, on the plains of <placeName key="tgn,2114382" n="1.000 36" reg="stevensburg, culpeper, virginia">Stevensburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1283"/>He belonged to the <orgName type="division" n="division 2">second division</orgName> of my own corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1284"/>Most of the corps, which was then <num value="27000">twenty-seven thousand</num> strong, must have witnessed the scene, from near or afar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1285"/>In hanging the culprit the provost-marshal made a dreadful botch of the job, for the rope was too long, and when the drop fell the man's feet touched the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1286"/>This obliged the <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">provost-marshal</rs> to seize the rope, and by main strength to hold him clear of the ground till death ensued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1287"/>It is quite probable that strangulation instead of a broken neck ended his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1288"/>His body was so light and emaciated that it is doubtful if, even under more favorable circumstances, his fall could have broken his neck. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1289"/>The report of the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</rs>, made in <dateStruct value="1870--"><year reg="1870">1870</year></dateStruct>, shows that there were <num value="121">one hundred and twenty-one</num> men executed during the war &mdash; a very insignificant fraction of those who, by military law, were liable to the death penalty. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1293"/>A partial description of the daily of the rank and file of the army in the monotony of camp life, more especially as it was lived during the years <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, &lsquo;<num value="62">62</num>, and &lsquo;<num value="63">63</num>, covers the subjectmatter treated in this chapter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1294"/>I do not expect it to be all new to the outside public even, who have attended the musters of the <rs>State</rs> militia, and have witnessed something of the routine that is followed there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1295"/>This routine was the same in the <rs>Union</rs> armies in many respects, only with the latter there was a reality about the business, which nothing but stern war can impart, and which therefore makes soldiering comparatively uninteresting in State camp &mdash; such, at least, is the opinion of old campaigners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1296"/>The private soldiers in every arm of the service had many experiences in common in camp life, so that it will not be profitable to describe each in detail, but where the routine differs I shall be more entertaining and exact by adhering to the branch with which I am the most familiar, <hi rend="italics">viz</hi>.: the light <pb id="p.165" n="165"/> artillery; and this I shall do, and, in so doing, shall narrate not the routine of my own company alone, but essentially of that branch of the service throughout the army as artillerymen saw and lived it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1297"/>Beginning the army day, then, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> bugle-call blown was <num value="1">one</num> known in artillery tactics as the <hi rend="italics">Assembly of Buglers</hi>, to sound which the corporal or sergeant of the guard would call up the bugler.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1298"/><figure id="fig.165"> 
<head>Assembly of Buglers (artillery).</head></figure> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1299"/>It was sounded in summer about <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time>, and in winter at <num value="6">six</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1300"/>It was the signal to the men to get out of their blankets and prepare for the morning roll-call, known as <hi rend="italics">Reveille</hi>. At this signal, the hum of life could be heard within the tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1301"/><quote>Put the bugler in the guard-house!</quote> --<quote>Turn out!</quote> --<quote>All up!</quote> --and other similar expressions, mingled with yawns, groans, and exclamations of deep disgust, formed a part of the response to this always unwelcome summons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1302"/>But as only the short space of <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure> was to intervene before the next call, the <hi rend="italics">Assembly</hi>, would be blown, the men had to bestir themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1303"/>Most of them would arise at once, do the little dressing that was required, and perform or omit their toilet, according to the inclination or habit or time of the individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1304"/><pb id="p.166" n="166"/> </p> 
<p>A common mode of washing was for <num value="1">one</num> man to pour water from a canteen into the hands of his messmate, and thus take turns; but this method was practised most on the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1305"/>In settled camp, some men had a short log scooped out for a washbasin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1306"/>Some were not so particular about being washed every day, and in the morning would put the time required for the toilet into another <quote>turn over</quote> and nap. As such men always <figure id="fig.166"> 
<head>A canteen wash.</head></figure> slept with their full uniform on, they were equivalent to a kind of Minute Men, ready to take the field for rollcall, or any other call, at a minute's notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1307"/><figure id="fig.166.1"> 
<head>Assembly (artillery).</head></figure> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1308"/>As soon as the <name>Assembly</name> sounded, the sight presented was quite an interesting <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1309"/>The men could be seen emerging from their tents or huts, their toilet in various stages of completion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1310"/>Here was a man with <num value="1">one</num> boot on, and the other in his hand; here, <num value="1">one</num> with his clothes buttoned <pb id="p.167" n="167"/> in skips and blouse in hand, which he was putting on as he went to the line; here was <num value="1">one</num> with a blouse on; there, <num value="1">one</num> with his jacket or overcoat (unless uniformity of dress on line was required &mdash; it was not always at the morning roll-calls, and in some companies never, only on inspections). Here and there was a man just about half awake, <figure id="fig.167"> 
<head>Fall in for roll-call.</head></figure> having a fist at each eye, and looking as disconsolate and forsaken as men usually do when they get from the bed before the public at short notice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1311"/>Then, this roll-call was always a powerful cathartic on a large number, who must go at once to the sinks, and let the <rs>Rebel</rs> army wait, if it wanted to fight, until their return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1312"/>The exodus in that direction at the sounding of the assembly was really quite a feature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1313"/>All enlisted men in a company, except the guard and sick, must be present at this rollcall, unless excused for good reasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1314"/>But as the shirks always took pride in dodging it, their notice of intention to be absent from it for any reason was looked at askance by the sergeants of detachments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1315"/>The studied agony that these men would work not only into their features but their <pb id="p.168" n="168"/> voice and even their gait would have been ludicrous in the extreme, if frequent repetitions had not rendered it disgusting; and the humorous aspect of these dodgers was not a little enhanced by the appearance which they usually had of having been dressed much as is a statue about to be dedicated, which, at the signal, by the pulling of a single cord, is instantly stripped of all its drapery and displayed in its full glory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1316"/>Other touches, which old soldiers <hi rend="italics">not</hi> artillerymen would readily recognize as familiar, might be added to the scene presented in camp, when the bugle or the drum called the men into line for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in the day. When at last the line was formed, it was dressed by the orderly,--now called, I believe, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sergeant,--and while at <quote>Parade rest</quote> the bugles blew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1317"/><figure id="fig.168"> 
<head>Reveille.</head></figure> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1318"/>There were words improvised to many of these calls, which I wish I could accurately remember.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1319"/>Those adapted to Reveille, in some regiments, ran as follows:-- <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1320"/></p><lg type="stanza"><l>I can't get 'em up, I can't get 'em up, </l><l>I can't get 'em up, I tell you. </l><l>I can't get 'em up, I can't get 'em up, </l><l>I can't get 'em up at all. </l><l>The corporal's worse than the private, </l><l>The sergeant's worse than the corporal, <pb id="p.169" n="169"/> </l><l>The lieutenant's worse than the sergeant, </l><l>But the captain's worst of all. </l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>I can't get 'em up, I can't get 'em up, </l><l>I can't get 'em up this morning; </l><l>I can't get 'em up, I can't get 'em up, </l><l>I can't get 'em up to-day.</l></lg></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1321"/>These are more appropriate when applied to the infantry, where the call was blown before the men came into line. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1322"/>When the bugle ceased to sound, the orderly-sergeant of a battery said, <quote>Pay attention to roll-call</quote> ; and the roll was called by the <num value="6">six</num> line or duty sergeants, each of whom had charge of <num value="25">twenty-five</num> men, more or less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1323"/>These sergeants then made their report of <quote>all present or accounted for,</quote> or whatever the report was, to the orderly-sergeant, who, in turn, reported to the officer of the day in charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1324"/>If there were no special orders to be issued for fatigue duty, or no checks or rebukes or instructions to be given <quote>for the good of the order,</quote> the line was dismissed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1325"/>Any men who were absent without leave were quite likely to be put on the <rs>Black List</rs> for their temerity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1326"/>Shortly after Reveille, the buglers sounded forth the shrill notes of <figure id="fig.169"> 
<head>Stable call.</head></figure> Here are the words sung to this call:-- <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1327"/></p><lg type="couplet"><l>Go to the stable, as quick as you're able, </l><l>And groom off your horses, and give them some corn; </l><l>For if you don't do it the captain will know it, </l><l>And then you will rue it, as sure as you're born.</l></lg></quote> <pb id="p.170" n="170"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1328"/>This call summoned all the drivers in the company to assemble at the grain pile with their pair of canvas nosebags, where the stable sergeant, so called (his rank was that of a private, though he sometimes put on the airs of a brigadier-general), furnished each with the usual ration of grain, either oats or corn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1329"/>With this forage, and a curry-comb and <figure id="fig.170"> 
<head>At the grain pile.</head></figure> brush, they at once proceeded to the picket rope, where, under the inspection of the <num value="6">six</num> sergeants, supervised also by the officer of the day and orderly, the horses were thoroughly groomed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1330"/>At a given signal, the grooming ceased, and the nose-bags were strapped on. Sometimes the feed was given while the grooming was in progress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1331"/>The only amusing phase of this duty that I now recall, occurred when some luckless cannoneer, who would insist that he did not know the difference between a curry-comb and a curry of mutton, was detailed to minister to the sanitary needs of some poor, unsavory, glanders-infected, or greasy-heeled, or sore-backed, or hoof-rotten brute, that could not be entirely neglected until he was condemned by governmental authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1332"/>Now the cannoneers of a battery, who constituted what was known as the <rs>Gun Detachment</rs>, were an aristocracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1333"/>It is worthy of notice <pb id="p.171" n="171"/> that when artillery companies received their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> outfit of horses, there were always at least <num value="3">three</num> men who wished to be drivers to <num value="1">one</num> who cared to serve as a cannoneer, the prevailing idea among the uninitiated being that a driver's position was a safer place in battle than that of a cannoneer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1334"/>I will only say, in passing this point, that they were much disappointed at its exposures when they came to the reality; but the cannoneers, taking the recognized post of danger from choice, a post whose duties when well executed were the most showy on parade, as well as the most effective in action, upon whose coolness and courage depended the safety not only of their own company but often that of regiments, were nursed by these facts into the belief that they rightfully outranked the rest of the rank and file.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1335"/>The posturings and facial contortions of a cannoneer, therefore, who cherished these opinions, when called upon to perform such a task as I have specified, can readily be imagined; if they cannot, I will only say that they would have excited the risibilities of the most sympathetic heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1336"/>The <num value="4">four</num>-footed patients alluded to were usually assigned to the charge of <quote>Spare men,</quote> that is, men who were neither drivers nor members of the gun detachments, who, by use, had come to fill the situation meekly and gracefully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1337"/>There was <num value="1">one</num> service that a cannoneer <hi rend="italics">would</hi> occasionally condescend to do a driver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1338"/>When the army was on the march, a driver would sometimes get weary of riding and ask a cannoneer to spell him while he stretched his legs; and just to oblige him, you know, the cannoneer would get into the saddle and ride <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure>, but beyond that he kept to his own sphere. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1339"/>Following close upon the completion of stable duties came Breakfast Call, when the men prepared and ate their breakfast, or received their dipper of coffee and other rations from the company cook-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1343"/>In response to this call, some who were whole and needed not a physician, as well as those who were sick, reported at the surgeon's tent for prescriptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1344"/>Much used to be said by the soldiers in regard to the competency or incompetency of army surgeons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1345"/>It was well understood in war time that, even though an examination of fitness was required of surgeons to secure an appointment in the army,--at least in some States,--many charlatans, by some means, received commissions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1346"/>Such an examination had as much value as those the medicine men made of recruits in &lsquo;<num value="64">64</num> and &lsquo;<num value="65">65</num>, for those who have occasion to remember will agree that a sufficient number of men too old or diseased came to the front in those years---no, they did not all get as far as the front &mdash; to fairly stock all the hospitals in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1347"/>A part of this showing must be charged to incompetent physicians, and a part to the strait the government was in for recruits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1348"/>The appointment of incompetent surgeons, on the other hand, is to be condoned in a government sorely pressed for medical assistance, and all too indifferent, in its strait, to the qualifications of candidates. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1349"/>Nothing in this line of remark is to be construed as reflecting on the great mass of army surgeons, who were most assiduous workers, and whose record makes a most creditable chapter in the history of the <rs>Rebellion</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1350"/>There are incompetents in every class. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1351"/>Every soldier who tried to do his duty, and only responded to sick-call when in the direst need, should have received the most skilful treatment to be had; but a strict regard for the facts compels the statement that a large number of those who waited upon the doctor deserved no better treatment than the most ignorant of these men of medicine were likely to administer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1352"/>Yes, there were a few individuals to be found, I believe, in every company in the service, who, to escape guard or fatigue duty, would feign illness, and, if possible, delude the surgeon into believing them proper subjects for his tenderest care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1353"/>Too often they succeeded, <pb id="p.174" n="174"/> and threw upon their own intimate associates the labors of camp, which they themselves were able to perform, and degraded their bodies by swallowing drugs, for the ailments to which they laid claim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1354"/>I can see to-day, after a lapse of more than <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>, these <quote>beats on the government</quote> emerging from their tents at sick-call in the traditional army overcoat, with <num value="1">one</num> hand tucked into the breast, the collar up, cap drawn down, <num value="1">one</num> <figure id="fig.174">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1356"/></p> 
<p>Sometimes the surgeons were shrewd enough to read the frauds among the patients, in which case they often gave them an unpalatable but harmless dose, and reported them back for duty, or, perhaps, reported them back for duty <hi rend="italics">without</hi> prescription, at the same time sending an advisory note to the captain of the company to be on the lookout for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1357"/>It was, of course, a great disappointment <pb id="p.175" n="175"/> to these would-be shirkers to fail in their plans, but some of the more persistent would stick to their programme, and, by refusing food and taking but little exercise, would in a short time make invalids of themselves in reality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1358"/>There were undoubtedly many men in the service who secured admission to the hospitals, and finally their discharge, by this method; and some of these men, by such a course of action, planted the seeds of real diseases, to which they long since succumbed, or from which they are now sufferers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1359"/>I must hasten to say that this is not a burlesque on <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the soldiers who answered to sick-call.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1360"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> forbid! The genuine cases went with a different air from the shams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1362"/>sterling fellows, soldiers to the core, stalwart men when they entered the army, but, overtaken by disease, they would report to sick-call, day after day, hoping for a favorable change; yet, in spite of medicine and the nursing of their messmates, pining away until at last they disappeared &mdash; went to the hospitals, and there died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1363"/>Oh, if such men could only have been sent to their homes before it was too late, where the surroundings were more congenial and comfortable, the nursing tender, and more skilful, because administered by warmer hearts and the more loving hands of mother, wife, or sister, <num value="1000">thousands</num> of these noble souls could have been saved to the government and to their families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1364"/>But it was not to be, and so they wasted away, manfully battling for life against odds, dying with the names of dear ones on their lips, dear ones whose presence at the death-bed was in so many cases impossible, but dying as honorable deaths as if they had gone down <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1366"/>This is <num value="1">one</num> of the saddest pictures that memory brings me from Rebellion days. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1367"/>The proverbial prescription of the average army surgeon was quinine, whether for stomach or bowels, headache or <pb id="p.176" n="176"/> toothache, for a cough or for lameness, rheumatism or fever and ague.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1368"/>Quinine was always and everywhere prescribed with a confidence and freedom which left all other medicines far in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1369"/>Making all due allowances for exaggerations, that drug was unquestionably the popular dose with the doctors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1370"/>After Sick-Call came <hi rend="italics">Water-Call</hi>, or <figure id="fig.176"> 
<head>Watering call,</head></figure> at which the drivers in artillery and the full rank and file of the cavalry repaired to the picket-rope, and, taking their horses, set out to water them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1371"/>This was a very simple and <figure id="fig.176.1"> 
<head>The picket rope.</head></figure> expeditious matter when the army was encamped near a river, as it frequently was; but when it was not, the horses were ridden from <num value="0.5">one-half</num> a mile to <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> before a stream or pond was found adequate to the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1372"/>It was no small matter to provide the animals of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> with water, as can be judged from the following figures: After <persName n="McClellan,,Antietam,,," id="n0006.0010.00176.00145" reg="default:McClellan,Antietam,,,"><foreName>Antietam</foreName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> had about <num value="38800">thirty-eight thousand eight hundred</num> horses and mules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1373"/>When the army <pb id="p.177" n="177"/> crossed the <rs>Rapidan</rs> into the <rs>Wilderness</rs>, in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, there were <num value="56499">fifty-six thousand four hundred and ninety-nine</num> horses and mules in it. Either of these is a large number to provide with water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1374"/>But of course they were not all watered at the same pond or stream, since the army stretched across many miles of territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1375"/>In the summer of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, the problem of water-getting before <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> was quite a serious <num value="1">one</num> for man and beast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/>No rain had fallen for several weeks, and the animals belonging to that part of the army which was at quite a remove from the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James</placeName> and <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox Rivers</placeName> had to be ridden nearly <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> (such was the case in my own company, at least; perhaps others went further) for water, and then got only a warm, muddy, and stagnant fluid that had accumulated in some hollow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1377"/>The soldiers were sorely pressed to get enough to supply their own needs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1378"/>They would scoop out small holes in old water courses, and patiently await a dipperfull of a warm, milky-colored fluid to ooze from the clay, drop by drop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1379"/>Hundreds wandered through the woods and valleys with their empty canteens, barely finding water enough to quench thirst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1380"/>Even places usually dank and marshy became dry and baked under the continuous drought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1381"/>But such a state of affairs was not to be endured a great while by live, energetic Union soldiers; and as the heavens continued to withhold the much needed supply of water, shovels and pickaxes were forthwith diverted from the warlike occupation of intrenching to the more peaceful pursuit of well-digging, it soon being ascertained that an abundance of excellent water was to be had <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="12feet" type="distance">twelve feet</measure> below the surface of the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1382"/>These wells were most of them dug broadest at the top and with shelving sides, to prevent them from caving, stoning a well being obviously out of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1383"/>Oldfashioned well-curbs and sweeps were then erected over them, and man and beast were provided with excellent water in camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1384"/>Fatigue call was the next in regular order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1385"/><pb id="p.178" n="178"/> <figure id="fig.178"> 
<head>Fatigue call (infantry).</head></figure> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1386"/>The artillery were almost never detailed for fatigue duty outside of their own company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1387"/>The only exception now occurring to me was when an <orgName n="Artillery Brigade" type="brigade">artillery brigade</orgName> headquarters was established near by, and an occasional detail was made and sent there for temporary service; but that was all. Our camp fatigue duty consisted in policing or cleaning camp, building stables, or perhaps I should more accurately designate them if I called them shelters, for the horses and mules, burying horses, getting wood and water, and washing gun-carriages and caissons for inspections. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1388"/>This building of horse-shelters was at times no mean or trivial enterprise, and sometimes employed a great many men a great many days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1389"/>When the army was on the march, with no danger impending, the horses were unharnessed and tied to the picket-rope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1390"/>This was a rope about <measure n="200feet" type="distance">two hundred feet</measure> long and <measure n="2inches" type="distance">two inches</measure> in diameter, which, when the battery was drawn up in park, was hitched to the outer hind wheel of a caisson on <num value="1">one</num> flank of the battery, and then carried through the hind wheels and over the ammunition-chests of the intervening caissons and made fast to a hind wheel of the caisson on the other flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1391"/><pb id="p.179" n="179"/> In camp, a different plan was adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1392"/>If it was in the open, a line of posts was set at intervals, such as would keep the rope from sagging low, and to them it was secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/>The earth for <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure> on either side was then thrown up beneath like a well graded street, so as to drain off readily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1394"/>Sometimes the picket was established in the edge of woods, in which case the rope ran from tree to tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1395"/>In summer camp a shelter of boughs was constructed over the picket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1396"/>In winter, a wall of pine-boughs was set up around, to fend off bleak winds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1397"/>Now and then, <num value="1">one</num> was roofed with a thatch of confiscated straw; and I remember of seeing <num value="1">one</num> nearly covered with long clapboard-like shingles, which were rifted out of pine-logs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1398"/>The character and stability of all such structures depended largely upon the skill displayed by regimental and company commanders in devising means to keep men employed, and on the tenure of a company's stay in a place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1399"/>But at this late day I fail to recall a single instance where the men called a meeting and gave public expression to their gratitude and appreciation in a vote of thanks for the kind thoughtfulness displayed by said commanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1400"/>In fact, not this alone but <hi rend="italics">all</hi> varieties of fatigue were accompanied in their doing with no end of growling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1401"/><hi rend="italics">It was</hi> aggravating after several days of exhausting labor, of cutting and carting and digging and paving,--for some of the <quote>high-toned</quote> commanders had the picket paved with cobble-stones,--to have boot-and-saddle call blown, summoning the company away, never to return to that camp, but to go elsewhere and repeat their building operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1402"/>It was the cheapest kind of balm to a company's feelings, where so much of love's &mdash; or rather <hi rend="italics">unwilling</hi>-labor had been lost, to see another company appear, just as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was leaving, and literally enter into the labors of the former, taking quiet and full possession of everything left behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1403"/>Yet such was <num value="1">one</num> of the inevitable concomitants <pb id="p.180" n="180"/> of war, and so used did the men become to such upsettings of their calculations that <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> sufficed, as a rule, to wipe out all yearnings for what so recently had been. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1404"/>I will add a few words in this connection in regard to the mortality of horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1405"/>Those who have not looked into the matter have the idea that actual combat was the chief source of the destruction of horseflesh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1406"/>But, as a matter of fact, that source is probably not to be credited with <hi rend="italics">onetenth</hi> of the full losses of the army in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1407"/>It is to be remembered that the exigencies of the service required much of the brutes in the line of hard pulling, exposure, and hunger, which conspired to use them up very rapidly; but the various diseases to which horses are subject largely swelled the death list.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1408"/>Every few weeks a veterinary surgeon would look over the sick-list of animals, and prescribe for such as seemed worth saving or within the reach of treatment, while others would be condemned, led off, and shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1409"/>To bury these, and those dying without the aid of the bullet, I have shown, was a part of the fatigue duty of artillerymen and cavalrymen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1410"/>The procuring of wood was often a task involving no little labor for all arms of the military service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1411"/>At <placeName reg="Brandy Station, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2110767">Brandy Station, Virginia</placeName>, before the army left there on the <dateStruct value="1864-05-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year>1864</year>,</dateStruct> some commands were obliged to go <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> for it. The inexperienced can leave little idea of how rapidly a forest containing many acres of heavy growth would disappear before an army of <num value="75">seventy-five</num> or a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> men camped in and about it. The scarcity of wood was generally made apparent by this fact, that when an army <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> went into camp trees were cut with the scarf <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> above the ground, but as the scarcity increased these stumps would get chipped down often below a level with the ground. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1412"/>After fatigue call the next business, as indicated by the drum or army bugle, was to respond to <pb id="p.181" n="181"/> <figure id="fig.181"> 
<head>Drill call (infantry).</head></figure> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1413"/>I will anticipate a little by saying that the last drill of any kind in which my own company engaged took place among the hills of <placeName key="tgn,2114382" n="1.000 36" reg="stevensburg, culpeper, virginia">Stevensburg</placeName>, but a day or <num value="2">two</num> before the army started into the <rs>Wilderness</rs> in &lsquo;<num value="64">64</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1414"/>From that time until the close of the war batteries were kept in constant motion, or placed in the intrenchments on siege duty, thus putting battery drill out of the question; such at least was the fact with <orgName n="Light Battery" type="battery">light batteries</orgName> attached to the various <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1415"/>The <orgName type="mil" key="ArtilleryReserve">Artillery Reserve</orgName>, belonging to the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>, may have been an exception to this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1416"/>I have no information in regard to it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1417"/>The artillery, like the infantry, had its squad drill, but, as the marchings and facings were of only trifling importance, there was an insignificant amount of time spent on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1418"/>The drivers were usually exempted from drill of this kind, the cannoneers of the gun detachments doing enough of it to enable them, while drilling the standing-gun drill, so called,--a drill without horses,--to get from line into <pb id="p.182" n="182"/> their respective stations about the gun and limber, and <hi rend="italics">vice versa</hi>. But long after this drill became obsolete and almost forgotten, the men seemed never to be at a loss to find their proper posts whenever there was need of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1419"/>So far as I know, artillerymen never piqued themselves on their skill in marchings by platoons, keeping correct alignment meanwhile, whether to the front, the rear, obliquely, or in wheelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1420"/>Indeed, I remember this part of their schooling as rather irksome to them, regarding it as they did, whether rightfully or wrongfully, as ornamental and not essential.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1421"/>It undoubtedly <hi rend="italics">did</hi> contribute to a more correct military bearing and soldierly carriage of the body, and, in a general way, improved military discipline: but these advantages did not always appear to the average member of the rank and file, and, when they did, were not always appreciated at their worth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1422"/>The drill of light-artillerymen in the school of the piece occupied a considerable time in the early history of each company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1423"/>Before field movements could be undertaken, and carried out either with much variety or success, it was indispensable for the cannoneers and drivers to be fully acquainted with their respective duties; and not only was each man drilled in the duties of his <hi rend="italics">own</hi> post, but in those of every other man as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1424"/>The cannoneers must know how to be drivers, and the drivers must have some knowledge of the duties of cannoneers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1425"/>This qualified a man to fill not only any other place than his own when a vacancy occurred, but another place <hi rend="italics">with</hi> his own if need came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1426"/>This education included a knowledge of the ordinary routine of loading and firing, the ability to estimate distances with tolerable accuracy, cut fuses, take any part in the dismounting and mounting of the piece and carriage, the transfer of limber-chests, the mounting of a spare wheel or insertion of a spare pole, the slinging of the gun under the limber in case a piece-wheel should be disabled; even all the parts of the harness must be known by cannoneer as <pb id="p.183" n="183"/> well as driver, so that by the time a man had graduated from this school he was possessed of quite a liberal military education. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1427"/>Doing this sort of business over and over again, day after day, got to be quite tedious, but it all helped to pass away the <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>. <num value="1">One</num> part of this instruction was quite interesting, particularly if the exercise was a match against time, or if there was competition between detachments or sections; this was the dismounting and remounting the piece and carriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1428"/>In this operation each man must know his precise place, and fit into it as accurately as if he were a part of a machine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1429"/>This was absolutely necessary, in order to secure facility and despatch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1430"/>In just the measure that he realized and lived up to this duty, did his gun detachment succeed in reducing the time of the exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1431"/><num value="1">One</num> gun's crew in my company worked with such speed, strength, unanimity, and precision, that they reduced the time for performing this manoeuvre, including loading and firing, to <measure n="49seconds" type="date">forty-nine seconds</measure>. Other batteries may have done even better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1432"/>The guns we then used were the steel <rs>Rodmans</rs>, weighing something over <measure n="800l." type="pounds"><num value="800">eight hundred</num> pounds</measure>, and <num value="4">four</num> of us could toss them about pretty much at will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1433"/>I say <num value="4">four</num> of us, because just <num value="4">four</num> were concerned in the lifting of the gun. We could not have handled the brass Napoleons with equal readiness, for they are somewhat heavier. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1434"/>After cannoneers and drivers came to be tolerably familiar with the school of the piece, field manoeuvres with the battery began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1435"/>The signal which announced this bit of <quote>entertainment for man and beast</quote> is known to Army Regulations as <figure id="fig.183"> 
<head>Boots and Saddles,</head></figure> <pb id="p.184" n="184"/> a call whose tones at a later period sent the blood of artillerymen and cavalrymen coursing more rapidly through the veins when it denoted that danger was nigh, and seeking encounter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1436"/>Battery drill was an enterprise requiring ample territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1437"/>When the vicinity of the camp would not furnish it, the battery was driven to some place that would.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1438"/>If cannoneers as a class were more devout than the other members of a <orgName n="Light Artillery" type="artillery">light-artillery</orgName> company, it must have been because they were stimulated early in their military career to pray &mdash; to pray that the limits of the drill-ground should be so contracted that the battery could not be cantered up and down a plain more than half a mile in extent, with cannoneers dismounted and strung along in the rear at intervals varying with their running capacity or the humor of the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs>; or, if mounted, clutching at the handles or edge of the limber-chest, momently expecting to be hurled headlong as the carriages plunged into an old sink or tent ditch or the gutter of an old company street, or struck against a stump or stone with such force as to shake the ammunition in the chests out of its packing, making it liable to explode from the next concussion-at least so feared the more timid of the cannoneers, when their fears of being thrown off were quieted so that they could think of anything else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1439"/>On such occasions they appreciated the re-enforced trousers peculiar to artillerymen, and wished government had been even more liberal in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1440"/>But this mental state of timidity soon wore off, and the men came to feel more at home while mounted on these noisiest and hardest-riding of vehicles; or else sulked in the rear, with less indifference to consequences. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1441"/>Notwithstanding the monotony that came of necessity to be inseparable from them, battery drills were often exhilarating occasions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1442"/>It was in the nature of things for them to be so, as when the artillery in action moved at all it must needs move promptly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1443"/>A full <num value="6">six</num>-gun battery going across <pb id="p.185" n="185"/> a plain at a trot is an animated spectacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1444"/>To see it quietly halted, then, at the command, <quote>Fire to the rear.--<placeName reg="Caissons pass">Caissons pass</placeName> your pieces-trot-march.--In Battery,</quote> break into moving masses, is a still more animated and apparently confused scene, for horses and men seem to fly in all directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1445"/>But the apparent confusion is only brief, for in a moment the guns are seen unlimbered in line, the cannoneers at their posts, and the piece-limbers and caissons aligned at their respective distances in the rear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1446"/>There was an excitement about this turmoil and despatch which I think did not obtain in any other branch of the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1447"/>The rattle and roar was more like that which is heard in a cotton-factory or machine-shop than anything else with which I can compare it. The drill of a <orgName n="Light Battery" type="battery">light battery</orgName> possessed much interest to outsiders, when well done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1448"/>It was not unusual, when the drill-ground was in proximity to an infantry camp, for the men to look on by hundreds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1449"/>To see <num value="6">six</num> cannons, with their accompanying <num value="6">six</num> caissons, sped by <num value="72">seventy-two</num> horses across the plain at a lively pace, the cannoneers either mounted or in hot pursuit, suddenly halt at the bugle signal, and in a moment after appear <quote>In battery</quote> belching forth mimic thunder in blank cartridge at a rapid rate, and in the next minute <quote>limbered up</quote> and away again to another part of the field, was a sight full of interest and spirit to the unaccustomed beholder; and if, as sometimes happened, there was a company of cavalry out on drill, to engage in a sham fight with the battery, a thrilling and exciting scene ensued, which later actual combats never superseded in memory; for while the cavalry swept down on the guns at a gallop, with sabres flashing in the air, the cannoneers with guns loaded with blank cartridges, of course, stand rigid as death awaiting the onset, until they are within a few rods of the battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1450"/>Then the lanyards are pulled, and the smoke, belched suddenly forth, completely envelops both parties to the bloodless fray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1451"/><pb id="p.186" n="186"/> </p> 
<p>As the drilling of a battery was done for the most part by sounding the commands upon a bugle, it became necessary for cannoneers and drivers to learn the calls; and this they did after a short experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1452"/>Even the horses became perfectly familiar with some of these calls, and would proceed to execute them without the intervention of a driver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1453"/>Cavalry horses, too, exhibited great sagacity in interpreting bugle signals. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1454"/>Sometimes the lieutenants who were chiefs of sections were sent out with their commands for special drill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1455"/>A section comprised <num value="2">two</num> guns with their caissons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1456"/>There was little enthusiasm in this piecemeal kind of practice, especially after familiarity and experience in the drill of the full battery; but it performed a part in making the men selfpossessed and expert in their special arm of the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1457"/>Beyond that, it gave men and horses exercise, and appetite for government food, which, without the exercise, would have been wanting, to a degree at least, and occupied time that would otherwise have been devoted to the soldier's pastime of grumbling. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1458"/>At <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time> the <hi rend="italics">Dinner Call</hi> was sounded.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1460"/>I can add nothing of interest here beyond what I have already presented in my talk on rations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1461"/>There was nothing in the regular line of duty in <orgName n="Light Artillery" type="artillery">light artillery</orgName> for afternoons which could be called routine, although there was more or less standing-gun drill for cannoneers early in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1462"/>In the infantry, battalion drill often occupied the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1463"/>The next regular call for a battery was <hi rend="italics">Water Call</hi>, sounded at <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time>, or perhaps a little later.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1464"/>On the return of the horses <hi rend="italics">Stable Call</hi> was again blown, and the duties of the morning, under this call, repeated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1465"/>At about <time value="5:45pm">5.45 P. M.</time>, <hi rend="italics">Attention</hi> was blown, soon to be followed by the <hi rend="italics">Assembly</hi>, when the men fell in again for <hi rend="italics">Retreat</hi> roll-call.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1466"/><figure id="fig.187"> 
<head>Retreat.</head></figure> <pb id="p.188" n="188"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1467"/>The music for this was arranged in <num value="3">three</num> parts, and when there were <num value="3">three</num> bugles to blow it the effect was quite pleasing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1468"/>The name <hi rend="italics">Retreat</hi> was probably given this call because <figure id="fig.188"> 
<head>Going to water.</head></figure> it came when there was a general retiring from the duties of the day. This roll-call corresponded with the <hi rend="italics">Dress Parade</hi> of the infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1469"/>Uniformity of dress was a necessity at this time with the latter, and quite generally too in the artillery; but the commanders of batteries differed widely in taste and military discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1470"/>A company of soldiers was what its captain made it. Some were particular, others were not, but all should have been in this matter of dress for at least <num value="1">one</num> roll-call in the day. At this parade all general orders were read, with charges, specifications, and findings of courtsmartial, etc., so that the name of <persName n="Townsend,,E.,D.,," id="n0006.0010.00188.00146" reg="expanded:Townsend,Edward,D.,,"><foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Townsend</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Adjutant General">Assistant Adjutant-General</rs>, became a household word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1471"/>At this time, too, lectures on the shortcomings of the company were in order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1472"/>The lecturer employed by the government to do this was usually the officer of the day, though now and then the captain would spell him. A lecturer of this kind had <num value="2">two</num> great advantages over a lecturer in civil life; <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, he was always sure of an audience, and, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, he could <pb id="p.189" n="189"/> hold their attention to the very close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1473"/>None of them left while the lecture was in progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1474"/>Now and then an orderly-sergeant would try his hand in the lecture field, but unless he was protected by the presence of a pair of shoulder-straps he was quite likely to be coughed or groaned down, or in some other way discouraged from repeating the effort. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1475"/>The shortcomings alluded to were of a varied character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1476"/>I think I mentioned some of them in the chapter on punishments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1477"/>Sometimes the text was the general delinquency of the men in getting into line; sometimes it was a rebuke for being lax in phases of discipline; the men were not sufficiently respectful to superior officers, did not pay the requisite attention to <hi rend="italics">saluting</hi>, had too much <hi rend="italics">back talk</hi>, were <hi rend="italics">too boisterous in camp, too untidy in line</hi>. These, and <num value="20">twenty</num> other allied topics, all having a bearing on the characteristics essential in the make &mdash; up of a good soldier, were preached upon with greater or less unction and frequency, as circumstances seemed to require, or the standard in a given company demanded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1478"/>After the dismission of the line, guard-mounting took place but this in the artillery was a very simple matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1479"/>The guard at once formed on the parade line were assigned to their reliefs, and dismissed till wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1480"/>Sometimes the guard-mounting took place in the morning, as did that of the infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1481"/>The neatest and most soldierly appearing guardsman was selected as captain's orderly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1482"/>But guardmounting in <orgName n="Light Artillery" type="artillery">light artillery</orgName> was not always thus simple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1483"/><placeName reg="Camp Barry">Camp Barry</placeName>, near <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, was used as a school of instruction for <orgName n="Light Battery" type="battery">light batteries</orgName>, for a period of at least <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>. During the greater part of this time there were <num value="10">ten</num> or a dozen batteries there on an average.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1484"/>Under <num value="1">one</num> of its commandants, at least, a brigade guard-mounting was held at <time value="8am">eight o'clock A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1485"/><pb id="p.190" n="190"/> <figure id="fig.190"> 
<head>Assembly of guard.</head></figure> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1486"/>The infantry bugle-call for the same purpose was more familiar, as it was heard daily for months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1487"/>It ran as follows:-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1488"/>This call was immediately followed by other music, either a <orgName n="Brass Band" type="band">brass band</orgName> or a fife-and-drum corps, to which the details from the various companies marched out on to the colorline, where the usual formalities ensued, such in substance as may be seen at a muster to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1489"/>The guard necessary in a single company of artillery was so small that the call with the bugle was rarely if ever sounded, at least in volunteer companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1490"/>A detail of cannoneers stood guard over the guns night and day, and over the cook-house and quartermaster's stores at night, and sometimes there was <num value="1">one</num> posted in front of company headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1491"/>A detail of drivers, also, went on duty at night at the picket-rope, to assure that the horses were kept tied and not stolen by marauding cavalrymen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1492"/>In the safe rear, where, as the men used to say, the officers were wont to sit up late at night burning out government candles, while they devised ways and means to keep the men exercised as well as exorcised, a guard tent was pitched in front of the camp, in which the guard were compelled to <pb id="p.191" n="191"/> stay when off post, much to their disgust sometimes; but when the company or regiment was in line along the glorious front, that unpopular lodging-house was abandoned, and each guardsmen slept in his own quarters, on his own army <rs n="feather bed" type="product">feather-bed</rs>, whither the corporal of the guard must come for his victim in the silent hours when that victim was wanted to go on post. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1493"/>With the infantry, guard-mounting took place in the morning at <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time>. The guard was divided into <num value="3">three</num> equal portions, called reliefs, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1494"/>each relief being on post <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> and off <num value="4">four</num>, thus serving <measure n="8hours" type="date">eight hours</measure> out of the <num value="24">twenty-four</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1495"/>With all the irksomeness of the detail, the guardsman enjoyed a temporary triumph as such, for on that day, at least, he could snap his fingers at roll-calls and all calls for fatigue duty &mdash; in short, was an independent gentleman within certain limits. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1496"/>I have stated it to have been the duty of the corporal of the guard to seek out the members of the various reliefs in their quarters, when the time came for them to go on post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1497"/>There was more or less of lively incident attending these explorations &mdash; not, however, with the sanction of the corporal, to whom the liveliness was anything but amusing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1498"/>Your corporal of the guard was up to the average of ordinary officers in intelligence, and, as he was just started on the ladder of promotions, fully intended to do his whole duty at least; and so he was wont to prepare himself for his nightly rounds by obtaining such a knowledge of the local geography of the camp as would enable him to arouse and assemble his guard with the least inconvenience to himself and the least commotion to the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1499"/>But the best laid plans of corporals of the guard would frequently <quote>gang agley,</quote> even though they used every precaution, and so it was the rule rather than the exception for him to get into the wrong tent, and, after waking up all the inmates and getting the profane to swearing, and all to abusing him for his stupid intrusion, to retreat in as good order as possible and try <pb id="p.192" n="192"/> again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1500"/>The next time perhaps he would get into the right <num value="1">one</num>, and, after scrutinizing his list of the guard once more, call out the name of <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n0006.0010.00192.00147" reg="nearbymention:Smith,Joe,,,"><surname>Smith</surname></persName></hi>, for example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1501"/>No answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1502"/><figure id="fig.192"> 
<head>Stockaded <persName n="Sibley,,,,," id="n0006.0010.00192.00148" reg="mostcommon:Sibley,Henry,,,:2"><surname>Sibley</surname></persName> tents.</head></figure> There was a kind of deafness generated in the service, which was almost epidemic among guardsmen, especially night guard; at least, such seemed to be the case, for the man that was wanted to go out and take his post was invariably the last <num value="1">one</num> in the tent to be awakened by the summons of the corporal; and long before that waking moment came, the corporal had as aids on his staff all these self-same inmates who had been victims to the assumed deafness of the man sought, and whose voices now furnished no mean chorus to the corporal's refrain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1503"/>Sometimes, when the knight of the double chevron was a man of retiring and quiet demeanor, he would save his lungs and make an effort to find his man by stepping inside the tent, and flashing the light of his army candle from the open side of his tin lantern upon the features of each of the <pb id="p.193" n="193"/> slumberers until he came to his victim, when he would shake him by the shoulder and arouse him. The only drawback to this method occurred when the reflections of the corporal woke up the wrong man, who, if he happened to be <num value="1">one</num> of those explosive creatures whom I have before mentioned, was not always complimentary to the intruder in his use of language. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1504"/>Once in a while, in making his midnight rounds, when calling the name of <num value="1">one</num> of his guard through the door of the stockade, the corporal would be politely directed by some <num value="1">one</num> from within, perhaps the very man he wanted, to <quote>Next tent below</quote> ; and many a time this officer succeeded in getting such an innocent and unsuspecting household completely by the ears before being convinced of the joke which had been played on him, when he would return to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> tent in no enviable humor; for meanwhile the men to be relieved were chafing and sputtering away at the non-appearance of the corporal and the relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1505"/>I think there was no <num value="1">one</num> minor circumstance which vexed soldiers more than tardy relief from their posts, for every minute that they waited after the expiration of their allotted time seemed to them at least <num value="10">ten</num>; so that the reception which the corporal and relief received when they <hi rend="italics">did</hi> arrive was likely to be far from fraternal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1506"/>Speaking of the corporal of the guard reminds me of a snatch of a song which used to be sung in camp to the tune of <quote>When <persName><foreName>Johnny</foreName></persName> comes marching home.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1507"/>Here is the fragment:-- <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1508"/></p><l>My <persName><foreName>Johnny</foreName></persName> he now a Corporal is!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1509"/></l><l>Hurrah! Hurrah! </l><l>My <persName><foreName>Johnny</foreName></persName> he now a Corporal is, </l><l>You bet he knows his regular biz, </l><l>And we'll all feel gay, etc.</l></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1510"/>At <time value="8:30pm">8.30 P.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1511"/>But this was Tattoo in the artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1512"/>A somewhat more inspiriting call was that of the infantry, which gave the bugler quite full scope as a soloist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1513"/>Here it is:--<pb id="p.195" n="195"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1514"/>Ere the last tone had died away, we could hear, when camped near enough to the infantry for the purpose, a very comical medley of names and responses coming from the several company streets of the various regiments within ear-shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1515"/>It was <quote><persName n="Jones,,,,," id="n0006.0010.00195.00149" reg="mostcommon:Jones,Edward,F.,,:1"><surname>Jones</surname></persName>!</quote> --<quote><persName n="Brown,,,,," id="n0006.0010.00195.00150" reg="nearbymention:Brown,James,,,"><surname>Brown</surname></persName>!</quote> --<quote><persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n0006.0010.00195.00151" reg="nearbymention:Smith,Joe,,,"><surname>Smith</surname></persName>!</quote> --<quote><persName n="Smith,,Joe,,," id="n0006.0010.00195.00152" reg="default:Smith,Joe,,,"><foreName>Joe</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>!</quote> --<quote><persName n="Green,,,,," id="n0006.0010.00195.00153" reg="mostcommon:Green,nomatch:0"><surname>Green</surname></persName>!</quote> --<quote><persName n="Gray,,,,," id="n0006.0010.00195.00154" reg="mostcommon:Gray,nomatch:0"><surname>Gray</surname></persName>!</quote> --<quote><persName n="O'Neil,,,,," id="n0006.0010.00195.00155" reg="mostcommon:O'Neil,nomatch:0"><surname>O'Neil</surname></persName>!</quote> --<quote><persName n="O'Reilly,,,,," id="n0006.0010.00195.00156" reg="nearbymention:O'Reilly,Miles,,,"><surname>O'Reilly</surname></persName>!</quote> --<quote><persName n="O'Brien,,,,," id="n0006.0010.00195.00157" reg="mostcommon:O'Brien,nomatch:0"><surname>O'Brien</surname></persName>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1516"/>and so on through the nationalities, only that the names were intermingled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1517"/>Then, the responses were replete with character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1518"/>I believe it to be among the abilities of a man of close observation to write out quite at length prominent characteristics of an entire company, by noting carefully the manner in which the men answer <quote>Here!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1519"/>at roll-call.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1520"/>Every degree of pitch in the gamut was represented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1521"/>Every degree of force had its exponent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1522"/>Some answered in a low voice, only to tease the sergeant, and <hi rend="italics">roar</hi> out a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> answer when called again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1523"/>There were upward slides and downward slides, guttural tones and nasal tones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1524"/>Occasionally, some <num value="1">one</num> would answer for a messmate, who was absent without leave, and take his chances of being detected in the act. Darkness gave cover to much good-natured knavery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1525"/>Tattoo was blown in artillery with the company at <quote>Parade rest,</quote> as at Reveille.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1526"/>The roll-call and reports followed just as before, and the company was then dismissed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1527"/>Well do I recall, after the lapse of more than <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>, the melodious tones of this little bit of army music coming to our ears so consecutively from various parts of the army as to make continuous vibrations for nearly <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure>, softened and sweetened by varying distances, as more than a <num value="1000">thousand</num> bugles gave tongue to the still and clear evening air, telling us that in the time specified a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> men had come out of their rude temporary homes &mdash; possibly the last ones they would ever occupy &mdash; to respond to their names, and give token that, though Nature's pall had now overshadowed the earth, they were yet loyally at their posts awaiting further orders for their country's service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1528"/><pb id="p.196" n="196"/> </p> 
<p>After this roll-call was over, the men had half an hour in which to make their beds, put on their nightcaps, and adjust themselves for sleep, as at <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> <hi rend="italics">Taps</hi> was sounded, which in the artillery ran as follows:-- <figure id="fig.196"> 
<head>Taps.</head></figure> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/>In the infantry, the bugle-call for Taps was identical with the <name>Tattoo</name> call in artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1530"/>At its conclusion a drummer beat a few single, isolated taps, which closed the army day. At this signal all lights must be put out, all talking and other noises cease, and every man, except the guard, be inside his quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1531"/>In a previous chapter I think I stated that the <rs>Black List</rs> caught the men who violated this regulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1532"/>Some officers enforced it with greater rigidity than others, but all must have a quiet camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1533"/>Yet here, as elsewhere, rank interposed to shield culprits from violations of military regulations, and, while the private soldier was punished for burning his candle or talking to his messmate after the bugle-signal, general, field, staff, or line officers could and did get together and carouse, and make the night turbulent with their revelry into the small hours, with no <num value="1">one</num> to molest or call them to an account for it, although making tenfold the disturbance ever caused by the high private after hours. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/>Taps ended the army day for all branches of the service, and, unless an alarm broke in upon the stillness of the night, the soldiers were left to their slumbers; or, what was oftener the case, to meditations on home; the length of time in months and days they must serve before returning thither; their prospects of surviving the vicissitudes of war; of the <pb id="p.197" n="197"/> boys who once answered roll-call with them, now camped over across the <placeName key="tgn,2275941" n="1.000 10" reg="Dark River, Saint Louis, Minnesota">Dark River</placeName>; or of plans for business, or social relations to be entered upon, if they should survive the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/>Many facts bearing upon the subject of this sketch have been already presented in the opening chapter, but much more remains to be told, and the reader will pardon me, I trust, for now injecting a little bit of personal history to illustrate what <num value="1000">thousands</num> of young men were doing at that time, and had been doing for months, as it leads up directly to the theme about to be considered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/>After I had obtained the reluctant consent of my father to enlist,--my mother never gave hers,--the next step hecessary was to make selection of the organization with which to identify my fortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/>I well remember the to me eventful <dateStruct><month>August</month></dateStruct> evening when that decision to enlist was arrived at. The Union army, then under <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0006.0011.00198.00160" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, had been driven from before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> in the disastrous <rs n="Peninsular Campaign" type="campaign">Peninsular campaign</rs>, and now the <rs>Rebel</rs> army, under <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0006.0011.00198.00161" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, was marching on <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/><persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0006.0011.00198.00162" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:3"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had issued a call for <num value="3">three</num> <pb id="p.199" n="199"/> <num value="100003">hundred thousand three</num>-years' volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/><num value="1">One</num> evening, shortly after this call was made, I met <num value="3">three</num> of my former school-mates and neighbors in the chief village of the town I then called home, and, after a brief discussion of the outlook, <num value="1">one</num> of the quartette challenged, or <quote>stumped,</quote> the others to enlist.. The challenge was promptly accepted all around, and hands were shaken to bind the agreement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>I will add in passing, that <num value="3">three</num> of the <num value="4">four</num> stood by that agreement; the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> was induced by increased wages to remain with his employer, although he entered the service later in the war, and bears a shell scar on his face to attest his honorable service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1541"/>After the decision had been reached, not to be revoked on my part as I fully determined, I returned to my home, and either that night or the next morning informed my father of the resolution I had taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1542"/>Instead of interposing an emphatic objection, as he had done the previous year, he said, in substance, <quote>Well, you know I do not want you to go, but it is very evident that a great many more must go, and if you have fully determined upon it I shall not object.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/></p> 
<p>Having already determined upon the arm of the service which I should enter, accompanied by <num value="3">three</num> other acquaintances of the same opinion, <num value="2">two</num> of them the school-fellows mentioned, I started for <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, with a view of seeing <persName n="Porter,Captain,,,," id="n0006.0011.00199.00163" reg="mostcommon:Porter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName>, who was then at home recruiting for the <orgName type="regiment" key="1MABattery">First Massachusetts Battery</orgName>, which he commanded, and enlisting with him, as there were at least <num value="2">two</num> men in his company who were fellow-townsmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1544"/>But we were much disappointed when the <rs>Captain</rs> informed us that his company was now recruited to the number required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1545"/>However, we directed our steps back to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> without delay, and there, in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> story of the <rs type="place">Old State House</rs>, enlisted in a new organization then rapidly filling. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1555"/>How often in later years did the disappointment I experienced at not obtaining membership in the <orgName type="company" n="Company I">company I</orgName> at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> decided upon recur to me, and how grateful I always felt for the fate which thus controlled my enlistment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1556"/>For the lot of a recruit in an old company was, at the best, not an enviable <num value="1">one</num>, and sometimes was made very disagreeable for him. He stood in much the same relation to the veterans of his company that the <name>Freshman</name> in college does to the <name>Sophomores</name>, or did when hazing was the rule and not the exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1557"/>It is to be remembered that he was utterly devoid of experience in everything which goes to make up the soldier, the details of camping, cooking, drilling, marching, fighting, etc., which put him at a disadvantage on all occasions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1558"/>For this reason he easily became the butt of a large number of his company &mdash; not all, for there were some men who were ever ready to extend sympathy and furnish information to him, when they saw it was needed, and did what they could to raise him to the same general plane occupied by the old members.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1559"/>But many of the veterans seemed to forget how they themselves obtained their army education little by little, and so ofttimes bore down on recruits with great severity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1560"/>In the later years of the war, when large bounties were being paid by town, city, and State governments, to encourage enlistments, these recruits were often addressed as <quote>bounty-jumpers</quote> by the evil disposed among the old members.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1561"/>But that term was a misnomer, unless these men proved later that they were deserving of it, for a bounty-jumper was a man &mdash; I hate to call him <num value="1">one</num>-who enlisted <hi rend="italics">only</hi> to get the bounty, and deserted at the earliest opportunity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1562"/>Recruits, it should be said, as a class, stood the abuse which was heaped upon them with much greater serenity of temper than they should have done, and, indeed, so anxious were they to win favor with the veterans, and to earn the right to be called and pass for old soldiers, <pb id="p.203" n="203"/> that they generally bore indignities without turning upon their assailants, The term <quote>recruit</quote> in the mouth of a veteran was a very reproachful <num value="1">one</num>, but after <num value="1">one</num> good brush with the enemy it was dropped, if the new men behaved well under fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1563"/>In fact, those who abused the recruits most were themselves, as a rule, the most unreliable in action and the greatest shirks when on camp duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1564"/><figure id="fig.203"> 
<head>A wood detail.</head></figure> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1565"/>When a detail made up of recruits and veterans was sent with the wagons for wood, the recruits would be patted on the back by their wily associates, and cajoled into doing most of the chopping, and then challenged to lift the heaviest end of the logs into the wagons, which they seldom refused to do. In the artillery, it usually fell to their lot to care for the spare and used &mdash; up horses, not from any intention of imposing upon them, but because cannoneers and drivers had their regular tasks to perform, and all recruits entering the artillery began as spare men, and worked up from the position of private to that of the highest private &mdash; a cannoneer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1566"/><pb id="p.204" n="204"/> </p> 
<p>They always came to camp <quote>flush</quote> with money, and received every encouragement from the bummers of the company to spend it freely; if they did not do this, they were in a degree ostracised, and their lot made much harder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1567"/>When their boxes of goodies arrived from home, the lion's share went to the old hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1568"/>If the recruit did not give it to them, the meanest of them would steal it when he was away on detail. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1569"/>Then, all sorts of games were played on recruits by men who liked nothing so well as a practical joke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1570"/>I recall the case of a young man in my own company who had just arrived, and, having been to the quartermaster for his outfit of clothing and equipments, was asked by <num value="1">one</num> of the practical jokers why he did not get his umbrella. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1571"/><quote>Do they furnish an umbrella?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1572"/>he asked. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1573"/><quote>Why, certainly,</quote> said his persecutor, unblushingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1574"/><quote>It's just like that fraud of a quartermaster to jew a recruit out of a part of his outfit, to sell for his own benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1575"/>Go back and <hi rend="italics">demand</hi> your umbrella of him, and a good <num value="1">one</num> too!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1576"/></p> 
<p>And the poor beguiled recruit returned to the quartermaster in high dudgeon at the imagined attempt to swindle him, only to find, after a little breeze, that he had been victimized by <num value="1">one</num> of the practical jokers of the camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1577"/>There were at least <num value="2">two</num> kinds of recruits to be found in every squad that arrived in camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1578"/><num value="1">One</num> of these classes was made up of modest, straightforward men, who accepted their new situation with its deprivations gracefully, and brought no sugar-plums to camp with which to ease their entrance into stern life on government fare and the hardships of government service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1579"/>They wore the government clothing as it was furnished them, from the unshapely, uncomely forage cap to the shoddy, inelastic sock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1580"/>It mattered naught to them that the limited stock of the quartermaster furnished nothing that fitted them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1581"/>They accepted what he tendered cheerfully, believing it to be all right, and seemed as happy and as much at ease in a wilderness of <pb id="p.205" n="205"/> overcoat and breeches as others did who had been artistically renovated by the company tailor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1582"/>But they were none the less ludicrous and unsoldierly sights to look upon <figure id="fig.205"> 
<head>Recruits in uniform.</head></figure> in such rigs, and after a while would see themselves as others saw them, and <quote>spruce up</quote> somewhat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1583"/>These men drew their army rations to the full, not slighting the <quote>salt horse,</quote> which I have intimated was rarely taken by old soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1584"/>They found no fault when detailed for fatigue duty, were always ready to learn, and in every way seemed anxious only to do the proper thing to be done, hoping by such a course to win a speedy and easy ascent to the plane of importance occupied by the veterans; and this course undoubtedly did much to give them caste in the eyes of the latter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1585"/>Unlike these men in many particulars was the other class of recruits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1586"/>This latter class was not modest or retiring in demeanor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1587"/>Its members came to camp in a uniform calculated to provoke impertinent remarks from the old vets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1588"/>Their caps were from the store of a professional hatter, and the numbers and emblem on the crown were of silver and gilt instead of homely brass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1589"/>Their clothing was generally <pb id="p.206" n="206"/> custom-made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1590"/>The pantaloons in particular were not only made to fit well, but were of the finest material obtainable, much unlike the government shoddy which covered the old veteran, and through whose meshes peas of ordinary calibre would almost rattle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1591"/>Then, their boots!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1592"/>such masterpieces of elegance and extravagance!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1593"/>Of the cavalry pattern, reaching above the knee, almost doing away with the necessity for pantaloons, sometimes of plain grained leather, sometimes of enamelled, elaborately stitched and stamped, but always seeming to mark their occupant as a man of note and distinction among his comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1594"/>They seemed a sort of fortification about their owner, protecting him from too close contact with his vulgar surroundings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1595"/>Alas! it never required more than <num value="1">one</num> day's hard march in these dashing appendages to humble their possessor so much that he would evacuate in as good order as possible when camp was reached, if not compelled to before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1596"/>Their underwear was such as the common herd did not use in service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1597"/>Their shirts were <quote>boiled,</quote> that is, white ones, or, if woollen, were of some <quote>loud</quote> checkered pattern, only less conspicuous than the flag which they had sworn to defend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1598"/>In brief, their general make &mdash; up would have stamped them as military <quote>dudes,</quote> had such a class of creatures been then extant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1599"/>Of course, it was their privilege to wear whatever did not conflict with Army Regulations, but I am giving the impressions they made on the minds of the old soldiers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1600"/>As for government rations, they scoffed at them so long as there was a dollar of bounty left, and a sutler within reach of camp to spend it with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1601"/>But when the treasury was exhausted they were disconsolate indeed, and wished that the wicked war was over, with all their hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1602"/>On fatigue duty they were useless at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and the old soldiers made their lot an unhappy <num value="1">one</num>; but by dint of bulldozing and an abundance of hard service, most of them got their <pb id="p.207" n="207"/> fine sentimental notions pretty well knocked out before they had been many weeks in camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1603"/>The sergeants into whose hands they were put for instruction did not spare them, keeping them hard at work until the recall from drill. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1604"/>It was fun in the artillery to see <num value="1">one</num> of these dainty men, on his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> arrival, put in charge of a pair of spare horses, -spare enough, too, usually;. It was expected of him that he would groom, feed, and water them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1605"/>As it often happened that such a man had had no experience in the care of horses, he would naturally approach the subject with a good deal of awe. When the <hi rend="italics">Watering Call</hi> blew, therefore, and the bridles and horses were pointed out to him by the sergeant, the fun began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1606"/><figure id="fig.207"> 
<head>A spare man and spare horses,</head></figure> Taking the bridle, he would look <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> at it, then at the horse, as if in doubt which end of him to put it on. In going to water, the drivers always bridled the horse which they rode, and led the other by the halter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1607"/>But our unfledged soldier seemed innocent of all proper information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1608"/>For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day or <num value="2">two</num> he would <hi rend="italics">lead</hi> his charges; then, as his courage grew with acquaintance, he would finally mount the near <num value="1">one</num>, and, with his legs crooked up like a V, cling for dear life until he got his lesson learned in this direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1609"/>But all the time that he was getting initiated he was a ridiculous object to observers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1610"/>The drilling of raw recruits of both the classes mentioned was no small part of the trials that fell to the lot of billeted officers, for they got hold of some of the crookedest sticks to make straight military men of that the country-or, rather, <hi rend="italics">countries</hi>--produced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1611"/>Not the least among the obstacles in the way of making good soldiers of them was <pb id="p.208" n="208"/> the fact that the recruits of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">5</year></dateStruct>, in particular, included many who could neither speak nor understand a word of <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0006.0011.00208.00164" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1612"/>In referring to the disastrous battle of <orgName n="Reams Station" type="station">Reams Station</orgName>, not long since, the late <persName n="Hancock,General,,,," id="n0006.0011.00208.00165" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,Winfield,S.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hancock</surname></persName> told me that the <orgName type="regiment" key="20MARegiment">Twentieth Massachusetts Regiment</orgName> had received an accession of about <num value="200">two hundred</num> <name>German</name> recruits only <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> before the battle, not <num value="1">one</num> of whom could understand the orders of their commanding officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1613"/>It can <figure id="fig.208"> 
<head>Drilling the awkward squad.</head></figure> be easily imagined how much time and patience would be required to mould such subjects as those into intelligent, reliable soldiery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1614"/>But outside of this class there were scores of men that spoke <name>English</name> who would <quote>hay-foot</quote> every time when they should <quote>straw-foot.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1615"/>They were incorrigibles in almost every military respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1616"/>Whenever they were out with a squad &mdash; usually the <quote>awkward squad</quote> --for drill, they made business lively enough for the sergeant in charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1617"/>When they stood in the rear rank their loftiest ambition seemed to be to walk up the backs of their file-leaders, and then they would insist that it was the file-leaders who were out of step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1618"/>Members of the much abused front rank often <pb id="p.209" n="209"/> had occasion to wish that the regulation <measure n="13inches" type="distance">thirteen inches</measure> from breast to back might be extended to as many feet; but when the march was backward in line, these front rank men would get square with their persecutors in the rear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1619"/>To see such men attempt to change step while marching was no mean show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1620"/>I can think of nothing more apt to compare it with than the game of Hop Scotch, in which the player hops <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> on <num value="1">one</num> foot, then on both; or to the blue jay, which, in uttering <num value="1">one</num> of its notes, jumps up and down on the limb; and if such a squad under full headway were surprised with a sudden command to halt, they went all to pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1621"/>It was no easy task to align them, for each man had a line of his own, and they would crane their heads out to see the buttons on the breast of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> man, to such an extent that the sergeant might have exclaimed, with the <name>Irish</name> sergeant under like circumstances, <quote>O be-gorra, what a bint row!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1622"/>Come out here, lads, and take a look at yoursels!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1623"/></p> 
<p>The awkward squad excelled equally in the infantry manual-of-arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1624"/>Indeed, they displayed more real individuality here, I think, than in the marchings, probably because it was the more noticeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1625"/>At a <quote>shoulder</quote> their muskets pointed at all angles, from <num value="45">forty-five</num> degrees to a vertical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1626"/>In the attempt to change to a <quote>carry,</quote> a part of them would drop their muskets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1627"/>At an <quote>order,</quote> no <num value="2">two</num> of the butts reached the ground together, and if a man could not always drop his musket on his <hi rend="italics">own</hi> toe he was a pretty correct shot with it on the toe of his neighbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1628"/>But, with all their awkwardness and slowness at becoming acquainted with a soldier's duties, the recruits of the earlier years in time of need behaved manfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1629"/>They made a poor exhibition on dress parade, but could generally be counted on when more serious work was in hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1630"/>Sometimes, when they made an unusually poor display on drill or parade, they were punished-unjustly it may have been, for what <pb id="p.210" n="210"/> they could not help &mdash; by being subjected to the knapsack drill, of which I have already spoken. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1631"/>It was a prudential circumstance that the war came to an end when it did, for the quality of the material that was sent to the army in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct> was for the most part of no credit or value to any arm of the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1632"/>The period of enlistments from promptings of patriotism had gone by, and the man who entered the army solely from mercenary motives was of little or no assistance to that army when it was in need of valiant men, so that the chief burden and responsibility of the closing wrestle for the mastery necessarily fell largely on the shoulders of the men who bared their breasts for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, &lsquo;<num value="62">62</num>, and &lsquo;<num value="63">63</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1633"/>I have thus far spoken of a recruit in the usual sense of a man enlisted to fill a vacancy in an organization already in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1634"/>But this seems the proper connection in which to say something of the experiences of men who enlisted with original regiments, and went out with the same in &lsquo;<num value="61">61</num> and &lsquo;<num value="62">62</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1635"/>In many respects, their education was obtained under as great adversity as fell to the lot of recruits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1636"/>In <hi rend="italics">some</hi> respects, I think their lot was harder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1637"/>They knew absolutely nothing of war. They were stirred by patriotic impulse to enlist and crush out treason, and hurl back at once in the teeth of the enemy the charge of cowardice and accept their challenge to the arbitrament of war. These patriots planned just <num value="2">two</num> moves for the execution of this desire: <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, to enlist &mdash; to join some company or regiment; <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, to have that regiment transferred at once to the immediate front of the <rs>Rebels</rs>, where they could fight it out and settle the troubles without delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1638"/>Their intense fervor <hi rend="italics">to do something right away</hi> to humble the haughty enemy, made them utterly unmindful that they must <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> go to school and learn the art of war from its very beginnings, and right at that point their sorrows began. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1639"/>I think the greatest cross they bore consisted in being compelled to settle down in home camp, as some regiments <pb id="p.211" n="211"/> did for months, waiting to be sent off. Here they were in sight of home in many cases, yet outside of its comforts to a large extent; soldiers, yet out of danger; bidding their friends a tender adieu to-day, because they are to leave them --perhaps forever &mdash; to-morrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1640"/>But the morrow comes, and finds them still in camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1641"/>Yes, there were soldiers who bade their friends a long good-by in the morning, and started for camp expecting that very noon or afternoon to leave for the tented field, but who at night returned again to spend a few hours more at the homestead, as the departure of the regiment had been unexpectedly deferred. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1642"/>The soldiers underwent a great deal of wear and tear from false alarms of this kind, owing to various reasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1643"/>Sometimes the regiment failed to depart because it was not full; sometimes it was awaiting its field officers; sometimes complete equipments were not to be had; sometimes it was delayed to join an expedition not yet ready; and thus, in <num value="1">one</num> way or other, the men and their friends were kept long on the tiptoe of expectation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1644"/>Whenever a rumor became prevalent that the regiment was surely going to leave on a certain day near at hand, straightway there was an exodus from carp for home, some obtaining a furlough, but more going without <num value="1">one</num>, to take another touching leave all around, for the dozenth time perhaps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1645"/>Many of those who lived too far away to be sure of returning in time, remained in camp, and telegraphed friends to meet them at some large centre, as they passed through on the specified day, which of course the friends faithfully tried to do, and succeeded if the regiment set forth as rumored. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1646"/>I said that many soldiers went home <hi rend="italics">without</hi> furloughs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1647"/>There was a camp guard hemming in every rendezvous for troops, with which I was familiar; but no sentinel could see a man cross his beat <hi rend="italics">if he did not look at him</hi>, and this few of them did. Indeed, many of the sentinels themselves, as soon as they were posted and the relieving squad were out of sight, stuck their inverted muskets into the ground and <pb id="p.212" n="212"/> decamped, either for their <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> or for the day, and took their chances of being brought to answer for it. The fact is, the men of &lsquo;<num value="61">61</num> and &lsquo;<num value="62">62</num> <hi rend="italics">wanted to go to war</hi>, and, whether they left the camp with or without leave, they were sure to return to it. This fact was quite generally understood by their superiors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1648"/>This home camp life seems interesting to look back upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1649"/>Hundreds of men did not spend <num value="1">one</num> day in <num value="6">six</num> in camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1650"/>They came often enough to have it known that they had not deserted, and then flitted again, but other hundreds conscientiously remained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1651"/>The company streets on every pleasant day were radiant with the costumes of <quote>fair women, and brave men</quote> --<hi rend="italics">to be</hi>. On such a day a young man sauntering along the parade, or winding in and out of the various company streets, the willing prisoner of <num value="1">one</num> or more interesting young women &mdash; his sisters, perhaps, or somebody else's &mdash; walked, the envy of the men who had no such friends to enliven their camp life, or whose friends were too far away to visit them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1652"/>If these latter men secured an introduction to such a party, it tempered their loneliness somewhat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1653"/>And if such a party entered a tent, and joined in the social round, it made a merry gathering while they tarried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1654"/>But there were other promenaders whose passing aroused no emotions of envy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1655"/>The husband and father attended by the loving wife and mother, whose brow had already begun to wear that sober aspect arising from a forecasting of the future, seeing, possibly, in the contingencies of war, herself a widow, her children fatherless &mdash; dependent on her own unaided hands for all of this world's comforts, which must be provided for the helplessness of childhood and youth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1656"/>The husband, too, leading his boy or girl by the hand as he walks, is not unmindful of the risks he has assumed or the comforts he must sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1657"/>But his hand is on the plough, and he will not turn back. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1658"/>Another interesting party often to be seen in the company street comprised a father, mother, and son, perhaps an only <pb id="p.213" n="213"/> boy, who had volunteered for the war. Their reluctance at the step which he had taken was manifested by turns in their looks, words, and acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/>But while he remained in the <rs>State</rs>, they must be with him as much as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>See that <rs n="carpet bag" type="product">carpet-bag</rs> which the mother opens as they take a seat on the straw in the son's tent!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/>Notice the solicitude which she betrays as she takes out <num value="1">one</num> comfort or convenience after another &mdash; the socks for cold weather, the woollens to ward off fever and ague, the medicine to antidote foul water, the little roll of bandages which &mdash; may he never have occasion for; the dozen other comforts that he ought to be provided with, including some goodies which he had better take along if the regiment should chance to go in a day or <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1662"/>And so she loads him up--<name n="God" type="God">God</name> bless her!--utterly unmindful that the government has already provided him with more than he can carry very far with his unaided strength. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1663"/>Then, the camps were full of pedlers of <quote><orgName n="Yankee Notions" type="newspaper">Yankee notions</orgName>,</quote> which soldiers were supposed to stand in need of. I shall refer to some of these in another connection. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1664"/>The lesson of submission to higher military authority was a hard <num value="1">one</num> for free, honest American citizens to learn, and, while learning it, they chafed tremendously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1665"/>It was difficult for them to realize the difference between men <hi rend="italics">with</hi> shoulder-straps and <hi rend="italics">without</hi> them; in fact, they <hi rend="italics">would not</hi> realize it for a long time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1666"/>When the straps crowned the shoulders of social inferiors, submission to such authority was at times degrading indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>I have already touched upon this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>But the most judicious code of military discipline, even if administered by an accomplished officer of estimable character, would have met with vigorous opposition, for a time, from these impetuous and hitherto untrammelled American citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1669"/>Fortunately for them, perhaps, but unfortunately for the service, the line officers were men of their own selection, their neighbors and friends, who had met them as equals on all occasions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1670"/>But now, if such <pb id="p.214" n="214"/> an officer attempted to enforce the authority conferred by his rank, in the interest of better drill or discipline, he was at once charged by his late equals with <quote>showing off his authority,</quote> <quote>putting on airs,</quote> <quote>feeling above his fellows</quote> ; and letters written home advertised him as a <quote>miniature tyrant,</quote> etc., which made his position a very uncomfortable <num value="1">one</num> to hold for a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1671"/>But this condition of affairs wore away soon after troops left the <rs>State</rs>, when the necessity for rigid discipline became apparent to every man. And when the private soldier saw that his captain was held responsible by the colonel for uncleanly quarters or arms, or unsoldierly and ill disciplined men, the colonel in turn being held to accountability by <hi rend="italics">his</hi> next superior, the growls grew less frequent or were aimed at the government rather than the captain, and the growlers began to settle down and accept the inevitable, taking lessons in something new every day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>It will be readily seen, I think, that the men composing the earliest regiments and batteries had also their trials to endure, and they were many; for not only they but their superiors were learning by rough experience the art of war. They were, in a sense, <quote>achieving greatness,</quote> while the recruits had <quote>greatness thrust upon them,</quote> often at short notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1673"/>Furthermore, recruits from the latter part of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct> forward went out with a knowledge of much which they must undergo in the line of hardship and privation, which the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rallies had to learn by actual experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1674"/>And while it may be said that it took more courage for men to go with the stern facts of actual war confronting them than when its realities were unknown to them, yet it is also true that many of these later enlistments were made under the advantage of pecuniary and other inducements, without which many would not have been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/>For patriotism unstimulated by hope of reward saw high-water mark in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, and rapidly receded in succeeding years, so that whereas men enlisted in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> and early in &lsquo;<num value="62">62</num> because they wanted to go, and without hope of reward, later in &lsquo;<num value="62">62</num> towns <pb id="p.215" n="215"/> and individuals began to offer bounties to stimulate lagging enlistments, varying in amount from <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">$10</measure> to <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">$300</measure>; and increased in &lsquo;<num value="63">63</num> and &lsquo;<num value="64">64</num> until, by the addition of State bounties, a recruit, enlisting for a year, received in the fall of &lsquo;<num value="64">64</num> from <measure n="700dollars" type="currency">$700</measure> to <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">$1000</measure> in some instances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1676"/>It was this large bounty which led old veterans to haze recruits in many ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1677"/>Of course, there was no justification for their doing it, only as the recruits in some instances provoked it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1678"/>There was a song composed during the war, entitled the <quote>Raw recruit,</quote> sung to the tune of <quote><persName><foreName>Abraham</foreName></persName>'s Daughter,</quote> which I am wholly unable to recall, but a snatch of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> verse, or its parody, ran about as follows:--I'm a raw recruit, with a bran&lsquo;--new suit, <measure n="900dollars" type="currency">Nine hundred dollars</measure> bounty, And I've come down from Darbytown To fight for <placeName reg="Oxford, Maine, United States" key="tgn,2000926">Oxford County</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1679"/>The name of the town and county were varied to suit the circumstances. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1680"/>In <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct> a draft was ordered to fill the ranks of the army, as volunteers did not come for-<figure id="fig.215"> 
<head>Drafted.</head></figure> ward rapidly enough to meet the exigencies of the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1681"/>Men of means, if drafted, hired a substitute, as allowed by law, to go in their stead, when patriotism failed to set them in motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1682"/>Many of these substitutes did good service, while others became deserters immediately after enlisting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1683"/>Conscription was never <pb id="p.216" n="216"/> more unpopular than when enforced upon American citizens at this time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1684"/>Here is a suggestive extract from a rhyme of that period, entitled

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1692"/>If there was a red-letter day to be found anywhere in the army life of a soldier,it occurred when he was the recipient of a box sent to him by the dear ones and friends he left to enter the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1693"/>Whenever it became clear, or even tolerably clear, that the army was likely to make pause in <num value="1">one</num> place for at least <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure>, straightway the average soldier mailed a letter home to mother, father, wife, sister, or brother, setting forth in careful detail what he should like to have sent in a box at the earliest possible moment, and stating with great precision the address that must be put on the cover, in order to have it reach its destination safely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1694"/>Here is a specimen address:-- <quote> 
<p rend="rend=center">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1695"/><persName n="Smith,Sergeant,John,J.,," id="n0006.0012.00217.00167" reg="default:Smith,John,J.,,"><roleName n="Sergeant">Sergeant</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, <lb/><hi rend="italics"><orgName type="company" n="Company A">Company A</orgName>., <orgName type="regiment" key="19MARegiment">19th Mass.

<p><hi rend="italics">Care <persName n="Brown,Captain,James,,," id="n0006.0012.00217.00168" reg="default:Brown,James,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <foreName>James</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName></hi>.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1696"/>As a matter of fact much of this address was unnecessary, and the box would have arrived just as soon and safely if <pb id="p.218" n="218"/> the address had only included the name, company, and regiment, with <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, D. C</hi>., added, for everything was forwarded from that city to army headquarters, and thence distributed through the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1697"/>But the average soldier wanted to make a sure thing of it, and so told the whole story. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1698"/>The boxes sent were usually of good size, often either a shoe-case or a common soap-box, and were rarely if ever less than a peck in capacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1699"/>As to the contents, I find on the back of an old envelope a partial list of such articles ordered at some period in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1700"/>I give them as they stand, to wit: <quote>Round-headed nails</quote> (for the heels of boots), <quote>hatchet</quote> (to cut kindlings, tent-poles, etc.), <quote>pudding, turkey, pickles, onions, pepper, paper, envelopes, stockings, potatoes, chocolate, condensed milk, sugar, broma, butter, sauce, preservative</quote> (for the boots). The <hi rend="italics">quantity</hi> of the articles to be sent was left to the discretion of thoughtful and affectionate parents. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1701"/>In addition to the above, such a list was likely to contain an order for <rs n="woollen shirt" type="product">woollen shirts</rs>, towels, a pair of boots made to order, some needles, thread, buttons, and yarn, in the line of <rs n="dry goods" type="product">dry goods</rs>, and a boiled ham, tea, cheese, cake, preserve, etc., for edibles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1702"/>As would naturally be expected, articles for the repair and solace of the inner man received most consideration in making out such a list. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1703"/>How often the wise calculations of the soldier were rudely dashed to earth by the army being ordered to move before the time when the box should arrive!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1704"/>And how his mouth watered as he read over the invoice, which had already reached him by mail, describing with great minuteness of detail all the delicacies he had ordered, and many more that kind and loving hearts and thoughtful minds had put in. For the neighborhood generally was interested when it became known that a box was making up to send to a soldier, and each <num value="1">one</num> must contribute some token of kindly remembrance, for the enjoyment of the far-away boy in <pb id="p.219" n="219"/> blue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1705"/>But the thought that some of these good things might spoil before the army would again come to a standstill came upon the veteran now and then with crushing force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1706"/>Still, he must needs endure, and take the situation as coolly as possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1707"/>It was a little annoying to have every box opened and inspected at brigade or regimental headquarters, to assure that no intoxicating liquors were smuggled into camp in that way, especially if <num value="1">one</num> was not addicted to their use. There was many a growl uttered by men who had lost their little pint or quart bottle of some choice stimulating beverage, which .had been confiscated from a box as <quote>contraband of war,</quote> although the sender had marked it with an innocent name, in the hope of passing it through unsuspected and uninspected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1708"/>Yet the inspectors were often baffled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1709"/>A favorite ruse was to have the bottle introduced into a well roasted turkey, a place that; no <num value="1">one</num> would for a moment suspect of containing such unique stuffing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1710"/>In such a case the bottle was introduced into the bird empty, and filled after the cooking was completed, the utmost care being taken to cover up all marks of its presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1711"/>Some would conceal it in a tin can of small cakes; others inserted it in a loaf of cake, through a hole cut in the bottom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1712"/><num value="1">One</num> member of my company had some whiskey sent for his enjoyment, sealed up in a tin can; but when the box was nailed up a nail was driven into the can, so that the owner found only an empty can and a generally diffused odor of <quote>departed spirits</quote> pervading the entire contents of food and raiment which the box contained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1713"/>It was really vexing to have <num value="1">one</num>'s knick-knacks and dainties overhauled by strangers under <hi rend="italics">any</hi> circumstances, and all the more so when the box contained no proscribed commodity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1714"/>Besides, the boxes were so nicely packed that it was next to impossible for the inspector to return all the contents, having once removed them; and he often made more or less of a jumble in attempting to do so. I think I <pb id="p.220" n="220"/> must have had as many boxes sent as the average among the soldiers, and simple justice to those who had the handling of them requires me to state that I never missed a single article from them, and, barring the breakage of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> bottles, which may or may not have been the fault of the opener, the contents were always undamaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1715"/>Sometimes the boxes were sent directly from brigade headquar-<figure id="fig.220"> 
<head>A wagon-load of boxes.</head></figure> ters to the headquarters of each company without inspection, and there only those were opened whose owners were known to imbibe freely on occasion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1716"/>The boxes came, when they came at all, by wagon-loads -mule teams of the company going after them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1717"/>I have already intimated that none were sent to the army when it was on the move or when a campaign was imminent; and as these moves were generally foreshadowed with tolerable accuracy, the men were likely to send their orders home at about the same time, and so they would receive their boxes together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1718"/>In this way it happened that they came to camp by wagon-loads, and a happier, lighter-hearted body of men than those who were gathered around the wagons could not have been found in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1719"/>I mean now those who were <pb id="p.221" n="221"/> the fortunate recipients of a box, for there was always a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> party on hand who did not expect a box, but who were on the spot to offer congratulations to the lucky ones; perhaps these would receive an invitation to quarters to see the box unpacked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1720"/>This may seem a very tantalizing invitation for them to accept; but, nevertheless, next to being the owner of the prize, it was most entertaining to observe what some <num value="1">one</num> else was to enjoy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1721"/>I think the art of box-packing must have culminated during the war. It was simply wonderful, delightfully so, to see how each little corner and crevice was utilized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1722"/>Not stuffed with paper by those who understood their business, thus wasting space, but filled with a potato, an apple, an onion, a pinch of dried apples, a handful of peanuts, or some other edible substance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1723"/>These and other articles filled the crannies between carefully wrapped glass jars or bottles of toothsome preserves, or boxes of butter, or cans of condensed milk or well roasted chickens, and the turkey that each box was wont to contain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1724"/>If there was a new pair of boots among the contents, the feet were filled with little notions of convenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1725"/>Then, there was likely to be, amid all the other merchandise already specified, a roll of bandages and lint, for the much-feared but unhoped &mdash; for contingency of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1726"/>It added greatly to the pleasures of the investigator to come now and then upon a nicely wrapped package, labelled <quote>From <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName>,</quote> <quote>From <persName><roleName n="Cousin">Cousin</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName></persName>,</quote> and perhaps a dozen other relatives, neighbors, school-mates or shop-mates, most of which contributions were delicious surprises, and many of them accompanied by notes of personal regard and good-wishes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1727"/>There were some men in every company who had no <num value="1">one</num> at home to remember them in this tender and appreciative manner, and as they sat or stood by the hero of a box and saw <num value="1">one</num> article after another taken out and unwrapped, each speaking so eloquently of the loving care and thoughtful remembrance of kindred or friends, they were moved by <pb id="p.222" n="222"/> mingled feelings of pleasure and sadness: pleasure at their comrade's good-fortune and downright enjoyment of his treasure, and sadness at their own lonely condition, with no <num value="1">one</num> to remember them in this pleasant manner, and often would their eyes fill with tears by the contrast of their own situation with the pleasant scene before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1728"/>But these men were generally remembered by a liberal donation whenever a box came to camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1729"/>Still, there were selfish men in every company, and, if they were selfish by nature, the war, I think, had a tendency to make them more so. Such men would keep their precious box and its precious contents away from sight, smell, and taste of all outsiders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1730"/>It was a little world to them, and all their own. <quote>Send for a box yourself, if you want <num value="1">one</num>,</quote> appeared in their every look, and often found expression in words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1731"/>As a boy I have seen a school-mate munching an apple before now with <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of his less favored acquaintances wistfully watching and begging for the core.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1732"/>But the men of whom I speak never had any core to their apples; they absorbed everything that was sent them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1733"/>I knew <num value="1">one</num> man who, I think, came uncomfortably near belonging to this class of soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1734"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> box he ever received contained, among other delicacies, about a peck of raw onions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1735"/>Before these onions had been reached in this man's consumption of the contents of his box a move was ordered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1736"/>What was to be done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1737"/>It was <num value="1">one</num> of the trying moments of his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1738"/><num value="19">Nineteen</num> out of every <num value="20">twenty</num> men, if not <num value="99">ninety-nine</num> out of every <num value="100">hundred</num>, would at this <num value="11" type="ordinal">eleventh</num> hour have set them outside of the tent and said, <quote>Here they are, boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1739"/>Take hold and help yourselves!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1740"/>But not he. He was the <num value="100" type="ordinal">hundredth</num> man, the exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1741"/>So, packing them up with some old clothes, he at once expressed them back to his home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1742"/>But, as I have intimated, such men were few in number, and, while war made this class more selfish, yet its community of hardship and danger and suffering developed sympathy and large-hearted generosity among <pb id="p.223" n="223"/> <num value="223">223</num> the rank and file generally, and they shared freely with their less fortunate but worthy comrades. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1752"/>But I will now leave this &mdash; to me deeply interesting theme &mdash; and introduce <figure id="fig.224"> 
<head>The Army sutler.</head></figure> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1753"/>This personage played a very important part as <hi rend="italics">quartermaster extraordinary</hi> to the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1754"/>He was not an enlisted man, only a civilian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1755"/>By Army Regulations sutlers could be appointed <quote>at the rate of <num value="1">one</num> for every regiment, corps, or separate detachment, by the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> of such regiment, corps, or detachment,</quote> subject to the approval of higher authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1756"/>These persons made a business of sutling, or supplying food and a various collection of other articles to the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1757"/>Each regiment was supplied with <num value="1">one</num> of these traders, who pitched his hospital tent near camp, and displayed his wares in a manner most enticing to the needs of the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/>The sutler was of necessity both a <rs n="dry goods" type="product">dry-goods</rs> dealer and a grocer, and kept, besides, such other articles as were likely to be called for in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>He made his chief reliance, however, a stock of goods that answered the demands of the stomach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>He had a line of canned goods which he sold mostly for use in officers' messes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>The canning of meats, fruits, and vegetables was <pb id="p.225" n="225"/> then in its infancy, and the prices, which in time of peace were high, by the demands of war were so inflated that the highest of high privates could not aspire to sample them unless he was the child of wealthy parents who kept him supplied with a stock of scrip or greenbacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/>It can readily be seen that his <measure n="13dollars" type="currency">thirteen dollars</measure> a month (or even <measure n="16dollars" type="currency">sixteen dollar</measure>, to which the pay was advanced <dateStruct value="1864-06-20"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="20">20</day>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, through the efforts of <persName n="Wilson,,Henry,,," id="n0006.0012.00225.00170" reg="default:Wilson,Henry,,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName>, who strove hard to make it <measure n="21dollars" type="currency">twenty-one dollars</measure>) would not hold out a great while to patronize an army sutler, and hundreds of the soldiers when the paymaster came round had the pleasure of signing away the entire amount due to them, whether <num value="2">two</num>, <num value="3">three</num>, or <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> pay, to settle claims of the sutler upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/>Here are a few of his prices as I remember them:-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>Butter (warranted to be rancid), <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar</measure> a pound; cheese, <measure n="50cents" type="currency">fifty cents</measure> a pound; condensed milk, <measure n="75cents" type="currency">seventy-five cents</measure> a can; navy tobacco of the blackest sort, <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar</measure> and <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> a plug.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1765"/>Other than the milk I do not remember any of the prices of canned goods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>The investment that seemed to pay the largest dividend to the puchaser <pb id="p.226" n="226"/> was the <hi rend="italics">molasses cakes</hi> or <hi rend="italics">cookies</hi> which the sutlers vended at the rate of <num value="6">six</num> for <num value="0.25">a quarter</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1767"/>They made a pleasant and not too rich or expensive dessert when hardtack got to be a burden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1768"/>Then, <num value="1">one</num> could buy sugar or molasses or flour of them, though at a higher price than the commissary charged for the same articles. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1769"/>The commissary, I think I have explained, was an officer in charge of government rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1770"/>From him quartermasters obtained their supplies for the rank and file, on a written requisition given by the commander of a regiment or battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1771"/>He also sold supplies for officers' messes at cost price, and also to members of the rank and file, if they presented an order signed by a commissioned officer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1772"/>Towards the end of the war sutlers kept self-raising flour, which they sold in packages of a few pounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1773"/>This the men bought quite generally to make into fritters or pancakes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1774"/>It would have pleased the celebrated <measure n="4000dollars" type="currency">four thousand dollar</measure> cook at the <rs type="place">Parker House</rs>, in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, could he have seen the men cook these fritters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1775"/>The mixing was a simple matter, as water was the only addition which the flour required, but the fun was in the turning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1776"/>A little experience enabled a <figure id="fig.226"> 
<head>Cooking pancakes.</head></figure> man to turn them without the aid of a knife, by <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> giving the fry-pan a little toss upward and forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1777"/>This threw the cake out and over, to be caught again the uncooked side down &mdash; all in <num value="0.5">a half</num>-<num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1778"/>But the miscalculations and mishaps experienced in performing this piece of culinary detail were numerous and amusing, many a cake being dropped into the fire, or taken by a sudden puff of wind, just as it got edgewise in the air, and whisked into the dirt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1779"/><pb id="p.227" n="227"/> </p> 
<p>Then, the sutler's pies!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1780"/>Who can forget them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1781"/><quote>Moist and indigestible below, tough and indestructible above, with untold horrors within.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1782"/>The most mysterious products that he kept, I have yet to see the soldier who can furnish a correct analysis of what they were made from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1783"/>Fortunately for the dealer, it mattered very little as to that, for the soldiers were used to mystery in all its forms, and the pies went down by hundreds; <measure n="25cents" type="currency">price, twenty-five cents</measure> each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1784"/>Not very high, it is true, compared with other edibles, but they were small and thin, though for the matter of thickness several.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1785"/>times the amount of such stuffing could have added but little to the cost. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1786"/>I have said that these army merchants were <rs n="dry goods" type="product">dry-goods</rs> dealers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1787"/>The only articles which would come under this head, that I now remember of seeing, were army regulation hats, cavalry boots, flannels, socks, and suspenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1788"/>They were not allowed to keep liquors, and any <num value="1">one</num> of them found guilty of this act straightway lost his permit to suttle for the troops, if nothing worse happened him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1789"/>I am of the opinion that the sutlers did not always receive the consideration that they deserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1790"/>Owing to the high prices which they asked the soldiers for their goods, the belief found ready currency that they were little better than extortioners; and I think that the name <quote>sutler</quote> to-day calls up in the minds of the old soldiers a man who would not enlist and shoulder his musket, but who was better satisfied to take his pack of goods and get his living out of the soldiers who were doing his fighting for him. But there is something to be said on the other side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1791"/>In the first place, he filled a need recognized, long before the <rs>Rebellion</rs>, by Army Regulations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1792"/>Such a personage was considered a convenience if not a necessity at military posts and in campaigns, and certain privileges were accorded him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1793"/>In the second place, no soldier was compelled to patronize him, and yet I question whether there was a man in the service any great length of time, within easy reach of <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.228" n="228"/> of these traders, who did not patronize him more or less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1794"/>In the third place, when <num value="1">one</num> carefully considers the expense of transporting his goods to the army, the wastage of the same from exposure to the weather, the cost of frequent removals, and the risk he carried of losing his stock <figure id="fig.228"> 
<head><persName n="Cook,,,,," id="n0006.0012.00228.00171" reg="mostcommon:Cook,nomatch:0"><surname>Cook</surname></persName>'s Shanty.</head></figure> of goods in case of a disaster to the army, added to the constant increase in the cost of the necessaries of life, of which the soldiers were not cognizant, I do not believe that sutlers as a class can be justly accused of overcharging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1795"/>I have seen <num value="1">one</num> of these merchants since the war, who seemed seized with the fullest appreciation of the worth of his own services to the country, and, with an innocent earnestness most refreshing, applied for membership in the <orgName n="Grand Army of the Republic" type="association">Grand Army of the Republic</orgName>, into which only men who have an honorable discharge from the government are admitted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1796"/>There undoubtedly were Shylocks among them, and they often had a hard time of it; and this leads me to speak of another risk that sutlers had to assume &mdash; the risk of being raided-or <quote>cleaned out,</quote> to quote the language of the expressive army slang.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1797"/>This meant the secret organization of a party of men in a regiment to fall upon a sutler in the <pb id="p.229" n="229"/> darkness of night, throw down his tent, help themselves liberally to whatever they wanted, and then get back speedily and quietly to quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/>It did not do to carry stolen goods to the tents, for the next day was likely to see a detachment of men, accompanied by the sutler, searching the quarters for the missing property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1799"/>Sometimes this raiding was done in a spirit of mischief, by unprincipled men, sometimes to get satisfaction for what they considered his exorbitant charges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1800"/>Sometimes the officers of a regiment sympathized in such a movement, if they thought the sutler's exactions deserved a rebuke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1801"/>When this was the case, it was no easy task to find the criminals, for the officers were very blind and stupid, or, if the culprits were detected, they were quietly reminded that if they were foolish enough to get caught they must suffer the penalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1802"/>But sutlers, like other people, profited by the teachings of experience, and, if they had faults, soon mended them, so that late'in the war they rarely found it necessary to beg deliverance from their friends. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1803"/>The following incident came under my own knowledge in the winter of &lsquo;<num value="64">64</num>, while the <orgName type="mil" key="ArtilleryBrigade">Artillery Brigade</orgName> of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 3">Third Corps</orgName> lay encamped in the edge of a pine woods near <placeName reg="Brandy Station, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2110767">Brandy Station, Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1804"/>Just in rear of the <orgName type="regiment" key="10Battery">Tenth Battery</orgName> camp, near company headquarters, the brigade sutler had erected his tent, and every wagon-load of his supplies passed through this camp under the eyes of any <num value="1">one</num> who cared to take note.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1805"/>A load of this description was thus inspected on a particular occasion, and while the wagon was standing in front of the tent waiting to be unloaded, and without special guarding, an always thirsty veteran stole up to it, seized upon a case of whiskey, said to have been destined for a battery commander, and was off in a jiffy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/>Less than <measure n="3minutes" type="date">three minutes</measure> elapsed before the case was missed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1807"/>At once the captain of the company was notified, who immediately gave his instructions to the officer of the day. The bugler blew the <hi rend="italics">Assembly</hi>, summoning every man into line; and <pb id="p.230" n="230"/> every man had to be there or be otherwise strictly accounted for by his sergeant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1808"/>What it all meant no <num value="1">one</num> apparently knew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1809"/>Meanwhile, <num value="2">two</num> lieutenants and the orderly were carrying on a thorough search of the men's quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1810"/>When it was completed, the orderly returned to the line, and the company was dismissed, in a curious frame of mind as to the cause of all the stir.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1811"/>This soon leaked out, as did also the fact that no trace of the missing property had been discovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>All was again quiet along the <rs>Potomac</rs>, except when the culprit and his coterie waxed a little noisy over imbibitions of <hi rend="italics">ardent</hi> mysteriously obtained, and not until after the close of the war was the mystery made clear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1813"/>It seems that as soon as he had seized his prize he passed swiftly down through the camp to the picket rope, where the horses were tied, and there, <hi rend="italics">in a pile of manure thrown up behind them</hi>, quickly concealed the case, and, at the bugle signal, was prompt to fall into line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1814"/>Under cover of darkness, the same night, the plunder was taken from the manureheap and carried to a hill in front of the camp, where it was buried in a manner which would not disclose it to the casual traveller, and yet leave it easily accessible to its unlawful possessor, and here he resorted periodically for a fresh supply, until it was exhausted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1815"/>I have quoted a few of the prices charged by sutlers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1816"/>Here are a few of the prices paid by people in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, during the latter part of the war, in Confederate money:-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1817"/>Potatoes <measure n="80dollars" type="currency">$80</measure> a bushel; a chicken <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">$50</measure>; shad <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">$50</measure> per pair; beef <measure n="15dollars" type="currency">$15</measure> a pound; bacon <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">$20</measure> a pound; butter <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">$20</measure> a pound; flour <measure n="1500dollars" type="currency">$1500</measure> a barrel; meal <measure n="140dollars" type="currency">$140</measure> a bushel; beans <measure n="65dollars" type="currency">$65</measure> a bushel; cow-peas <measure n="80dollars" type="currency">$80</measure> a bushel; hard wood <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">$50</measure> a cord; green pine <measure n="80dollars" type="currency">$80</measure> a cord; and a dollar in gold was worth <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">$100</measure> in Confederate money. </p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1819"/>There was <num value="1">one</num> other source from which soldiers &mdash; at least, some soldiers &mdash; replenished their larder, or added to its variety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>The means employed to accomplish this end was known as <hi rend="italics">Foraging</hi>, which is generally understood to mean a seeking after food, whether for man or beast, and appropriating to <num value="1">one</num>'s own use whatsoever is found in this line, wheresoever it is found in an enemy's country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1821"/>It took the army some time to adopt this mode of increasing its stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/>This arose from the fact that early in the war many of the prominent government and military officers thought that a display of force with consideration shown the enemy's property would win the <rs>South</rs> back to her allegiance to the <rs>Union</rs>; but that if, on the other hand, they devastated property and appropriated personal effects, it would only embitter the enemy, unite them more solidly, and greatly prolong the war; so that for many months after war began, Northern troops were prohibited from seizing fence-rails, poultry, swine, straw, or any similar merchandise in which <pb id="p.232" n="232"/> they might under some circumstances feel a personal interest; and whenever straw-stacks and fences <hi rend="italics">were</hi> appropriated by order of commanding officers, certificates to that effect were given the owners, who might expect at some time to be reimbursed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>But the <rs>Rebellion</rs> waxed apace, and outgrew all possibility of certificating everybody whose property was entered upon or absorbed, and furthermore it came to be known that many who had received certificates were in collusion with the enemy, so that the issuance of these receipts gradually grew beautifully less. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/>Then, there was another obstacle in the way of a general adoption of foraging as an added means of support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/>It was the presence in the army of a large number of men who had learned the <num value="10">ten</num> commandments, and could not, with their early training and education, look upon this taking to themselves the possessions of others without license as any different from stealing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1826"/>These soldiers would neither forage nor share in the fruits of foraging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1827"/>It can be readily imagined, then, that when <num value="1">one</num> of this class commanded a regiment the diversion of foraging was not likely to be very general with his men. But as the war wore on, and it became more evident that such tender regard for Rebel property only strengthened the enemy and weakened the cause of the <rs>Union</rs>, conscientious scruples stepped to the rear, and the soldier who had them at the end of the war was a curiosity indeed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1828"/>There are some phases of this question of foraging which at this late day may be calmly considered, and the right and wrong of it carefully weighed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1829"/>In the first place, international law declares that in a hostile section an army may save its rations and live off the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1830"/>To the large majority of the soldiers this would be sufficient warrant for them to appropriate from the enemy whatever they had a present liking for in the line of provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1831"/>If all laws were based on absolute justice, the <num value="1">one</num> quoted would settle the question finally, and leave nothing as an objection to foraging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1832"/><pb id="p.233" n="233"/> But while the majority make the laws, the consciences and convictions of the minority are not changed thereby.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1833"/>Each man's conscience must be a final law unto himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1834"/>It is well for it to be so. I only enlarge upon this for a moment to show that on all moral questions every intelligent man must in a meas-<figure id="fig.233"> 
<head>A discovery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1835"/>Act I.</head></figure> ure make his own law, having Conscience as a guide. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1836"/>The view which the average soldier took was, as already intimated, in harmony with the international law quoted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1837"/>This view was, in substance, that the people of the <rs>South</rs> were in a state of rebellion against the government, notwithstanding that they had been duly <figure id="fig.233.1"> 
<head>A discovery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1838"/>Act <num value="2">II</num>.</head></figure> warned to desist from war and return to their allegiance; that they had therefore forfeited all claim to whatever property the soldier chose to appropriate; that this was <num value="1">one</num> of the risks they assumed when they raised the banner of secession; that for this and perhaps other reasons, <pb id="p.234" n="234"/> they should be treated just as a foreign nation waging war against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, all of which may seem plausible at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> view, and indeed it may be said just here that if the soldiers had always despoiled the enemy to supply their own pressing personal needs, or if they had always taken or destroyed only those things which could be of service to the enemy in the prosecution of the war, the arguments against foraging would be considerably weakened; but the authority to forage carried with it also the exercise of the office of judge and jury, from whom there was no appeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/>If the owner of a lot of corn or poultry was to protest against losing it, on the ground that he was a Unionist, unless the proof was at hand, he would lose his case &mdash; that is, his corn and chickens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1840"/>However sincere he may have been, it was not possible for him to establish his Union sentiments at short notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1841"/>Indeed, so many who really were <quote>secesh</quote> claimed to be good Union men, it came latterly to be assumed that the victim was playing a false role on all such occasions, and so the soldiers went straight for the plunder, heeding no remonstrances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1842"/>Without doubt, hundreds of Union men throughout the <rs>South</rs> suffered losses in this way, which, if their loyalty could have been clearly shown, they would have been spared. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1843"/>A good deal of the foraging, while unauthorized and forbidden by commanding officers, was often connived at by them, and they were frequently sharers in the spoils; but I was about to say that it was not always of the most judicious kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1844"/>No <num value="1">one</num>, better than the old soldiers, knows how destitute many, if not most, of the houses along the line of march were of provisions, clothing, and domestic animals, after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> few months of the war. I will amend that statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/>There <hi rend="italics">was</hi> <num value="1">one</num> class who knew better than the soldiers,the <hi rend="italics">tenants</hi> of those houses knew that destitution bettersometimes feigned it, may be, but as a rule it was the ugly and distressing reality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>I am dealing now with the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> <pb id="p.235" n="235"/> of the <rs>Potomac</rs>,, which travelled the same roads year after year, either before or behind the <rs>Rebel</rs> <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>In or near the routes of these bodies little was attempted by the people in the way of crop-raising, for their products were sure to feed <num value="1">one</num> or the other of the <num value="2">two</num> armies as they tramped up and down the state, so that destitution in some of the wayside cabins and farm-houses was often quite marked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>No <num value="1">one</num> with a heart less hard than flint could deprive such families of their last cow, shote, or ear of corn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1849"/>Yet there were many unauthorized foragers who would not hesitate a moment to seize and carry off the last visible mouthful of food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1850"/>So it has seemed to me that the cup of Rebellion was made unnecessarily bitter from the fact that such appeals too often fell on deaf ears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1851"/>Granting it to be true that the <rs>Rebels</rs> had forfeited all right to whatever property their antagonists saw fit to appropriate, yet in the absence of those Rebels their families ought not to suffer want and distress; the innocent should not suffer for the guilty, and when nothing was known against them they should not have been deprived of their last morsel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1852"/>But there were exceptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1853"/>There were some families who gave information to the <rs>Rebel</rs> army or detachments of it, by which fragments of ours were killed or captured, and when this was known the members of that family were likely sooner or later to suffer for it, as would naturally be expected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1854"/>Some of these families were so destitute that they were at times driven to appeal to the nearest army headquarters for rations to relieve their sufferings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/>To do this it was often necessary for them to walk many miles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>Horses they had not. They could not keep them, for if the <rs>Union</rs> cavalry did not <quote>borrow.,</quote> the <rs>Rebel</rs> cavalry would impress them; so that they were not only without a beast of burden for farm work, but had none to use as a means of transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/>Now and then a sore-backed, emaciated, and generally usedup horse or mule, which had been abandoned and left in the <pb id="p.236" n="236"/> track of the army to die, was taken charge of, when the coast was clear, and nursed back into vitality enough to stand on at least <num value="3">three</num> of his legs, when, by means of bits of tattered rope, twisted corn-husks, and odds and ends of leather which had seen better days, the sorry-looking brute, still bearing the brand <hi rend="italics">U</hi>. S. or <hi rend="italics">C</hi>. S. on his rump, partly concealed perhaps by his rusty oufit, was tackled into a nondescript vehicle, possibly the skeleton remains of what had been, in years <figure id="fig.236"> 
<head>Going to Army Headquarters.</head></figure> gone by, the elegant and stylish family carriage, but fully as often into a <num value="2">two</num>-wheeled cart, which now answered all the purposes of the family in its altered circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1858"/><num value="1">One</num> would hardly expect to find in such a brute a <hi rend="italics">Goldsmith Maid</hi> or a <hi rend="italics">Jay Eye See</hi> in locomotion, and so as a matter of fact such a beast was urged on from behind by lusty thwacks from a cudgel, propelling the family at a headlong <hi rend="italics">walk</hi>headlong, because he was likely to go headlong at any moment, from lack of strength, over the rough <address><street n="Virginia roads">Virginia roads</street></address>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/>When such a brute got to be pretty lively once more, unless he was concealed, he would soon fall into service again in <num value="1">one</num> of the armies, and possibly another gasping skeleton left in his place; but later in the war all animals abandoned by the <rs>Union</rs> army were shot if any life remained in them, so that even this resource was to that extent cut <pb id="p.237" n="237"/> off from the inhabitants, and the family <hi rend="italics">cow</hi>, while she was spared, was fitted out for such service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>But the soldiers did not always content themselves with taking eatables and forage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1861"/>Destruction of the most wanton and inexcusable character was sometimes indulged in. It is charged upon them when the army entered <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, that they took especial delight in bayonetting mirrors, smashing piano-keys with musket-butts, pitching crockery out of windows, and destroying other such inoffensive material, which could be of no possible service to either party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1862"/>If they had been imbibing commissary whiskey, they were all the more unreasonable and outrageous in their destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1863"/>Whenever a man was detected in the enactment of such disgraceful and unsoldierly conduct, he was put under arrest, and sentenced by court-martial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1864"/>But this class of men was an insignificantly small fraction of an army, although seeming very numerous to their victims. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1865"/>A regularly authorized body of foragers, in charge of a commissioned officer, never gave way to excesses like those I have mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1866"/>Their task was usually well defined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1867"/>It was to go out with wagons in quest of the contents of smoke-houses or barns or corn-barns; and if a flock of fowls or a few swine chanced to be a part of the livestock of the farms visited, the worse for the live-stock and Secessia, and the better for the <rs>Union</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/>The usual plunder secured by regular foraging parties was hams, <rs n="bacon sides" type="product">bacon sides</rs>, flour, sweet potatoes, <rs n="corn meal" type="product">corn-meal</rs>, corn on the cob, and sometimes corn-shooks as they were called, that is, corn-leaves stripped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>from the stalks, dried and bundled, for winter fodder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1870"/>The neat cattle in the <rs>South</rs> get the most of their living in the winter by browsing, there being but little hay cured. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>In traversing fresh territory, the army came upon extensive quantities of corn in corn-ricks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1872"/>At <placeName reg="Wilcox's Landing">Wilcox's Landing</placeName>, on the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName>, where we crossed in <dateStruct value="1864-06-"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, the <pb id="p.238" n="238"/> Rebel <persName n="Wilcox,,,,," id="n0006.0013.00238.00173" reg="mostcommon:Wilcox,nomatch:0"><surname>Wilcox</surname></persName>, who had a splendid farm on the left bank of the river, had hundreds of bushels of corn, I should judge, which the forage trains took aboard before they crossed over; and on the south side of the <rs>James</rs>, east from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, where Northern troops had never before pene-<figure id="fig.238">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1873"/>In this section, too, and in the territory stretching from the <rs>Wilderness</rs> to <placeName reg="Cold Harbor">Cold Harbor</placeName>, immense quantities of tobacco were found in the various stages of curing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1874"/>The drying-houses were full of it. These houses were rude structures, having water-tight roofs, but with walls built of small logs placed <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3inches" type="distance">three inches</measure> apart, to admit a free circulation of air. On poles running across the interior hung the stalks of tobacco, root upwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1875"/>Then, in other buildings were hogsheads pressed full of the <quote>weed,</quote> in another stage of the curing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1876"/>It is well known that <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> is the centre of a very extensive tobacco-trade, and in that city are large tobacco-factories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1877"/>But the war put a summary end to this business for the time, by closing northern markets and blockading southern ports, so that this article of foreign and domestic commerce accumulated in the hands of the producers to the very great extent found by the army when it appeared in that vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1878"/>Every soldier <pb id="p.239" n="239"/> who had a liking for tobacco helped himself as freely as he pleased, with no <num value="1">one</num> caring to stay his hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1879"/>But I believe that the experts in smoking and chewing preferred the black navy plug of the sutler, at a dollar and <num value="0.25">a quarter</num>, to this unprepared but purer article to be had by the taking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1891"/>In all foraging of whatever kind, the parties engaged will refrain from abusive or threatening language, and may, where the officer in command thinks proper, give written certificates of the facts, but no receipts; and they will endeavor to leave with each family a reasonable portion for their maintenance.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1896"/>Their plunder consisted of bacon, meal, turkeys, ducks, chickens, and whatever else was eatable for man or beast.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1902"/>But this travelling picnic of the <rs>Western</rs> armies was unique.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1903"/>There is nothing like it elsewhere in the history of the war. Certainly, the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> could not present anything to compare with it. As a matter of fact, there was no other movement in the war whose nature justified such a season of riotous living as this <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1904"/>But it illustrates in a <hi rend="italics">wholesale</hi> way the kind of business other armies did on a <hi rend="italics">retail</hi> scale. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1905"/>There was no arm of the service that presented such favorable opportunities for foraging as did the cavalry, and none, I may add, which look so great an advantage of its opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1906"/>In the first place, being the eyes and the ears of the army, and usually going in advance, cavalrymen skimmed the cream off the country when a general movement was making.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1907"/>Then when it was settled down in camp they were the outposts and never let anything in the line of poultry, bee-hives, milk-houses, and apple-jack, not to enumerate other delicacies which outlying farm-houses afforded, escape the most rigid inspection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1908"/>Again, they were frequently engaged in raids through the country, from the nature of which they were compelled to live in large measure off southern products, seized as they went along; <pb id="p.242" n="242"/> but infantry and artillery must needs confine <hi rend="italics">their</hi> quests for special rations to the homesteads near the line of march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1909"/>The cavalry not only could and did search these when they led the advance, but also made requisitions on all houses in sight of the thoroughfares travelled, even when they were <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> away, so that, in all probability, they ate a smaller quantity of government rations, man for man, than did any other branch of the land-service; but they did not therefore always fare sumptuously, for now and then the cavalry too were in a strait for rations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1910"/>Next to the cavalry, the infantry stood the best chance of good living on foraged edibles, as their picket-duty took them away some distance from the main lines and often into the neighborhood of farm-houses, from which they would buy or take such additions to their rations as the premises afforded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1911"/>Then, they went out in reconnoitring parties, or, perhaps, to do fatigue duty, such as the building of bridges, or the corduroying of roads, which also opened opportunities for them to enlist a few turkeys or chickens in the <rs>Union</rs> cause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1912"/>Perhaps the most unfortunate natives were those who chanced to live in a house by the roadside in the direct line of march of the army, for, from the time the head of the column struck such a house until the last straggler left it, there was a continuous stream of officers and men thronging into and about the premises, all ambitious to buy or beg or take whatsoever in the line of eatables and drinkables was to be had by either of these methods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1913"/>The net result of this was to leave such families in a starving condition, and finally begging rations from the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1914"/>Those families by whose premises <hi rend="italics">both</hi> armies marched were in the depths of distress, for Confederate soldiers let little in the way of provisions escape their maws on their line of march, even in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>; so that it was not unusual for such families to meet the <rs>Union</rs> advance with tearful eyes, and relate the losses which they had sustained and the beggary to which <pb id="p.243" n="243"/> they had been reduced by the seizure of their last cow and last ounce of <rs n="corn meal" type="product">corn-meal</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1915"/>Sometimes, no doubt, they deceived to ward off impending search and seizure from a new quarter, but as a rule the premises showed their statements to be true. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1916"/>Sometimes the inhabitants were shrewd and watchful enough to scent danger and secrete the articles most precious to them till the danger was past; but not infrequently they were a little tardy in adopting such a measure, and were overhauled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1917"/>just before they had reached cover, and <figure id="fig.243"> 
<head>Scene at a wayside farm-house.</head></figure> despoiled of the whole or a part of their treasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1918"/>The corn-fields of these roadside residents were the saddest of spectacles after the army had passed along in the early fall, for no native-born Southron had a finer appreciation of the excellent qualities of <quote>roasting ears</quote> than the average <name>Yankee</name> soldier, who left no stalk unstripped of its burden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1919"/>Even the stalks themselves were used, to regale the appetites of the horses and mules. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1920"/>Volumes might be filled with incidents of foraging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1921"/>I will relate <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> that came under my own personal observation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1922"/>The people of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> undoubtedly enjoyed greater exemption from foragers, as a whole, than did those of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, for a larger number of the former than of the <pb id="p.244" n="244"/> latter were supposed to be loyal and were therefore protected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1923"/>I say <hi rend="italics">supposed</hi>, for personally I am of the opinion that the <name>Virginians</name> were fully as loyal as the <name>Marylanders</name>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2012"/>But my story is not of the commanders, nor of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0006.0014.00253.00202" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, but of the corps, and what I have said will show how they were composed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2013"/>Let us review for a moment: <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the <hi rend="italics">regiments</hi>, each of which, when full, contained <num value="1046">one thousand and forty-six</num> men; <hi rend="italics"><num value="4">four</num></hi> of these composed a <hi rend="italics">brigade; <num value="3">three</num> brigades</hi> were taken to form a <hi rend="italics">division</hi>, and <hi rend="italics"><num value="3">three</num> divisions</hi> constituted a <hi rend="italics">corps</hi>.

Sometimes a corps had a <hi rend="italics"><num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num></hi> division, <pb id="p.254" n="254"/> but such a case would be a deviation, and not the regular plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2014"/>So, too, a division might have an extra brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2015"/>For example, a brigade might be detached from <num value="1">one</num> part of the service and sent to join an army in another part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2016"/>Such a brigade would not be allowed to remain independent in that case, but would be at once assigned to some division, usually a division whose brigades were small in numbers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2017"/>I have said that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0006.0014.00254.00203" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> made up his brigades of <num value="4">four</num> regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2018"/>I think the usual number of regiments for a brigade is <num value="3">three</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2019"/>That gives a system of threes throughout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2020"/>But in this matter also, after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> organization, the plan was modified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2021"/>As a brigade became depleted by sickness, capture, and the bullet, <hi rend="italics">new</hi> regiments were added, until, as the work of addition and depletion went on, I have known a brigade to have within it the skeletons of <num value="10">ten</num> regiments, and even then its strength not half that of the original body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2022"/>My camp was located at <num value="1">one</num> time near a regiment which had only <hi rend="italics"><num value="38">thirty-eight</num> men present for duty</hi>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2024"/>The same causes which operated to reduce brigades and divisions naturally decimated corps, so that some of them were consolidated; as, for example, the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 1">First</orgName> and <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 3">Third Corps</orgName> were merged in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num>, <num value="5" type="ordinal">Fifth</num>, and <num value="6" type="ordinal">Sixth</num>, in the spring of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2028"/>What are corps badges?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2029"/>The answer to this question is somewhat lengthy, but I think it will be considered interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2045"/>Soon after these emblems came into vogue among the officers there is strong traditional testimony to show that the men of the rank and file, <hi rend="italics">without general orders</hi>, of their own accord cut pieces of red from their overcoat linings, or obtained them from other sources to make patches for themselves; and, as to the shape, there are weighty reasons for believing that <hi rend="italics">any</hi> piece of red fabric, of whatsoever shape, was considered to answer the purpose, <pb id="p.257" n="257"/> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2212"/>That <quote>necessity is the mother of invention</quote> nothing can more clearly and fully demonstrate than war. I will devote this chapter to presenting some facts from the last war which illustrate this maxim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2213"/>As soon as the tocsin of war had sounded, and men were summoned to take the field, a demand was <figure id="fig.269">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2214"/>But they were somewhat old-fashioned, and, now that there was a demand for new arms, inventive genius was stimulated to produce better ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2215"/>It always has been true, and always will be, that the manufactured products for which there is an extensive demand are the articles which invention will improve upon until they arrive as near perfection as it is possible for the work of human hands to be.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2216"/>Invention was stimulated in various directions, but its products appeared most numerous, perhaps, in the changes which the arms, ammunition, and ordnance underwent in their better adaptation to the needs of the hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2228"/>When the war broke cut, the available vessels were mainly a few ships-of-the-line, frigates and screw steamers; but these could be of little service in such a warfare as was evidently on hand, a warfare which must be carried on in rivers, and <figure id="fig.271">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2230"/>But with the increase in range and calibre of naval armament came a seeking by Invention for something less vulnerable to their power, and after the encounter of the little <quote><name>Yankee</name> cheese box,</quote> so called, and the <name n="Confederate States">Rebel</name> Ram <quote><placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>,</quote> the question of what should constitute the main reliance of the navy was definitely settled, and monitors became the idols of the hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2231"/>These facts are all matters of well written history, and I refer to them now only to illustrate the truth of the maxim with which I began the chapter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2232"/><pb id="p.272" n="272"/> </p> 
<p>I wish now to give it still further emphasis by citing some illustrations which the historian has neglected for <quote>nobler game.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2233"/>Some of the inventions which I shall refer to were impractical, and had only a brief existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2234"/>Of course your small inventor and would-be benefactor to his kind clearly foresaw that men who were about to cut loose from the amenities of civil life would be likely to spend money freely in providing themselves before their departure with every-<figure id="fig.272"> 
<head>A mortar boat.</head></figure> thing portable that might have a tendency to ameliorate the condition of soldier life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2235"/>With an eye single to this idea these inventors took the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2236"/><num value="1">One</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> products of their genius which I recall was a combination <hi rend="italics">knife-fork-and-spoon</hi> arrangement, which was peddled through the state camping-grounds in great numbers and variety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2237"/>Of course every man must have <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2238"/>So much convenience in so small a compass must be taken advantage of. It was a sort of soldier's trinity, which they all thought that they understood and appreciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2239"/>But I doubt <pb id="p.273" n="273"/> whether this invention, on the average, ever got beyond the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> camp in active service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2240"/>I still have in my possession the remnants of a <hi rend="italics">waterfilterer</hi> in which I invested after enlistment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2241"/>There was a metallic mouth-piece at <num value="1">one</num> end of a small gutta-percha tube, which latter was about <measure n="15inches" type="distance">fifteen inches</measure> long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2242"/>At the other end of the tube was a suction-chamber, an inch long by <measure n="0.5inch" type="distance">a half-inch</measure> in diameter, with the end perforated, and containing a piece of bocking as a filter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2243"/>Midway of the tubing was an air-chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2244"/>The tubing long since dried <figure id="fig.273"> 
<head>A double-turreted Monitor.</head></figure> and crumbled away from the metal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2245"/>It is possible that I used this instrument half a dozen times, though I do not recall a single instance, and on breaking camp just before the <rs n="Gettysburg Campaign" type="campaign">Gettysburg Campaign</rs>, I sent it, with some other effects, northward. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2246"/>I remember another filterer, somewhat simpler.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2247"/>It consisted of the same kind of mouth-piece, with rubber tubing attached to a small conical piece of pumice-stone, through which the water was filtered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2248"/>Neither of these was ever of any practical value. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2249"/>I have spoken of the rapid improvements made in arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2250"/>This improvement extended to all classes of fire-arms alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2251"/>Revolvers were no exception, and <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Colt,,,,," id="n0006.0015.00273.00281" reg="mostcommon:Colt,nomatch:0"><surname>Colt</surname></persName>'s</hi> revolver, which monopolized the field for some time, was soon crowded in the race by <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n0006.0015.00273.00282" reg="nearbymention:Smith,W.,F.,,"><surname>Smith</surname></persName> and <persName n="Wesson,,,,," id="n0006.0015.00273.00283" reg="mostcommon:Wesson,nomatch:0"><surname>Wesson</surname></persName>, <persName n="Remington,,,,," id="n0006.0015.00273.00284" reg="mostcommon:Remington,nomatch:0"><surname>Remington</surname></persName></hi>, and others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2252"/><num value="1000">Thousands</num> of them were sold monthly, and the newly <pb id="p.274" n="274"/> fledged soldier who did not possess a revolver, either by his own purchase, or as a present from solicitous relatives, or admiring friends, or enthusiastic business associates, was something of a curiosity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2253"/>Of course a present of this kind necessitated an outfit of special ammunition, and such was at once procured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2254"/>But the personal armory of many heroes was not even then complete, and a dirk knife &mdash; a real <quote>Arkansaw toothpick</quote> --was no unusual sight to be seen hanging from the belt of some of the incipient but blood-thirsty warriors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2255"/>The little town of <placeName reg="Ashby, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049329">Ashby</placeName> in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, at <num value="1">one</num> of its earliest war-meetings, voted <quote>that each volunteer shall be provided, with a revolver, a bowie-knife, and a Bible, and shall also receive <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollars</measure> in money.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2256"/>The thought did not appear to find lodgement in the brain of the average soldier or his friends that by the time the government had provided him with what arms, ammunition, and equipments it was thought necessary for him to have, he would then be loaded with about all he could bear, without adding a personal armory and magazine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2257"/>Nor did he realize that which afterwards in his experience must have come upon him with convincing force, that by the time he had done his duty faithfully and well with the arms which the government had placed in his hands there would be little opportunity or need, even if his ambition still held out, to fall back on his personal arsenal for further supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2258"/>Members of the later regiments got their eyes open to this fact either through correspondence with men at the front, or by having been associated with others who had seen service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2259"/>But the troops of &lsquo;<num value="61">61</num> and &lsquo;<num value="62">62</num> took out hundreds of revolvers only to lose them, give them away, or throw them away; and as many regiments were forbidden by their colonels to wear them, a large number were sent back to the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2260"/>Revolvers were probably cheaper in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, in those years, than in any other state in the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2261"/>There was another invention that must have been sufficiently <pb id="p.275" n="275"/> popular to have paid the manufacturer a fair rate on his investment, and that was the steel-armor enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2262"/>There were a good many men who were anxious to be heroes, but they were particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2263"/>They preferred to be <hi rend="italics">live</hi> heroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2264"/>They were willing to go to war and fight as never man fought before, if they could only be insured against bodily harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2265"/>They were not willing to assume all the risks which an enlistment involved, without securing something in the shape of a drawback.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2266"/>Well, the iron tailors saw and appreciated the situation and sufferings of this class of men, and came to the rescue with a vest of steel armor, worth, as I remember it, about a dozen dollars, and greaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2267"/>The latter, I think, did not find so ready a market as the vests, which were comparatively common.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2268"/>These iron-clad warriors admitted that when panoplied for the fight their sensations were much as they might be if they were dressed up in an old-fashioned air-tight stove; still, with all the discomforts of this casing, they felt a little safer with it on than off in battle, and they reasoned that it was the right and duty of every man to adopt all honorable measures to assure his safety in the line of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2269"/>This seemed solid reasoning, surely; but, in spite of it all, a large number of these vests never saw Rebeldom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2270"/>Their owners were subjected to such a storm of ridicule that they could not bear up under it. It was a stale yet common joke to remind them that in action these vests must be worn behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2271"/>Then, too, the ownership of <num value="1">one</num> of them was taken as evidence of faint-heartedness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2272"/>Of this the owner was often reminded; so that when it came to the packing of the knapsack for departure, the vest, taking as it did considerable space, and adding no small weight to his already too heavy burden, was in many cases left behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2273"/>The officers, whose opportunity to take baggage along was greater, clung to them longest; but I think that they were quite generally abandoned with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> important reduction made in the luggage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2274"/><pb id="p.276" n="276"/> </p> 
<p><num value="1">One</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> supposed-to-be useful, if not ornamental stupidities, which some of the earlier troops took to themselves by order, was the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Havelock,,,,," id="n0006.0015.00276.00285" reg="mostcommon:Havelock,nomatch:0"><surname>Havelock</surname></persName></hi>. True, its invention antedated the time of which I speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2275"/>It was a foreign conception, and derived its name from an English general who distinguished himself in the war in <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName>, where they were worn in <dateStruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2276"/>It was a simple covering of white linen for the cap, _ with a cape depending for the protection of the neck from the sun. They may have been very essential to the comfort of the troops in the <rs>Eastern</rs> climate, but, while whole regiments went South with them, if <num value="1">one</num> of these articles survived active service <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> I have yet to hear of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2277"/>Then there were fancy patent-leather <figure id="fig.276"> 
<head>A Havelock.</head></figure> haversacks, with <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> compartments for the assortment of rations, which <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Sam</foreName></persName> was expected to furnish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2278"/>But those who invested in them were somewhat disgusted at a little later stage of their service, when they were ordered to throw away all such <quote>high-toned</quote> trappings and adopt the regulation pattern of painted cloth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2279"/>This was a bag about a foot square, with a broad strap for the shoulder, into which soldiers soon learned to bundle all their food and table fur-<figure id="fig.276.1"> 
<head>A haversack and dipper.</head></figure> niture, which, I think I have elsewhere stated, after a day's hard march were always found in such a delightful hodgepodge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2280"/>Now and then an invention was to be found which was a real convenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2281"/>I still have in my possession such a <num value="1">one</num>, an article which, when not in use, is a compact roll <num value="8">eight</num> and <pb id="p.277" n="277"/> <measure n="0.5inches" type="distance">one-half inches</measure> long and <measure n="2inches" type="distance">two inches</measure> in diameter, and designed to hold pens, ink, and paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2282"/>Unrolled, it makes a little tablet of the length given and <measure n="5.5inches" type="distance">five and one-half inches</measure> wide, which was my writing-desk when no better was to be had. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2283"/>The Turkish fez, with pendent tassel, was seen on the heads of some soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2284"/>Zouave regiments wore them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2285"/>They did very well to lie around camp in, and in a degree marked their owner as a somewhat conspicuous man among his fellows, but they were not tolerated on line; few of them ever survived the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> campaigning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2286"/>And this recalls the large number of the soldiers of &lsquo;<num value="62">62</num> who did not wear the forage cap furnished by the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2287"/>They bought the <quote><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0006.0015.00277.00286" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,B.,,:2"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> cap,</quote> so called, at the hatters' instead, which in most cases faded out in a month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2288"/>This the government caps did not do, with all their awkward appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2289"/>They <figure id="fig.277"> 
<head>A Zouave.</head></figure> may have been coarse and unfashionable to the eye, but the colors would stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2290"/>Nearly every man embellished his cap with the number or letter of his company and regiment and the appropriate emblem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2291"/>For infantry this emblem is a bugle, for artillery <num value="2">two</num> crossed cannons, and for cavalry <num value="2">two</num> crossed sabres. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2292"/><num value="1">One</num> other item occurs to me, not entirely germane to the chapter, yet interesting enough to warrant its insertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2293"/>This was the great care exercised to have all equipments prominently marked with the regiment, company, and State to which the owner belonged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2294"/>For example, on the back of the knapsack of every man in a regiment appeared in large lettering something like this: <orgName type="company" n="Company B">Co. B</orgName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="33NYRegiment">33d New York Regiment</orgName>; <pb id="p.278" n="278"/> or, if it was <orgName n="Light Artillery" type="artillery">light artillery</orgName>, this, <orgName type="regiment" key="10MABattery">10th Mass. Battery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2295"/>Nor did the advertising stop here, for the haversacks and canteens were often similarly labelled, and yet, at the time, it seemed necessary to somebody that it should be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2296"/>At any rate, nobody found any fault with it; and if it had been thought desirable that each article of apparel should be similarly placarded, there would have been a general acquiescence on the part of the untutored citizen soldiery, who were in the best of humor, and with <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n0006.0015.00278.00287" reg="mostcommon:Pope,John,,,:2"><surname>Pope</surname></persName> (<persName n="Alexander,,,,," id="n0006.0015.00278.00288" reg="mostcommon:Alexander,E.,Porter,,:2"><surname>Alexander</surname></persName> not <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>) seemed to agree that <quote>Whatever is is right.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2297"/>But how many of these loudly marked equipments survived the strife?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2298"/>Perhaps not <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2299"/>The knapsack may have been thrown aside in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> battle, and a simple roll composed of the woollen and rubber blanket substituted for it. The haversacks and canteens were soon lost, and new ones took their place; and they lasted just as long and were just as safe as if conspicuously marked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2300"/><num value="1">One</num> of the comical sights of the service was to see Rebel prisoners brought in having strapped on their backs knapsacks bearing just such labelling as that which I have quoted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2301"/>Of course, these were trophies which they had either taken from prisoners or had picked up on some battlefield or in the wake of the <rs>Union</rs> army, and appropriated to their own use. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2302"/>Light-artillerymen went to the front decorated with brass scales on their shoulders, but, finding an utter absence of such ornaments on the persons of soldiers who had been in action, and feeling sensitive about being known as recruits, these decorations soon disappeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2303"/>Theoretically, they were worn to ward off the blows of a sabre aimed by cavalrymen at the head; practically, it is doubtful whether they ever served such a purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2309"/>Mules vary more in size than horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2310"/>The largest and best come from <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2315"/>But the main source of supply for the <rs>Western States</rs>, where they are very generally used, for the <rs>South</rs>, and for the government, during war time, was <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2316"/>When the war broke out, efforts were made by <persName n="Magoffin,Governor,,,," id="n0006.0016.00280.00291" reg="mostcommon:Magoffin,Beriah,,,:1"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Magoffin</surname></persName> of that State-or rather by the <name>Legislature</name>, for the <rs>Governor</rs> was in full sympathy with the <rs>Rebels</rs>--to have that commonwealth remain neutral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2317"/>For this reason when the general government attempted to purchase mules there in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, they were refused; but in the course of a few weeks the neutrality nonsense was pretty thoroughly knocked out of the authorities, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> took its stand on the side of the <figure id="fig.280">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2318"/>What were these mules used for?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2319"/>Well, I have related elsewhere that, when the war broke out, <num value="1000">thousands</num> of soldiers came pouring into <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> for its defence, and afterwards went by <num value="1000">thousands</num> into other sections of Rebeldom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2320"/>To supply these soldiers with the necessary rations, forage, and camp equipage, and keep them supplied, <num value="1000">thousands</num> of wagons were necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2321"/>Some of the regiments took these wagons with them from their native State, but most did not. Some of the wagons were drawn by mules already owned by the government, and more mules were purchased from time to time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2322"/>The great advantage possessed by these animals over horses was not at that period <pb id="p.281" n="281"/> fully appreciated, so that horses were also used in large numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2323"/>But the magnitude of the <rs>Rebellion</rs> grew apace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2324"/>Regiments of cavalry, each requiring <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> horses, and <orgName n="Light Battery" type="battery">light batteries</orgName> <num value="110">one hundred and ten</num>, were now rapidly organizing, calling for an abundance of horse-flesh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2325"/>Then, disease, exposure, and hard usage consumed a great many more, so that these animals naturally grew scarcer as the demand increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2326"/>For certain kinds of work horses <hi rend="italics">must</hi> be had, mules would not do. The horse was good for any kind of service, as a beast of burden, up to the limits of his endurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2327"/>Not so his half-brother the mule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2328"/>The latter was more particular as to the kind of service he performed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2329"/><figure id="fig.281"> 
<head>A mule Eating an overcoat.</head></figure> Like a great many <hi rend="italics">bipeds</hi> that entered the army, he preferred to do military duty in the safe rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2330"/>As a consequence, if he found himself under fire at the front, he was wont to make a stir in his neighborhood until he got out of such inhospitable surroundings. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2331"/>This nervousness totally unfitted him for artillery or cavalry service ; he must therefore be made available for draft in the trains, the ammunition and forage trains, the supply and bridge trains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2332"/>So, as rapidly as it could conveniently be done, mules took the place of horses in all the trains, <num value="6">six</num> mules replacing <num value="4">four</num> horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2333"/><pb id="p.282" n="282"/> </p> 
<p>Aside from this nervousness under fire, mules have a great advantage over horses in being better able to stand hard usage, bad feed, or no feed, and neglect generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2334"/>They can travel over rough ground unharmed where horses would be lamed or injured in some way. They will eat brush, and not be very hungry to do it, either.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2335"/>When forage was short, the drivers were wont to cut branches and throw before them for their refreshment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2337"/>The operation made the driver <hi rend="italics">blue</hi>, if the diet did not thus affect the mule. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2338"/>In organizing a <num value="6">six</num>-mule team, a large pair of heavy animals were selected for the pole, a smaller size for the swing, and a still smaller pair for leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2339"/>There were advantages in this arrangement; in the first place, in going through a miry spot the small leaders soon place themselves, by their quick movements, on firm footing, where they can take hold and pull the pole mules out of the wallow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2340"/>Again, with a good heavy steady pair of wheel mules, the driver can restrain the smaller ones that are more apt to be frisky and reckless at times, and, assisted by the brake, hold back his loaded wagon in descending a hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2341"/>Then, there was more elasticity in such a team when well trained, and a good driver could handle them much more gracefully and dexterously than he could the same number of horses. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2342"/>It was really wonderful to see some of the experts drive these teams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2343"/>The driver rides the near pole mule, holding in his left hand a single rein.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2344"/>This connects with the bits of the near lead mule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2345"/>By pulling this rein, of course the brutes would go to the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2346"/>To direct them to the right <num value="1">one</num> or more short jerks of it were given, accompanied by a sort of gibberish which the mule-drivers acquired in the business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2347"/>The bits of the lead mules being connected by an iron bar, whatever movement was made by the near <num value="1">one</num> directed the movements of the off <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2348"/>The pole mules were controlled by short reins which hung over their necks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2349"/><pb id="p.283" n="283"/> The driver carried in his right hand his <hi rend="italics">black snake</hi>, that is, his black leather whip, which was used with much effect on occasion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2350"/>When mules were brought to the army they were enclosed in what was called a <hi rend="italics">corral</hi>. To this place the driver in quest of a mule must repair to make and take his selection, having the proper authority to do so. I will illustrate how it was done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2351"/>Here is a figure representing a corral, having on the inside a fence running from A to <persName n="Ad,,C.,,," id="n0006.0016.00283.00292" reg="default:Ad,C.,,,"><foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Ad</surname></persName> and be are pairs of bars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2352"/>The driver enters A the yard, mounted, and, having selected the mule he wants, drives him A corral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2353"/>toward be. The bars at Ad being up, and those at be being down, the mule advances and the bars be are put up behind him. He is now enclosed in the small space indicated by <persName><foreName>Abde</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2354"/>The mule-driver then mounts the fence, bridles the brute of his choice, lets down the bars at Ad, and takes him out. Why does he bridle him from the fence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2355"/>Well, because the mule is an uncertain animal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2356"/>In making his selection the driver did not always draw a prize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2357"/>Sometimes his mule would be kind and tractable, and sometimes not. Of course he would saddle him, and start to ride him to camp; but the mule is not always docile under the saddle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2358"/>He too often has a mind of his own. He may go along all right, or, if he is tricky, he may suddenly pause, bracing his forefeet and settling down on his hind ones, as if he had suddenly happened to think of the girl he left behind him, and was debating whether or not to go back after her. It is when the mule strikes such an attitude as this, I suppose, that <persName n="Billings,,Josh,,," id="n0006.0016.00283.00293" reg="default:Billings,Josh,,,"><foreName>Josh</foreName> <surname>Billings</surname></persName> calls him <quote>a stubborn fact.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2359"/>But the driver!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2360"/>Well, if at that moment he was off his guard, he would get off without previous preparation, as a man sometimes sits down on ice, and look at <pb id="p.284" n="284"/> the mule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2361"/>If, however, he was on the alert, and well prepared, the mule, in the end, would generally come off <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2362"/>I have referred to the <hi rend="italics">Black Snake</hi>. It was the badge of authority with which the mule-driver enforced his orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2363"/>It was the panacea for all the ills to which mule-flesh was heir.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2364"/>It was a common sight to see a <num value="6">six</num>-mule team, when <figure id="fig.284"> 
<head>Dismounted.</head></figure> left to itself, get into an entanglement, seeming inextricably mixed, unless it was unharnessed; but the appearance of the driver with his black wand would change the scene as if by magic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2365"/>As the heel-cord of <persName n="Achilles,,,,," id="n0006.0016.00284.00294" reg="mostcommon:Achilles,nomatch:0"><surname>Achilles</surname></persName> was his only vulnerable part, so the ears of the mule seemed to be the development through which his reasoning faculties could be the most quickly and surely reached, and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> cracks of the whip on or near these little monuments, accompanied by the driver's very expressive ejaculation in the mule tongue, which I can only describe as a kind of cross between an unearthly screech and a groan, had the effect to disentangle them unaided, and make them stand as if at a <quote>present</quote> to their master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2366"/>When off duty in camp, they were usually hitched to the pole of their wagon, <num value="3">three</num> on either side, and here, between meals, they were often as antic as kittens or puppies at play, leaping from <num value="1">one</num> side of the pole to the <pb id="p.285" n="285"/> other, lying down, tumbling over, and biting each other, until perhaps all <num value="6">six</num> would be an apparently confused heap of mule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2367"/>If the driver appeared at such a crisis with his black <quote>ear-trumpet,</quote> <num value="1">one</num> <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> was long enough to dissolve the pile into its original mule atoms, and arrange them again on either side of the pole, looking as orderly and innocent as if on inspection. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2368"/>An educated mule-driver was, in his little sphere, as competent a disciplinarian as the colonel of a regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2369"/>Nor <figure id="fig.285"> 
<head>Oats for <num value="6">six</num>.</head></figure> did he always secure the prompt and exact obedience above described by applications of the <rs>Black Snake</rs> alone, or even when accompanied by the sternest objurgations delivered in the mule dialect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2370"/>He was a terror to his subjects in yet another way: and old soldiers will sustain me in the assertion that the propulsive power of the mule-driver was increased many fold by the almost unlimited stock of profanity with which he greeted the sensitive ears of his muleship when the latter was stubborn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2371"/>I have seen mules, but now most obdurate, jump into their collars the next moment <pb id="p.286" n="286"/> with the utmost determination to do their whole duty when <num value="1">one</num> of these <name type="weapon">Gatling guns</name> of curses opened fire upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2372"/>Some reader may prefer to adjudge as a reason for this good behavior the fear of the <rs>Black Snake</rs>, which was likely to be applied close upon the volley of oaths; but I prefer to assign as a motive the mule's interest in the advancement of good morals. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2373"/>In all seriousness, however, dealing only with the fact, without attempting to prove or deny justification for it, it is undoubtedly true that the mule-drivers, when duly aroused, could produce a deeper cerulean tint in the surrounding atmosphere than any other class of men in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2374"/>The theory has been advanced that if all of these professional m. d.&lsquo;s in the trains of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> could have been put into the trenches around <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, in the fall of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, and have been safely advanced to within ear-shot of the enemy, then, at a signal, set to swearing simultaneously at their <hi rend="italics">level-worst</hi>, the <rs>Rebels</rs> would either have thrown down their arms and surrendered then and there, or have fled incontinently to the fastnesses of the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2375"/>There may have been devout mule-drivers in <orgName n="army"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0006.0016.00286.00295" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:1"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, but I never saw <num value="1">one</num> east.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2376"/>They may have been pious on taking up this important work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2377"/>They were certainly impious before laying it down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2378"/>Nevertheless, in these later days, when they are living better lives, any twinge of conscience which they may occasionally feel must be relieved by the knowledge that <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0006.0016.00286.00296" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> has given them credit for being able to swear a mule-team out of the mud when it could not be moved by any other process. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2379"/>I have stated that the mule was uncertain; I mean as to his intentions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2380"/>He cannot be trusted even when appearing honest and affectionate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2381"/>His reputation as a kicker is worldwide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2382"/>He was the <name>Mugwump</name> of the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2383"/>The mule that will not kick is a curiosity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2384"/>A veteran relates how, after the <rs n="Battle of Antietam" type="battle">battle of Antietam</rs>, he saw a colored mule-driver <pb id="p.287" n="287"/> approach his mules that were standing unhitched from the wagons, when, presto!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2385"/><num value="1">one</num> of them knocked him to the ground in a twinkling with <num value="1">one</num> of those unexpected instantaneous kicks, for which the mule is peerless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2386"/>Slowly picking himself up, the negro walked deliberately to his wagon, took out a long stake the size of his arm, returned with the same moderate pace to his muleship, dealt him a stunning blow on the head with the stake, which felled him to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2387"/>The stake was returned with the same deliberation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2388"/>The mule lay quiet for a moment, then arose, shook his head, a truce was declared, and driver and mule were at peace and understood each other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2389"/>Here is another illustration of misplaced confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2390"/>On the road to <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, after the <rs>Antietam</rs> campaign in <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, the colored cook of the headquarters of the <orgName type="regiment" key="60NYRegiment">Sixtieth New York Regiment</orgName> picked up a large and respectable looking mule, to whom, with a cook's usual foresight and ambition, he attached all the paraphernalia of the cook-house together with his own personal belongings, and settled himself down proudly on his back among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2391"/>All went on serenely for a time, the mule apparently accepting the situation with composure, until the <rs>Potomac</rs> was reached at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2392"/>On arriving in the middle of the pontoon bridge upon which the army was crossing, from some unexplained reason &mdash; perhaps because, on looking into the water, he saw himself as others saw him &mdash; the mule lifted up his voice in <num value="1">one</num> of those soul-harrowing brays, for which he is famous &mdash; or infamous &mdash; and, lifting his hind legs aloft, in the next moment tossed his entire burden of cook and cookhouse into the river, where, weighted <hi rend="italics">down</hi> with messkettles and other utensils of his craft, the cook must have drowned had not members of the regiment come to his rescue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2393"/>Not at all daunted by this experience, the cookey harnessed the mule again as before, led him across the remaining portion of the bridge, where he remounted and settled himself among his household goods once more, where <pb id="p.288" n="288"/> all was well till the <rs>Shenandoah</rs> was reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2394"/>Here, with another premonitory blast of his nasal trumpet, the mule once more dumped his load into the rapid rolling river, <figure id="fig.288"> 
<head>Dumped into the <rs>Potomac</rs>.</head></figure> when the cook lost all confidence in mules as beasts of burden, and abandoned him. </p>

This same humorist must have had some experience with the mule, for he has said some very bright and pat things concerning him. Here are a few that I recall:-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2396"/><quote>To break a mule-begin at his head.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2397"/></p> 
<p><quote> To find the solid contents of a mule's hind leg, feel of it clussly.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2399"/></p> 
<p><quote>The only thing which makes a mule so highly respectable is the great accuracy of his kicking.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2400"/></p> 
<p><quote>The mule is a sure-footed animal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2401"/>I have known <pb id="p.289" n="289"/> him to kick a man <measure n="15feet" type="distance">fifteen feet</measure> off <num value="10">ten</num> times in a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2402"/></p> 
<p>These are a few samples, most all of which have reference to his great ability as a kicker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2403"/>Unquestionably he had no equal in this field of amusement &mdash; to him. His legs were small, his feet were small, but his ambition in this direction was large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2404"/>He <hi rend="italics">could</hi> kick with wonderful accuracy, as a matter of fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2405"/>Mule-drivers tell me he could kick a fly off his ear, as he walked along in the team, with unerring accuracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2406"/>This being so, of course larger objects were never missed when they were within range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2407"/>But the distance included within a mule's range had often to be decided by <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> expensive tests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2408"/><num value="1">One</num> driver, whom I well knew, was knocked over with a mule's hind foot while standing <hi rend="italics">directly in front of him</hi>. This shows something of their range. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2409"/>I have remarked, in substance, that the mule was conquered only by laying hold of or striking his ears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2410"/>It may be asked how he was shod if he was such a kicker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2411"/>To do this, <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="2">two</num> methods was adopted; either to sling him up as oxen are slung, then strap his feet; or walk him into a noose, and cast him, by drawing it around his legs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2412"/>Of course, he would struggle violently for a while, but when he gave in it was all over for that occasion, and he was as docile under the smith's hands as a kitten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2413"/>Being surerfooted and more agile than a horse, of course he gets into fewer bad places or entanglements; but once in, and having made a desperate struggle for his relief, and failing, he seems utterly discouraged, and neither whip nor persuasion can move him. Then, as in the shoeing, the driver can handle him with the utmost disregard of heels; but when once on his feet again, stand aside!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2414"/>He has a short memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2415"/>He lives in the future, and his heels are in business, as usual, at the old stand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2416"/>I need not comment on the size of the mule's ears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2417"/>Of course, everybody who has seen them knows them to be abnormal <pb id="p.290" n="290"/> in size.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2418"/>But disproportionately large though they may be, there is <num value="1">one</num> other organ in his possession which surpasses them; that is his voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2419"/>This is something simply tremendous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2420"/>That place which the guinea-fowl occupies among the feathered bipeds of the barn-yard in this respect, the mule holds <hi rend="italics">facile princes</hi> among the domestic quadrupeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2421"/>The poets who lived in the same time with <persName n="Pericles,,,,," id="n0006.0016.00290.00298" reg="mostcommon:Pericles,nomatch:0"><surname>Pericles</surname></persName> said of the latter that <quote>he lightened, thundered, and agitated all <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName>,</quote> so powerful was his eloquence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2422"/>So, likewise, when <figure id="fig.290"> 
<head>The <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> of the regiment.</head></figure> the mule raised his voice, all opposition was silent before him, for nothing short of rattling, crashing thunder, as it seemed, could successfully compete for precedence with him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2423"/>In addition to his great usefulness in the train, he was used a good deal under a pack-saddle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2424"/>Each regiment usually had <num value="1">one</num>, that brought up the rear on the march, loaded with the implements of the cook-house &mdash; sometimes with nothing to be seen but head and tail, so completely was he covered in. They were generally convoyed by a colored man. Sometimes these strong-minded creatures, in crossing a stream, would decide to lie down, all encumbered as they were, right in the middle, and down they would settle in spite of the ludicrous opposition and pathetic protests <pb id="p.291" n="291"/> of the convoy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2425"/>Of course, it was no balm to his wound to have the passing column of soldiers keep up a running fire of banter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2426"/>But there was no redress or relief to be had until his muleship got ready to move, which was generally after every ounce of his burden had been stripped off and placed on terra firma. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2427"/>When the army was lying in line of battle in such close proximity to the enemy that the ammunition wagons could not safely approach it, <measure n="2boxes" type="mass">two boxes</measure> were taken and strapped on a mule, <num value="1">one</num> on each side, <quote>to keep his balance true,</quote> and thus the troops were supplied when needed. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2429"/>Rations were furnished in the same manner under similar circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2430"/>But now and then a mule would lie down under his burden, and refuse to budge. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2433"/>I believe I have stated that the mule much preferred to do military duty in the safe rear; but if there was anything which the war proved with the utmost clearness to both <persName n="Yanks,,,,," id="n0006.0016.00291.00300" reg="mostcommon:Yanks,nomatch:0"><surname>Yanks</surname></persName> and Rebs, it was that there was surely no safe rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2434"/>This being so, the vivacious mule did not always have a plain and peaceful pilgrimage as a member of the wagontrain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2435"/>I vividly recall the enjoyment of my company, during <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0006.0016.00291.00301" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:1"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s final retreat, whenever our guns were unlimbered, as they were again and again, to be trained on the columns of retreating wagon-trains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2436"/>The explosion of a shell or <num value="2">two</num> over or among them would drive the long-ears <pb id="p.292" n="292"/> wild, and render them utterly unmanageable, and the driver's best and often his <hi rend="italics">only</hi> recourse was to let them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2437"/>go if there was room ahead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2438"/>But <num value="1">one</num> demoralized, disorganized <num value="6">six</num>-mule team would sometimes so effectively block the way, when the road was narrow, and the pursuit close, as to cause the capture of that part of the train behind it. Were any ex-Johnny m. d. to read this chuckling over the misfortunes of his craft, and not quite appreciate my enjoyment, I <figure id="fig.292"> 
<head>Mules loaded with ammunition.</head></figure> should at once assure him that there are some <persName n="Yank,,,,," id="n0006.0016.00292.00302" reg="mostcommon:Yank,nomatch:0"><surname>Yank</surname></persName> m. d.&lsquo;s who <hi rend="italics">call</hi> heartily sympathize with him, having had a like experience. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2439"/>From what I have stated, it will be seen that the mule would be very unreliable in cavalry service, for in action he would be so wild that if he did not dismount his rider he would carry even the most valiant from the scene of conflict, or, what was just as likely, rush madly into the ranks of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2440"/>The same observations would suit equally well as objections to his service with artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2441"/>On the <dateStruct value="1865-04-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year>1865</year>,</dateStruct> during the retreat of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0006.0016.00292.00303" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:1"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, we came upon a batch of wagons and a battery of steel guns, of the <rs>Armstrong</rs> <pb id="p.293" n="293"/> pattern, I think, which <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0006.0016.00293.00304" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,Philip,H.,,:1"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>'s troopers had cut out of the enemy's retreating trains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2442"/>The guns had apparently never been used since their arrival from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2443"/>The harnesses were of russet leather and equally new; but the battery was drawn by a sorry-looking lot of horses and mules, indiscriminately mingled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2444"/>My explanation for finding the mules thus tackled was that horses were scarce, and that it was not expected to use the guns at present, but simply to get them off safely; but that if it became necessary to use them they could do so with comparative safety to the mules as the guns were of very long range. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2445"/>I should have pronounced these particular mules safe anywhere, even under a hot fire, if extreme emaciation had been a sure index of departed strength and nerve in this variety of brute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2446"/>But that is not mule at all. The next day, at <placeName reg="Sailor's Creek, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2646522">Sailor's Creek</placeName>, my corps (<num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num>), after a short, sharp contest, made a capture of <num value="13">thirteen</num> flags, <num value="3">three</num> guns, <measure n="1300" type="prisoners">thirteen hundred prisoners</measure>, and over <num value="200">two hundred</num> army wagons, with their mules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2447"/>And such mules!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2448"/>the skinniest and boniest animals that I ever saw still retaining life, I sincerely believe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2449"/>For a full week they had been on the go, night and day, with rare and brief halts for rest or food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2450"/>Just before their capture they would seem to have gone down a long hill into a valley, a literal Valley of Humiliation as it proved, for there they were compelled to stay and surrender, either from inability to climb the opposite hill and get away, or else because there was not opportunity for them to do so before our forces came upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2451"/>And yet, in spite of the worn and wasted state of those teams, it is doubtful if their kicking capacity was materially reduced by it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2452"/>The question frequently raised among old soldiers is, What became of all the army mules?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2453"/>There are <num value="1000">thousands</num> of these men who will take a solemn oath that they never saw a dead mule during the war.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2482"/>The sketch embodied in this chapter is an attempt in a limited space to give the public a more adequate idea of the <orgName n="Medical Department" type="department">medical department</orgName> of the army, what it was, how it grew up, and something of what it accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2483"/>I enter upon it with a quasi-apology for its incompleteness, understanding fully how inadequate any mere sketch must be regarded by those whose labors in this department made its record <num value="1">one</num> of the most remarkable in the history of the war; yet, like all the other topics treated in this volume, it must undergo abridgment, and I can only hope that what is presented will, in some degree, do justice to this much neglected but very interesting theme in the <rs>Rebellion</rs>'s annals. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2484"/>At the time of the <rs n="Battle of Bull Run" type="battle">battle of Bull Run</rs> there was no plan in operation by which the wounded in that battle were cared for. Before this engagement took place, while the troops were lying in and around <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, general hospitals had been established to provide for the sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2485"/>For this purpose <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> hotels, seminaries, and infirmaries, in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and <placeName reg="Georgetown, Washington, District of Columbia" key="tgn,7015724">Georgetown</placeName>, and <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> in <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, had been taken possession of, and these were all the hospital accommodations to be found at the end of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>. So general was the opinion that the war <pb id="p.299" n="299"/> would be speedily ended no <num value="1">one</num> thought of such a thing as building permanent structures for hospital purposes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2486"/>But this condition of affairs soon after changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2487"/>Preparations for war were made on a grander scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2488"/>The <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>, under the moulding hands of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0006.0017.00299.00310" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,B.,,:2"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, was assuming form, and the appointment by him, <dateStruct value="1861-08-12"><month reg="08">Aug.</month> <day reg="12">12</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, of <persName n="Tripler,Surgeon,Charles,S.,," id="n0006.0017.00299.00311" reg="default:Tripler,Charles,S.,,"><roleName n="Surgeon">Surgeon</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Tripler</surname></persName> as medical director of that army indicated a purpose of having a <orgName n="Medical Department" type="department">medical department</orgName> set on foot and put in completeness for active service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2489"/>Let us pause and glance at the situation as he found it, and we may, perhaps, the better appreciate the full magnitude of the task which he had before him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2490"/>Army Regulations were the written law to which it was attempted to have everything conform as far as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2491"/>But when these regulations were drafted, there was no expectation of such a war as finally came upon us, and to attempt to confine so large an army as then existed to them as a guide was as impossible and absurd as for the full-grown man to wear the suit of clothes he cast off at <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2492"/><quote> New times demand new measures and new men,</quote> and so in certain directions Army Regulations had to be ignored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2493"/>For example, they provided only for the establishment of regimental and general hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2494"/>A regimental hospital is what its name indicates &mdash; the hospital of a particular regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2495"/>But if such a hospital became full or received some patients whose ailments were not likely to submit readily to treatment, such cases were sent to a <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="General Hospital">General Hospital</placeName></hi>, that is, <num value="1">one</num> into which patients were taken regardless of the regiment to which they belonged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2496"/>But in these early war times, in the absence of a system, any patient who was able could, at his pleasure, leave <num value="1">one</num> general hospital and go to another for any reason which seemed sufficient to him, or he could desert the service entirely. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2497"/>By general orders issued from the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">war department</orgName> <dateStruct value="1861-05-25"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="25">25</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, governors of States were directed to appoint a <pb id="p.300" n="300"/> surgeon and assistant surgeon for each regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2498"/>The men appointed were for the most part country physicians, many of them with little practice, who, on reaching the field, were, in some respects, as ignorant of their duties under the changed conditions as if they had not been educated to the practice of medicine; and the <rs type="role" reg="medical-Director">medical director</rs> of the army found his hands more than full in attempting to get them to carry out his wishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2499"/>So, to simplify his labors and also to increase the efficiency of his department, brigade hospitals were organized about the beginning of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, and by general orders from the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">war department</orgName> brigade surgeons were appointed, with the rank of major, and assigned to the staffs of brigadier-generals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2500"/>These brigade surgeons had supervision of the surgeons of their brigades, and exercised this duty under the instructions of the <rs type="role" reg="medical-Director">medical director</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2501"/>The regimental hospitals in the field were sometimes tents, and sometimes dwellings or barns near camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2502"/>It was partly to relieve these that brigade hospitals were established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2503"/>The latter were located near their brigade or division. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2504"/>The hospital tent I have already described at some length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2505"/>I may add here that those in use for hospital purposes before the war were <measure n="24feet" type="distance">24 feet</measure> long by <measure n="14feet" type="distance">14 feet</measure> <measure n="6inches" type="distance">6 inches</measure> wide, and <measure n="11feet" type="distance">11 feet</measure> <measure n="6inches" type="distance">6 inches</measure> high, but, owing to their great bulk and weight, and the difficulty of pitching them in windy weather, the size was reduced, in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, to <measure n="14feet" type="distance">14 feet</measure> by <measure n="14feet" type="distance">14 feet</measure> <measure n="6inches" type="distance">6 inches</measure>, and <measure n="11feet" type="distance">11 feet</measure> high in the centre, with the walls <measure n="4feet" type="distance">4 feet</measure> <measure n="6inches" type="distance">6 inches</measure>, and a <quote>fly</quote> <measure n="21feet" type="distance">21 feet</measure> <measure n="6inches" type="distance">6 inches</measure> by <measure n="14feet" type="distance">14 feet</measure>. Each of these was designed to accommodate <num value="8">eight</num> patients comfortably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2506"/>Army Regulations assigned <num value="3">three</num> such tents to a regiment, together with <num value="1">one</num> <persName n="Sibley,,,,," id="n0006.0017.00300.00312" reg="mostcommon:Sibley,Henry,,,:2"><surname>Sibley</surname></persName> and <num value="1">one</num> Wedge or A tent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2507"/>The <persName n="Sibley,,,,," id="n0006.0017.00300.00313" reg="mostcommon:Sibley,Henry,,,:2"><surname>Sibley</surname></persName> tent I have likewise quite fully described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2508"/>I will only add here that, not having a <quote>fly,</quote> it was very hot in warm weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2509"/>Then, on account of its centre pole and the absence of walls, it was quite contracted and inconvenient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2510"/>For these reasons it was little used for hospital purposes, and not used at all after the early part of the war. <pb id="p.301" n="301"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2511"/>The hospital tents in the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> were heated, for the most part, by what was called, for some reason, the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> Plan</hi>. This consisted of a pit, dug just outside of the hospital door, <measure n="2.5feet" type="distance">two and a half feet</measure> deep, from which a trench passed through the tent, terminating outside the other end in a chimney, built of barrels, or in such a manner as I have elsewhere described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2512"/>This trench was covered throughout its entire extent with iron plates, which were issued by the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">quartermaster's department</orgName> for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2513"/>The radiation of the heat from the plates kept the tent very comfortable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2514"/>The honor of organizing the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> field hospital in tents is said to belong to <persName n="Irwin,Doctor,B.,J.,D.," id="n0006.0017.00301.00314" reg="default:Irwin,B.,J.,D.,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Irwin</surname></persName>, <orgName n="U. S. Army">U. S. A.</orgName>, of the <orgName n="Army of the Ohio" type="army">Army of the Ohio</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2515"/>It occurred at the <rs n="Battle of Shiloh" type="battle">battle of Shiloh</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2516"/>While establishing a hospital near the <rs type="place">camp of Prentiss'</rs> division of that army, which had been captured the day before, the abandoned tents still standing suggested themselves to him as a convenient receptacle for his wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2517"/>He at once appropriated the camp for this purpose, and laid it out in systematic form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2518"/>It was clearly shown by this and succeeding experiences during the war that the wounded treated under canvas did better and recovered more rapidly than those treated in permanent hospitals. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2519"/>As fast as they could be procured, hospital tents were furnished, <num value="3">three</num> to a regiment, in accordance with the provision of Army Regulations referred to. Each regiment provided its own nurses and cooks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2520"/>In general hospitals <num value="1">one</num> nurse was allowed to <num value="10">ten</num> patients, and <num value="1">one</num> cook to <num value="30">thirty</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2521"/>The capacity of a regimental hospital tent, like a stagecoach, varied according to the demand for room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2522"/>I have said they were designed to accommodate <num value="8">eight</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2523"/>An old army surgeon says, <quote>Only <num value="6">six</num> can be comfortably accommodated in <num value="1">one</num> of them, <num value="3">three</num> on each side.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2524"/>But when the surgeons were crowded with the wounded, it was a common practice to set <num value="2">two</num> long narrow boards edgewise through the centre <pb id="p.302" n="302"/> of the tent, about <measure n="20inches" type="distance">twenty inches</measure> apart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2525"/>If boards were wanting, <num value="2">two</num> good-sized <hi rend="italics">poles</hi> were cut and used instead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2526"/>Between these was the passage for the surgeons and nurses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2527"/>Behind the boards or poles a filling of straw or fine boughs was made and covered with blankets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2528"/>On these latter could be placed <num value="20">twenty</num> patients, <num value="10">ten</num> on either side; but they were crowded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2529"/>When <num value="6">six</num> single cots were put in <num value="1">one</num> of these tents, <num value="3">three</num> on each side, ample space was afforded to pass among them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2530"/>In the latter part of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, the government, realizing its pressing needs, began to build general hospitals for the comfort <figure id="fig.302"> 
<head>A <num value="2">two</num>-wheeled ambulance.</head></figure> and accommodation of its increasing <num value="1000">thousands</num> of sick and wounded, continuing to build, as the needs increased, to the very last year of the war, when they numbered <num value="205">two hundred and five</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2531"/>Before the civil war, the government had never been supplied with carriages to convey the sick and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2532"/>Only <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> before, a board, appointed by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">secretary of war</rs>, had adopted for experiment a <num value="4">four</num>-wheeled and a <num value="2">two</num>-wheeled carriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2533"/>The <num value="4">four</num>-wheeled vehicle was tried in an expedition sent into <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName>, and was favorably reported on; the <num value="2">two</num>-wheeled was never tested, but was judged to be the best adapted to badly wounded men <pb id="p.303" n="303"/> (though the contrary proved to be the fact), and so the board reported in favor of adopting these carriages in the ratio of <num value="5">five</num> <num value="2">two</num>-wheeled to <num value="1">one</num> <num value="4">four</num>-wheeled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2535"/>This was stopped, for a time at least, and an order was issued, leaving <num value="1">one</num> to a regiment and requiring the rest to be turned over to the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">quartermaster's department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2536"/>But the perversion of ambulances from their proper use, I will add in passing, continued, to a greater or less extent, till the end of the war.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2537"/>The most important steps taken towards organizing the <orgName n="Medical Department" type="department">medical department</orgName>, and placing it on that thorough basis which distinguished it in the later years of the war, were the result of the foresight, energy, and skilful management of <persName n="Letterman,Doctor,Jonathan,,," id="n0006.0017.00303.00317" reg="default:Letterman,Jonathan,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>Jonathan</foreName> <surname>Letterman</surname></persName>, who was made medical director of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> on the <dateStruct value="1862-06-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.

<p>All of the ambulances belonging to an <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> were to be placed under the control of the <rs type="role" reg="medical-Director">medical director</rs> of that corps, for now, in addition to a medical director of the army, there was a subordinate medical director for each <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2546"/>Such an <orgName n="Ambulance Corps" type="corps">ambulance corps</orgName> was put into the hands of a captain as commandant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2547"/>This corps was divided and subdivided into division, brigade, and regimental trains, corresponding to the divisions of the <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> to which it belonged, having a first lieutenant in charge of a division, a second lieutenant in charge of a brigade, and a sergeant in charge of a regimental detachment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2548"/>Besides these, <num value="3">three</num> privates, <num value="1">one</num> of them being the driver, were to accompany each ambulance on the march and in battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2549"/>The duties of all these men, both officers and privates, were very carefully defined, as well for camp as for the march and battle.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2551"/>In addition to the foregoing articles, which were carefully assorted both as to quantity and quality, each ambulance was required to carry in the box beneath the driver's seat, under lock and key, the following articles:-- </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2553"/>There was another scheme, which was conceived and carried into execution by <persName n="Letterman,Doctor,,,," id="n0006.0017.00305.00321" reg="nearbymention:Letterman,Jonathan,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Letterman</surname></persName>, which deserves mention in this connection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2554"/>This was the establishment of <persName n="Hospitals,,Field,,," id="n0006.0017.00305.00322" reg="default:Hospitals,Field,,,"><foreName>Field</foreName> <surname>Hospitals</surname></persName>, <quote>in order that the wounded might receive the most prompt and efficient attention during and after an engagement, and that the necessary operations might be performed by the most skilful and responsible surgeons, at the earliest moment.</quote>

<head>A <num value="4">four</num>-wheeled ambulance.</head></figure> being sent to general hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2556"/>But there was no recognized system and efficiency in regard to it. Just before an engagement, a field hospital for each division was established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2557"/>It was made by pitching a suitable number of hospital tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2558"/>The location of such a hospital was left to the <rs type="role" reg="medical-Director">medical director</rs> of the corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2559"/>Of course, it must be in the rear of the division, out of all danger and in a place easily reached by the ambulances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2560"/>A division hospital of this description was under the charge of a surgeon, who was selected by the <rs type="role" reg="Surgeon-in-Chief">surgeon-in-chief</rs> of the division.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2561"/>With him was an assistant surgeon, similarly appointed, whose duty it was to pitch the tents, provide straw, fuel, water, etc., and, in general, make everything ready for the comfort of the wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2562"/>For <pb id="p.306" n="306"/> doing this the hospital stewards and nurses of the division were placed under his charge, and special details made from the regiments to assist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2563"/>A kitchen or cook-tent must be at once erected and the cooks put in possession of the articles mentioned as carried in the ambulance boxes and hospitalwagons, so that a sufficient amount of nourishing food could be prepared for immediate use. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2564"/>Another <rs type="role" reg="assistant-Surgeon">assistant surgeon</rs> was detailed to keep a complete record of patients, with name, rank, company, and regiment, the nature of their wound, its treatment, etc. He was also required to see to the proper interment of those who died, and the placing of properly marked head-boards at their graves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2565"/>Then, there were in each of these division hospitals <num value="3">three</num> surgeons, selected from the whole division, <quote>without regard to rank, but solely on account of their known prudence, judgment, and skill,</quote> whose duty it was to perform all important operations, or, at least, be responsible for their performance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2566"/><num value="3">Three</num> other medical officers were detailed to assist these <num value="3">three</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2567"/>Nor was this all, for the remaining medical officers of the division, except <num value="1">one</num> to a regiment, were also required to report at once to the hospital, to act as dressers of wounds and assistants generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2568"/>In addition to these, a proper number of nurses and attendants were detailed to be on hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2569"/>The medical officers left with regiments were required to establish themselves during the fighting in the rear of their respective organizations, at such a distance as not to unnecessarily expose themselves, where they could give such temporary aid to the wounded as they should stand in need of. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2570"/>I have said that these hospitals were to be located out of all danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2571"/>That statement needs a little modifying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2572"/>In case the tide of battle turned against our army and it was compelled to retreat, what was before a safe place might at once be converted into a place of great danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2573"/>But a hospital could not be struck and its patients moved at a <pb id="p.307" n="307"/> moment's or even a day's warning, as a rule, and so it was made the duty of the <rs type="role" reg="medical-Director">medical director</rs> of a corps to select a sufficient number of medical officers, who, in case a retreat was found necessary, should remain in charge of the wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2574"/>When the <rs>Rebels</rs> captured such a hospital, it was their general practice to <hi rend="italics">parole</hi> all the inmates &mdash; that is, require them to give their word of honor that they would not bear arms again until they had been properly exchanged <figure id="fig.307"> 
<head>A medicine wagon.</head></figure> as prisoners of war. Our government established what were known as parole camps, where such prisoners were required to remain until duly exchanged. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2575"/>I think it can now be readily understood, from even this fragmentary sketch, how the establishment of these field hospitals facilitated the care of the wounded, and, by their systematic workings, saved hundreds of lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2576"/>With a skilful, energetic man as medical director of the army, giving his orders to medical directors of corps, and these carefully superintending surgeons-in-chief of divisions, who, in turn, held the surgeons and assistant surgeons and officers of <orgName n="Ambulance Corps" type="corps">ambulance corps</orgName> to a strict accountability for a careful performance of their duties, while the latter fortified themselves by judicious oversight of <hi rend="italics">their</hi> subordinates, the result <pb id="p.308" n="308"/> was to place this department of the army on a footing which endured, with the most profitable of results to the service, till the close of the war. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2581"/>The surgeon had just completed an operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2582"/>It was the amputation of an arm about <measure n="5inches" type="distance">five inches</measure> below the shoulder, the stump being now carefully dressed and bandaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2583"/>As soon as the patient recovered from the effects of the ether, the attendants raised him to a sitting posture on the operating-table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2584"/>At that moment the thought of his wounded arm returned to him, and, turning his eyes towards it, they met only the projecting stub.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2585"/>The awful reality dawned upon him for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2586"/>An arm had gone forever, and he dropped backwards on the table in a swoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2587"/>Many a poor fellow like him brought to the operator's table came to consciousness only to miss an arm or a leg which perhaps he had begged in his last conscious moments to have spared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2588"/>But the <rs type="role" reg="medical-Officer">medical officers</rs> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> mentioned decided all such cases, and the patient had only to submit.

<p>It has been charged that limbs and arms were often uselessly sacrificed by the operators; that they were especially fond of amputating, and just as likely to amputate for a flesh-wound as for a fractured bone, on the ground that they could do it more quickly than they could dress the wound; <figure id="fig.309"> 
<head>A Folding Litter.</head></figure> that it made a neater job, thus gratifying professional pride: but how the victim might feel about it or be affected by it then or thereafter did not seem to enter their thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2595"/>But the corporal talked the matter over with a wounded cavalryman (this was a year when cavalrymen were wounded quite generally) and decided that his leg must <hi rend="italics">not</hi> <pb id="p.310" n="310"/> come off; so, obtaining the loaded revolver of his comrade, he put it under his pillow and awaited the reappearance of the surgeon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2604"/>At this the men stepped back, and the surgeon tried to reason with the corporal, assuring him that in no other way could his life be saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2605"/>But the corporal persisted in declaring that if he died it should be with both legs <hi rend="italics">on</hi>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2606"/>At that <quote>Sawbones</quote> (as the men used to call them) lost his temper and sought out the surgeon in general charge, with whom he soon returned to the corporal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2625"/>There were always plenty of men who hadn't the interests of the cause so nearly at heart but what they could be induced, without much persuasion, when bullets and shells were flying thick, to leave the front line and escort a suffering comrade to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2626"/>Very often such a sufferer found a larger body-guard than could well make his needs a pretext for their absence from the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2647"/>But the wounded officer was heavy, and it was, as can readily be seen, an awkward way of carrying him. Moreover, his wound was a serious <num value="1">one</num>,--mortal as it soon proved,and every movement of ours tortured him so that he begged of us to leave him there to die. Just then we caught sight of a stretcher on which a wounded Rebel was lying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2648"/>Some Union stretcher-bearers had been taking him to the rear when the flank attack occurred, when they evidently abandoned him to look out for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2649"/>It was not a time for sentiment; so, with the sergeant at <num value="1">one</num> end of the stretcher and the narrator at the other, our wounded enemy was rolled off, with as much care as time would allow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2650"/>With the aid of our other comrades we soon put the lieutenant in his place, and, raising the stretcher to our shoulders, started down the road to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2651"/>We had gone but a few rods, however, before the enemy's sharpshooters or outposts fired on us, driving us to seek safety in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2652"/>But it was now dusk, and no easy matter to take such a burden through woods, especially as it rapidly grew darker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2653"/>Suffice it to know, however, that, after more than an hour's wandering and plunging, our burden was delivered at the ambulance, where another of our lieutenants, also mortally wounded, was afterwards to join him. This fragment of personal experience will well illustrate some of the many obstacles which stretcher-bearers had to contend with, and disclose the further truth that in actual combat the chances for severely wounded men to be taken from the field were few indeed, for at such a time stretcherbearers, like the proverbial <quote>good men,</quote> are scarce.

<p>I omitted to say in the proper connection that the men whose wounds were dressed in the field hospitals were transported as rapidly as convenient to the general hospitals, where the best of care and attention could be given them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2655"/>Such hospitals were located in various places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2656"/>Whenever it was possible, transportation was by water, in steamers specially fitted up for such a purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2664"/>The articles included in his outfit were a cap or hat (usually the former), blouse, overcoat, dress coat, trousers, shirts, drawers, socks, shoes, a woollen and a rubber blanket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2665"/>This was the wardrobe of the <hi rend="italics">infantry</hi>. It should be said, however, that many regiments never drew a dress coat after leaving the state, the blouse serving as the substitute for that garment.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2667"/>This outfit was not sufficient to last the year through, for various reasons, and so the quartermaster supplied duplicates of the garments when needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2668"/>But whatever was drawn from him beyond the amount allowed by the government was charged to the individual, and deducted from his <pb id="p.317" n="317"/> pay at the end of the year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2670"/>The infantry made way with a large amount of clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2671"/>Much of it was thrown away on the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2672"/>A soldier burdened with a musket, from <num value="40">forty</num> to <num value="80">eighty</num> rounds of ammunition, according to circumstances; a haversack stuffed plump as a pillow, but not so soft, with <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> rations; a canteen of water, a woollen and rubber blanket, and <num value="0.5">a half</num> shelter tent, would be likely to take just what more he was obliged to.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2675"/>At the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> start from camp many would burden themselves with much more than the above, but after a few miles tramp the roadside would be sprinkled with the cast-away articles.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2680"/>When the infantry were ordered in on a charge, they always left their knapsacks behind them, which they might or might not see again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2681"/>And whenever they were surprised and compelled to fall back hastily, they were likely to throw aside everything that impeded their progress except musket and ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2682"/>Then, in the heat of battle, again there was a dispensing with all encumbrances that would impair <pb id="p.318" n="318"/> their efficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2683"/>For these and other reasons, the governmental allowances would not have been at all adequate to cover the losses in clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2684"/>Recognizing this fact, the government supplied new articles gratis for everything lost in action, the quartermaster being required to make out a list of all such articles, and to certify that they were so lost, before new ones could be obtained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2685"/>But the men who did garrison duty were not exempt from long clothing bills more than were those who were active at the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2686"/>I have in mind the heavy artillerymen who garrisoned the forts around <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2687"/>They were in receipt of visits at all hours in the day from the most distinguished of military and civil guests, and on this account were not only obliged to be efficient in drill but showy on parade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2688"/>Hence their clothing had always to be of the best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2689"/>No patched or untidy garments were tolerated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2690"/>In the spring of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, <num value="24000">twenty-four thousand</num> of these men were despatched as reenforcements to the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> of the <figure id="fig.318">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2691"/>They were soldiers, for the most part, who had enlisted early in the war, and, having had so safe &mdash; or, as the boys used to say, <quote>soft</quote> --and easy a time of it in the forts, had re-enlisted, only to be soon relieved of garrison duty and sent to the front as infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2692"/>But while they were veterans in service in point of time, yet, so far as the real hardships of war were concerned, they were simply recruits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2698"/>It numbered over <num value="2000">two thousand</num> strong, and, never having lost any men in battles and hard campaigning, its ranks were full.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2699"/>The strength of these regiments struck the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> with surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2700"/>A single regiment larger than <num value="1">one</num> of their own brigades! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2701"/>These men had started from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> with knapsacks that were immense in their proportions, and had clung to them manfully the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day or <num value="2">two</num> out, but this morning in question, which was of the sultriest kind, was taxing them beyond endurance, as they plunged along in the mire marching up to the front; and their course could have been followed by the well stuffed knapsacks &mdash; or <quote>bureaus,</quote> as some of the old vets called them &mdash; that sprinkled the roadside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2702"/>It seemed rather sad to see a man step out of the ranks, unsling his knapsack, seat himself for a moment to overhaul its contents, transfer to his pocket some little keepsake, then, rising, and casting <num value="1">one</num> despairing look at it, hurry on after the column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2703"/>Many would not even open their knapsacks, but, giving them a toss, would leave them to fate, and sternly resume their march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2705"/>Their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was made in cutting loose from their comfortable quarters and accumulated conveniences in the forts, which they had so recently left. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2706"/>The knapsack, haversack, canteen, and shelter-tent, like the arms, were government property, for which the commanding <pb id="p.320" n="320"/> officer of a company was responsible.

<head>Army cattle.</head></figure> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2708"/>An army officer who was reputed to have been of high and hasty temper, who certainly seemed to have been capable of rash and inconsiderate remarks, was once overheard to say of soldiers that they were nothing but cattle, and deserved to be treated only as such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2709"/>In the short sketch here submitted on the subject of Army Cattle, I do not include the variety above referred to, but rather the quadrupedal kind that furnished food for them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2710"/>In the sketch on Army Rations I named fresh beef as <num value="1">one</num> of the articles furnished, but I gave no particulars as to just <hi rend="italics">how</hi> the army was supplied with it. This I will now endeavor to do. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2711"/>When there came an active demand for fresh and salt meat to feed the soldiers and sailors, at once the price advanced, and Northern farmers turned their attention more extensively to grazing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2712"/>Of course, the great mass of the cattle were raised in the <rs>West</rs>, but yet even rugged <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> contributed no inconsiderable quantity to swell the total.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2713"/>These were sent by hundreds and <num value="1000">thousands</num> on rail and shipboard to the various armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2714"/>On their arrival, they were put in a <hi rend="italics">corral</hi>. Here they were subject, like all supplies, to the disposition of the <rs type="role" reg="Commissary-General">commissary-general</rs> of the army, who, through his subordinates, supplied them to the various organizations upon the presentation of a requisition, signed by the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> of a regiment or other body of troops, certifying to the number of rations of meat required. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2717"/>The beeves were a blessing to them, far more precious and valuable than as many Union prisoners would have been; for they already had more prisoners than they could or would feed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2718"/>As for us, I do not remember that fresh meat was any the scarcer on account of this raid, for the <rs>North</rs>, with its abundance, was bountifully supplying the government with whatever was needed, and the loss of a few <num value="100">hundred</num> cattle could scarcely cause even a temporary inconvenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2719"/>Had the army been on the march, away from its base of supplies, the loss might have been felt more severely. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2720"/>Whenever the army made a move its supply of fresh meat went along too. Who had charge of it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2721"/>Men were detailed for the business from the various regiments, who acted both as butchers and drovers, and were excused from all other duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2722"/>When a halt was made for the night, some of the steers would be slaughtered, and the meat furnished to the troops upon presentation of the proper requisitions by quartermasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2723"/>The butcher killed his victims with a rifle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2724"/>The killing was not always done at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2725"/>It often took place in the morning or forenoon, and the men received their rations in time to cook for dinner. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2726"/>The manner in which these cattle were taken along was rather interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2727"/><num value="1">One</num> might very naturally suppose that they would be driven along the road just as they are driven in any neighborhood; but such was not exactly the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2728"/>The troops and trains must use the roads, and so the cattle must needs travel elsewhere, which they did. Every herd had a steer that was used both as a pack animal and a leader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2729"/>As a pack animal he bore the equipments and cooking utensils <pb id="p.322" n="322"/> of the drovers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2730"/>He was as docile as an old cow or horse, and could be led or called fully as readily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2731"/>By day he was preceded in his lead by the herdsman in charge, on horseback, while other herdsmen brought up the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2732"/>It was necessary to keep the herd along with the troops for <num value="2">two</num> reasons-safety and convenience; and, as they could not <figure id="fig.322"> 
<head>Leading the herd.</head></figure> use the road, they skirted the fields and woods, only a short remove from the highways, and picked their way as best they could. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2733"/>By night <num value="1">one</num> of the herdsmen went ahead of the herd on foot, making a gentle hallooing sound which the sagacious steer on lead steadily followed, and was in turn faithfully followed by the rest of the herd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2734"/>The herdsman's course lay sometimes through the open, but often through the woods, which made the hallooing sound necessary as a guide to keep the herd from straying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2735"/>They kept nearer the road at night than in the day, partly for safety's sake, and partly to take advantage of the light from huge camp-fires which detachments of cavalry, that preceded <pb id="p.323" n="323"/> the army, kindled at intervals to light the way, making them nearer together in woods and swamps than elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2736"/>Even then these drovers often had a thorny and difficult path to travel in picking their way through underbrush and brambles. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2737"/>Such a herd got its living off the country in the summer, but not in the winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2738"/>It was a sad sight to see these animals, which followed the army so patiently, sacrificed <figure id="fig.323"> 
<head>The last steer.</head></figure> <num value="1">one</num> after the other until but <num value="0.5">a half</num>-dozen were left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2739"/>When the number had been reduced to this extent, they seemed to realize the fate in store for them, and it often took the butcher some time before he could succeed in facing <num value="1">one</num> long enough to shoot him. His aim was at the curl of the hair between the eyes, and they would avert their lowered heads whenever he raised his rifle, until, at last, his quick eye brought them to the ground. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2740"/>From the manner in which I have spoken of these herds, it may be inferred that there was a common herd for the whole army; but such was not the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2741"/>The same system prevailed here as elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2742"/>For example, when the army entered the <rs>Wilderness</rs> with <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> rations of hard <pb id="p.324" n="324"/> bread, and <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> rations of meat in their haversacks, the fresh meat to accompany the other <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> rations, which they had stowed in their knapsacks, was driven along in division herds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2743"/>The remainder of the meat ration which they required to last them for the <measure n="16days" type="date">sixteen days</measure> during which it was expected the army would be away from a base of supplies was driven as corps herds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2744"/>In addition to these there <hi rend="italics">was</hi> a general or army herd to fall back upon when necessary to supply the corps herds, but this was always at the base of supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2745"/>Probably from <num value="8000">eight</num> to <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> head of cattle accompanied the army across the <rs>Rapidan</rs>, when it entered upon the <rs>Wilderness Campaign</rs>.

<head>The Army horse.</head></figure> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2747"/>I have already stated that the horse was the sole reliance of the artillery and cavalry, and have given the reasons why the mule was a failure in either branch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2748"/>I have also stated that the mule replaced him, for the most part, in the wagontrains, <num value="6">six</num> mules being substituted for <num value="4">four</num> horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2749"/>I did not state that in the ambulance train the horses were retained because they were the steadier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2750"/>But I wish now to refer more particularly to their conduct in action and on duty generally. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2751"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, then, I will come directly to the point by saying that the horse was a hero in action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2752"/>That horses under fire behaved far better than men did under a similar exposure would naturally be expected, for men knew what and whom to fear, whereas a horse, when hit by a bullet, if he could get loose, was fully as likely to run towards the enemy as from him. But not every horse would run or make a fuss when wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2753"/>It depended partly upon the horse and partly upon the character and location of the wound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2756"/>In this battle the <num value="57">fifty-seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> horses belonging to my company stood out in bold relief, a sightly target for the bullets of Rebel sharpshooters, who, from a woods and cornfield in our front, improved their opportunity to the full.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2757"/>Their object was to kill off our horses, and then, by charg ing, take the guns, if possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2758"/>It was painfully interesting to note the manner in which our brave limber-horses-those which drew the gunssuccumbed to the bullets of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2759"/>They stood harnessed in teams of <num value="6">six</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2760"/>A peculiar dull thud indicated that the bullet had penetated some fleshy part of the animal, sounding much as a pebble does when thrown into the mud. The result of such wounds was to make the horse start for a moment or so, but finally he would settle down as if it was something to be endured without making a fuss, and thus he would remain until struck again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2761"/>I remember having had my eye on <num value="1">one</num> horse at the very moment when a bullet entered his neck, but the wound had no other effect upon him than to make him shake his head as if pestered by a fly. Some of the horses would go down when hit by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> bullet and after lying quiet awhile would struggle to their feet again only to receive additional wounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2762"/>Just before the close of this battle, while our gallant <persName n="Hancock,General,,,," id="n0006.0018.00327.00336" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,Winfield,S.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hancock</surname></persName> was riding along endeavoring by his own personal fearlessness to rally his retreating troops, his horse received a bullet in the neck, from the effects of which he fell forward, dismounting the general, and appearing as if dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2763"/>Believing such to be the case, <persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n0006.0018.00327.00337" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,Winfield,S.,,:2"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName> mounted another horse; but within <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> the fallen brute arose, shook himself, was at once remounted by the general, and survived the war many years. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2764"/>When a bullet struck the bone of a horse's leg in the lower part, it made a hollow snapping sound and took him off his feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2765"/>I saw <num value="1">one</num> pole-horse shot thus, fracturing the <pb id="p.328" n="328"/> bone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2766"/>Down he went at once, but all encumbered as he was with harness and limber, he soon scrambled up and stood on <num value="3">three</num> legs until a bullet hit him vitally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2767"/>It seemed sad to see a single horse left standing, with his <num value="5">five</num> companions all lying dead or dying around him, himself the object of a concentrated fire until the fatal shot finally laid him low.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2773"/>But, aside from their wonderful <hi rend="italics">heroism</hi>,--for I can find no better name for it,--they exhibited in many ways that sagacity for which the animal is famous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2774"/>I have already referred to the readiness with which they responded to many of the bugle-calls used on drill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2775"/>In the cavalry service they knew their places as well as did their riders, and it was a frequent occurrence to see a horse, when his rider had been dismounted <pb id="p.329" n="329"/> by some means, resume his place in line or column without him, seemingly not wishing to be left behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2776"/>This quality was often illustrated when a poor, crippled, or generally usedup beast, which had been turned out to die, would attempt to hobble along in his misery and join a column as it passed. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2785"/>But there is much in this as in other experiences which was common to all longterm veterans, and to this common experience more especially I shall address my attention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2786"/>From the descriptions which I have already given of the various kinds of shelter used by the soldiers it will be readily understood that they got the most comfortably settled in their winter-quarters, and that in a small way each hut became a miniature homestead, and for the time being possessed, to a certain extent, all the attractions of home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2787"/>The bunk, the stools, and other furniture, the army bric-a-brac, whether captured or of home production, which adorned the rough tenement within and without, all came to have a value by association in the soldier's thought, a value which was not fully computed till campaigning impended &mdash; that usually direful day, when marching orders came and the boys folded their tents and marched away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2788"/>This sketch <pb id="p.331" n="331"/> will relate something of army life as it was lived after marching orders were received. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2789"/>When the general commanding an army had decided upon a plan of campaign, and the proper time came to put it in operation, he at once issued his orders to his subordinate commanders to have their commands ready to take their place in column at a given hour on a given day. These orders came down through the various corps, division, brigade, regimental, or battery headquarters to the rank and file, whose instructions given them on line would be to the effect that at the stated hour they were to be ready to start with <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> rations in their haversacks (this was the usual quantity), the infantry to have <num value="40">forty</num> rounds of ammunition in their cartridge-boxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2790"/>This latter quantity was very often exceeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2791"/>The <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> went into the <rs>Wilderness</rs> having from <num value="80">eighty</num> to a <num value="100">hundred</num> rounds of ammunition to a man, stowed away in knapsacks, haversacks, or pockets, according to the space afforded, and <measure n="6days" type="date">six days</measure> rations similarly disposed of. When <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n0006.0019.00331.00341" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,Joseph,,,:2"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName> started on the <rs n="Chancellorsville Campaign" type="campaign">Chancellorsville Campaign</rs>, <hi rend="italics"><measure n="11days" type="date">eleven days</measure> rations</hi> were issued to the troops. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2792"/>Sometimes marching orders came when least expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2793"/>I remember to have heard the long roll sounded <num value="1">one</num> <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> forenoon in the camp of the infantry that lay near us in the fall of &lsquo;<num value="63">63</num>; it was <dateStruct value="-10-10"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg="10">10</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2794"/>Our guns were unlimbered for action just outside of camp where we had been lying several days utterly unsuspicious of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2795"/>It was quite a surprise to us; and such <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0006.0019.00331.00342" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:1"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> intended it to be, he having set out to put himself between our army and <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2796"/>We were not attacked, but started to the rear a few hours afterwards. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2797"/>Before the opening of the spring campaign a reasonable notice was generally given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2798"/>There was <num value="1">one</num> orderly from each brigade headquarters who almost infallibly brought marching orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2799"/>The men knew the nature of the tidings which he cantered up to regimental headquarters with under <pb id="p.332" n="332"/> his belt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2800"/>Very often they would good-naturedly rail at him as he rode into and out of camp, thus indicating their dislike of his errand; but the wise ones went directly to quarters and began to pack up. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2801"/>When it was officially announced to the men on line at night that marching orders were received, and that at such an hour next morning tents would be struck and the men in packing up. place, equipped and provided as already stated, those men who had not already decided the question retired to their huts and took an account of stock in order to decide what to take and what to leave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2802"/>As a soldier would lay out <num value="2">two</num> articles on the bunk, of equally tender associations, <num value="1">one</num> could seem to hear him murmur, with <persName n="Gay,,,,," id="n0006.0019.00332.00343" reg="mostcommon:Gay,nomatch:0"><surname>Gay</surname></persName>, <quote>How happy could I be with either Were t'other dear charmer away.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2804"/>The <quote>survival of the fittest</quote> <pb id="p.333" n="333"/> was the question, which received deeper and tenderer consideration here in <num value="1">one</num> evening than <persName n="Darwin,,,,," id="n0006.0019.00333.00344" reg="mostcommon:Darwin,nomatch:0"><surname>Darwin</surname></persName> has ever given it in the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2805"/>Then, there was the overcoat and the woollen blanket which should be left?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2806"/>Perhaps he finally decided to try taking both along for a while.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2807"/>He will leave the dress-coat and wear the blouse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2808"/>He has <num value="2">two</num> changes of flannels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2809"/>He will throw away those he has on, don a clean set and take a change with him. These flannels, by the way, if they were what he drew from the government stores, were often as rough to the skin as coarse <rs n="sand paper" type="product">sand-paper</rs>, which they somewhat resembled in color. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2810"/>From the head of his bunk he takes a collection of old letters which have accumulated during the winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2811"/>These he looks over <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> and commits to the flames with a sigh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2812"/>Many of them are letters from home; some are from acquaintances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2813"/>Possibly he read the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Waverly magazine" type="newspaper">Waverly Magazine</orgName></hi>, and may have carried on a correspondence with <num value="1">one</num> or more of the many young women who advertised in it for a <quote>soldier correspondent, who must not be over <num value="20">twenty</num>,</quote> with all the virtues namable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2814"/>There was no man in my company &mdash; from old Graylocks, of nearly <num value="60">sixty</num>, down to the callow <quote>chicken</quote> of <num value="17">seventeen</num>--but; what felt qualified to fill such a bill, <quote>just for the fun of it, you know.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2815"/>The young woman was generally <quote><num value="18">eighteen</num>, of prepossessing appearance, good education, and would exchange photographs if desired.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2816"/></p> 
<p>An occasional letter from such <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> would provoke a smile as the soldier glanced at its source and contents before committing it to the yawn of his army fireplace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2817"/>This rather unpleasant task completed, he continues his researches and work of destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2818"/>He tucks his little collection of photographs, which perhaps he has encased in rubber or leather, into an inside pocket, and disposes other small keepsakes about his person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2819"/>If he intends to take his effects in a knapsack, he will at the start have put by more to carry than if he simply takes his blankets (rubber and woollen) rolled and slung over his shoulder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2820"/>Late in the war this latter was the <pb id="p.334" n="334"/> most common plan, as the same weight could be borne with less fatigue in that manner than in a knapsack, slung on the back. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2821"/>I have assumed it to be evening or late afternoon when marching orders arrived, and have thus far related what the average soldier was wont to do immediately afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2822"/>There was a night ahead and the soldiers were wont to <quote>make a night of it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2823"/>As a rule, there was little sleep to be had, the enforcement of the usual rules of camp being relaxed on such an occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2824"/>Aside from the labor of personal packing and destroying, the rations were to be distributed, and each company had to fall into line, march to the cook-house, and receive their <num value="3">three</num> or more days' allowance of hardtack, pork, coffee, and sugar, all of which they must stow away, as compactly as possible, in the haversack or elsewhere if they wanted them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2825"/>In the artillery, besides securing the rations, sacks of grain &mdash; usually oats &mdash; must be taken from the grainpile and strapped on to the ammunition-chests for the horses; the axles must be greased, good spare horses selected to supply the vacancies in any teams where the horses were unfit for duty; the tents of regimental headquarters must be struck, likewise the cook-tents, and these, with officers' baggage, must be put into the wagons which are to join the trains;--in brief, everything must be prepared for the march of the morrow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2826"/>After this routine of preparation was completed, camp-fires were lighted, and about them would gather the happy-go-lucky boys of the rank and file, whose merry din would speedily stir the blood of the men who had hoped for a few hours' sleep before starting out on the morrow, to come out of their huts and join the jovial round; and soon they were as happy as the happiest, even if more reticent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2827"/>As the fire died down and the soldiers drew closer about it, some comrade would go to his hut, and, with an armful of its furniture, the stools, closets, and tables I have spoken of, reillumine and enliven the scene and drive back the circle of bystanders again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2828"/><pb id="p.335" n="335"/> The conversation, which, with the going down of the fire, was likely to take on a somewhat sober aspect, would again assume a more cheerful strain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2829"/>For a time conjectures on the plan of the coming compaign would be exchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2830"/>Volumes of wisdom concerning what <hi rend="italics">ought</hi> to be done changed hands at these camp-fires, mingled with much <quote>I told you so</quote> about the last battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2831"/>Alexanders simply swarmed, so waiting for marching Orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2832"/>numerous were those who could solve the <name>Gordian</name> knot of success at sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2833"/>It must interest those strategists now, as they read history, to see how little they really knew of what was taking place. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2834"/>When this slight matter of the proper thing for the army to do was disposed of, some <num value="1">one</num> would start a song, and then for an hour at least <quote><persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0006.0019.00335.00345" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>'s body,</quote> <quote>Marching along,</quote> <quote><rs type="color">Red</rs>, <rs type="color">white</rs>, and <rs type="color">blue</rs>,</quote> <quote>Rally &lsquo;round the flag,</quote> and other popular and familiar songs would ring out on the clear evening air, following along in quick succession, and sung with great earnestness and enthusiasm as the chorus was <pb id="p.336" n="336"/> increased by additions from neighboring camp-fires, until tired Nature began to assert herself, when <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> the company would withdraw, each going to his hut for <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure> rest, if possible, to partially prepare him for the toils of the morrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2835"/>Ah! is not that an all-wise provision of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> which keeps the future a sealed book, placing it before us leaf by leaf only, as the present?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2836"/>For some of these very men, it may have been, whose voices rang out so merrily at that camp-fire, would lie cold and pale ere the week should close, in the solemn stillness of death. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2837"/>But morning dawned all too soon for those who gave up most of the night to hilarity, and all were summoned forth at the call of the bugle or the drum, and at a time agreed upon <hi rend="italics">The General</hi> was sounded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2838"/>the <rs>General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2839"/><hi rend="italics">Presto</hi>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2840"/>The above is the <rs>General</rs> of infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2841"/>That of the artillery was less often used and entirely different. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2842"/>At this signal, every tent in a regiment was struck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2843"/>It was quite an interesting sight to see several acres of canvas disappear in a moment, where before it had been the prominent feature in the landscape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2844"/>As a fact, I believe the <rs>General</rs> was little used in the latter part of the war. For about <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, when the troops were sheltered by the <name>Sibley</name>, Wedge, and Wall tents, it was necessary to have them struck at an early hour, in order that they might be packed away in the wagon-train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2845"/>But after the <name>Shelter</name> tent <pb id="p.337" n="337"/> came into use, and each man was his own wagon, the <rs>General</rs> was seldom heard unless at the end of a long encampment; for, when marching orders came, each man understood that he must be ready at the hour appointed, even if his regiment waited another day before it left camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2846"/>No more provoking incident of army life happened, I believe, than for a regiment to wait in camp long after the hour appointed to march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2847"/>But such was the rule rather than the exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2848"/>Many a man's hearth-stone was then desolate, for if the hour of departure was set for the morning, when morning came and the stockade was vacated, it often suffered demolition to increase the heat of the campfires, as previously noted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2849"/>But as hour after hour wore on, and men still found themselves in camp with nothing to do and plenty of help, they began to wish that they had not been so hasty in breaking up housekeeping and tearing down their shanties, else they might resort to them and make their wait a little more endurable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2850"/>Especially did they repent if rain came on as they lingered, or if night again overtook them there with their huts untenable, for it would have been the work of only a moment to re-cover them with the <name>Shelter</name> tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2851"/>Such waits and their consequences were severe tests to the patience of the men, and sometimes seemed to work more injury to their morals than the average army chaplain could repair in days. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2852"/>But there is an end to all things earthly, this being no exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2853"/>The colors of corps headquarters borne at the heels of the corps commander, and followed by his staff, are at last seen moving into the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2854"/>The bugler of the division having the lead sounds the call <hi rend="italics">Attention</hi>. <figure id="fig.337">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2855"/>This call is the <name>Attention</name> of infantry at which the men, already in column, take their places, officers mount, and all await the next call, which is <figure id="fig.338">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2856"/>At this signal the regiments take <quote>right shoulder shift,</quote> and the march begins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2857"/>Let the reader, in imagination, take post by the roadside as the column goes by. Take a look at corps headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2858"/>The commander is a major-general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2859"/>His staff comprises an assistant adjutant-general, an assistant inspector-general, a topographical engineer, a commissary of musters, a commissary of subsistence, a judgeadvocate, several aides-de-camp &mdash; and perhaps other officers, of varying rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2861"/>In the <rs>Union</rs> army, major-generals might command either a division, a corps, or an army, but in the <rs>Confederate</rs> service each army of importance was commanded by a lieutenant-general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2865"/>When the army entered upon the <rs>Wilderness Campaign</rs>, each corps headquarters floated a blue swallow-tailed flag bearing its own particular emblem in white, in the centre of which was the figure designating the corps, in red. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2866"/>Here comes the <orgName type="division" n="Division 1">First Division</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2867"/>At the head rides its general commanding and staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2868"/>Behind him is the colorbearer, carrying the division flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2869"/>If you are familiar with the corps badges, you will not need to ask what corps or division it is. The men's caps tell the story, but the flags are equally plain-spoken. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2885"/>His flag is the simple star-spangled banner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2886"/>The stars and stripes were a common flag for army headquarters.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2889"/>You can easily count the regiments in column by their <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2890"/>A few of them, you will notice, have a battle-flag, bearing the names of the engagements in which they have participated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2891"/>Some regiments used the national colors for a battle-flag, some the state colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2892"/>I think the volunteers did not adopt the idea early in the war. Originally battles were only inscribed on flags by authority of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">secretary of war</rs>, that is, in the regular army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2893"/>But the volunteers seemed to be a law unto themselves, and, while many flags in existence to-day bear names of battles inscribed by order of the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs>, there are some with inscriptions of battles which the troops were hardly in hearing of. The Rebel battle-flag was a blue spangled saltier in a red field, and originated with <persName n="Johnston,General,Joe,,," id="n0006.0019.00340.00354" reg="default:Johnston,Joe,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Joe</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> after the <rs n="First Battle of Bull Run" type="battle">first Bull Run</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2894"/>You will have little difficulty in deciding where a regiment <pb id="p.341" n="341"/> begins or ends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2895"/>It begins with a field officer and ends with a mule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2896"/>Originally it ended with several army wagons; but now that portion of regimental headquarters baggage which has not gone to the wagon-train is to be found stowed about the mule, that is led along by a contraband.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2897"/>Yes, the head, ears, and feet which you see are the only visible externals of a mule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2898"/>He is <quote>clothed upon</quote> with the various materials necessary to prepare a <quote>square meal</quote> for the colonel and other headquarters officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2899"/>His trappings would, seemingly, fit out a small family in household goods of a kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2900"/>There is a mess-kettle, a fry-pan, messpans, tent-poles, a fly (canvas), a valise, a knapsack and haversack, a hamper on each side, a musket, and other matter which goes to make the burden at least twice the size of the animal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2901"/><num value="4">Four</num> mules were regarded as having the carrying capacity of <num value="1">one</num> army wagon.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2903"/>The mule had other company than the negro ofttimes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2904"/>That man who seems to be flour and grease from head to heels, who needs no shelter nor rubber blanket because he is waterproof already, perhaps, <hi rend="italics">inside</hi> and out, whose shabby, well-stuffed knapsack furnishes the complement to the mule's lading, who shuffles along with <quote>no style about him,</quote> is the cook, perhaps, for the regiment, probably for headquarters, certainly not for Delmonico.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2905"/>It is singular, but none the less true, that if a man made a slovenly, indifferent soldier he was fully as likely to get a berth in the cook-house as to have any other fate befall him. This remark applies to men who <hi rend="italics">drifted</hi> into the business of <quote>army caterer</quote> after trying other service, and not those who entered at once upon it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2906"/>Here comes a <orgName n="Light Battery" type="battery">light battery</orgName> at the rear of the division.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2907"/>Possibly it is to remain with this part of the corps for the campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2908"/>Such was sometimes the case, but later a battery was often used anywhere within the limits of a corps that <pb id="p.342" n="342"/> it could be of advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2909"/>This battery has <num value="6">six</num> brass Napoleons, <num value="12">12</num>-pounders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2910"/>They are very destructive at short range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2911"/>It is followed by a battery of steel guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2912"/>They are Parrots, <measure n="3inch" type="distance">three-inch</measure> rifles; best for long range, but good anywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2913"/>Not so safe for close action, however, as the <name>Napoleons</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2914"/>Yonder you can see the <orgName type="division" n="Division 2">Second Division</orgName> moving across the fields, made up like the <num value="1">one</num> just passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2915"/>It will close in upon the rear of this division farther up the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2916"/>What an interesting spectacle it presents, the bright sunlight glinting from the <num value="1000">thousands</num> of polished muskets, the moving masses of light and dark blue inching along over the uneven ground, the various flags streaming proudly in the air, marking off the separate brigades and regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2917"/>The column is moving at a moderate pace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2918"/>It takes some time for a corps to get under way. If we wait long enough, the <orgName type="division" n="Division 3">Third Division</orgName>, made up like the others, will pass by us, unless it has gone on a parallel road. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2919"/>It is growing warmer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2920"/>The column has now got straightened out, and for the last hour has moved forward quite rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2921"/>The road is evidently clear of all obstructions, but the heat and speed begin to tell on the men. Look at the ground which that brigade has just vacated after its brief halt for rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2922"/>It is strewn with blankets, overcoats, dresscoats, pantaloons, shirts &mdash; in fact, a little of everything from the outfit of the common soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2923"/>As the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2">Second Corps</orgName> advanced into the <rs>Wilderness</rs> on the morning of <dateStruct value="1864-05-04"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="4">4</day>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, I saw an area of an acre or more almost literally covered with the articles above named, many of them probably extras, but some of them the sole garment of their kind, left by the owners, who felt compelled, from the increasing weight of their load, to lighten it to the extent of parting with the blankets which they would need that very night for shelter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2924"/>This lightening of the load began before the columns had been on the road an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2925"/>A soldier who had been through the mill would not wait for a general <pb id="p.343" n="343"/> halt to occur before parting with a portion of his load, if it oppressed him; but a recruit would hang to his until he bent over at an angle of <num value="45">45</num>° from a vertical, with his eyes staring, his lower jaw hanging, and his face dripping with moisture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2926"/>If you were to follow the column after, say, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>, you would find various articles scattered along at intervals by the roadside, where a soldier quietly stepped out of the ranks, sat down, unslung his knapsack or his blanket-roll, took out what he had decided to throw away, again equipped himself, and, thus relieved, hastened on to overtake the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2927"/>It did not take an army long to get into light marching order after it was once fairly on the road. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2928"/>I have been dealing with the <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num></hi> day out of settled camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2929"/>On subsequent days, of course the same programme would not be enacted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2930"/>And, again, if a man clung to his effects till noon, he was likely to do so for the day, as after <time value="12pm">noon</time> the thought of shelter for the night nerved <figure id="fig.343"> 
<head>A footsore straggler.</head></figure> him to hold on. But men would drop out in the afternoon of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day for another reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2931"/>They blistered or chafed their feet and sat; down at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stream to bathe them, <pb id="p.344" n="344"/> after which, if the weather admitted, they could be seen plodding along barefooted, their pantaloons rolled up a few inches, and their shoes dangling at the end of their musketbarrel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2932"/>Then, this very crossing of a stream often furnished an interesting scene in the march of the column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2933"/>A river broad and deep would be spanned by a pontoon bridge, but the common creeks of the <rs>South</rs> were crossed by fording.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2934"/>Once in a while (in warm weather) the men would take off most of their clothing and carry it with their equipments across on their heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2935"/>It was no uncommon experience for them to ford streams waist-deep, even in cool weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2936"/>If the bottom was a treacherous <num value="1">one</num>, and the current rapid, a line of cavalry-men was placed across the river just below the column to pick up such men as should lose their footing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2937"/>Many were the mishaps of such a crossing, and, unless the enemy was at hand, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing to be done after reaching shore was to strip and wring out such clothing as needed it. With those who had slipped and fallen this meant <hi rend="italics">all they had on</hi> and what was in their knapsack besides, but with most it included only trousers, drawers, and socks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2938"/>After the halt which allowed the soldiers time to perform this bit of laundry work had ended, and the column moved along, it was not an uncommon sight to see muskets used as clothes-lines, from which depended socks, shoes, here and there a shirt, perhaps a towel or handkerchief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2939"/>But if the weather was cool the wash did not hang out in this way. When it became necessary to cross a stream in the night, huge fires were built on its banks, with a picket at hand, whose duty it was to keep them burning until daylight, or until the army had crossed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2940"/>A greater number of mishaps occurred in fording by night than by day even then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2941"/>During <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n0006.0019.00344.00355" reg="mostcommon:Meade,George,G.,,:1"><surname>Meade</surname></persName>'s retreat from <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName>, in the fall of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, --it was the night of <dateStruct value="-10-11"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg="11">11</day></dateStruct>,--my company forded the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> after dark, and went into camp a few rods <pb id="p.345" n="345"/> away from the ford; and I remember what a jolly night the troops made of it when they came to this ford.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2942"/>At short intervals I was awakened from slumber by the laughter or cheers of the waders, as they made merry at the expense of some of their number, who came out after immersion using language which plainly indicated their disbelief in that kind of baptism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2943"/>Here was the field for the tired, overloaded <quote>Headquarters</quote> in trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2944"/>headquarters mule to display his obstinacy to a large and changing audience, by getting midway of the stream and refusing to budge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2945"/>I can see the frenzied <rs>Ethiopian</rs> in charge, now, waist-deep in water, wild with despair at the situation, alternating reasoning with pulling and beating, while the brute lies down in the stream all encumbered with the baggage, the passing column jeering poor <persName><foreName>Sambo</foreName></persName>, and making the adjacent woodland echo with their loud guffaws at his helpless yet laughable condition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2946"/>That was a noisy night, and it has always been a matter of wonder to me that we remained undisturbed, with the enemy less than <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> up the river, as <persName n="Birney,General,,,," id="n0006.0019.00345.00356" reg="mostcommon:Birney,David,B.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Birney</surname></persName>, with whom we then were, has left on record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2947"/>There was no stopping to wring out. But <quote>close up!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2948"/>was the order after <pb id="p.346" n="346"/> crossing, and the dull rattle made by the equipments, the striking of the coffee dipper on the canteen or buckles, as the column glided along in the darkness, or the whipping &mdash; up of belated mule-teams, was heard until the gray of morning appeared. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2949"/>The army on the march in a rain-storm presented some aspects not seen in fair weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2950"/>As soon as it began to rain, or just before, each man would remove his rubber blanket from his roll or knapsack, and put it over his shoulders, tying it in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2951"/>Some men used their shelter tent instead &mdash; a very poor substitute, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2952"/>But there was no fun in the marching business during the rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2953"/>It might settle the dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2954"/>It certainly settled about everything else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2955"/>An order to go into camp while the rain was in progress was not much of an improvement, for the ground was wet, fence-rails were wet, <num value="1">one</num>'s woollen blanket was likely also to be wet, hardtack in the haversack wet-in fact, nothing so abundant and out of place as water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2956"/>I remember going into camp <num value="1">one</num> night in particular, in <placeName reg="Pleasant Valley, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,2587753">Pleasant Valley, Md.</placeName>, on a side-hill during a drenching rain, such as mountain regions know, and lying down under a hastily pitched shelter, with the water coursing freely along beneath me. I was fresh as a soldier then, and this experience, seeming so dreadful then, made a strong impression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2957"/>Such situations were too numerous afterwards to make note of even in memory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2958"/>Then, the horses!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2959"/>It made them ugly and vicious to stand in the pelting rain at the picket-rope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2960"/>I think they preferred being in harness on the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2961"/>But they were likely to get subdued the next day, when sloughs and mire were the rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2962"/>If <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2">two corps</orgName> took the same road after a storm, the worse for the hindermost, for it found deep ruts and mud-holes in abundance; and as it dragged forward it would come upon some piece of artillery or caisson in the mire to the hubs, doomed to stay, in spite of the shoutings and lashings of the drivers, the swearing of the officers, and <pb id="p.347" n="347"/> the lifting and straining of mud-bedraggled cannoneers, until <num value="6">six</num> more horses were added to extricate it. Anon the corps would arrive at a place utterly impassable, when down would go the fence by the roadside, if there was <num value="1">one</num>, and out would go the column into the field skirting the road, returning again beyond the mire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2963"/>At another slough, a staff officer might be found posted to direct the artillery where to make a safe passage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2964"/>Such places by night were generally lighted by fires built for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2965"/>I remember such a spot in particular &mdash; a <figure id="fig.347">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2966"/>My battery was then attached to the <orgName type="division" n="Division 3">Third Division</orgName> of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 3">Third Corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2967"/>By the edge of the slough in question sat <persName n="Carr,General,J.,B.,," id="n0006.0019.00347.00357" reg="default:Carr,J.,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Carr</surname></persName>, the division commander, with a portion of his command near by, and, as a caisson went down in the mire, he called in his <quote>Blue diamonds</quote> to lift it out, which they did right manfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2968"/>There was no turning into fields that night, for, while the roads were soft, the fields were softer, and worse travelling I believe the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> never saw, unless on the <quote>Mud march.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2969"/></p> 
<p>When the army was expecting to run against the enemy <pb id="p.348" n="348"/> in its advance, <hi rend="italics">flankers</hi> were thrown out on either side of the column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2970"/>These flankers were a single file of soldiers, who marched along a few feet apart parallel to the column, and perhaps <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> rods distant from it in open country, but not more than half that distance when it was marching through woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2971"/>In the event of an attack, the flankers on that side became the skirmish line in action. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2972"/>It was an interesting sight to see a column break up when the order came to halt, whether for rest or other reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2973"/>It would melt in a moment, dividing to the right and left, and scattering to the sides of the road, where the men would sit down or lie down, lying back on their knapsacks if they had them, or stretching at full length on the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2986"/>Before giving a history of the wagon-trains which formed a part, and a <hi rend="italics">necessary</hi> part, of every army, I will briefly refer to what was known as k <quote><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0006.0020.00350.00364" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,:2"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s military Railroad,</quote> which was really a railroad built <hi rend="italics">for</hi> the army, and used solely by it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2987"/>The <rs>Lynchburg</rs> or <orgName n="Southside Railroad" type="railroad">Southside Railroad</orgName> enters <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> from the west, and a short railroad, known as the <orgName n="City Point Railroad" type="railroad">City Point Railroad</orgName>, connects it with <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>, <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> eastward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2988"/>The greater portion of this <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> fell within the <rs>Union</rs> lines after our army appeared before <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, and, as these lines were extended westward after the siege was determined upon, <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0006.0020.00350.00365" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,:2"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> conceived the plan of <pb id="p.351" n="351"/> running a railroad inside our fortifications to save both time and mule-flesh in distributing supplies along the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2989"/>It was soon done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2990"/>About <placeName><distance reg="5miles">five miles</distance> of the <placeName key="tgn,2240477" n="1.000 6" reg="city point, virginia, virginia">City Point</placeName></placeName> road were used, from which the new road extended to the southwest, perhaps <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure>, striking the <orgName n="Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Weldon Railroad</orgName>, which had been wrested from the enemy.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2992"/>Of course, there were stations along this road at which supplies were left for those troops near by. These stations were named after different generals of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2994"/>The trains on this road were visible to the enemy for a time as they crossed an open plain in their trips, and brought upon themselves quite a lively shelling, resulting in no damage, I believe, but still making railroading so uncomfortable that a high embankment of earth was thrown up, which completely covered the engine and cars as they rolled along, and which still stands as a monument to the labors of the pick-and-shovel brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2995"/>This railroad was what is known as a surface road, by which is meant that there were no cuts made, the track being laid on the natural surface of the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2996"/>When a marsh was met with, instead of filling, the engineers built a trestling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2997"/>The effect of such railroading to the eye was quite picturesque, as a train wound its serpentine course along the country, up hill and down dale, appearing much as if it had jumped the track, and was going across lots to its destination. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2998"/>But <hi rend="italics">the</hi> trains of the army were <hi rend="italics">wagon-trains</hi>, and so little has been written about them in histories of the war that a limited sketch in this volume will have interest for many readers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2999"/>The trains belong to what is known in French as the <hi rend="italics">materiel</hi> of the army, in distinction from the <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi>, the <pb id="p.352" n="352"/> men employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3000"/>In <name>Roman</name> history we frequently find the baggage-trains of the army alluded to as the <hi rend="italics">impedimenta</hi>. The <hi rend="italics">materiel</hi>, then, or <hi rend="italics">impedimenta</hi>, of our armies has, very naturally, been ignored by the historian; for the <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi>, the actors, are of so much <hi rend="italics">more</hi> consequence, they have absorbed the interest of both writers and readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3001"/>I say the persons are of much more consequence, but I must not be understood as belittling the importance of the trains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3002"/>An army without its varied supplies, which the trains care for and provide, would soon be neither useful nor ornamental.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3003"/>In fact, an army is like a piece of machinery, each part of which is indispensable to every other part. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3004"/>I presume every <num value="1">one</num> of mature years has an idea of what army wagons look like.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3005"/>They were heavy, lumbering <figure id="fig.352">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3006"/>As a pleasure carriage, however, they were not considered a success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3007"/>When the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 3">Third Corps</orgName> was wintering at <placeName reg="Brandy Station, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2110767">Brandy Station</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">4</year></dateStruct> the concert troupe, which my company boasted was engaged to give a week of evening <pb id="p.353" n="353"/> entertainments not far from <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName>, in a large hexagonal stockade, which would seat <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="700">seven hundred</num> persons, and which had been erected for the purpose by <num value="1">one</num> <persName n="Lee,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0006.0020.00353.00368" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, then on either <persName n="French,General,,,," id="n0006.0020.00353.00369" reg="mostcommon:French,William,H.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>French</surname></persName>'s or <persName n="Birney,General,,,," id="n0006.0020.00353.00370" reg="mostcommon:Birney,David,B.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Birney</surname></persName>'s staff &mdash; I cannot now say which.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3008"/>To convey us thither over the intervening distance of <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure>, as I now remember, we hired a mule-driver with his army wagon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3010"/>The <measure n="7dollars" type="currency">seven dollars</measure> apiece per night which we received for our services was but a trifling compensation for the battering and mellowing we endured <hi rend="italics">en route</hi>, and no more than paid for wear and tear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3028"/>This order was issued before the corps were organized, while the wagons were yet with their regiments, and while the men yet had their big knapsacks, which they were always ready to ride with or toss into a wagon when the regiment moved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3029"/>This was the time of transporting tentfloors, the luxurious fault-finding period before carpets, <rs n="feather beds" type="product">feather-beds</rs>, and roast beef had entirely lost their charm; when each man was, in his own way and belief, fully the size of a major-general; when the <rs type="role" reg="medical-Director">medical director</rs> of the army had time, unaided as yet by subordinates, to decide the question of tent-floors <hi rend="italics">versus</hi> no tent-floors for individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3155"/>Without going into details, I may say that the total train of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2">Second Corps</orgName>, not including the ambulances, could not have been far from <num value="800">800</num> wagons, of which about <num value="600">600</num> carried the various supplies, and the remainder the baggage &mdash; the camp equipage of the corps. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3156"/>When the army was in settled camp, the supply trains went into park by themselves, but the baggage-wagons were retained with their corps, division, brigade, or regimental headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3157"/>When a march was ordered, however, these wagons waited only long enough to receive their freight of camp equipage, when away they went in charge of their respective quartermasters to join the corps supply train. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3158"/>I have alluded to the strength of a single corps train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3168"/>These were divided nearly equally between his <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 4">four corps</orgName>, each corps commander managing his own train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3169"/>In this campaign the transportation had the roads, while the infantry plodded along by the roadside. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3170"/>The supply trains, it will now be understood, were the travelling depot or reservoir from which the army replenished its needs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3171"/>When these wagons were emptied, they were at once sent back to the base of supplies, to be reloaded with precisely the same kind of material as before; and empty wagons had always to leave the road clear for loaded ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3172"/>Unless under a pressure of circumstances, all issues except of ammunition were made at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3173"/>By this plan the animals of the supply consumed their forage at the base of supplies, and thus saved hauling it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3178"/>The officers in immediate charge were especially burdened with responsibility, as the statement above illustrates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3182"/>The troops must have their rations, or, more important still, the ammunition must be at hand in case of need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3183"/>Sometimes they would accomplish the task assigned without difficulty, but it was the exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3184"/>Of course, they could not start until the army had got out of the way. Then, the roads, already cut up somewhat by the artillery, were soon rendered next to impassable by the moving trains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3185"/>The quartermaster in charge of a train would be called upon to extricate a wagon here that was blocking the way, to supply the place of a worn-out horse or mule there; to have a stalled wagon unloaded and its contents distributed among other wagons; to keep the train well closed up; to keep the right road even by night, when, of necessity, much of their travelling was done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3186"/>And if, with a series of such misfortunes befalling <pb id="p.366" n="366"/> him, the quartermaster reached his destination a few hours late, his chances were very good for being roundly sworn at by his superior officers for his delinquency. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3187"/>During the progress of the train, it may be said, the quartermaster would ease his nervous and troubled spirit by swearing at careless or unfortunate mule-drivers, who, in turn, would make the air blue with profanity addressed to their mules, individually or collectively, so that the anxiety to get through was felt by all the moving forces in the train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3188"/>A large number of these drivers were civilians early in the war, but owing to the lack of subordination which many of them showed, their places were largely supplied later by enlisted men, upon whom <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Sam</foreName></persName> had his grip, and who could not resign or <quote>swear back</quote> without penalty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3189"/>The place of the trains on an advance was in the rear of the army; on the retreat, in front, as a rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3190"/>If they were passing through a dangerous section of country, they were attended by a guard, sometimes of infantry, sometimes cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3191"/>The strength of the guard varied with the nature of the danger expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3192"/>Sometimes a regiment, sometimes a brigade or division, was detailed from a corps for the duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3194"/>When ammunition was wanted by a battery or a regiment in the line of battle, a wagon was sent forward from the train to supply it, the train remaining at a safe distance in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3195"/>The nearness of the wagon's approach was governed somewhat by the nature of the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3196"/>If there was cover to screen it from the enemy, like a hill or a piece of woods, it would come pretty near, but if exposed it would keep farther away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3197"/>When it was possible to do so, supplies both of subsistence and ammunition were brought <pb id="p.367" n="367"/> up by night when the army was in line of battle, for, as I have said elsewhere, a mule-team or a mule-train under fire was a diverting spectacle to every <num value="1">one</num> but the mule-drivers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3203"/>The landscape between this stirring scene and our standpoint presented <num value="1">one</num> of the most animated spectacles that I ever saw in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3204"/>Its most attractive feature was the numerous wagon-trains, whose long lines, stretching away for miles over the open plain, were hastening forward to a place of refuge, all converging towards a common centre &mdash; the high ground lying along the hither side of <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3205"/>The officers in charge of the trains, made somewhat nervous by the sounds of conflict reaching them from <pb id="p.368" n="368"/> the rear, impatiently urged on the drivers, who, in turn, with lusty lungs uttered vigorous oaths at the mules, punctuated by blows or cracks of the black snake that equalled in volume the intonations of a rifle; and these jumped into their harnesses and took the wagons along over stumps and through gullies with as great alacrity as if the chief strain and responsibility of the campaign centred in themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3206"/>An additional feature of animation was presented by the columns of infantry from the other corps, which alternated in the landscape with the lines of wagons, winding along into camp tired and footsore, but without apparent concern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3207"/>I do not now remember any other time in my experience when so large a portion of the <hi rend="italics">materiel</hi> and <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi> of the army could have been covered by a single glance as I saw in the gathering twilight of that <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct> afternoon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3208"/>The system of designating the troops by corps badges was extended to the transportation, and every wagon was marked on the side of the canvas covering with the corps badge, perhaps <measure n="18inches" type="distance">eighteen inches</measure> in diameter, and of the appropriate color to designate the division to which it belonged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3209"/>In addition to this, the number of its division, brigade, and the nature of its contents, whether rations, forage, clothing, or ammunition,--and, if the latter, the kind, whether artillery or musket, and the calibre,--were plainly stencilled in large letters on the cover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3210"/>All this and much more went to indicate as perfect organization in the trains as in the army itself, and to these men, who were usually farthest from the fray, for whom few words of appreciation have been uttered by distinguished writers on the war, I gladly put on record my humble opinion that the country is as much indebted as for the work of the soldiers in line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3211"/>They acted well their part, and all honor to them for it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3212"/>A regular army officer, who had a large experience in charge of trains, has suggested that a bugler for each brigade or division train would have been a valuable auxiliary <pb id="p.369" n="369"/> for starting or halting the trains, or for regulating the camp duties as in artillery and cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3213"/>It seems strange that so commendable a proposition was not thought of at the time. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3285"/>Where the surface was simply muddy, no stringers were used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3286"/>It should be said here that by far the greater portion of this variety of work fell to fatigue details from the infantry, as did much more of the labor which came within the scope of the engineers' duties; for the latter could not have accomplished <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> of the tasks devolved upon them in time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3288"/>I state this not in detraction of the engineers, who always did well, but in justice to the infantry, who so often supplemented the many and trying duties of their own department with the accomplishments of the <orgName n="Engineer Corps" type="corps">engineer corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3349"/>Each man, therefore, knows just what he has to do. The abutment party takes the initiative, by laying the abutment, and preparing the approaches as already described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3424"/><num value="3">Three</num> of these flags, <num value="1">one</num> <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure>, <num value="1">one</num> <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure>, and <num value="1">one</num> <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> square, were white, and had each a block of red in the centre <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> the dimensions of the flag; that is, a flag <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> square had a centre <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> square; <num value="2">two</num> flags were black with white centres, and <num value="2">two</num> were red with white centres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3425"/>When the flags were in use, they were tied to a staff, whose length varied with the size of the flag to be used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3426"/>If the distance to signal was great, or obstructions intervened, a long staff and a large flag were necessary; but the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 4">four-foot</orgName> flag was the <num value="1">one</num> in most common use. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3427"/>It will be readily inferred that the language of these flags was to be addressed to the eye and not the ear. To make that language plain, then, they must be distinctly seen by the persons whom they addressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3428"/>This will explain why they <figure id="fig.396"> 
<head>Plate <num value="1">1</num>.</head></figure> were of different colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3429"/>In making signals, the color of flag to be used depended upon the color of background against which it was to appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3430"/>For example, a <hi rend="italics">white</hi> flag, even with its red centre, could not be easily seen against the <pb id="p.397" n="397"/> sky as a background.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3431"/>In such a situation a <hi rend="italics">black</hi> flag was necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3432"/>With green or darkcolored backgrounds the <hi rend="italics">white</hi> flag was used, and in fact this was <hi rend="italics">the</hi> flag of the signal service, having been used, in all probability, <num value="9">nine</num> times out of every <num value="10">ten</num> that signals were made. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3434"/>made. Let me illustrate these motions ing cuts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3435"/>plate <num value="2">2</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3436"/>talk, certain motions were agreed upon to represent particular ideas, letters, and figures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3437"/>In like manner, a key, or <hi rend="italics">code</hi>, was constructed which interpreted the motions of the signal flag,--for it talked by motions,--and in accord with which the motions were by the accompany-<pb id="p.398" n="398"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3438"/>Plate <num value="1">1</num> represents a member of the <orgName n="Signal Corps" type="corps">Signal Corps</orgName> in position, holding the flag directly above his head, the staff vertical, and grasped by both hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3439"/>This is the position from which all the motions were made. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3440"/>Plate <num value="2">2</num> represents the flagman making the numeral <quote><num value="2">2</num></quote> or the letter <quote>i.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3441"/>This was done by waving the flag to the right and instantly returning it to a vertical position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3442"/>To make <quote><num value="1">1</num></quote> the flag was waved to the left, and instantly returned as before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3443"/>See plate <num value="3">3</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3444"/>This the code translated as the letter <quote>t</quote> and the word <quote>the.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3445"/><quote><num value="5">5</num></quote> was made by waving the flag directly to the front, and returning at once to the vertical. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3446"/>The signal code most commonly used included but <num value="2">two</num> symbols, which made it simple to use. With these, not only could all the letters of the alphabet and the numerals be communicated, but an endless variety of syllables, words, phrases, and statements besides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3447"/>As a matter of fact, however, it contained several <num value="1000">thousand</num> combinations of numerals with the significance of each combination attached to it. Let me illustrate still further by using the symbols <quote><num value="2">2</num></quote> and <quote><num value="1">1</num>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3448"/></p> 
<p>Let us suppose the flagman to make the signal for <quote><num value="1">1</num>,</quote> and follow it immediately with the motion for <quote><num value="2">2</num>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3449"/>This would naturally be read as <num value="12">12</num>, which the code showed to mean <persName n="Similarly,,O.,,," id="n0006.0022.00398.00451" reg="default:Similarly,O.,,,"><foreName>O.</foreName> <surname>Similarly</surname></persName>, <num value="2">two</num> consecutive waves to the right, or <num value="22">22</num>, represented the letter N. <num value="3">Three</num> waves to the right and <num value="1">one</num> to the left, or <num value="2221">2221</num>, stood for the syllable <hi rend="italics">tion</hi>. So by repeating the symbols and changing the combinations we might have, for example, <num value="2122">2122</num>, meaning <hi rend="italics">the enemy are advancing</hi>; or <dateStruct value="1122--"><year reg="1122">1122</year></dateStruct>, <hi rend="italics">the cavalry have halted;</hi> or <num value="12211">12211</num>, <hi rend="italics"><num value="3">three</num> guns in position</hi>; or <dateStruct value="1112--"><year reg="1112">1112</year></dateStruct>, <hi rend="italics"><measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> to the left</hi>,--all of which would appear in the code. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3450"/>Let us join a signal party for the sake of observing the method of communicating a message.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3451"/>Such a party, if complete, was composed of <num value="3">three</num> persons, viz., the <rs type="role" reg="Signal Officer">signal officer</rs> (commissioned) in charge, with a telescope and fieldglass; <pb id="p.399" n="399"/> the flagman, with his kit, and an orderly to take charge of the horses, if the station was only temporary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3452"/>The point selected from which to signal must be a commanding position, whether a mountain, a hill, a tree-top, or a house-top.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3453"/>The station having been attained, the flagman takes position, and the officer sweeps the horizon and intermediate territory with his telescope to discover another signal station, where a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> officer and flagman are posted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3454"/>Having discovered such a station, the officer directs his man to <quote>call</quote> that station.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3455"/>This he does by signalling the number of the station (for each station had a number), repeating the same until his signal is seen and answered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3456"/>It was the custom at stations to keep a man on the lookout, with the telescope, for signals, constantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3457"/>Having got the attention of the opposite station, the officer sends his message.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3458"/>The flagman was not supposed to know the import of the message which he waved out with his flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3459"/>The officer called the numerals, and the flagman responded with the required motions almost automatically, when well practised. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3460"/>At the end of each word motion <quote><num value="5">5</num></quote> was made once; at the end of a sentence <quote><num value="55">55</num></quote> ,; and of a message <quote><num value="555">555</num>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3461"/>There were a few words and syllables which were conveyed by a single motion of the flag; but, as a rule, the words had to be spelled out letter by letter, at least by beginners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3462"/>Skilled signalists, however, used many abbreviations, and rarely found it necessary to spell out a word in full. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3463"/>So much for the manner of <hi rend="italics">sending</hi> a message.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3464"/>Now let us join the party at the station where the message is being <hi rend="italics">received</hi>. There we simply find the officer sitting at his telescope reading the message being sent to him. Should he fail to understand any word, his own flagman signals an interruption, and asks a repetition of the message from the last word understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3465"/>Such occurrences were not frequent, however. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3466"/>The services of the <orgName n="Signal Corps" type="corps">Signal Corps</orgName> were just as needful and <pb id="p.400" n="400"/> valuable by night as in daylight; but, as the flags could not then talk understandingly, <hi rend="italics">Talking Torches</hi> were substituted for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3467"/>As a <quote>point of reference</quote> was needful, by which to interpret the torch signals made, the flagman lighted a <quote>foot torch,</quote> at which he stood firmly while he signalled with the <quote>flying torch.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3468"/>This latter was attached to a staff of the same length as the flagstaff, in fact, usually the flagstaff itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3469"/>These torches were of copper, and filled with turpentine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3470"/>At the end of a message the flying torch was extinguished. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3471"/>The rapidity with which messages were sent by experienced operators was something wonderful to the uneducated looker-on.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3472"/>An ordinary message of a few lines can be sent in <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure>, and the rate of speed is much increased where officers have worked long together, and understand each other's methods and abbreviations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3473"/>Signal messages have been sent <measure n="28miles" type="distance">twenty-eight miles</measure>; but that is exceptional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3474"/>The conditions of the atmosphere and the location of stations were seldom favorable to such longdistance signalling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3475"/>Ordinarily, messages were not sent more than <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure>, but there were exceptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3476"/>Here is a familiar but noted <num value="1">one</num>:-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3477"/>In the latter part of <dateStruct value="1864-09-"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, the <rs>Rebel</rs> army under <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0006.0022.00400.00452" reg="mostcommon:Hood,John,B.,,:1"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> set out to destroy the railroad communications of <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0006.0022.00400.00453" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:1"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, who was then at <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3479"/>As it was only held by a small brigade, whereas the enemy was seen advancing upon it in much superior numbers, <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0006.0022.00400.00454" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:1"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> signalled a despatch from <placeName reg="Vining's Station">Vining's Station</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,2062292" n="1.000 10" reg="Kenesaw, Adams, Nebraska">Kenesaw</placeName>, and from <placeName key="tgn,2062292" n="1.000 10" reg="Kenesaw, Adams, Nebraska">Kenesaw</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,2129741" n="1.000 35" reg="allatoona, bartow, georgia">Allatoona</placeName>, whence it was again signalled to <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3480"/>It requested <persName n="Corse,General,,,," id="n0006.0022.00400.00455" reg="nearbymention:Corse,John,M.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Corse</surname></persName>, who was at the latter place, to hurry back to the assistance of <placeName key="tgn,2129741" n="1.000 35" reg="allatoona, bartow, georgia">Allatoona</placeName>.

<p>The occasions which called the <orgName n="Signal Corps" type="corps">Signal Corps</orgName> into activity were various, but they were most frequently employed in reporting the movements of troops, sometimes of the <rs>Union</rs>, sometimes of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3491"/>They took post on elevated stations, whether a hill, a tall tree, or the top of a building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3492"/>Any position from which they could command a broad view of the surrounding country was occupied for their purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3493"/>If nature did not always provide a suitable place for <orgName n="Lookout Artillery" type="artillery">lookout, art</orgName> came to the rescue, and signal towers of considerable height were built for this class of workers, who, like the cavalry, were the <quote>eyes</quote> of the army if not the ears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3494"/>I remember several of these towers which stood before <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3495"/>They were of especial use there in observing the movements of troops within the enemy's lines, as they stood, I should judge, from <num value="100">one hundred</num> to <measure n="150feet" type="distance">one hundred and fifty feet</measure> high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3496"/>Although these towers were erected <pb id="p.402" n="402"/> somewhat to the rear of the <rs>Union</rs> main lines, and were a very open trestling, they were yet a conspicuous target for the enemy's long-range guns and mortar-shells. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3497"/>Sometimes the nerve of the flagman was put to a very severe test, as he stood on the summit of <num value="1">one</num> of these frail structures waving his flag, his situation too like that of Mahomet's coffin, while the <name>Whit</name>-<figure id="fig.402">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3498"/>Where is he?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3499"/>or, by another interpretation, <quote>Which <num value="1">one</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3500"/>Which <num value="1">one</num>?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3501"/>Had <num value="1">one</num> of these bolts hit a corner post of the lookout, the chances for the flagman and his lieutenant to reach the earth by a new route would have been favorable, although the engineers who built them claimed that with <hi rend="italics"><num value="3">three</num></hi> posts cut away the tower would still stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3502"/>But, as a matter of fact, I believe no shot ever seriously injured <num value="1">one</num> of the towers, though tons weight of iron must have been hurled at them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3503"/>The roof of the <rs type="place">Avery House</rs>, before <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, was used for a signal station, and the shells of the enemy's guns often tore through below much to the alarm of the signal men above. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3504"/>Signalling was carried on during an engagement between different parts of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3505"/>By calling for needed reenforce-ments, or giving news of their approach, or requesting ammunition, or reporting movements of the enemy, or noting the effects of shelling,--in these and a <num value="100">hundred</num> kindred ways the corps made their services invaluable to the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3506"/>Sometimes signal officers on shore communicated with others <pb id="p.403" n="403"/> on shipboard, and, in <num value="1">one</num> instance, <persName n="Brown,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0006.0022.00403.00464" reg="nearbymention:Brown,J.,Willard,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> told me that through the information he imparted to a gunboat off <placeName reg="Suffolk, Suffolk, Virginia" key="tgn,2114436">Suffolk</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, regarding the effects of the shot which were thrown from it, <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n0006.0022.00403.00465" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,James,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> had since written him that the fire was so accurate he was compelled to withdraw his troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3507"/>The signals were made from the tower of the <rs>Masonic Hall</rs> in <placeName reg="Suffolk, Suffolk, Virginia" key="tgn,2114436">Suffolk</placeName>, whence they were taken up by another signal party on the river bluff, and thence communicated to the gunboat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3508"/>Not long since, <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0006.0022.00403.00466" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, in conversation, alluded to a correspondent of the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <name>Herald</name></orgName> whom he had threatened to hang, declaring that had he done so his <quote>death would have saved <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> lives.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3509"/>The relation of this anecdote brings out another interesting phase of signalcorps operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3510"/>It seems that <num value="1">one</num> of our signal officers had succeeded in reading the signal code of the <figure id="fig.403"> 
<head>A Signal tower before <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg, Va.</placeName></head></figure> enemy, and had communicated the same to his fellowoffi-cers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3511"/>With this code in their possession, the corps was enabled to furnish valuable information directly from Rebel headquarters, by reading the <rs>Rebel</rs> signals, continuing to do so during the <rs>Chattanooga</rs> and much of the <rs n="Atlanta Campaign" type="campaign">Atlanta campaign</rs>, when the enemy's signal flags were often plainly visible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3512"/>Suddenly this source of information was completely cut off by the ambition of the correspondent to publish all <pb id="p.404" n="404"/> the news, and the natural result was the enemy changed the code.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3513"/>This took place just before <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0006.0022.00404.00467" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:1"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s attack on <placeName reg="Kenesaw Mountain, Cobb, Georgia" key="tgn,2434755">Kenesaw Mountain</placeName> (<dateStruct value="1864-06-"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>), and it is to the hundreds slaughtered there that he probably refers.
