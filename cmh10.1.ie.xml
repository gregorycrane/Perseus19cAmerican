<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>The National <orgName n="Democratic Convention" type="convention">Democratic convention</orgName> met at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, <dateStruct value="1860-04-29"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="29">29</day>, <year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>&mdash;the <rs>Louisiana</rs> <orgName n="Constitutional Convention" type="convention">Constitutional convention</orgName>, <dateStruct value="1861-01-23"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg="23">23</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Between these conventions Secession, as the inevitable result, of acute dissension in the old camps, was already standing with stalwart sponsors at the baptismal font of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Its time for action was not ripe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>It stood on guard, awaiting the summons with brave eyes sweeping the front.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>The answer of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> to the conflict of convention nominations was prompt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>This promptness was specially marked in her chief city in the sharpened activity of politicians and in the enthusiasm of rank and file.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>From its older days the native population of New Orleans, inspired by its French and <persName><foreName>Spanish</foreName></persName> blood, instinct in imagination, has lent itself readily to the picturesque angle in its public spectacles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>A presidential campaign in New Orleans largely exhibits, along with Southern heartiness, an &eacute;lan rarely found among the men of other cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Enthusiasm here assumes a poetic guise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The processions, marching with joyous abandon, carry within themselves an air of the carnival; the ranks, far from quiet be it said, fill the streets with racy cries; and around and about the transparencies shines a gleam of color which seen, is as inspiring as the mottoes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Strangely enough&mdash;yet not so odd, considering the <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> respectable and wealthy party back of it&mdash;the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> response came through a call, published in the papers, for a Bell and <persName n="Everett,,,,," id="n0253.0001.00004.00003" reg="mostcommon:Everett,nomatch:0"><surname>Everett</surname></persName> ratification meeting to be held on <dateStruct value="-05-30"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="30">30th</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>This call was signed by an imposing number of citizens, prominent in every branch of the public interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Among the names subscribed were found those of <persName n="Hunt,,Randell,,," id="n0253.0001.00004.00004" reg="default:Hunt,Randell,,,"><foreName>Randell</foreName> <surname>Hunt</surname></persName> and <persName n="Roselius,,Christian,,," id="n0253.0001.00004.00005" reg="default:Roselius,Christian,,,"><foreName>Christian</foreName> <surname>Roselius</surname></persName>, eminent members of the bar; <persName n="Greenwood,,Moses,,," id="n0253.0001.00004.00006" reg="default:Greenwood,Moses,,,"><foreName>Moses</foreName> <surname>Greenwood</surname></persName>, banker; <persName n="Conway,,John,R.,," id="n0253.0001.00004.00007" reg="default:Conway,John,R.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Conway</surname></persName>, afterward mayor; <persName n="King,,W.,H.,C.," id="n0253.0001.00004.00008" reg="default:King,W.,H.,C.,"><foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>King</surname></persName>, journalist; <persName n="Seymour,,I.,G.,," id="n0253.0001.00004.00009" reg="expanded:Seymour,Isaac,G.,,"><foreName>I.</foreName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <surname>Seymour</surname></persName>, editor of the <name>Bulletin</name>; <persName n="Sloo,,Thomas,,," id="n0253.0001.00004.00010" reg="default:Sloo,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Sloo</surname></persName>, merchant; <persName n="Lumsden,,F.,A.,," id="n0253.0001.00004.00011" reg="default:Lumsden,F.,A.,,"><foreName>F.</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Lumsden</surname></persName>, editor of the <name>Picayune</name>; <persName n="Denegre,,W.,O.,," id="n0253.0001.00004.00012" reg="default:Denegre,W.,O.,,"><foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>O.</foreName> <surname>Denegre</surname></persName>, lawyer; <persName n="Parker,,E.,T.,," id="n0253.0001.00004.00013" reg="default:Parker,E.,T.,,"><foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName>, sheriff of <placeName reg="Orleans, Louisiana, United States" key="tgn,2000889">Orleans parish</placeName>; and, to conclude with a war name, <persName n="Walton,,J.,B.,," id="n0253.0001.00004.00014" reg="expanded:Walton,John,B.,,"><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Walton</surname></persName>, to be veteran major of the <orgName n="Washington Artillery" type="artillery">Washington Artillery</orgName> when the bugle should sound for battle, and the gallant colonel of that superb battalion on fields not less hard-fought than glorious.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>At this meeting, with all their voices for <persName n="Bell,,,,," id="n0253.0001.00004.00015" reg="mostcommon:Bell,Henry,H.,,:1"><surname>Bell</surname></persName> and <persName n="Everett,,,,," id="n0253.0001.00004.00016" reg="mostcommon:Everett,nomatch:0"><surname>Everett</surname></persName>, appeared for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time the <q direct="unspecified">Young Bell Ringers.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>These were a gallant band of marchers; young men, stepping jauntily and jesting while they stepped; evidently musically inclined, since in their bands, with a pleasantly conceived jeu d'esprit on their principal candidate's name, each bore and zealously rang a bell, great or small, with note sharp or mellow, as the need was. The <q direct="unspecified">Young Bell Ringers</q> presented the picturesque element in the presidential campaign of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Opposed to them in the canvass, equally light in step, equally witty in tongue, equally proud in their candidates, came, sweeping along in their processions in pride of hopeful youth, the <q direct="unspecified">Young Men's Breckinridge and Lane Club.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Less wealthy than their rivals, they did not spring from darkness into sudden light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Their growth from a small beginning had been slow&mdash;from darkness into half tone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the <q direct="unspecified">Young Men's Breckinridge and Lane Club</q> showed <num value="12">twelve</num> members, as aggressive in speeches as they were sturdy in spirit <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> Though small in numbers, this club had, from its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gathering, with a purpose boldly proclaimed at the meetings and fearlessly shouted in the streets, impressed itself upon the imaginations of unattached Democrats of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>From it sprang, in different parts of the city, clubs like the <rs>Young Guards</rs>, Breckinridge Guards, Chalmette Guards, <orgName n="Southern Guards" type="guards">Southern Guards</orgName>, as from a mother organization.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It was not long before it became noticed by keen eyes on the banquette that the small group following the main parade was like an island on fire in a quiet sea. Among those sharp eyes were others belonging to young men, still unplaced in the campaign because dubious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>In this estuary the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> parade of the club turned the tide to fulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>As it marched along it was flanked by <num value="2">two</num> stalwart scouts who kept the crowd moving either side of the procession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>There are many veterans, old men now, young then, who still remember those scouts of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> and how well they kept the ways free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The ethics of the clubs of both parties leaned to mercy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>No crowns were cracked; but order&mdash;as the primal law of parades&mdash;was rigidly maintained.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>In this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> procession the club made converts as it marched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It attracted them by a debonair step; and won and retained them by cheers full of fire and already aggressive with <q direct="unspecified">Dixie.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The tide rose swift and high in <num value="1">one</num> night, as that of the bay of <placeName reg="Fundy">Fundy</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>At the next procession of clubs, now increased in number, the <rs>Young Men</rs>'s Breckinridge and <persName n="Lane,,,,," id="n0253.0001.00005.00017" reg="mostcommon:Lane,nomatch:0"><surname>Lane</surname></persName> club, with <persName n="Lagarde,,Ernest,,," id="n0253.0001.00005.00018" reg="default:Lagarde,Ernest,,,"><foreName>Ernest</foreName> <surname>Lagarde</surname></persName>, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> president, and his successor in office, <persName n="Ogden,,Fred,,," id="n0253.0001.00005.00019" reg="default:Ogden,Fred,,,"><foreName>Fred</foreName> <surname>Ogden</surname></persName>, paraded <num value="2000">two thousand</num> strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>No longer a faction of the <rs>Democratic</rs> host, it had become the procession, since, wherever placed, its banners were <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sought and its gay and ringing shouts were eagerly listened for.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>As the growth of the club developed, the <rs>Young Bell Ringers</rs> began gradually to haunt the banquette.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>They were there to watch the swing and to pass comments on <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> the campaign music of their rivals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Friendship allied many in either rank; kinship, not a few; yet loyalty was for a space intense enough to divide them by a party-hedge of the thickest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/><num value="1">One</num> night, when the campaign was still young, a new shout, with a strange rhythm about the words, startled the <rs>Bell</rs> men. This cry came from <num value="2000">two thousand</num> lungs, filling the air with its proud defiance and stirring the <rs>Bell Ringers</rs> to many a satiric retort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Not yet heeding, they were soon to heed the solemn voice of their mother State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>These gibes came from those whose credo was all for the <q direct="unspecified">Union and the <name>Enforcement</name> of the <name>Laws</name>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/></p> 
<p>The cry of that night prefigured the future: <q direct="unspecified">Hurrah for the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>A subtone of youth's thoughtlessness might have been in it. For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time injected into a Louisiana campaign, it was the key to that far mightier voice, yet unlocked, which, springing from heroism, was, in a muster of armies, to ring through the valleys and echo from the hills of an embattled South.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>In New Orleans there was in that day a large body of citizens faithful to their section, but of conservative tone and suspicious of overhaste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>These heard this new cry of the young Democrats and thought it imprudent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Some of them, indeed, reported the incident to the leaders of the party, then to be found in the rooms of the <orgName n="State Central Committee" type="committee">State central committee</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Strong with experience, the elders shook their heads gravely, but&mdash;like <persName n="Tennyson,,,,," id="n0253.0001.00006.00020" reg="mostcommon:Tennyson,nomatch:0"><surname>Tennyson</surname></persName>'s wise old chamberlain&mdash;said nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Occasion was promptly found, however, to see the young children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/><q direct="unspecified">Don't go too fast, boys,</q> said <num value="1">one</num>, hiding behind grave glasses a smiling eye. <q direct="unspecified">Now, you must really be more cautious,</q> echoed another, beaming on the offenders.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The counsel was fatherly, the rebuke mild.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The Young Men's Breckinridge and <persName n="Lane,,,,," id="n0253.0001.00006.00021" reg="mostcommon:Lane,nomatch:0"><surname>Lane</surname></persName> club received this warning from their leaders with respect, shrugged their shoulders on leaving the room, and continued to shout, with scarcely bated voices, for a Confederacy then mistily <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> arising amid the shadows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>It would have been far from prudent leadership in the closing months of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> to crush the high temper of youths who might, within <num value="0.5">a half</num> year, be carrying a musket or riding double on a caisson.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>In this gallant temper of her young men, New Orleans recalls with pride that of all her sons, marching under what banners soever or shouting what party names in the canvass of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, none able to go was found lacking when <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> needed his services on the field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>With the progress of the campaign, bad news came to render the timid anxious and to make the brave heady.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The news felt like a breath of war from the <rs>Hudson</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Arrangements were making, it was said, on a given date before the election, to parade all the <rs>Black Republican</rs> <q direct="unspecified">Wide-awake</q> clubs in New York and <placeName reg="Brooklyn, New York, Kings" key="tgn,7015822">Brooklyn</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Instant was the antagonism to this veiled threat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/><q direct="unspecified">Wide awake to what?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>asked men of all parties on the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>To this question, but <num value="1">one</num> answer could be truthful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>This bit of news came to be a triumph for the <rs>Young Men</rs>'s Breckinridge and <persName n="Lane,,,,," id="n0253.0001.00007.00022" reg="mostcommon:Lane,nomatch:0"><surname>Lane</surname></persName> club.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Their enthusiasm had been wiser, had looked more clearly into the future than the prudence of their elders; had seen, to use a strong <name>French</name> expression, the <q direct="unspecified">movement coming.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Meantime the election went apace with its shouts, its bands and transparencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>At the end of <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> a Breckinridge and <persName n="Lane,,,,," id="n0253.0001.00007.00023" reg="mostcommon:Lane,nomatch:0"><surname>Lane</surname></persName> mass-meeting was held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The club not only led the van of a monster parade, but marched proudly under the folds of a beautiful banner presented to it on <dateStruct value="-09-24"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="24">24th</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>A notable feature in this procession was the appearance of the <rs type="place">Lane</rs> Dragoons&mdash;a new club of horsemen, recently organized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>On their horses the dragoons, <num value="90">ninety</num> strong, presented a military aspect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Many, by the way, considered this a fair <persName n="Roland,,,,," id="n0253.0001.00007.00024" reg="mostcommon:Roland,nomatch:0"><surname>Roland</surname></persName> for the Wide-awake <persName n="Oliver,,,,," id="n0253.0001.00007.00025" reg="mostcommon:Oliver,R.,P.,,:1"><surname>Oliver</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>They wore black coats buttoned up, with a white belt bearing the club name, and a cap decorated with a gold band.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Of this parade, with politics in a ferment, the <name>Picayune</name> <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> said: <q direct="unspecified">A grand affair and remarkable for its composition.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/></p> 
<p>The campaign moved swiftly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/><dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct> came and found the <rs>Young Bell Ringers</rs> full of purpose, strengthening their party by mass-meetings in different parts of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>They affected the public squares, holding their assemblies on <address><street n="Lafayette square">Lafayette square</street></address> and <address><street n="Annunciation square">Annunciation square</street></address> in the <orgName type="district" n="district 1">First district</orgName>, and <address><street n="Washington square">Washington square</street></address> in the <num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>At each meeting the <rs>Bell</rs> and <rs>Everett</rs> men were surrounded by crowds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Their meetings under the trees became a marked feature of the canvass&mdash;nay, they undoubtedly aided the large vote that came with election day. In a measure, <persName n="Breckinridge,,,,," id="n0253.0001.00008.00026" reg="nearbymention:Breckinridge,John,C.,,"><surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName> men were more domestic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>They had held their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meeting in Armory hall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>As the fight went on, they clung to its white-washed walls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>It was soon known that at Armory hall were to be found eloquent speakers, strong speeches, bright lights, enlivening cries, stirring campaign songs, along with an enthusiasm which, springing from the club, rose to fill all visitors with political ozone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>These chance meetings gathered night after night The public meetings were merely an ordinary night's meeting, enlarged and improved and <q direct="unspecified">ozoned.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/></p> 
<p>On <dateStruct value="-10-29"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg="29">29th</day></dateStruct> the <name>Breckinridge</name> club swung into a new path.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>On that day they went, carrying their new banner, down to the <rs type="place">Pontchartrain depot</rs> on Elysian Fields to welcome <persName n="Yancey,the Honorable,William,Lowndes,," id="n0253.0001.00008.00027" reg="default:Yancey,William,Lowndes,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>Lowndes</foreName> <surname>Yancey</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, the magnetic orator of disunion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Some time previous they had invited this famous <q direct="unspecified">firer of Cotton States into rebellion</q> to address the <name>Democracy</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>New Orleans was ablaze with excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>A vast crowd of all parties assembled on <address><street n="Camp street">Camp street</street></address> to hear <persName n="Yancey,Mister,,,," id="n0253.0001.00008.00028" reg="nearbymention:Yancey,William,Lowndes,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Yancey</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>A brilliant speech from the orator was followed by a torchlight procession which filled the streets with Southern airs and cries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>He had more than kept his word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/><pb id="p.9" n="9"/></p> 
<p>A week after this, on <dateStruct value="-11-7"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="7">7th</day></dateStruct>, the telegraph flashed to the <rs>Union</rs> of divided minds the result of the election held on the <dateStruct value="--6"><day reg="2">6th</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7007256" n="1.000 183" reg="louisiana">Louisiana</placeName> the election of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0253.0001.00009.00030" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, the candidate of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of that party to snatch victory from the vote of a united country, fell like a shock of icicles upon citizens of all parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Some received the news with amazement, others with apprehension, others with indignation; all with disappointment During the campaign, thus adversely ended, <persName n="Breckinridge,,John,C.,," id="n0253.0001.00009.00031" reg="default:Breckinridge,John,C.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName> had said: <q direct="unspecified">In the <rs>Southern States</rs> of the <rs>Union</rs> a few are, perhaps, per se disunionists&mdash;though I doubt if they are.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>It consolidated the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>After the result was known, politics turned into a game of partners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>The Young Bell Ringers maintained their organization for a while.
