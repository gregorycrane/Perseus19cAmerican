<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/><emph>W</emph>E remarked recently in the hearing of several persons, <q direct="unspecified">There's a subway a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> long in <placeName>Medford</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Our auditors, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> incredulous, were later curious to know where it might be, and we told them&mdash;of its size, location, and purpose for which it was constructed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>It lies beneath <address><street n="Jerome street">Jerome</street></address> and <address><street n="Sherman street">Sherman streets</street></address>, crosses under High, and extends through the former <rs>Brooks</rs> estate to <placeName>Mystic</placeName> upper lake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Its terminal stations were the brick gate-houses beside the river and above the dam that separates the <num value="2">two</num> divisions of what used to be called <placeName>Medford</placeName> ponds ere this was built.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>It is, or rather was, a sub-waterway, the conduit of the <orgName n="Charlestown Water Works" type="works">Charlestown Water Works</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>At the time of its building, public <orgName n="Water Works" type="works">water works</orgName> were confined to the larger cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>The city of <placeName reg="Charlestown">Charlestown</placeName>, after considering various sources of supply, decided upon <placeName reg="Medford pond">Medford pond</placeName>, whose watershed extended backward to the divide between the <placeName reg="Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States" key="tgn,1124945">Ipswich</placeName> and <placeName reg="Aberjona, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1120924">Aberjona rivers</placeName> in <placeName>Wilmington</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>By natural configuration <placeName reg="Medford pond">Medford pond</placeName> lent itself well to the design.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The Narrows, or the <name>Partings</name>, were the names by which the location of the impounding dam had been previously known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It must have been a picturesque spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>We have found no view of it preserved by artist's brush or pencil of those pre-camera days, but have heard it much spoken of.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/><num value="2">Two</num> wedge-shaped portions of <placeName>Medford</placeName> and <placeName>West Cambridge</placeName> extended into the pond so nearly that a plank would bridge the strait, and in which was but slight fall.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Of this entire work of so much magnitude and importance but little has been preserved in <placeName>Medford</placeName> annals, <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> and but for the fact that <num value="1">one</num> of the engineers engaged on the work made a private record of his doings from start to finish it would be difficult at this time to ascertain the facts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Preliminary surveys were begun <q direct="unspecified">on a high bluff east of the <name>Narrows</name> on <dateStruct value="1862-04-14"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="14">14</day>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>,</q> by <num value="2">two</num> engineers, with a laborer to assist, and on <dateStruct value="-04-16"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="16">16</day></dateStruct> <persName n="Buchanan,,Roberdeau,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00002" reg="default:Buchanan,Roberdeau,,,"><foreName>Roberdeau</foreName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> joined them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It was he who made the record to which we allude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It is illustrated by accurate drawings of the entire work, explanatory of the text of his record, and is now in the <orgName>office of the Metropolitan</orgName> Water Commission, by whose courtesy we were permitted to examine its interesting pages and compile this account.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>These engineers reached <placeName key="possibilities=43" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Walnut hill</placeName>, the site of the distributing reservoir, on <dateStruct value="1862-04-25"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="25">25</day>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, and it is interesting to note just here, that in their more than <measure n="2mile" type="distance">two-mile</measure> walk they passed near to no dwellings until reaching <persName n="Winthrop,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00003" reg="nearbymention:Winthrop,John,,,"><surname>Winthrop</surname></persName>, then called <placeName reg="South River, Georgia, United States" key="tgn,2681709">South</placeName> street, where there was a house which was later the residence of <persName n="Perkins,Mister,J.,W.,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00004" reg="default:Perkins,J.,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Perkins</surname></persName>. <placeName reg="Seventeen houses">Seventeen houses</placeName>, <num value="4">four</num> of which were upon the <rs type="place">Brooks</rs> estate, comprised all then west of and near the railway, and but <num value="3">three</num> buildings housed <orgName n="Tufts College" type="college">Tufts College</orgName> then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Contrast this open plain and hill-slope with existing conditions and population.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>On <dateStruct value="-04-21"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="21">21</day></dateStruct> another party began a survey westward toward <placeName reg="Wyman Hill, Essex, New York" key="tgn,2783696">Wyman hill</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7013320" n="1.000 30" reg="arlington, middlesex county, massachusetts">West Cambridge</placeName>, on which the reservoir would have been located had that route or plan been chosen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>But the eastern route, suggested by <persName n="Baldwin,Engineer,,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00005" reg="mostcommon:Baldwin,James,F.,,:2"><roleName n="Engineer">engineers</roleName> <surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> and <persName n="Stevenson,Engineer,,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00006" reg="mostcommon:Stevenson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Engineer"></roleName><surname>Stevenson</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></dateStruct> was decided upon and work begun thereon by survey on <dateStruct value="1862-05-19"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="19">19</day>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The actual work upon this portion was begun on <dateStruct value="1863-01-08"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg="8">8</day>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, in the construction of the coffer-dam for the gate-house and bridge across the <rs>Mystic</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Just here we obtain a hint of the forestry conditions at the <q direct="unspecified">Partings</q> then existing:&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Piles, of white oak <hi rend="italics">recently</hi> cut near the pond . . . <num value="11">11</num> pairs <measure n="13feet" type="distance">13 feet</measure> apart and <measure n="15feet" type="distance">15 feet</measure> between the <num value="2">two</num> rows, driven <num value="4">4</num> to <measure n="5feet" type="distance">5 feet</measure> below the bed of the river.</p></quote> <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> These piles supported a narrow bridge <measure n="143.9feet" type="distance">143.9 feet</measure> long, and were a part of the coffer-dam within which the conduit was built beneath the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>This conduit here consisted of <num value="2">two</num> <measure n="36inch" type="distance">36-inch</measure> iron pipes, placed <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> from centers, laid in and covered with concrete and puddled on either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The cost of this (bridge and pipe) section was <measure n="6700.00dollars" type="currency">$6,700.00</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>We were told years ago by <persName n="Symmes,Superintendent,Luther,,," id="n0334.0002.00003.00007" reg="default:Symmes,Luther,,,"><roleName n="Superintendent">Supt.</roleName> <foreName>Luther</foreName> <surname>Symmes</surname></persName>, that at that time the commissioners made effort with <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> selectmen to have our town share in the expense of a wider and more desirable bridge, as this was in the line of a proposed street, but without success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Built as originally designed, and though the traveling public had no right therein, it served as the only passage across the river between <address><street n="Harvard avenue">Harvard avenue</street></address> and <address><street n="Winthrop street">Winthrop street</street></address> until <placeName reg="Canal bridge">Canal bridge</placeName> and <address><street n="Boston avenue">Boston avenue</street></address> were opened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It continued in use until <dateStruct value="1910--"><year reg="1910">1910</year></dateStruct>, and since its removal has been greatly missed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The <num value="2">two</num> iron pipes mentioned form <measure n="485.5feet" type="distance">485 1/2 feet</measure> of the conduit from pump-well to gate-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The remainder is of brick construction, the lower portion a semicircle of <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> inside diameter, the upper an oval of <num value="2">two</num> axes, giving an inside height of <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> and <measure n="8inches" type="distance">eight inches</measure>. The invert is laid in a bed of concrete, and in various places this required a pile and timber support.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>As the lower pond received the inflow of the tide twice daily, an artificial channel with automatic gates was made in the river below <placeName reg="Wear bridge">Wear bridge</placeName> to keep out the flood, and removed at completion of the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Even then, and with the aid of <num value="2">two</num> steam pumps, but <measure n="30feet" type="distance">30 feet</measure> could be built at a time, and some sections had to be rebuilt because of insecure foundation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Inlets were provided in the top at regular intervals, but nearly all were permanently covered beneath the surface of the ground, leaving but a few with removable iron covers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>We recall <num value="1">one</num> of these near <address><street n="Harvard avenue">Harvard avenue</street></address>, which was a sort of way-station used by the operating workmen, who entered for the purpose of sweeping the <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> bottom, which had but <measure n="1inch" type="distance">one-inch</measure> incline in <measure n="100feet" type="distance">100 feet</measure> on its course.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Among the trees (the <q direct="unspecified"><address><street n="Mystic road">Mystic</street></address> hickories</q>) on the <rs type="place">Brooks</rs> estate was a star-shaped brick structure, about <measure n="9feet" type="distance">nine feet</measure> high, with overhanging roof, which served as a ventilator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>We once saw an attractive water-color of this in a West Medford home and hoped to secure it for illustration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Recent inquiry failed us, and it is probably lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>No longer needed, this structure was removed in the building of the <name>Parkway</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The conduit in <num value="1">one</num> place lies close to the course of the famous old waterway, the <rs type="place">Middlesex canal</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Indeed, the old canal contributed to its construction by the removal of <num value="1">one</num> of the banks to grade over the new structure, as shown in <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0002.00004.00008" reg="nearbymention:Buchanan,Roberdeau,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>'s drawing and record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/><measure n="2.5years" type="date">Two years and a half</measure> had elapsed since the engineers began work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The entire system, of which this was but an essential part, was also complete and ready for service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>That it will ever be used again now appears unlikely, unless, indeed-and who knows?-some new and now unthought&mdash;of industry, public or otherwise, should arise, to which this great work of <num value="0.5">a half</num> century ago may in some equally unthought&mdash;of way lend itself.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The name came into use when the present station house of the railroad was built.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Prior to its building, the depot, as it was called, was on the opposite side of the railway cut, reached from the tracks by <num value="1">one</num> long flight of stairs, and was appropriately known as <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> steps.
