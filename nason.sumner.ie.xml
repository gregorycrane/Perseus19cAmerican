<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>The design of this work is to set forth in distinct relief the life, character, and public career of an accomplished scholar, an incorruptible statesman, and an eminent and eloquent defender of human freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>In every age men have arisen, and, by the force of an original genius and a lofty aspiration, have come to stand as heralds in the fore-front of national progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Their high mission has been to point with a prophetic finger to the coming issues; to sway and elevate with a commanding eloquence the public mind; to meet the exigencies of the times; and to pursue, unterrified by power and above the reach of bribery, their own elected course with an unfaltering steadiness to the end. Such was the dauntless <rs>John Hampden</rs> of the <orgName n="Long Parliament" type="parliament">Long Parliament</orgName> in the days of <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName> the <genName n="1">First</genName></persName>; such was the patriot <rs>Samuel Adams</rs> in our Revolutionary crisis; such was the golden-voiced <persName n="Sumner,,Charles,,," id="n0150.0000.00005.00004" reg="default:Sumner,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> in the ordeal from which we now are slowly rising.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>In the late tremendous struggle for human freedom he stood forth pre-eminent as a prophet, as a leader, as a counsellor, as an unflinching friend of the oppressed; and to his brave outlook over the whole field of contest, to his extensive knowledge of political history, <pb id="p.6" n="6"/>to his grand ideal of a perfect commonwealth, and to his impassioned eloquence, must be in part ascribed the ardor which inspired our Union army, and the success which crowned the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Others grandly spoke and fought for freedom: but none more eloquently, more learnedly, more effectively, enunciated its eternal principles than he; nor more profoundly and persistently instilled into the public mind its justice, grandeur, and necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The life of such a man is therefore a lesson and an inspiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It will ever be held as a kind of beacon-light by the <foreign lang="fr">avant-couriers</foreign> of freedom, not only in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, but throughout the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>In attempting to portray it, I shall endeavor to be guided by the words of his own favorite <persName n="Shakspeare,,,,," id="n0150.0000.00006.00005" reg="mostcommon:Shakspeare,William,,,:1"><surname>Shakspeare</surname></persName>:--<quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/></p><l>Speak of me as I am: nothing extenuate,</l> <l>Nor set down aught in malice.</l></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>As often as practicable, he will be permitted to speak in his own language; and many of the most eloquent passages from his ablest orations will be introduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It is hoped that this record, the materials for which have been drawn from the most reliable sources, may prove acceptable to the patriot, the scholar, the orator, and the friend of freedom; that it may serve in some degree to promote the principles of liberty, fraternity, and equality among men, and to awaken some fresh aspirations for a still nobler national life and destiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The author would here express his sincere thanks to those personal friends of <persName n="Sumner,Mister,,,," id="n0150.0000.00006.00006" reg="nearbymention:Sumner,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName>, and also to other gentlemen, who have kindly assisted in this undertaking.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1105"/>Sir, I have never been a politician.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>The slave of principles, I call no party master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/>By sentiment, education, and conviction, a friend of human rights in their utmost expansion, I have ever most sincerely embraced the democratic idea; not, indeed, as represented or professed by any party, but according to its real significance, as transfigured in the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> and in the inspiration of Christianity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>In this idea I saw no narrow advantages merely for individuals or classes, but the sovereignty of the people, and the greatest happiness of all secured by equal laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1111"/>And here, sir, I may speak proudly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1112"/>By no effort, by no desire, of my own, I find myself a senator of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>Never before have I held public office of any kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>With the ample opportunities of private life I was content.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1115"/>No tombstone for me could bear a fairer inscription than this: <quote>Here lies <num value="1">one</num> who, without the honors or emoluments of public station, did something for his fellow-man.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1116"/>From such simple aspirations I was taken away by the free choice of my native Commonwealth, and placed in this responsible post of duty, without personal obligation of any kind beyond what was implied in my life and published words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1117"/>The earnest friends by whose confidence I was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> designated asked nothing from me, and, throughout the long conflict which ended in my election, rejoiced in the position which I most carefully guarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1118"/>To all my language was uniform, that I did not desire to be brought forward; that I would do nothing to promote the result; that I had no pledges or promises to offer; that the office should seek me, and not I the office; and that it should find me in all respects an independent man, bound to no party and to no human being, but only, according to my best judgment, to act for the good of all. Again, sir, I speak with pride, both for myself and others, when I add, that these avowals found a sympathizing response.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1125"/>Of them I do not speak; but without fear and without favor, as without impeachment of any person, I assail this wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1144"/>His main proposition he thus announces,--<quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1145"/>The relations of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> (I speak of the national government) to slavery, though plain and obvious, are constantly misunderstood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1146"/>A popular belief at this moment makes slavery a national institution, and, of course, renders its support a national duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1147"/>The extravagance of this error can hardly be surpassed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1148"/>An institution which our fathers most carefully omitted to name in the constitution; which, according to the debates in the convention, they refused to cover with any <quote>sanction;</quote> and which, at the original organization of the government, was merely sectional, existing nowhere on the national territory,--is now, above all other things, emblazoned as national.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1149"/>Its supporters plume themselves as national.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1150"/>The old political parties, while upholding it, claim to be national.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1151"/>A national Whig is simply a slavery Whig; and a national Democrat is simply a slavery Democrat,--in contradistinction to all who regard slavery as a sectional institution, <pb id="p.159" n="159"/>within the exclusive control of the <name>States</name>, and with which the nation has nothing to do. As slavery assumes to be national, so, by an equally strange perversion, freedom is degraded to be sectional; and all who uphold it under the national constitution share the same epithet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1152"/>The honest efforts to secure its blessings everywhere within the jurisdiction of Congress are scouted as sectional; and this cause which the founders of our national government had so much at heart is called <quote>sectionalism.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1153"/>These terms, now belonging to the commonplaces of political speech, are adopted and misapplied by most persons without reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1154"/>But herein is the power of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1156"/>But slavery has done more than this: it has changed word for word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1157"/>It has taught many to say <quote>national</quote> instead of <quote>sectional,</quote> and <quote>sectional</quote> instead of <quote>national.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1158"/>Slavery national!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1159"/>Sir, this is all a mistake and absurdity, fit to take a place in some new collection of vulgar errors by some other <persName n="Browne,Sir,Thomas,,," id="n0150.0009.00159.00688" reg="default:Browne,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Browne</surname></persName>, with the ancient but exploded stories that the toad has a stone in its head, and that ostriches digest iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1160"/>According to the true spirit of the constitution, and the sentiments of the fathers slavery and not freedom is sectional, while freedom and not slavery is national.

<p>In an admirable review of the course of argument, he says,--<quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1167"/>And now, sir, let us review the field over which we have passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1168"/>We have seen that any compromise, finally closing the discussion of slavery under the constitution, is tyrannical, absurd, and impotent; that, as slavery can exist only by virtue of positive law, and as it has no such positive support in the constitution, it cannot exist within the national jurisdiction; that the constitution nowhere recognizes property in man; and that, according to its true interpretation, freedom and not slavery is national, while slavery and not freedom is sectional; that in this spirit the national government was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> organized under <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0150.0009.00160.00693" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, himself an abolitionist, surrounded by abolitionists, while the whole country, by its church, its colleges, its literature, and all its best voices, was united against slavery, and the national flag at that time nowhere within the national territory covered a single slave; still further, that the national <pb id="p.161" n="161"/>government is a government of delegated powers; and, as among these there is no power to support slavery, this institution cannot be national, nor can Congress in any way legislate in its behalf; and, finally, that the establishment of this principle is the true way of peace and safety for the republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1169"/>Considering next the provision for the surrender of fugitives from labor, we have seen that it was not <num value="1">one</num> of the original compromises of the constitution; that it was introduced tardily and with hesitation, and adopted with little discussion, and then and for a long period after was regarded with comparative indiference; that the recent Slave Act, though many times unconstitutional, is especially so on <num value="2">two</num> grounds,--<hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num></hi> as a usurpation by Congress of powers not granted by the constitution, and an infraction of rights secured to the <name>States</name>; and <hi rend="italics">secondly</hi> as a denial of trial by jury in a question of personal liberty and a suit at common law; that its glaring unconstitutionality finds a prototype in the <rs>British</rs> <name n="Stamp Act" type="legislation">Stamp Act</name>, which our fathers refused to obey as unconstitutional on <num value="2">two</num> parallel grounds,--<hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num></hi> because it was a usurpation by parliament of powers not belonging to it under the <orgName n="British Constitution" type="newspaper">British constitution</orgName>, and an infraction of rights belonging to the colonies; and <hi rend="italics">secondly</hi> because it was a denial of trial by jury in certain cases of property; that, as liberty is far above property, so is the outrage perpetrated by the <orgName n="American Congress" type="congress">American Congress</orgName> far above that perpetrated by the <orgName n="British Parliament" type="parliament">British Parliament</orgName>; and, finally, that the <rs>Slave Act</rs> has not that support in the public sentiment of the <name>States</name> where it is to be executed, which is the life of all law, and which prudence and the precept of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> require.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1337"/>In this solemn <pb id="p.182" n="182"/>language, which has been strangely pronounced blasphemous on this floor, there is obviously no assumption of ecclesiastical power, as has been perversely charged, but simply a devout observance of the <name>Scriptural</name> injunction, <quote>Whatsoever ye do, in word or deed, do all in the name of the <rs>Lord</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1338"/>Let me add, also, that these remonstrants, in this very language, have followed the example of the <name>Senate</name>, which at our present session has ratified at least <num value="1">one</num> important treaty beginning with these precise words, <quote>In the name of Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</quote>

<p>the bill which you are now about to pass is at once the worst and the best bill on which Congress ever acted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1358"/>Yes, <rs type="role" reg="Sir">sir</rs>, Worst and best at the same time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1359"/>It is the worst bill, inasmuch as it is a present victory of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1360"/>In a Christian land, and in an age of civilization, a time-honored statute of freedom is struck down, opening the way to all the countless woes and wrongs of human bondage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1361"/>Among the crimes of history another is about to be recorded, which no tears can blot out, and which, in better days, will be read with universal shame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1364"/>Am I not right, then, in calling it the worst bill on which Congress ever acted?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1365"/>But there is another side to which I gladly turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1366"/>Sir, it is <pb id="p.184" n="184"/>the best bill on which Congress ever acted; for it prepares the way for that <quote>All hail hereafter,</quote> when slavery must disappear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1367"/>It annuls all past compromises with slavery, and makes all future compromises impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1368"/>Thus it puts freedom and slavery face to face, and bids them grapple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1369"/>Who can doubt the result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1370"/>It opens wide the door of the future, when, at last, there will really be a North, and the slave-power will be broken; when this wretched despotism will cease to dominate over our government, no longer impressing itself upon every thing at home and abroad; when the national government shall be divorced in every way from slavery, and, according to the true intention of our fathers, freedom shall be established by Congress everywhere, at least beyond the local limits of the <name>States</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1371"/>Slavery will then be driven from its usurped foothold here in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, in the national <rs>Territories</rs>, and elsewhere beneath the national flag; the <rs>Fugitive-Slave Bill</rs>, as vile as it is unconstitutional, will become a dead-letter; and the domestic slave-trade, so far as it can be reached, but especially on the high seas, will be blasted by Congressional prohibition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1372"/>Everywhere within the sphere of Congress, the great <hi rend="italics">northern hammer</hi> will descend to smite the wrong; and the irresistible cry will break forth, <quote>No more slave States!</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1374"/>More clearly than ever before, I now see <quote>the beginning of the end</quote> of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1375"/>Proudly I discern the flag of my country, as it ripples in every breeze, at last become in reality, as in name, the flag of freedom, undoubted, pure, <pb id="p.185" n="185"/>and irresistible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>The diagnosis and the treatment of this case are, on account of their unusual interest, here given in the words of this distinguished physiologist and practitioner as presented by him in a public lecture:--<quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/>When, in <dateStruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct>, I saw <persName n="Sumner,Mister,Charles,,," id="n0150.0013.00241.01019" reg="default:Sumner,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, he presented to me at once symptoms which I could not but recognize as dependent upon an irritation of some fibres of a sympathetic nerve, and a paralysis of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1858"/>As you know, he received a terrible blow upon the head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/>His spine as he was sitting had been bent in <num value="2">two</num> places, the cranium fortunately resisting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>This bending of the spine in <num value="2">two</num> places had produced there the effects of a sprain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1861"/>When I saw him in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> he had recovered altogether from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> effects of the blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1862"/>He suffered only from the <num value="2">two</num> sprains of the spine, and perhaps a slight irritation of the spinal cord itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1863"/>He had <num value="2">two</num> troubles at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1864"/><num value="1">One</num> was that he could not make use of his brain at all. He could not read a newspaper, could not write a letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1865"/>He was in a frightful state as regards the activity of the mind, as every effort there was most painful to him. It seemed to him at times as if his head would burst: there seemed to be some great force within pushing the pieces <pb id="p.242" n="242"/>away from <num value="1">one</num> another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1866"/>Any emotion was painful to him. Even in conversation, any thing that called for depth of thought or feeling caused him suffering, so that we had to be very careful with him. He had another trouble, resulting from the sprain which was at the level of the lowest dorsal vertebra.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1867"/>The irritation produced was intense, and the result very painful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/>When he tried to move forward, he was compelled to push <num value="1">one</num> foot slowly and gently forward but a few inches, and then drag the other foot to a level with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, holding his back at the same time to diminish the pain that he had there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>It had been thought that he was paralyzed in the lower limbs, and that he had disease of the brain; and the disease of the brain was construed as being the cause of this paralysis of the lower limbs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1870"/>Fortunately, the discovery made of what we call the vasamotor nervous system led me at once to the conclusion that he had no disease of the brain, and had no paralysis: he had only an irritation of those vasa-motor nerves, resulting from the upper sprain in the spine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>That irritation was the cause of the whole mischief as regards the function of the brain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1872"/>The other sprain caused the pain which gave the appearance of paralysis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1873"/>When I asked him if he was conscious of any weakness in his lower limbs, he said, <quote>Certainly not: I have never understood that my physicians considered me paralyzed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1874"/>I only cannot walk on account of the pain.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1875"/>What was to be done was to apply counter-irritants to those <num value="2">two</num> sprains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1876"/>That was done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1877"/>I told him that the best plan of treatment would consist in the application of moxas, and that they produced the most painful kind of irritation of the skin that we knew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1878"/>I urged him then to allow me to give him chloroform, to diminish the pain, if not take it away altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1879"/><pb id="p.243" n="243"/>I well remember his impressive accent when he replied, <quote>If you can say positively that I shall derive as much benefit if I take chloroform as if I do not, then of course I will take it; but if there is to be any degree whatever of amelioration in case I do not take it, then I shall not take it.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1880"/>I did not find courage enough to deceive him. I told him the truth,--that there would be more effect, as I thought, if he did not take chloroform; and so I had to submit him to the martyrdom of the greatest suffering that can be inflicted on mortal man. I burned him with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> moxa.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1881"/>I had the hope that after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> application he would submit to the use of chloroform; but for <num value="5">five</num> times after that he was burned in the same way, and refused to take chloroform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1882"/>I have never seen a patient who submitted to such treatment in that way.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1883"/>I cannot conceive that it was from mere heroism that he did it. The real explanation was this: Heaps of abuse had been thrown upon him. He was considered as amusing himself in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, as pretending to be ill. In fact, he wanted to get well and go home as quickly as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1884"/>A few days were of great importance to him. And so he passed through that terrible suffering, the greatest that I have ever inflicted upon any being, be it man or animal.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1885"/>I mention this only to show what the man was; and I shall only add, that, since that, I have always found him ready to submit to any thing for the sake of what he thought to be right; and in other spheres you know that such was his character.</p></quote> </p>
