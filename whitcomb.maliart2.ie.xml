<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>During the years which have followed the close of the <rs>Civil War</rs>, there have appeared many histories of various companies, regiments and different divisions of the volunteer troops, all of value both to the historian and to the participants in the great struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>So far as can be learned, almost nothing has been published of the military history of the <orgName type="regiment" key="2MALightArtillery">2d Massachusetts Light Artillery</orgName>, better known as <orgName n="Battery"><persName n="Nims,,,,," id="n0194.0001.00009.00001" reg="nearbymention:Nims,O.,F.,,"><surname>Nims</surname></persName>' Battery</orgName>, save a few short sketches necessarily incomplete and sometimes inaccurate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>In <dateStruct value="1870--"><year reg="1870">1870</year></dateStruct>, at the <rs>Anniversary Dinner</rs> of the <name>Nims</name>' Battery Association, the matter of <quote>publishing a history of the battery during its service throughout the war of the <rs>Rebellion</rs>, <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>,</quote> was brought forward and a committee was appointed to take the necessary steps toward this work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>The committee, which consisted of <persName n="Nims,Colonel,O.,F.,," id="n0194.0001.00009.00002" reg="expanded:Nims,Ormand,F.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>O.</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Nims</surname></persName>, <persName n="Knowlton,,J.,S.,," id="n0194.0001.00009.00003" reg="expanded:Knowlton,Joseph,S.,,"><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Knowlton</surname></persName>, <persName n="Smith,,John,R.,," id="n0194.0001.00009.00004" reg="default:Smith,John,R.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, <persName n="Norcross,,A.,M.,," id="n0194.0001.00009.00005" reg="default:Norcross,A.,M.,,"><foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Norcross</surname></persName>, <persName n="Hammond,,D.,M.,," id="n0194.0001.00009.00006" reg="default:Hammond,D.,M.,,"><foreName>D.</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Hammond</surname></persName> and <persName n="Burwell,,A.,B.,," id="n0194.0001.00009.00007" reg="expanded:Burwell,Augustus,B.,,"><foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Burwell</surname></persName>, issued a call to the members of the battery asking each <num value="1">one</num> to forward to the committee any information in his possession such as diaries, letters, newspaper clippings or matter of any kind that might aid in the work, and urging the hearty cooperation of all <quote>to the end that the glorious record made by <orgName n="Battery"><persName n="Nims,,,,," id="n0194.0001.00009.00008" reg="nearbymention:Nims,O.,F.,,"><surname>Nims</surname></persName>' Battery</orgName>-<num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> to no other &mdash; may not be suffered to perish in oblivion in our day and generation, but be handed down to our children and children's children for all time.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>So far as can be ascertained, nothing further was done in the matter and the only records to be found are those incorporated in the general histories of the war or in war records, which are not always easy of access.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>At the request and through the generosity of a member <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> of the <name>Nims</name>' Family Association, the writer has prepared the following brief account of the military career of <orgName n="Battery"><persName n="Nims,,,,," id="n0194.0001.00010.00009" reg="nearbymention:Nims,O.,F.,,"><surname>Nims</surname></persName>' Battery</orgName>, together with the life of its commander, the history of the <rs type="place">Battery</rs> Association and the complete roster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>After a period of <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>, it has been impossible to gather together the personal reminiscences and to bring before our readers the life of an artillery man as clearly as we could wish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>We trust, however, that there will be found in the pages of this book a fairly complete and reasonably accurate record of the military career of this organization.</p>
