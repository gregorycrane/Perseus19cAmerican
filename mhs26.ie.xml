<head>Views of <placeName>Medford</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/><emph>T</emph>HE rapid increase of <placeName>Medford</placeName>'s population in the last <measure n="2decades" type="date">two decades</measure>, with the many physical changes within its bounds, both of public and private enterprise, give rise to a query of comparison,&mdash;how did the <hi rend="italics">old</hi> town look?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Indeed, this was asked in a local paper <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> ago by its editor in hope of eliciting reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>He received but few. The older people, of course, could <hi rend="italics">tell</hi>, in words, as they had seen it. In various issues of the <name>Register</name> their observations have been preserved for readers to construct for themselves into a satisfying vista.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Still, such results are but word pictures, intangible, and variable as might be the observer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Those possessing the ability to transfer to canvas or board, by brush or pencil, what they saw and told of are few, as search will disclose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Now, for <hi rend="italics">old</hi> <placeName>Medford</placeName> vistas let us make search.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Naturally, we turn <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to the published histories, only to be disappointed, as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is of <dateStruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></dateStruct>, and scantily illustrated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>The earliest attempt to portray any view or scene in <placeName>Medford</placeName> which has come to our knowledge was made (doubtless in <dateStruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></dateStruct>) when some <num value="1">one</num> painted a view with the legend, <q direct="unspecified">Junction of the <rs type="place">River</rs>, Canal and Railroad in <placeName>Medford</placeName>, <dateStruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></dateStruct>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>As <num value="1">one</num> said of it in <placeName>Marblehead</placeName>, where we <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> saw it (<dateStruct value="1903--"><year reg="1903">1903</year></dateStruct>), <q direct="unspecified">It is evidently the work of a novice.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/></p> 
<p>It conveys the idea expressed but imperfectly, and the <q direct="unspecified">novice</q> introduced features so manifestly incongruous <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> as to cause its later owner to endorse on its back (in effect) that <hi rend="italics">the fine houses were a fancy of the artist</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Crude as it is, and of no artistic merit, it, however, is the result of a worthy motive, the presentation of a new and important feature in scenic <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Who the <q direct="unspecified">novice</q> was is unknown, but, in a way, he showed the high embankment stretching across the <rs>Mystic</rs> marshland, with engine and cars upon it, the bridges over the river and canal, in which latter a boat going westward drawn by horses, and in the distance the lock and tavern is seen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/><hi rend="italics">A surprising</hi> feature is in evidence: a balloon hovering over the whole and in the foreground (where is now the <placeName reg="Parkway-Auburn">Parkway-Auburn</placeName> street bridge) stand a man, woman and child viewing the scene.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/><hi rend="italics">Possibly</hi> the <rs>Medford</rs> aeronaut <persName n="Lauriat,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00001" reg="mostcommon:Lauriat,nomatch:0"><surname>Lauriat</surname></persName> may have made an ascension and sailed over <q direct="unspecified">about this time.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Who knows?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>So far as is known, no reproduction of this view has ever been made, though several attempts have failed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>In <dateStruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Barber,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00002" reg="mostcommon:Barber,nomatch:0"><surname>Barber</surname></persName>'s <q direct="unspecified">Historical Collection</q> was published, the author himself making the illustrating sketches in the various <placeName key="tgn,7007517" n="1.000 8" reg="massachusetts">Massachusetts</placeName> towns he visited and described.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>In the <name>Register</name> of <dateStruct value="1920-09-"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1920">1920</year></dateStruct>, may be seen his work in portraying <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>This view is printed from the same <q direct="unspecified">wood block</q> made and used in <dateStruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It is not without its inaccuracies, as was noticed in that and subsequent issues; still, to old residents the view was cognizable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>In <dateStruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></dateStruct> the engraver on steel or wood had to be furnished a sketch or drawing of the scene to be portrayed, and not all <hi rend="italics">artists</hi> were expert, as we have already shown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Some painted on canvas, some pencilled on paper&mdash; and some drew on their imagination&mdash;and sometimes the engraver added a little for effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It is an interesting study to follow the various gradations, as seen in such illustrations, in points of time and process.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>In <dateStruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></dateStruct> <persName n="Gleason,,Frederic,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00003" reg="default:Gleason,Frederic,,,"><foreName>Frederic</foreName> <surname>Gleason</surname></persName> began, in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, to publish <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> his famous pictorial weekly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>His illustrations were on a larger scale, engraved on wood, and though the invention of <persName n="Daguerre,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00003.00004" reg="mostcommon:Daguerre,nomatch:0"><surname>Daguerre</surname></persName> was in <dateStruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></dateStruct>, there is little evidence of its being employed in the <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">Pictorial</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/></p> 
<p>The tornado of <dateStruct value="1851-08-23"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg="23">23</day>, <year reg="1851">1851</year></dateStruct>, is there depicted, the locality being the site of the <name>West Medford</name> postoffice and opposite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>How artists' views might differ can be seen in a view of the same place and occurrence in the <hi rend="italics">Illustrated National Mirror</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>In <dateStruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></dateStruct> came the publication of the <hi rend="italics">History of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName></hi>, by <persName n="Brooks,Reverend,Charles,,," id="n0334.0002.00003.00005" reg="default:Brooks,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Reverend">Rev.</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName>, and in this are <num value="8">eight</num> steel engravings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Several people are at the store door, women and children are looking in the windows&mdash;Tinkham's now&mdash;and a man is stooping over, as if in pain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Next is <num value="1">one</num> with a big black sign over the door and a smaller <num value="1">one</num> that looks like Drugs beside it. Iron bars hang from the windows, for storekeepers used <q direct="unspecified">to put shutters up</q> at night.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>A letter recently received by a Medford man, from a friend of his school days, suggests our subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>Its writer lived in <placeName reg="West Medford">West Medford</placeName> several years in the early &lsquo;70s, <pb id="p.35" n="35"/> attending the grammar school there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>Like others, he had a curiosity to <q direct="unspecified">peek into the old rum distillery, sneak under the fence at the race track,</q> and go to the library for books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>The library was then in the town house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>He wrote, <q direct="unspecified">there were some fine places on the way, with statuary in their front yards.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>As none of this latter is now to be seen, a few observations may be of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>A century ago people of artistic taste and of wealth thus embellished their grounds.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>Prominent in <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> were those of <persName n="Magoun,,Thatcher,,," id="n0334.0003.00035.00198" reg="default:Magoun,Thatcher,,,"><foreName>Thatcher</foreName> <surname>Magoun</surname></persName>, on <address><street n="High street">High street</street></address>. A substantial fence nearly <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> high adjoined the sidewalk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>This, unlike the high board fence before the <name>Gray</name> mansion opposite, was of square palings, all of which passed through the continuous rails; but, at intervals, a paling was of iron, firmly set into the granite base beneath, thus supporting the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>Thus enclosed, the entire grounds were still visible and attracted much attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>The winding walks were of red gravel in which no grass or weeds could grow, and bordered more or less with box, a close-growing evergreen plant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>In spring the flower beds were ablaze with tulips and hyacinths and other flowers in their season, and the shrubbery of various kinds, tastefully arranged and well cared for. Beside the walks were <num value="4">four</num> and on the pedestals of the terrace were <num value="2">two</num> statues of white marble, and at least <num value="2">two</num> marble vases, which sometimes held flowering plants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>The grounds sloped away to the river and extended westward to the <name>Tufts</name> estate, and in this portion were several pagodas&mdash; or <q direct="unspecified">summer houses,</q> as people used to style them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>It was <num value="1">one</num> of the <q direct="unspecified">show-places</q> of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> in those days.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/><num value="1">One</num> day (since the <num value="20" type="ordinal">twentieth</num> century came in) the writer, going down <address><street n="High street">High street</street></address>, noticed a hay wagon at the <name>Magoun</name> gateway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>Men were bringing out the statuary; each piece stood in a big basket, and somewhat <pb id="p.36" n="36"/> swathed, was roped in and lifted into the wagon, then roped to the top rail for safe riding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>It was a grotesque sight (which some others also witnessed), and as the horse-drawn wagon moved down <address><street n="High street">High street</street></address> it did seem as if <hi rend="italics"><persName><foreName>Ichabod</foreName></persName></hi> was written on and about the place.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>We have recently tried to ascertain what the statues represented and have only succeeded in <num value="1">one</num> instance,&mdash; Esculapius, the patron saint of the medical profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>We are unable to answer with certainty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>In a Boston daily of <dateStruct value="1907-06-06"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="6">6</day>, <year reg="1907">1907</year></dateStruct>, was a statement that their then owner <q direct="unspecified">Offers Art Junk for <placeName reg="Lynn's City">Lynn's City</placeName> Lawn,</q> <hi rend="italics">i.e</hi>., desired to sell them for decorative purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>The statues were photographed in <num value="1">one</num> group, the illustrative cut being the width of <num value="3">three</num> newspaper columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>The article said, <q direct="unspecified">much of the stuff had little value except as oddities.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>Indeed, we have heard similar deprecatory remarks made very recently, to which latter we cannot agree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>They could not have been simply <q direct="unspecified">plaster casts</q> and have remained exposed to the weather the year round for over <measure n="60years" type="date">sixty years</measure>; nor is it at all likely that men of wealth and taste, as were these owners, would have surrounded their homes with any inferior specimens of art.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>There were also <num value="2">two</num> statues on the elder <rs>Magoun</rs>'s estate, which like those already named, are shown in the steel engravings in <persName n="Brooks,,,,," id="n0334.0003.00036.00200" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Charles,,,"><surname>Brooks</surname></persName>' History of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> (<dateStruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></dateStruct>).

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>But where are they today?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>On the front lawn of the old <rs>Brooks</rs> mansion on <address><street n="Grove street">Grove street</street></address>, also, were <num value="2">two</num> smaller statues of white marble, on pedestals of darker stone; whether others were beyond the mansion in the extensive grounds we cannot say, neither what these represented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>They were at a <pb id="p.37" n="37"/> distance from the street, and were not recognizable, even by an art critic, in the scattered broken limbs, disfigured heads and torsos we found while visiting the partially demolished mansion in <dateStruct value="1916--"><year reg="1916">1916</year></dateStruct>, <q direct="unspecified">Art junk</q> <hi rend="italics">they</hi> surely were then, but not when selected by the discriminating owner a century before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>This was about <dateStruct value="1630--"><year reg="1630">1630</year></dateStruct>, etc. There was no <address><street n="High street">High street</street></address> and no bridge; no houses nearer than the <rs type="place">Cradock buildings</rs> in the town pump region.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>They had to be there for central administration of the governor's property, and on the nearest site to the only ford which offered sufficient level space.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>There was no retaining wall nor filling at the river; all was normal, unchanged by man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>So extensive filling was requisite, and from whence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>Probably not by long haul from the <placeName reg="Terrace, Weber, Utah" key="tgn,2715353">Terrace</placeName> road region, but it should come by short haul from the south Bastion from the <name>Tract</name>, which developed slowly into <address><street n="High street">High street</street></address> and its vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>Much filling was also placed at some unknown period or periods along the gravelly beach and so on to <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address>, and retaining walls built.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/><placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> was a spectacle town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>A very high, bulky and red nose stuck up between the glasses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>Later this was about the best part of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, but neither streets nor lots yet fit for homesteads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>The colonists wanted practical convenience&mdash;not hill top villas and bungalows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>The Halls owned the whole of <placeName reg="Pasture Hill, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2570242">Pasture hill</placeName>, but never dreamed of living up there; they left it to the kite-flying boys and preferred to dig their homes down to the level of common folks.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>A man had to get rich before he could excavate his homestead out of <placeName reg="Pasture Hill, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2570242">Pasture hill</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>The dates of the house building will help us here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>We may <pb id="p.49" n="49"/> assume that the street and lots had about reached finality when the houses were built, and conversely that as soon as street and lots were fit, houses would be built here.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>The excavations abreast of the tan-yard and at and about the <rs type="place">Hall houses</rs>, etc., carried the crest further back and changed the contour of nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>Upon cautiously opening the door of the building to which I had just applied a large key, I was instantly met by a gust of cool, musty air, <q direct="unspecified">old-fashioned</q> air, if you will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> of my senses to respond to the strange but interesting surroundings was distracted in all directions; but as I ascended the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> short flight of stairs, soon centered on some large, peculiarly-shaped vessels, black with age, which were suspended from the ceiling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>These, on a close examination of the cards attached to them, proved to be rum kettles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>The mention of such objects probably <pb id="p.57" n="57"/> discloses to you the place of my visit; however, further description may furnish enlightenment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>After inspecting in the alcove some very old documents and letters which were encased on the walls, and also many very queer articles of all sorts under glass, I mounted more steps and entered a door on the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>Again my eyes rested upon a most wonderful display of antiques and relics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>Some dated back to pre-Revolutionary days; others represented various periods in the history of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>After spending not a few enjoyable moments among these very old memorial preservations, I returned to the outer room and climbed a longer flight of iron stairs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>Here, on the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> floor, I found the <hi rend="italics">sanctum sanctorum</hi>. At the farther end, near the windows overlooking <address><street n="Governors avenue">Governors avenue</street></address>, was the desk of the librarian and editor of the <rs>Historical Register</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>Facing down the long room, and lining the walls on either side, were numerous books and pictures&mdash;a most business-like, yet home-like office, library and museum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>His keen wit and sense of humor inspired me beyond measure; and it was a joy to talk with <num value="1">one</num> who commanded his English so excellently.

<p>A more versatile character I never met&mdash;so eager and alert to answer my questions and to make explanations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>He commanded my respect the moment he greeted me, and the longer we conversed, the more I realized that he was a real <q direct="unspecified">honest-to-goodness</q> man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>I wished that I had a camera to photograph <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>'s historian-editor at his desk; the influence of character on setting, and <hi rend="italics">vice-versa</hi> was at perfection.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>Later on, he chanced to mention the fact that he once had differences with a man as to whether or not there was ever any statuary on the front porch of the <rs>Public Library</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>His friend persisted in the negative, and calling to his wife, asked <q direct="unspecified">if it wasn't so.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>She replied that there <q direct="unspecified">used to be such a state of affairs,</q> thus corroborating the affirmative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>However, the dubious gentleman was escorted to this very room upstairs, and, after seeing a fine picture of the <rs>Public Library</rs> adorned with the said statuary, was emphatically convinced.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>I told Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;that his reference to the statuary reminded me of my recollections of the statuary on the old <placeName key="tgn,2105883" n="1.000 10" reg="Magoun, Lipscomb, Texas">Magoun</placeName> estate that I was accustomed to see as a youngster, when my grandmother took me to ride in my baby carriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>Quick as a flash he replied, <q direct="unspecified">Why don't you write an account of it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>Entitle it, <quote>Reminiscences from a baby carriage</quote> ? A great many people have undoubtedly forgotten that sculptured likenesses ever existed on those premises.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">I remember,</q> he added, a twinkle in his eye, <q direct="unspecified">that I happened to see those very statues carried off on a hay-wagon <num value="1">one</num> day.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>The way in which he told these incidents was indeed most amusing.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>However, I do not deem it of sufficient importance to compose a dissertation on a vehicle of this type; and, therefore, will humbly proceed to state the facts regarding the matter at issue.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>When a very small boy it was my distinct good fortune to be possessed of a carriage, similar to the type mentioned above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>Among those sights which captivated my fancy the most, was the statuary adjoining the front yard of the old <persName n="Magoun,,,,," id="n0334.0005.00059.00306" reg="nearbymention:Magoun,Thatcher,,,"><surname>Magoun</surname></persName> estate, <num value="2">two</num> doors below the ivy-covered <orgName n="Grace Church" type="church">Grace Church</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>Then, too, I wondered at the awe-inspiring urns whose massive forms rested on the strategic points about and upon the spacious porch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/>To me, Sir, the mansion itself seemed as impressive as the statuary, and presented a somewhat mysterious appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>I always thought that its inhabitants were deceased, because as it happened, I never chanced to see anyone about the grounds, nor any signs of life within.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>The silence of the whole scene and especially that evidenced by the dead white figures cast its spell over me.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1186"/><pb id="p.82" n="82"/></p> 
<p>The <hi rend="italics">Medford Mercury</hi>, the longest established weekly paper of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, has just moved into its new quarters, the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> in its history, and is issuing a memorial or anniversary number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1187"/>Of its publishing interests and personnel its managers will doubtless tell.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1188"/>The present writer has undertaken to tell of the journalism of the past <measure n="66years" type="date">sixty-six years</measure>, partly from his own observation and from authentic record.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1189"/>Allusion has been made to the <orgName n="Historical Society" type="society">Historical Society's</orgName> collection of papers, to which the writer turns for proof of some statements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1190"/>Among these are the earlier but not complete files of the <hi rend="italics">Mercury</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1191"/>It was with much surprise that we found some years ago that our public library had no files of the (<num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>) <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> <hi rend="italics">Journal</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Chronicle</hi>, nor yet any bound files of the <hi rend="italics">Mercury</hi>. It seems strange that neither earlier editor saw to it that the library was furnished with copies of his paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1192"/>Furthermore, it seems that there was a lack of foresight somewhere, or else a niggardly economy (whether in town meeting or committee we are not prepared to say) that the <hi rend="italics">Mercury</hi> of each succeeding year was not substantially bound in board covers and thus preserved.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1193"/>Even the editors and publishers of the early <hi rend="italics">Mercury</hi> were negligent in this, though they did place a year's issue between half-inch strips of hard wood, tied through at intervals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1194"/>But such method did not protect the outer pages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1195"/>It would appear that even they had lost some years' numbers, as some bear the name of <persName n="Cummings,,Charles,,," id="n0334.0006.00082.00506" reg="default:Cummings,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Cummings</surname></persName>, the old <orgName n="High School" type="school">high school</orgName> master.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1196"/>In later years they were rolled up and consigned to the dark loft under the roof, to be consulted only by the rats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1197"/>At removal from the old quarters down <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address>, such as remained in the loft were transported to the <name>Historical</name> rooms, where the librarian carefully arranged them, but found <num value="2">two</num> volumes (for the years <dateStruct value="1884--"><year reg="1884">1884</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1885--"><year reg="1885">1885</year></dateStruct>) missing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1198"/>Later (a labor of love) they were wire-stitched and bound in heavy covers of builders <pb id="p.83" n="83"/> felt and kept flat in a filing case in the library.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1199"/>Since that time we had occasion to seek information contained in those that are missing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1200"/>Our only resort was the public library.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1201"/>Some bundles were brought us and with the utmost care we examined them till we found in the issue of <dateStruct value="1884-03-28"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="28">28</day>, <year reg="1884">1884</year></dateStruct>, the object of our search&mdash;the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> illustration (other than advertising cuts) used in a Medford paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1202"/>It was a view of <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Abbot Hall">Abbot Hall</placeName>,</q> the municipal building of <placeName key="tgn,7013997" n="1.000 22" reg="marblehead, essex county, massachusetts">Marblehead</placeName>, reproduced by the courtesy of the <hi rend="italics">Marblehead Messenger</hi>,&mdash;a result of the town hall agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1203"/>Since then the various <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> papers have been more or less illustrated, especially since the camera became so popular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1204"/>It is a great help to the journalist.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1205"/>A source of regret it is that from <dateStruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1880--"><year reg="1880">1880</year></dateStruct>, and practically those other <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, the doing in <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> the papers told of is lost, and that so little opportunity is available for the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1206"/>In a nearby suburban city at the present time its early newspapers (since <dateStruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></dateStruct>) are being carefully searched and indexed and important happenings tabulated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1207"/>In those early years an outlay of <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3dollars" type="currency">three dollars</measure> a year would have saved these <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> papers for future use.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1208"/>We have been told that <q direct="unspecified">they were not worth binding</q> (meaning, doubtless, in present condition). But we hold that a local weekly which tells of current events is worthy of preservation if worthy of publication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1209"/>But to fold a newspaper page into <num value="8">eight</num> squares is not a preservative method, nor yet is it well to leave the accumulated papers exposed to the sunlight.
