<head>Preface</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>To the public at large, the volume prepared by <persName n="Rodenbough,General,,,," id="n0109.0000.00011.00026" reg="nearbymention:Rodenbough,Theodore,F.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Rodenbough</surname></persName> and his associates will be not only instructive but decidedly novel in its view-point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>In the popular conception the cavalryman figures as the most dashing and care-free among soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>He is associated primarily with charges at a gallop to the sound of clashing sabers and bugle calls, and with thrilling rescues on the field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Adventurous, indeed, are the exploits of <quote><persName n="Jeb,,,,," id="n0109.0000.00011.00027" reg="mostcommon:Jeb,nomatch:0"><surname>Jeb</surname></persName></quote> <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0109.0000.00011.00028" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,:6"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, <persName n="Custer,,,,," id="n0109.0000.00011.00029" reg="mostcommon:Custer,George,Armstrong,,:2"><surname>Custer</surname></persName>, and others recounted in the pages that follow, together with the typical reminiscences from <persName n="Wyeth,Doctor,,,," id="n0109.0000.00011.00030" reg="nearbymention:Wyeth,John,Allan,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Wyeth</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The characteristic that stands dominant, however, throughout this volume shows that the soldiers in the cavalry branch were peculiarly responsible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Not only must they maintain a highly trained militant organization, ready to fight with equal efficiency either mounted or on foot, but to them fell the care of valuable, and frequently scarce, animals, the protection of the armies' supplies, the transmission of important messages, and dozens more special duties which must usually be performed on the cavalryman's own initiative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>On such detached duty there was lacking the shoulder to shoulder comradeship that large masses of troops enjoy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Confronted by darkness, distance, and danger, the trooper must carry out his orders with few companions, or alone.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The discussion of organization and equipment is most important to an understanding of the cavalryman as he actually worked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The Federal methods, described at length in this volume, naturally involved a larger system and a more elaborate growth than those of the <rs>South</rs> with its waning resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>In other respects, however, the <rs>Confederate</rs> organization differed from that of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The feeling for locality in the <rs>South</rs> manifested itself at the beginning of the war through the formation of companies and regiments on a geographical basis, and the election of officers by the men of the companies themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Thus, in spite of the want of military arms and ordnance stores, and the later disastrous scarcity of horses, the <rs>Confederates</rs> <quote>hung together</quote> in a manner that recalls the <rs>English</rs> yeomen archers who fought so sturdily, county by county.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Altogether it was a gallant and devoted part that the <rs>American</rs> cavalryman, Federal or Confederate, played on his hard-riding raids and his outpost duty, as well as his better-known battles and charges, from <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>The enormous number of casualties among the horses was due to many causes, among which were poor horsemanship on the part of the raw troopers mustered in at the beginning of the war, and the ignorance and gross inefficiency on the part of many officers and men as to the condition of the horses' backs and feet, care as to food and cleanliness, and the proper treatment of the many diseases to which horses on active service are subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1368"/>These <num value="4">four</num> Federal troopers holding their horses, side by side with an equal number of infantry, are typical of the small detachments that split up the cavalry into units of little value during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> of the war. The cavalry also furnished guides, orderlies, and grooms for staff officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1369"/>The authorities divided it up so minutely among corps, division, and brigade commanders as completely to subvert its true value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1370"/>It was assigned to accompany the slow-moving wagon-trains, which could have been equally well guarded by an infantry detail, and was practically never used as a coherent whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1372"/>This photograph was taken in <dateStruct value="1865-02-"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, after the cavalry had proved itself.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1375"/>Here it is apparent why the <rs>Northern</rs> generals found it necessary to detach large portions of their armies along their lines of communication, to guard against the impending raids of the <orgName n="Confederate Cavalry" type="org">Confederate cavalry</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/>The destruction of the bridge in this photograph, part of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0109.0008.00184.01057" reg="mostcommon:Grant,S.,S.,,:2"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s line of communication in the <rs>Wilderness</rs> campaign, would have delayed his movements for days and have compelled him to detach a strong body to recapture the railroad, and another to rebuild the bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1377"/>Hence this strong force detailed as a guard.

<head>Outposts and cavalry pickets.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1382"/>An army on the march is protected from surprise and annoyance by advance, rear, and flank guards, or by independent cavalry scouting far to the front until contact with the enemy is established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1383"/>When it halts, its security is maintained through outposts, instructed to observe the front and flanks while it sleeps, and to act as a barrier to the entrance of patrols and spies, or to resist strenuously any sudden and unexpected advance of a hostile force.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1384"/>Outpost duty, therefore, is most important, not alone as a protective measure, but because deductions from many campaigns have shown that troops which suffer continuously from many night alarms either lose nerve or become indifferent, so that, in either case, discipline and efficiency suffer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1385"/>In the <rs>Federal</rs> armies, outpost or picket duty in the presence of their enterprising adversaries was ever fatiguing, nerveracking, and dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1386"/>Organizations went on picket for <num value="24">twenty-four</num> continuous hours, and, in the cavalry, horses at the advanced posts remained saddled and bridled for hours at a time, ready for instant use. Except by the supports and reserves, the lighting of fires and cooking of food, when in close contact with the <rs>Confederates</rs>, were forbidden, but many a strip of bacon and occasionally a stolen chicken were fried surreptitiously in a safe hiding-place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1387"/>Although a farmhouse was oftentimes available, horses and troopers were usually without shelter, and this, in rainy or freezing weather, made outpost duty an uncomfortable, if not a thrilling, experience.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/>For the inexperienced soldier, with eyes and ears at extraordinary tension, the grunting of a predatory hog or the browsing of a calf was quite sufficient to create alarm.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1398"/>Sometimes the <quote>friend</quote> was an officer, making his rounds of inspection; sometimes a countryman who had never heard of the countersign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1399"/>Occasionally the answer to the countersign was a rush of feet, a blow, and the driving &mdash; in of the outpost by a force of the foe, or by guerrillas.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1400"/>The tendency of the raw recruit was to see a gray uniform behind every stump, tree, or bush, and in the early period of the <rs>Civil War</rs>, the rifle-firing by opposing pickets, especially at night, was constant and uninterrupted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1401"/>Many a time, too, the lone sentinel or vedette was shot down in cold blood.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1405"/>The rifles were leveled; the telescopic sights were adjusted on the poor fellow's chest; the triggers were pulled in unison, and although too distant to hear a sound from the outpost, the cavalryman was seen to fall dead from his horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1409"/>However, by this time (<dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>) the true value of the <rs>Federal</rs> cavalry had been appreciated by the authorities; it was being used in mass on important raids, and had been given a chance to show its prowess in battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1411"/>But as the war progressed, this constant firing by sentinels and vedettes disappeared, and opposing pickets began to comprehend that this was not war. To the guerrillas, who killed to rob and loot, it was, of course, a different matter.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1413"/>It was <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> before the true role of cavalry was understood by the <rs>Federal</rs> commanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1414"/>During that early period, the constant use of the mounted branch as outposts for infantry divisions and <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>, was largely responsible for cavalry inefficiency, and for the tremendous breaking-down of horse-flesh.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1416"/>But many opportunities for brave and gallant deeds occurred on outpost duty, albeit many such were performed in obscurity, and were thus never lauded to the world as heroic.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1425"/>At the beginning of the <rs>Civil War</rs>, what is now known as military information or intelligence was not appreciated as it was later.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1426"/>The organization of the scout service was not perfected; accurate military maps of the theater of operations were almost wholly lacking, and many commanders accepted the gage of battle with no very comprehensive idea of the foe's numbers, position, and <hi rend="italics">morale</hi>, and with no accurate conception of the topography of the battlefield.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1427"/>As the military organization of the <rs>Union</rs> armies was perfected, however, and the newly made officers learned their lesson in the stern school of experience, the importance of scouting became apparent, and this use of cavalry developed into a necessary preliminary to every serious encounter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1428"/>Perhaps no branch of the military operations of the <rs>Civil War</rs> gave such opportunities for individual intelligence, initiative, nerve, daring, resourcefulness, tact, and physical endurance, as the constant scouting by the cavalry of the opposing armies between the great battles of the war.
