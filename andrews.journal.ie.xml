<head>Prologue</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>To edit oneself after the lapse of nearly half a century is like taking an appeal from <persName><foreName>Philip</foreName></persName> drunk to <persName><foreName>Philip</foreName></persName> sober.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>The changes of thought and feeling between the middle of the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> and the beginning of the <num value="20" type="ordinal">twentieth</num> century are so great that the impulsive young person who penned the following record and the white-haired woman who edits it, are no more the same than were <persName><foreName>Philip</foreName></persName> drunk with the wine of youth and passion and <persName><foreName>Philip</foreName></persName> sobered by the lessons of age and experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>The author's lot was cast amid the tempest and fury of war, and if her utterances are sometimes out of accord with the spirit of our own happier time, it is because she belonged to an era which, though but of yesterday, as men count the ages of history, is separated from our own by a social and intellectual chasm as broad almost as the lapse of a <measure n="1000years" type="date">thousand years</measure>. In the lifetime of a single generation the people of the <rs>South</rs> have been called upon to pass through changes that the rest of the world has taken centuries to accomplish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>The distance between the armor-clad <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> knight at Acre and the <quote>embattled farmers</quote> at <placeName reg="Lexington, Fayette, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013887">Lexington</placeName> is hardly greater than that between the feudal aristocracy which dominated Southern sentiment in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, and the commercial plutocracy that rules over the destinies of the nation to-day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Never was there an aristocracy so compact, so united, so powerful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Out of a population of some <num value="9000000">9,000,000</num> whites that peopled the <rs>Southern States</rs>, according to the census of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, only about <num value="300000">300,000</num> were actual slaveholders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Less than <num value="3000">3,000</num> of thesemen owning, say, over <num value="100">100</num> negroes each, constituted the great planter class, who, with a small proportion of professional and business men affiliated with them in culture and sympathies, dominated Southern sentiment and for years dictated the policy of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>The more prominent families all over the country knew each other by reputation, if not by actual contact, and to be a member of the privileged few in <num value="1">one</num> community was an <hi rend="italics">ex-officio</hi> title to membership in all. To use a modern phrase, we were intensely <quote>class conscious</quote> and this brought about a solidarity of feeling and sentiment almost comparable to that created by family ties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Narrow and provincial we may have been, in some respects, but take it all in all, it is doubtful whether the world has ever produced a state of society more rich in all the resources for a thoroughly wholesome, happy, and joyous life than existed among the privileged <quote><num value="4000">4,000</num></quote> under the peculiar civilization of the Old South--a civilization which has <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> served its purpose in the evolution of the race and passed away forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>So completely has it vanished that the very language in which we used to express ourselves is becoming obsolete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Many of our household words, among them a name scarcely less dear than <quote>mother,</quote> are a dead language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Others have a strangely archaic sound to modern ears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>When the diary was written, women were still regarded as <quote>females,</quote> and it was even permissible to have a <quote>female acquaintance,</quote> or a <quote>male friend,</quote> when distinction of sex was necessary, without being relegated forthwith to the ranks of the <foreign lang="la">ignobile vulgus</foreign>. The words <quote>lady</quote> and <quote>gentleman</quote> had not yet been brought into disrepute, and strangest of all, to modern ears, the word <quote>rebel,</quote> now so bitterly resented as casting a stigma on the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, is used throughout the diary as a term of pride and affectionate endearment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It is for the sake of the light it throws on the inner life of this unique society at the period of its dissolution &mdash; a period so momentous in the history of our country &mdash; that this contemporaneous record from the pen of a young woman in private life, is given to the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The uncompromising attitude of the writer's father against secession removed him, of course, from all participation in the political and official life of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and so this volume can lay claim to none of the dignity which attaches to the utterances of <num value="1">one</num> narrating events <quote lang="la">quorum pars magna fui.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>But for <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> this reason its testimony will, perhaps, be of more value to the student of social conditions than if it dealt with matters pertaining more exclusively to the domain of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The experiences recounted are such as might have come at that time, to any woman of good family and social position; the feelings, beliefs, and prejudices expressed reflect the general sentiment of the <rs>Southern</rs> people of that generation, and this is my apology for offering them to the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>As an informal contemporaneous record, written with absolutely no thought of ever meeting other eyes than those of the author, the present volume can claim at least the merit of that unpremeditated realism which is more valuable as a picture of life than detailed statistics of battles and sieges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The chief object of the writer in keeping a diary was to cultivate ease of style by daily exercise in rapid composition, and, incidentally, to preserve a record of personal experiences for her own convenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>This practice was kept up with more or less regularity for about <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>, but the bulk of the matter so produced was destroyed at various times in those periodical fits of disgust and self-abasement that come to every keeper of an honest diary in saner moments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The present volume was rescued from a similar fate by the intercession of a relative, who suggested that the period dealt with was <num value="1">one</num> of such transcendent interest, embracing the last months of the war and the equally stormy times immediately following, that the record of it ought to be preserved <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> along with our other war relics, as a family heirloom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>So little importance did the writer attach to the document even then, that the only revision made in changing it from a personal to a family history, was to tear out bodily whole paragraphs, and even pages, that were considered too personal for other eyes than her own. In this way the manuscript was mutilated, in some places, beyond recovery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The frequent hiatuses caused by these elisions are marked in the body of the work by the usual signs of ellipsis. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The original manuscript was written in an old daybook fished out of some forgotten corner during the war, when writing paper was as scarce as banknotes, and almost as dear, if measured in Confederate money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The pale, home-made ink, never too distinct, at best, is faded after nearly <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>, to a light ocher, but little darker than the age-yellowed paper on which it was inscribed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Space was economized and paper saved by writing between the closely-ruled lines, and in a hand so small and cramped as to be often illegible, without the aid of a lens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The manuscript suffered many vicissitudes, the sheets having been torn from the covers and crumpled into the smallest possible space for better concealment in times of emergency. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>As a discourager of self-conceit there is nothing like an old diary, and I suppose no <num value="1">one</num> ever knows what a full-blown idiot he or she is capable of being, who has not kept such a living record against himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>This being the case, the gray-haired editor may be pardoned <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> a natural averseness to the publication of anything that would too emphatically <quote>write me down an ass</quote> --to borrow from our friend Dogberry-though I fear that in some of the matter retained in the interest of truth, I have come perilously near to that alternative. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>But while the <quote>blue line</quote> has been freely used, as was indispensable in an intimate private chronicle of this sort, it has not been allowed to interfere in any way with the fidelity of the narrative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Matter strictly personal to the writer &mdash; tiresome reflections, silly flirtations, and the like &mdash; has been omitted, and thoughtless criticisms and other expressions that might wound the feelings of persons now living, have been left out or toned down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Connectives, or other words are supplied where necessary for clearness; where more particular information is called for, it is given in parentheses, or in the explanatory notes at the heads of the chapters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Even the natural temptation to correct an occasional lapse into local barbarisms, such as <quote>like</quote> for <quote>as,</quote> <quote>don't</quote> for <quote>doesn't,</quote> or the still more unpardonable offense of applying the terms <quote>male</quote> and <quote>female</quote> to objects of their respective genders, has been resisted for fear of altering the spirit of the narrative by too much tampering with the letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>For the same reason certain palpable errors and misstatements, unless of sufficient importance to warrant a note, have been left unchanged &mdash; for instance, the absurd classing of <persName n="Butler,,B.,F.,," id="n0002.0001.00006.00001" reg="default:Butler,B.,F.,,"><foreName>B.</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> with <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0002.0001.00006.00002" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,I.,Across,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> as a degenerate West Pointer, or the confusion between <foreign lang="la">fuit Ilium</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">ubi <placeName key="tgn,7002329" n="1.000 10" reg="Troy,Canakkale,Marmara,Turkiye,Asia">Troja</placeName> fuit</foreign> that resulted in the misquotation on <ref target="p.190" targOrder="U">page 190</ref>. For my <quote>small Latin,</quote> I have no excuse to offer except that I had never been a school teacher then, and could enjoy the bliss of ignorance without a blush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>As to the implied reflection on <placeName reg="West Point, Hardin, Kentucky" key="tgn,2041899">West Point</placeName>, I am not sure whether I knew any better at the time, or not. Probably I did, as I lived in a well-informed circle, but my excited brain was so occupied at the moment with thoughts of the general depravity of those dreadful <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>, that there was not room for another idea in it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Throughout the work none but real names are employed, with the single exception noted on <ref target="p.105" targOrder="U">page 105</ref>. In extenuation of this gentleman's bibulous propensities, it must be remembered that such practices were much more common in those days than now, and were regarded much more leniently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>In fact, I have been both surprised and shocked in reading over this story of a bygone generation, to see how prevalent was the use of wines and other alcoholic liquors, and how lightly an occasional over-indulgence was regarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>In this respect there can be no doubt that the world has changed greatly for the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>When <quote>gentlemen,</quote> as we were not afraid to call our men guests in those days, were staying in the house, it was a common courtesy to place a bottle of wine, or brandy, or both, with the proper adjuncts, in the room of each guest, so that he might help himself to a <quote>night-cap</quote> <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> on going to bed, or an <quote>eye-opener</quote> before getting up in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It must also be taken into account that at this particular time men everywhere were ruined, desperate, their occupation gone, their future without hope, the present without resources, so that they were ready to catch at any means for diverting their thoughts from the ruin that enveloped them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The same may be said of the thoughtless gayety among the young people during the dark days preceding the close; it was a case of <quote>eat, drink, and be merry, for to-morrow we die.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/></p> 
<p>In the desire to avoid as far as possible any unnecessary tampering with the original manuscript, passages expressive of the animosities of the time, which the author would be glad to blot out forever, have been allowed to stand unaltered &mdash; not as representing the present feeling of the writer or her people, but because they do represent our feelings <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> ago, and to suppress them entirely, would be to falsify the record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>While recognizing the bad taste of many of these utterances, which <quote><persName><foreName>Philip</foreName></persName> sober</quote> would now be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to repudiate, it must be remembered that he has no right to speak for <quote><persName><foreName>Philip</foreName></persName> drunk,</quote> or to read his own present feelings into the mind of his predecessor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The diary was written in a time of storm and tempest, of bitter hatreds and fierce animosities, and its pages are so saturated with the spirit of the time, that to attempt to banish it would be like giving the play of Hamlet without the title-role.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>It does not pretend to <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> give the calm reflections of a philosopher looking back dispassionately upon the storms of his youth, but the passionate utterances of stormy youth itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It is in no sense a history, but a mere series of crude pensketches, faulty, inaccurate, and out of perspective, it may be, but still a true picture of things as the writer saw them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It makes no claim to impartiality; on the contrary, the author frankly admits that it is violently and often absurdly partisan-and it could not well have been otherwise under the circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Coming from a heart ablaze with the passionate resentment of a people smarting under the humiliation of defeat, it was inevitable that along with the just indignation at wrongs which ought never to have been committed, there should have crept in many intemperate and indiscriminate denunciations of acts which the writer did not understand, to say nothing of sophomorical vaporings calculated now only to excite a smile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Such expressions, however, are not to be taken seriously at the present day, but are rather to be regarded as a sort of fossil curiosities that have the same value in throwing light on the psychology of the period to which they belong as the relics preserved in our geological museums have in illustrating the physical life of the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Revolutions never take place when people are cool-headed or in a serene frame of mind, and it would be as dishonest as it is foolish to deny that such bitternesses ever existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The better way is to cast them behind us and thank the powers of the <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> universe that they exist no longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>I cannot better express this feeling than in the words of an old Confederate soldier at <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg, Va.</placeName>, where he had gone with a number of his comrades who had been attending the great reunion at <placeName reg="Richmond, Madison, Kentucky" key="tgn,7014337">Richmond</placeName>, to visit the scene of their last struggles under <quote><persName><roleName n="Massa">Marse</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>They were standing looking down into the <name>Crater</name>, that awful pit of death, lined now with daisies and buttercups, and fragrant with the breath of spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/><placeName reg="Tall Pines, Lamar, Mississippi" key="tgn,2710133">Tall pines</placeName>, whose lusty young roots had fed on the hearts of dead men, were waving softly overhead, and nature everywhere had covered up the scars of war with the mantle of smiling peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>I paused, too, to watch them, and we all stood there awed into silence, till at last an old battle-scarred hero from <num value="1">one</num> of the wiregrass counties way down in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, suddenly raised his hands to heaven, and said in a voice that trembled with emotion: <quote>Thar's <measure n="300" type="dead">three hundred dead</measure> <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName> buried here under our feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>I helped to put 'em thar, but so help me <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, I hope the like &lsquo;ll never be done in this country again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Slavery's gone and the war's over now, thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for both!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>We are all brothers once more, and I can feel for them layin&lsquo; down thar just the same as fur our own.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/></p> 
<p>That is the sentiment of the new <rs>South</rs> and of the few of us who survive from the old. We look back with loving memory upon our past, as we look upon the grave of the beloved dead whom we mourn but would not recall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>We glorify the men and the memories <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> of those days and would have the coming generations draw inspiration from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>We teach the children of the <rs>South</rs> to honor and revere the civilization of their fathers, which we believe has perished not because it was evil or vicious in itself, but because, like a good and useful man who has lived out his allotted time and gone the way of all the earth, it too has served its turn and must now lie in the grave of the dead past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The Old South, with its stately feudal <hi rend="italics">regime</hi>, was not the monstrosity that some would have us believe, but merely a case of belated survival, like those giant sequoias of the <rs>Pacific</rs> slope that have lingered on from age to age, and are now left standing alone in a changed world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Like every civilization that has yet been known since the primitive patriarchal stage, it was framed in the interest of a ruling class; and as has always been, and always will be the case until mankind shall have become wise enough to evolve a civilization based on the interests of all, it was doomed to pass away whenever changed conditions transferred to another class the economic advantage that is the basis of all power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>It had outlived its day of usefulness and was an anachronism in the end of the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century &mdash; the last representative of an economic system that had served the purposes of the race since the days when man <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> emerged from his prehuman state until the rise of the modern industrial system made wage slavery a more efficient agent of production than chattel slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/><pb id="p.12" n="12"/> </p> 
<p>It is as unfair to lay all the onus of that institution on the <rs>Southern States</rs> of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> as it would be to charge the <rs>Roman</rs> <orgName n="Catholic Church" type="church">Catholic Church</orgName> with the odium of all the religious persecutions of the <num value="16" type="ordinal">sixteenth</num> and <num value="17" type="ordinal">seventeenth</num> centuries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The spirit of intolerance was in the air; everybody persecuted that got the chance, even the saints of <placeName reg="Plymouth Rock, Franklin, New York" key="tgn,2588760">Plymouth Rock</placeName>, and the <name>Catholics</name> did the lion's share only because there were more of them to do it, and they had more power than our Protestant forefathers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>In like manner, the spirit of chattel slavery was in the race, possibly from its prehuman stage, and through all the hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of years that it has been painfully traveling from that humble beginning toward the still far-off goal of the superhuman, not <num value="1">one</num> branch of it has ever awakened to a sense of the moral obliquity of the practice till its industrial condition had reached a stage in which that system was less profitable than wage slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Then, as the ethical sentiments are prone to follow closely the line of economic necessity, the conscience of those nations which had adopted the new industrialism began to awaken to a perception of the immorality of chattel slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Our Southern States, being still in the agricultural stage, on account of our practical monopoly of the world's chief textile staple, were the last of the great civilized nations to find chattel slavery less profitable than wage slavery, and hence the <quote>great moral crusade</quote> of the <rs>North</rs> against the perverse and <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> unregenerate South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>It was a pure case of economic determinism, which means that our great moral conflict reduces itself, in the last analysis, to a question of dollars and cents, though the real issue was so obscured by other considerations that we of the <rs>South</rs> honestly believe to this day that we were fighting for States Rights, while the <rs>North</rs> is equally honest in the conviction that it was engaged in a magnanimous struggle to free the slave. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>It is only fair to explain here that the action of the principle of economic determinism does not imply by any means that the people affected by it are necessarily insincere or hypocritical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>As enunicated by <persName n="Marx,,Karl,,," id="n0002.0001.00013.00003" reg="default:Marx,Karl,,,"><foreName>Karl</foreName> <surname>Marx</surname></persName>, under the cumbrous and misleading title of <quote>the materialistic interpretation of history,</quote> it means simply that the economic factor plays the same part in the social evolution of the race that natural selection and the survival of the fittest are supposed to play in its physical evolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The influence of this factor is generally so subtle and indirect that we are totally unconscious of it. If I may be pardoned an illustration from my own experience, I remember perfectly well when I myself honestly and conscientiously believed the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> to be as just and sacred as I now hold it to be the reverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>It was according to the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, and to question it was impious and savored of <quote>infidelity.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Most of my contemporaries would probably give a similar experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> of us now but would look upon a return to slavery with <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> horror, and yet not <num value="1">one</num> of us probably is conscious of ever having been influenced by the economic factor! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>The truth of the matter is that the transition from chattel to wage slavery was the next step forward in the evolution of the race, just as the transition from wage slavery to free and independent labor will be the next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Some of us, who see our own economic advantage more or less clearly in this transformation, and others who do not see it so clearly as they see the evils of the present system, are working for the change with the zeal of religious enthusiasts, while the capitalists and their retainers are fighting against it with the desperation of the old Southern slaveholder against the abolitionist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>But here, in justice to the <rs>Southerner</rs>, the comparison must end. He fought a losing battle, but he fought it honestly and bravely, in the open &mdash; not by secret fraud and cunning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>His cause was doomed from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> by a law as inexorable as the <num value="1">one</num> pronounced by the fates against <placeName reg="Troy, Rensselaer, New York" key="tgn,7014660">Troy</placeName>, but he fought with a valor and heroism that have made a lost cause forever glorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>He saw the civil fabric his fathers had reared go down in a mighty cataclysm of blood and fire, a tragedy for all the ages &mdash; but better so than to have perished by slow decay through ages of sloth and rottenness, as so many other great civilizations of history have done, leaving only a debased and degenerate race behind them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>It was a medieval civilization, out of accord with the modern tenor of our time, and it had to go; but if it stood for some outworn <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> customs that should rightly be sent to the dust heap, it stood for some things, also, that the world can ill afford to lose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>It stood for gentle courtesy, for knightly honor, for generous hospitality; it stood for fair and honest dealing of man with man in the common business of life, for lofty scorn of cunning greed and ill-gotten gain through fraud and deception of our fellowmen &mdash; lessons which the founders of our New South would do well to lay to heart. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>And now I have just a word to say on a personal matter &mdash; a solemn <hi rend="italics">amende</hi> to make to the memory of my dear father, to whose unflinching devotion to the <rs>Union</rs> these pages will bear ample testimony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>While I have never been able to bring myself to repent of having sided with my own people, I have repented in sackcloth and ashes for the perverse and rebellious spirit so often manifested against him. How it was that the influence of such a parent, whom we all loved and honored, should have failed to convert his own children to his way of thinking, I do not myself understand, unless it was the contagion of the general enthusiasm around us. Youth is impulsive, and prone to run with the crowd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>We caught the infection of the war spirit in the air and never stopped to reason or to think.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>And then, there were our soldier boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>With my <num value="3">three</num> brothers in the army, and that glorious record of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0002.0001.00015.00004" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:1"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> and his men in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, how was it possible not to throw oneself heart and soul into the cause for which they were fighting so gallantly?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>And <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> when the bitter end came, it is not to be wondered at if our resentment against those who had brought all these humiliations and disasters upon us should flame up fiercer than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>In the expression of these feelings we sometimes forgot the respect due to our father's opinions and brought on scenes that were not conducive to the peace of the family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>These lapses were generally followed by fits of repentance on the part of the offender, but as they led to no permanent amendment of our ways, I am afraid, that <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and last, we made the old gentleman's life a burden to him. In looking back over the sufferings and disappointments of those dreadful years the most pathetic figure that presents itself to my memory is that of my dear old father, standing unmoved by all the clamor of the times and the waywardness of his children, in his devotion to the great republic that his father had fought for at <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>I can see now, what I could not realize then, that the <rs>Union</rs> men in the <rs>South</rs>--the honest ones, I mean, like my father &mdash; sacrificed even more for their cause than we of the other side did for ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>These men are not to be confounded with the scalawags and traitors who joined the carpet-baggers in plundering their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>They were gentlemen, and most of them slaveholders, who stood by the <rs>Union</rs>, not because they were in any sense Northern sympathizers, but because they saw in division death for the <rs>South</rs>, and believed that in saving her to the <rs>Union</rs> they were saving her to herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>They suffered not <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> only the material losses of the war, but the odium their opinions excited; and worst of all, the blank disillusionment that must have come to them when they saw their beloved Union restored only to bring about the riot and shame of Reconstruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>My father died before the horrors of that period had passed away; before the strife and hatred he so bitterly deplored had begun to subside; before he could have the satisfaction of seeing his grandson fighting under the old flag that his father had followed and that his sons had repudiated.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>Meanwhile the people in our part of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> had had time to get their breath once more, and began to look about for some way of bridging the gap of ruin and desolation that stretched through the entire length of our State.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>By the middle of <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, communication, though subject to many difficulties and discomforts, was so well established that my father concluded it would be practicable for us to make the journey to our sister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Thus far it had never been seriously threatened by the enemy, and was supposed to be the last spot in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> on which he would ever set foot-and this, in the end, proved to be not far from the truth.

<p>So then, after careful consultation with my oldest brother, <persName><foreName>Fred</foreName></persName>, at that time commandant of the <rs>Georgia</rs> <placeName reg="Camp of Instruction">camp of instruction</placeName> for conscripts, in <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName>, we set out under the protection of a reliable man whom my brother detailed to take care of us.

Women, young or old, were intrusted to the care of any man known to their family as a gentleman, with a confidence as beautiful as the loyalty that inspired it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>When I had put my clothes off and started to get into bed, I found there was but <num value="1">one</num> sheet, and that looked as if half of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0002.0002.00042.00071" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,I.,Across,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> might have slept in it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/><persName><foreName>Metta</foreName></persName>'s side <pb id="p.43" n="43"/> of the bed was comparatively dry, and she waked up just enough to pull the cotton bedquilt that was our only covering, over her head, and then went stolidly to sleep again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Meanwhile the storm increased till it was terrible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>The rain seemed to come down in a solid sheet, and I thought the old house would be torn from its foundations by the fierce wind that swept over it. The solitary pine knot that had been our only light went out and left us in total darkness, but I was getting so drenched where I lay that I was obliged to move, so I groped my way to an old lounge that stood in a somewhat sheltered corner by the fireplace, and covered myself with the clothing I had taken off. The lounge was so narrow that I couldn't turn over without causing my cover to fall over on the floor, so I lay stiff as a corpse all night, catching little uneasy snatches of sleep between the wildest bursts of the storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Early in the morning <persName n="Palmer,Mrs.,,,," id="n0002.0002.00043.00073" reg="mostcommon:Palmer,George,,,:1"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Palmer</surname></persName> and <persName n="Jenny,Mrs.,,,," id="n0002.0002.00043.00074" reg="mostcommon:Jenny,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs."></roleName><surname>Jenny</surname></persName> came in with bowls and pans to put under the leaks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>There were so many that we were quite shingled over, as we lay in bed, with a tin roof of pots and pans, and they made such a rattling as the water pattered into them, that neither of us could sleep any more for laughing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The colonel had given us instructions over night to be ready for an early start, so when another pine knot had been lighted on the hearth, we made haste to dress, before it burned out. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>But the bride, as is the way of brides, was so long in getting ready that it was nearly <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> before we started on our journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>It had stopped raining by this time, but the weather was so cold and cloudy that I found my <num value="2">two</num> suits of clothing very comfortable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>A bitter wind was blowing, and on all sides were to be seen shattered boughs and uprooted trees, effects of the past night's storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>The gentlemen had had all the baggage placed in front, and the floor of the wagon covered with fodder, where we could sit and find some protection from the wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>I should have felt tolerably comfortable if I had not seen that <persName><foreName>Metta</foreName></persName> was feeling ill, though she kept up her spirits and did not complain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>She said she had a headache, and I noticed that her face was covered with ugly red splotches, which I supposed were caused by the wind chapping her skin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>We put our shawls over our heads, but the wind played such antics with them that they were not much protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>The bride, instead of crouching down with us, mounted on top of a big trunk, the coldest place she could find, and cheered us with the comforting announcement that she was going to have pneumonia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>It was beautiful to see how the big, handsome colonel devoted himself to her, and I half suspect that was at the bottom of her pneumonia scare-at least we heard no more of it. I offered her some of our brandy, and the doctor made her a toddy, but she couldn't drink it because it was grape and not peach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Everybody seemed disposed <pb id="p.45" n="45"/> to be silent and out of sorts at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, except <persName><foreName>Metta</foreName></persName> and me, who had not yet had adventures enough to surfeit us, and we kept on talking till we got the rest of them into a good humor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>We made the gentlemen tell us what their various professions were before the war, and were delighted to learn that our dear colonel was a lawyer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>We told him that our father was a judge, and that we loved lawyers better than anybody else except soldiers, whereupon he laughed and advised the other gentlemen, who were all unmarried, to take to the law. I said that about lawyers for the doctor's benefit, because he looked all the time as if he were afraid <num value="1">one</num> of us was going to fall in love with him. I laughed and told Mett that it was she that scared him, with her hair all cropped off from fever, and that dreadful splotched complexion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>He heaped coals of fire on my head soon after, when I was cowering down in the body of the wagon, nearly dead with cold, by inviting me to get out and warm myself by taking a walk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>My feet were so cold that they felt like lifeless clods and I could hardly stand on them when I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stepped to the ground, but a brisk walk of <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> warmed me up so pleasantly that I was sorry when a succession of mud holes forced me to get back into the wagon. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>There were several crossroads at the burnt mill and we took the wrong <num value="1">one</num>, and got into somebody's cornfield, where we found a little crib whose remoteness seemed to have protected it from the greed of the invaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>It was particularly bad just at this time on account of the heavy rain, and had overflowed the swamp for nearly <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>The <rs>Yankees</rs> had thrown dead cattle in the ford, so that we had to drive about at random in the mud and water, to avoid these uncanny <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> obstructions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Our gentlemen, however, concluded that we had not time to make <num value="2">two</num> trips, so they all piled into the wagon at once and trusted to <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> for the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>We came near upsetting twice, and the water was so deep in places that we had to stand on top of the trunks to keep our feet dry. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>Safely over the swamp, we dined on the scraps left in our baskets, which afforded but a scanty meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>The cold and wind had increased so that we could hardly keep our seats, but the roads improved somewhat as we advanced, and the aspect of the country was beautiful in spite of all that the vandalism of war had done to disfigure its fair face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Many fine young saplings <pb id="p.48" n="48"/> were killed in this way, but the quickest and most effective method of destruction was to lay the iron across piles of burning cross-ties, and while heated in the flames it was bent and warped so as to be entirely spoiled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>A large force is now at work repairing the road; as the repairs advance a little every day, the place for meeting the train is constantly changing and not always easy to find.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>We floundered around in the swamps a long time and at last found our train in the midst of a big swamp, with crowds of people waiting around on little knolls and islands till the cars should be opened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>The Southern prisoners came North worn and emaciated-half starved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/><hi rend="italics">They had reached this condition because of their scant rations</hi>. They came from a mild climate to a rigorous Northern climate, and, although we <pb id="p.59" n="59"/> gave them shelter and plenty to eat, they could not stand the change.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>This argument, intended as a defense of the <rs>North</rs>, is a boomerang whose force as a weapon for the other side it is unnecessary to point out. Whether the conditions at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName> might have been ameliorated by the personal efforts of those in charge, I do not know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>I never met <persName n="Wirz,Captain,,,," id="n0002.0003.00059.00112" reg="mostcommon:Wirz,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Wirz</surname></persName>, but I do know that had he been an angel from heaven, he could not have changed the pitiful tale of suffering from privation and hunger unless he had possessed the power to repeat the miracle of the loaves and fishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>I do know, too, that the sufferings of the prisoners were viewed with the deepest compassion by the people of the neighborhood, as the diary will show, and they would gladly have relieved them if they had been able.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>In the fall of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, when it was feared that <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0002.0003.00059.00113" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,I.,Across,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> would send a raid to free the prisoners and turn them loose upon the defenseless country, a band of several <num value="1000">thousand</num> were shipped round by rail to <placeName reg="Camp Lawton">Camp Lawton</placeName>, near <placeName key="tgn,2023620" n="1.000 61" reg="millen, jenkins, georgia">Millen</placeName>, to get them out of his way. Later, when he had passed on, after destroying the railroads, these men were marched back overland to <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName>, and the planters who lived along the road had hampers filled with such provisions as could be hastily gotten together and placed before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>Among those who did this were my sister, <persName n="Butler,Mrs.,Troup,,," id="n0002.0003.00059.00114" reg="default:Butler,Troup,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>Troup</foreName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>, and her neighbors, the <name>Bacons</name>, so frequently mentioned in this part of the diary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>My sister says that she had every drop of milk and clabber in her dairy brought out and given to the poor fellows, and she begged the officer to let them wait till she could have what food she could spare cooked for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>This, however, being impossible, she had potatoes and turnips and whatever else could be eaten raw, hastily collected by the servants and strewn in <pb id="p.60" n="60"/> the road before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>I have before me, as I write, a very kind letter from an old Union soldier, in which he says that he was <num value="1">one</num> of the men fed on this occasion, and he adds: <quote>I still feel thankful for the help we got that day.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>He gives his name as <persName n="Andrews,,S.,S.,," id="n0002.0003.00060.00115" reg="default:Andrews,S.,S.,,"><foreName>S.</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Andrews</surname></persName>, <orgName type="company" n="Company K">Co.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>But it is hardly to be expected that men half-crazed by suffering and for the most part ignorant of their own government's responsibility in the matter, should discriminate very closely in apportioning the blame for their terrible condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>Accustomed to the bountiful provision made for its soldiers by the richest nation in the world, they naturally enough could not see the tragic humor of their belief, when suddenly reduced to <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> rations, that they were the victims of a deliberate plot to starve them to death! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>Another difficulty with which the officers in charge of the stockade had to contend was the lack of a sufficient force to guard so large a body of prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>At <num value="1">one</num> time there were over <num value="35000">35,000</num> of them at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName> alonea number exceeding <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0002.0003.00060.00116" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:1"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s entire force at the close of the siege of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>The men actually available for guarding this great army, were never more than <num value="1200">1,200</num> or <num value="1500">1,500</num>, and these were drawn from the <orgName type="mil" key="StateReserves">State Reserves</orgName>, consisting of boys under <num value="18">eighteen</num> and invalided or superannuated men unfit for active service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>At almost any time during the year <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, if the prisoners had realized the weakness of their guard, they could, by a concerted assault, have overpowered them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>At the time of <persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n0002.0003.00060.00117" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,nomatch:0"><surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName>'s projected raid, their numbers had been reduced to about <num value="7500">7,500</num>, by distributing the excess to other points and by the humane action of the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities in releasing, without equivalent, <measure n="15000" type="sick">15,000 sick</measure> and <pb id="p.61" n="61"/> wounded, and actually forcing them, as a free gift, upon the unwilling hospitality of their own government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>But even allowing for this diminution, the consequences of turning loose so large a body of men, naturally incensed and made desperate by suffering, to incite the negroes and ravage the country, while there were only women and children and old men left on the plantations to meet their fury, can hardly be imagined, even by those who have seen the invasion of an organized army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>The consternation of my father, when he found that he had sent us into the jaws of this danger instead of the security and rest he had counted on, cannot be described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>Happily, the danger was over before he knew of its existence, but communication was so slow and uncertain in those days that a long correspondence at cross purposes ensued before his mind was set at rest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>It may seem strange to the modern reader that in the midst of such tremendous happenings we could find it in our hearts to go about the common business of life; to laugh and dance and be merry in spite of the crumbling of the social fabric about us. But so it has always been; so it was <quote>in the days of <persName n="Noe,,,,," id="n0002.0003.00061.00118" reg="mostcommon:Noe,nomatch:0"><surname>Noe</surname></persName>,</quote> and so, we are told, will it be <quote>in the end of the world.</quote>

The dearth of men available for social functions that was so conspicuous in other parts of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> remote from the seat of war, did not exist here, because the importance <pb id="p.62" n="62"/> of so rich an agricultural region as a source of food supply for our armies, and the quartering of such large bodies of prisoners at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName> and <persName n="Millen,,,,," id="n0002.0003.00062.00119" reg="mostcommon:Millen,nomatch:0"><surname>Millen</surname></persName>, necessitated the presence of a large number of officers connected with the commissary and quartermaster's departments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1285"/>The general opinion seems to be that it is to be evacuated, and every preparation seems to be going forward to that end.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2461"/>explanatory note.--I would gladly have left out the family dissensions about politics with which this and the preceding chapter abound, could it have been done consistently with faithfulness to the original narrative which I have sought to maintain in giving to the public this contemporary record of the war time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2462"/>It is due to my father's memory, however, to say that his devotion to the <rs>Union</rs> was not owing to any want of sympathy with his own section, but to his belief that the interests of the <rs>South</rs> would be best served by remaining under the old flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2463"/>No man was ever in more hearty accord with our civilization and institutions than he. The question with him was not whether these ought to be preserved, but by what means their safety could best be assured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2464"/>His judgment told him that secession must inevitably be a failure, in any case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2465"/>Even could we have held our own in the face of the overwhelming odds against us, and established our independence, he believed that the disintegrating forces of inter-state jealousies and the intrigues of self-seeking politicians would soon have dissolved the bonds of a loosely-organized confederation, based on the right of secession, and left us in the end, broken and divided, at the mercy of our powerful centralized neighbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2466"/>I think, too, his common sense told him that slavery was bound to go, sooner or later, and if <pb id="p.280" n="280"/> emancipation must come, it would be better that it should take place peacefully and by carefully prearranged steps than with the violence and unreason which he foresaw were sure to follow in case of war. He was a large slaveholder himself, and honestly believed, like most of his class, that a condition of mild servitude secured by strict regulations against abuses, was the best solution of the <quote>negro problem</quote> bequeathed us by our ancestors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2467"/>We were in the position of the man who had the bull by the horns and couldn't let loose if he wanted to, for fear of being gored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2468"/>Yet, in spite of the dangers and difficulties that beset this course, his pride and faith in the future of the great republic his father had fought for, were so great, that if forced to choose, he would have preferred emancipation, under proper safeguards, rather than disruption of the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2469"/>But while he believed that peaceable and gradual emancipation would have been a lesser evil than disunion, he was bitterly and unalterably opposed to negro suffrage, and regarded it as the greatest of all the evils brought upon us by the war.

Such advice was unpopular at the time, but it was a mere question of policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2470"/>He deplored the misfortunes of the <rs>South</rs> as much as anybody; we differed only in our opinion as to who was to blame for them, and how they were to be remedied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2471"/>We laid all our sufferings at the door of the hated <rs>Yankees</rs>; he blamed the authors of the secession movement-<quote>the fool <pb id="p.281" n="281"/> secessionists,</quote> he used to call them, when angry or heated by contradiction, but more commonly, <quote>the poor fools,</quote> in a tone of half-pitying rebuke, just as he had spoken of them on that memorable night when the bells were ringing for the secession of his State. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2598"/>Our pleasant evening had a sad termination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2599"/>We went to our rooms at <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time>, and I had just stretched myself out for a good night's rest when mother came to the door and said that father was very ill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2602"/>A man of father's age and feeble health cannot well stand a severe attack of illness, and I felt cold with terror every time I thought of the possibility that he might die.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2603"/>He is the dearest, best old father <pb id="p.297" n="297"/> that ever lived, and I have talked dreadfully to him sometimes, and now I am so sorry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2604"/>He is much better to-day &mdash; entirely out of danger, the doctor says, but must not leave his bed. Mother stays in the room reading to him, so Mett and I have to take charge of the household.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2617"/>When I spoke to him about it, he laughed and said: <quote>How could you expect a man to be anything but solemn at his own wedding?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2618"/>I turned the tables by saying it was the woman's time to look solemn afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2619"/>We kept up a sort of mock warfare the whole evening, and I don't know when I have ever laughed more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2620"/>You can be so free and easy with a married man and let him say things you wouldn't take from a single <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2621"/>He and <persName><roleName n="Cousin">Cousin</roleName> <foreName>Bolling</foreName></persName> nicknamed me <quote>Zephyr</quote> because they said my hair looked like a zephyr would if they could see it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2622"/><quote>You needn't be uneasy,</quote> the captain said, <quote>they only need another good pinching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2627"/>He said no, but he had been married long enough not to be fooled with hot iron and yellow paper devices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2628"/><quote>Oh, but it is worse even than that sometimes,</quote> I acknowledged, pulling out a little bunch of artificial frizzettes that I use in damp weather to fill in the gaps of my own, <quote>they are <q direct="unspecified"> false as fair.</q>

<p>He laughed at my frankness and proposed that we should have another dance, but I made some excuse, and slipped off upstairs to get a look at myself in the glass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2630"/>Between the damp and the dancing, my frizzes were in a condition that made me look like a Medusa's head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2631"/>I fastened them down the best I could with hairpins and hid the worst-looking under a little cluster of rosebuds and then went back to the parlor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2632"/>I wish now that I had never cut off my front hair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2633"/>It has grown too long to frizz, and is still too short to do anything else with, and as the false frizzettes I have are made of <persName><foreName>Metta</foreName></persName>'s and my hair mixed, they won't stay curled in damp weather, and so are not much of a help.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2650"/>After we had each told everything we could think of to raise a laugh against the other, he put on a serious face, and began to hint, in a very mysterious way, that he thought this house was a dangerous place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2651"/><quote>There are ghosts in it,</quote> he said, and then, to our utter amazement, went on to tell, as if he were relating a genuine ghost story, about <persName n="Goldthwaite,Captain,,,," id="n0002.0007.00301.01106" reg="mostcommon:Goldthwaite,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Goldthwaite</surname></persName>'s encounter with <persName><roleName n="Cousin">Cousin</roleName> <foreName>Liza</foreName></persName> the other morning, as he was coming out of his room to take the early train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2652"/>He evidently didn't know, when he started, who the real ghost was, but he saw at once, from our laughter, that it was neither <persName><foreName>Cora</foreName></persName> nor <persName><foreName>Metta</foreName></persName> nor me, so he said it must lie between <persName><roleName n="Cousin">Cousin</roleName> <foreName>Liza</foreName></persName> and Mary Day, and he would find out by telling the story at the dinner table, and watching their faces, which <num value="1">one</num> it was.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2654"/>But instead of laughing with the rest of us, she got on her high horse and gave him a piece of her mind that silenced him for that time as a story-teller.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3380"/>Here the record ends, amid the gloom and desolation of defeat &mdash; a gloom that was to be followed ere long by the still blacker darkness of Reconstruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3381"/>Yet, I would not have the reader draw from its pages a message of despair, but of hope and courage under difficulties; for disaster cheerfully borne and honorably overcome, is not a tragedy, but a triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3382"/>And this, the most glorious of all conquests, belongs to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3383"/>Never in all history, has any people recovered itself so completely from calamity so overwhelming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3384"/>By the abolition of slavery alone <num value="4000">four thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> worth of property were wiped out of existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3385"/>As many <num value="1000000">millions</num> more went up in the smoke and ruin of war; while to count in money the cost of the precious lives that were sacrificed, would be, I will not say an impossibility, but a desecration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3386"/>I do not recall these things in a spirit of bitterness or repining, but with a feeling of just pride that I belong to a race which has shown itself capable of rising superior to such conditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3387"/>We, on this side of the line, have long since forgiven the war and its inevitable hardships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3388"/>We challenged the fight, and if we got more of it in the end than we liked, there was nothing for it but to stand up like men and take our <pb id="p.386" n="386"/> medicine without whimpering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3389"/>It was the hand that struck us after we were down that bore hardest; yet even its iron weight was not enough to break the spirit of a people in whom the <name>Anglo</name>-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0002.0009.00386.01412" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> blood of our fathers still flows uncontaminated; and when the insatiable crew of the carpet-baggers fell upon us to devour the last meager remnants left us by the spoliation of war, they were met by the ghostly bands of <quote>The Invisible Empire,</quote> who through secret vigilance and masterful strategy saved the civilization they were forbidden to defend by open force. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3390"/>To conquer fate is a greater victory than to conquer in battle, and to conquer under such handicaps as were imposed on the <rs>South</rs> is more than a victory; it is a triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3391"/>Forced against our will, and against the simplest biological and ethnological laws, into an unnatural political marriage that has brought forth as its monstrous offspring a race problem in comparison with which the <rs>Cretan Minotaur</rs> was a suckling calf; robbed of the last pitiful resource the destitution of war had left us, by a prohibitory tax on cotton, our sole commercial product; discriminated against for half a century by a predatory tariff that mulcts us at every turn, from the cradle to the grave; giving <num value="1000000">millions</num> out of our poverty to educate the negro, and contributing <num value="1000000">millions</num> more to reward the patriotism of our conquerors, whose imperishable multitudes as revealed by the pension rolls, make the <num value="4">four</num>-year resistance of our thin gray bands <num value="1">one</num> of the miracles of history; yet, in spite <pb id="p.387" n="387"/> of all this, and in spite of the fact that the path of our progress has been a thorny <num value="1">one</num>, marked by many an unwritten tragedy of those who went down in the struggle, too old, or too deeply rooted in the past to adapt themselves to new conditions, we have, as a people, come up out of the depths stronger and wiser for our battle with adversity, and the land we love has lifted herself from the <rs type="place">Valley of Humiliation</rs> to a pinnacle of prosperity that is the wonder of more favored sections. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3392"/>And so, after all, our tale of disaster is but the prelude to a triumph in which <num value="1">one</num> may justly glory without being accused of vainglory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3393"/>It is good to feel that you belong to a people that you have a right to be proud of; it is good to feel coursing in your veins the blood of a race that has left its impress on the civilization of the world wherever the <name>Anglo</name>-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0002.0009.00387.01413" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> has set his foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3394"/>And to us, who bore the storm and stress and the tragedy of those dark days, it is good to remember that if the sun which set in blood and ashes over the hills of <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName> has risen again in splendor on the smiling prospect of a New South, it is because the foundations of its success were laid in the courage and steadfastness and hopefulness of a generation who in the darkest days of disaster, did not despair of their country.</p>
