<head>Preface.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>I am aware that this book has neither the fullness of personal narrative, nor the closeness of scientific analysis, which its too comprehensive title might lead the reader to expect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>A word of explanation is therefore needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>I thought little at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of the general public, when I began to weave together in narrative form the facts, letters, and journals contained in these volumes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>My chief object was to prevent the dispersion and final loss of scattered papers which had an unquestionable family value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>But, as my work grew upon my hands, I began to feel that the story of an intellectual life, which was marked by such rare coherence and unity of aim, might have a wider interest and usefulness; might, perhaps, <pb n="iv"/> serve as a stimulus and an encouragement to others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>For this reason, and also because I am inclined to believe that the <rs>European</rs> portion of the life of <persName n="Agassiz,,Louis,,," id="n0258.0001.00000.00001" reg="default:Agassiz,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> is little known in his adopted country, while its American period must be unfamiliar to many in his native land, I have determined to publish the material here collected.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>The book labors under the disadvantage of being in great part a translation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>The correspondence for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volume was almost wholly in <name>French</name> and <name>German</name>, so that the choice lay between a patch-work of several languages or the unity of <num value="1">one</num>, burdened as it must be with the change of version.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>I have accepted what seemed to me the least of these difficulties.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Besides the assistance of my immediate family, including the revision of the text by my son <persName n="Agassiz,,Alexander,,," id="n0258.0001.00000.00002" reg="default:Agassiz,Alexander,,,"><foreName>Alexander</foreName> <surname>Agassiz</surname></persName>, I have been indebted to my friends Dr. and <persName n="Hagen,Mrs.,,,," id="n0258.0001.00000.00003" reg="mostcommon:Hagen,Hermann,,,:2"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Hagen</surname></persName> and to the late <persName n="Guyot,Professor,,,," id="n0258.0001.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Guyot,Arnold,,,:8"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Guyot</surname></persName> for advice on special points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/><pb n="v"/> As will be seen from the list of illustrations, I have also to thank <persName n="Elliot,Mrs.,John,W.,," id="n0258.0001.00000.00005" reg="default:Elliot,John,W.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Elliot</surname></persName> for her valuable aid in that part of the work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>On the other side of the water I have had most faithful and efficient collaborators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/><persName n="Agassiz,Mister,Auguste,,," id="n0258.0001.00000.00006" reg="default:Agassiz,Auguste,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Auguste</foreName> <surname>Agassiz</surname></persName>, who survived his <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Louis</foreName></persName> several years, and took the greatest interest in preserving whatever concerned his scientific career, confided to my hands many papers and documents belonging to his brother's earlier life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>After the death of my brother-in-law, his cousin <persName n="Mayor,Mister,Auguste,,," id="n0258.0001.00000.00007" reg="default:Mayor,Auguste,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Auguste</foreName> <surname>Mayor</surname></persName>, of <placeName>Neuchatel</placeName>, continued the same affectionate service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Without their aid I could not have completed the narrative as it now stands.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The friend last named also selected from the glacier of the <name>Aar</name>, at the request of <persName n="Agassiz,,Alexander,,," id="n0258.0001.00000.00008" reg="default:Agassiz,Alexander,,,"><foreName>Alexander</foreName> <surname>Agassiz</surname></persName>, the boulder which now marks his father's grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>With unwearied patience <persName n="Mayor,Mister,,,," id="n0258.0001.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Mayor,Auguste,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Mayor</surname></persName> passed hours of toilsome search among the blocks of the moraine near the site of the old <q direct="unspecified">Hotel des Neuchatelois,</q> and <pb n="vi"/> chose at last a stone so monumental in form that not a touch of the hammer was needed to fit it for its purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>In conclusion I allow myself the pleasure of recording here my gratitude to him and to all who have aided me in my work.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The parsonages in <placeName key="tgn,7011731" n="1.000 54" reg="switzerland">Switzerland</placeName> are frequently pretty and picturesque.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>That of <persName n="Motier,,,,," id="n0258.0002.00001.00013" reg="mostcommon:Motier,nomatch:0"><surname>Motier</surname></persName>, looking upon the lake and sheltered by a hill which commands a view over the whole <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> chain of the <name>Bernese</name> <placeName reg="Alps" key="tgn,7007746">Alps</placeName>, was especially so. It possessed a vineyard large enough to add something in good years to the small salary of the pastor; an orchard containing, among other trees, an apricot famed the country around for the unblemished beauty of its abundant fruit; a good vegetable garden, and a delicious spring of water flowing always fresh and pure into a great stone basin behind the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>That stone basin was <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0002.00002.00014" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,Louis,Rodolphe,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName>'s <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> aquarium; there he had his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> collection of fishes.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> 
<p>After his death a touching tribute was paid to his memory by the inhabitants of his birthplace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>With appropriate ceremonies, a marble slab was placed above the door of the parsonage of <persName n="Motier,,,,," id="n0258.0002.00002.00015" reg="mostcommon:Motier,nomatch:0"><surname>Motier</surname></persName>, with this inscription, <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Agassiz,,J.,Louis,," id="n0258.0002.00002.00016" reg="default:Agassiz,J.,Louis,,"><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Agassiz</surname></persName>, celebre naturaliste, est ne dans cette maison, le <dateStruct value="1807-05-28"><day reg="28">28</day> <month reg="05">Mai</month>, <year reg="1807">1807</year></dateStruct>.</q></p></note> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It does not appear that he had any precocious predilection for study, and his parents, who for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> of his life were his only teachers, were too wise to stimulate his mind beyond the ordinary attainments of his age. Having lost her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="4">four</num> children in infancy, his mother watched with trembling solicitude over his early years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It was perhaps for this reason that she was drawn so closely to her boy, and understood that his love of nature, and especially of all living <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> things, was an intellectual tendency, and not simply a child's disposition to find friends and playmates in the animals about him. In later years her sympathy gave her the key to the work of his manhood, as it had done to the sports of his childhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>She remained his most intimate friend to the last hour of her life, and he survived her but <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/><persName><foreName>Louis</foreName></persName>'s love of natural history showed itself almost from infancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>When a very little fellow he had, beside his collection of fishes, all sorts of pets: birds, field-mice, hares, rabbits, guinea-pigs, etc., whose families he reared with the greatest care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Guided by his knowledge of the haunts and habits of fishes, he and his <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Auguste</foreName></persName> became the most adroit of young fishermen,&mdash;using processes all their own and quite independent of hook, line, or net. Their hunting grounds were the holes and crevices beneath the stones or in the water-washed walls of the lake shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>No such shelter was safe from their curious fingers, and they acquired such dexterity that when bathing they could seize the fish even in the open water, attracting them by little arts to which the fish submitted as to a kind of fascination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Such amusements are no doubt the delight of many a lad living in the country, <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> nor would they be worth recording except as illustrating the unity of <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0002.00004.00017" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,J.,Louis,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName>'s intellectual development from beginning to end. His pet animals suggested questions, to answer which was the task of his life; and his intimate study of the fresh-water fishes of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, later the subject of <num value="1">one</num> of his important works, began with his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> collection from the <rs type="place">Lake of Morat</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>As a boy he amused himself also with all kinds of handicrafts on a small scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The carpenter, the cobbler, the tailor, were then as much developed in him as the naturalist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>In <persName><foreName>Swiss</foreName></persName> villages it was the habit in those days for the trades-people to go from house to house in their different vocations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The shoemaker came <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> times a year with all his materials, and made shoes for the whole family by the day; the tailor came to fit them for garments which he made in the house; the cooper arrived before the vintage, to repair old barrels and hogsheads or to make new ones, and to replace their worn-out hoops; in short, to fit up the cellar for the coming season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/><persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0002.00004.00018" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,J.,Louis,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> seems to have profited by these lessons as much as by those he learned from his father; and when a very little fellow, he could cut and put together a well-fitting pair of shoes <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> for his sisters' dolls, was no bad tailor, and could make a miniature barrel that was perfectly water-tight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>He remembered these trivial facts as a valuable part of his incidental education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>He said he owed much of his dexterity in manipulation, to the training of eye and hand gained in these childish plays.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Though fond of quiet, in-door occupation, he was an active, daring boy. <num value="1">One</num> winter day when about <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> of age, he was skating with his little <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Auguste</foreName></persName>, <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> younger than himself, and a number of other boys, near the shore of the lake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>They were talking of a great fair held that day at the town of <placeName reg="Murten,Bern,Schweiz,Europe" key="tgn,7007425">Morat</placeName>, on the opposite side of the lake, to which <persName n="Agassiz,,M.,,," id="n0258.0002.00005.00019" reg="default:Agassiz,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> had gone in the morning, not crossing upon the ice, however, but driving around the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The temptation was too strong for <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName></persName>, and he proposed to <persName><foreName>Auguste</foreName></persName> that they should skate across, join their father at the fair, and come home with him in the afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>They started accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The other boys remained on their skating ground till <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time>, the usual dinner hour, when they returned to the village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/><persName n="Agassiz,Madame,,,," id="n0258.0002.00005.00020" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,M.,,,"><roleName n="Madame">Mme.</roleName> <surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> was watching for her boys, thinking them rather late, and on inquiring <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> for them among the troop of urchins coming down the village street she learned on what errand they had gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Her anxiety may be imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The lake was not less than <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> across, and she was by no means sure that the ice was safe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>She hurried to an upper window with a spy-glass to see if she could descry them anywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>At the moment she caught sight of them, already far on their journey, <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName></persName> had laid himself down across a fissure in the ice, thus making a bridge for his little brother, who was creeping over his back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Their mother directed a workman, an excellent skater, to follow them as swiftly as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>He overtook them just as they had gained the shore, but it did. not occur to him that they could return otherwise than they had come, and he skated back with them across the lake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Weary, hungry, and disappointed, the boys reached the house without having seen the fair or enjoyed the drive home with their father in the afternoon.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>When he was <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> old, <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0002.00006.00021" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,M.,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> was sent to the college for boys at <placeName reg="Biel, Bern, Schweiz" key="tgn,7007320">Bienne</placeName>, thus exchanging the easy rule of domestic instruction for the more serious studies of a public school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>He found himself on a level with his class, however, for his father was an admirable <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> teacher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Indeed it would seem that <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0002.00007.00022" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,M.,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName>'s own passion for teaching, as well as his love of young people and his sympathy with intellectual aspiration everywhere, was an inheritance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Wherever his father was settled as pastor, at <persName n="Motier,,,,," id="n0258.0002.00007.00023" reg="mostcommon:Motier,nomatch:0"><surname>Motier</surname></persName>, at <placeName reg="Orbe, Vaud, Schweiz" key="tgn,7007438">Orbe</placeName>, and later at <placeName key="tgn,1064000" n="1.000 10" reg="Concise,Vaud,Schweiz,Europe">Concise</placeName>, his influence was felt in the schools as much as in the pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>A piece of silver remains, a much prized heir-loom in the family, given to him by the municipality of <placeName reg="Orbe, Vaud, Schweiz" key="tgn,7007438">Orbe</placeName> in acknowledgment of his services in the schools.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The rules of the school at <placeName reg="Biel, Bern, Schweiz" key="tgn,7007320">Bienne</placeName> were rather strict, but the life led by the boys was hardy and invigorating, and they played as heartily as they worked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Remembering his own school life, <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0002.00007.00024" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,M.,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> often asked himself whether it was difference of climate or of method, which makes the public school life in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> so much more trying to the health of children than the <num value="1">one</num> under which he was brought up. The boys and girls in our public schools are said to be overworked with a session of <measure n="5hours" type="date">five hours</measure>, and an additional hour or <num value="2">two</num> of study at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>At the <rs type="place">College of Bienne</rs> there were <measure n="9hours" type="date">nine hours</measure> of study, and the boys were healthy and happy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Perhaps the secret might be found in the frequent interruption, <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure> of <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> study alternating with an interval for play or rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/><persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0002.00008.00025" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,M.,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> always retained a pleasant impression of the school and its teachers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/><persName n="Rickly,Mister,,,," id="n0258.0002.00008.00026" reg="mostcommon:Rickly,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Rickly</surname></persName>, the director, he regarded with an affectionate respect, which ripened into friendship in maturer years.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The vacations were, of course, hailed with delight, and as <persName n="Motier,,,,," id="n0258.0002.00008.00027" reg="mostcommon:Motier,nomatch:0"><surname>Motier</surname></persName> was but <placeName><distance reg="20miles">twenty miles distant</distance> from <placeName reg="Biel, Bern, Schweiz" key="tgn,7007320">Bienne</placeName></placeName>, <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0002.00008.00028" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,M.,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> and his younger <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Auguste</foreName></persName>, who joined him at school a year later, were in the habit of making the journey on foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The lives of these brothers were so closely interwoven in their youth that for many years the story of <num value="1">one</num> includes the story of the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>They had everything in common, and with their little savings they used to buy books, chosen by <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName></persName>, the foundation, as it proved, of his future library.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Long before dawn on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of vacation the <num value="2">two</num> bright, active boys would be on their homeward way, as happy as holiday could make them, especially if they were returning for the summer harvest or the autumn vintage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The latter was then, as now, a season of festivity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>In these more modern days something of its primitive picturesqueness may have been lost; but when <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0002.00008.00029" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,M.,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> was a boy, all the ordinary occupations were <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> given up for this important annual business, in which work and play were so happily combined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>On the appointed day the working people might be seen trooping in from neighboring cantons, where there were no vineyards, to offer themselves for the vintage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>They either camped out at night, sleeping in the open air, or found shelter in the stables and outhouses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>During the grape gathering the floor of the barn and shed at the parsonage of <persName n="Motier,,,,," id="n0258.0002.00009.00030" reg="mostcommon:Motier,nomatch:0"><surname>Motier</surname></persName> was often covered in the evening with tired laborers, both men and women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Of course, when the weather was fine, these were festival days for the children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>A bushel basket, heaped high with white and amber bunches, stood in the hall, or in the living room of the family, and young and old were free to help themselves as they came and went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Then there were the frolics in the vineyard, the sweet cup of <hi rend="italics">must</hi>(unfermented juice of the grape), and the ball on the last evening at the close of the merry-making.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>How the fecundation takes place I know not, but it must needs be the same as in other kinds of the related <rs>Bombinator</rs>; <hi rend="italics">igneus</hi> throws out almost as many eggs hanging together in clusters as <hi rend="italics">obstetricans; fuscus</hi> throws them out from itself in strings (see Roseld's illustration). . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>This string is a bag, in which the eggs lie inclosed at different distances, though they seem in the empty space to be fallen, thread-like, together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>But if you stretch the thread and press the eggs, they change their places, and you can distinctly see that they lie free in the bag, having their own membranous envelopes corresponding to those of other batrachian eggs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Surely this species seeks the water at the time of fecundation, for so do all batrachians, the water being indeed a more fitting medium for fecundation <pb id="p.42" n="42"/> than the air. . . . It is certain that the eggs were already fecundated when we found them in the ground, for later, I found several not so far advanced as those you have, and yet after <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> I had tadpoles from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>In those eggs which were in the lowest stage of development (how they may be earlier, <hi rend="italics">nescio</hi>), nothing was clearly visible; they were simply little yellow balls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>After some days, <num value="2">two</num> small dark spots were to be seen marking the position of the eyes, and a longitudinal streak indicated the dorsal ridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>Presently everything became more distinct; the mouth and the nasal opening, the eyes and the tail, which lay in <num value="0.5">a half</num> circle around the body; the skin was so transparent that the beating of the heart and the blood in the vessels could be easily distinguished; the yolk and the yolk sac were meanwhile sensibly diminished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>The movements of the little animal were now quite perceptible,&mdash;they were quick and by starts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>After <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4weeks" type="date">four weeks</measure> the eggs were as large as peas; the bags had burst at the spots where the eggs were attached, and the little creatures filled the egg envelopes completely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>They moved incessantly and very quickly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Now the female stripped off the eggs from her legs; she <pb id="p.43" n="43"/> seemed very uneasy, and sprang about constantly in the tank, but grew more quiet when I threw in more water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>The eggs were soon free, and I laid them in a shallow vessel filled with fresh water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>The restlessness among them now became greater, and behold!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>. . . You know well to whom you speak, dear mother, and how you must bait your hook in order that the fish may rise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>When you paint it, I see nothing above domestic happiness, and am convinced that the height of felicity is to be found in the bosom of your <pb id="p.63" n="63"/> family, surrounded by little marmots to love and caress you. I hope, too, to enjoy this happiness in time. . . . But the man of letters should seek repose only when he has deserved it by his toil, for if once he anchor himself, farewell to energy and liberty, by which alone great minds are fostered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>Therefore I have said to myself, that I would remain unmarried till my work should assure me a peaceful and happy future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>A young man has too much vigor to bear confinement so soon; he gives up many pleasures which he might have had, and does not appreciate at their just value those which he has.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>This brings me to the subject of my last letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>It seems that you have misunderstood me, for your answer grants me after all just what I ask. You think that I wish to renounce entirely the study of medicine?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>On the contrary, the idea has never occurred to me, and, according to my promise, you shall have <num value="1">one</num> of these days a doctor of medicine as a son. What repels me is the thought of practicing medicine for a livelihood, and here <pb id="p.64" n="64"/> you give me free rein just where I wanted it. That is, you consent that I should devote myself wholly to the natural sciences should this career offer me, as I hope it may, a more favorable prospect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>It requires, for instance, but <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> to go around the world at government expense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>I will levy contributions on all my senses that not a single chance may escape me for making interesting observations and fine collections, so that I also may be ranked among those who have enlarged the boundaries of science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>With that my future is secured, and I shall return content and disposed to do all that you wish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>Even then, if medicine had gained greater attraction for me, there would still be time to begin the practice of it. It seems to me there is nothing impracticable in this plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>I beg you to think of it, and to talk it over with papa and with my uncle at <placeName key="tgn,7007299" n="1.000 2" reg="lausanne,vaud,schweiz,europe">Lausanne</placeName>. . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>Your mother's last letter, my dear <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName></persName>, was in answer to <num value="1">one</num> from you which crossed it on the way, and gave us, so far as your health and contentment are concerned, great satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>Yet our gratification lacks something; it would be more complete had you not a mania for rushing full gallop into the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>I have often reproved you for this, and you would fare better did you pay more attention to my reproof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>If it be an incurable malady with you, at all events do not force your parents to share it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>I will not for the present hear of anything else, and that is more than enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>Talk to us, then in your letters, of your friends, of your personal life, of your wants (which I am always ready to satisfy), of your pleasures, of <pb id="p.66" n="66"/> your feeling for us, but do not put yourself out of our reach with your philosophical syllogisms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>The Vaudois <q direct="unspecified">Society of Public Utility</q> has just announced an altogether new project, that of establishing popular libraries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>. . . What you tell me of the <q direct="unspecified">Society of Public Utility</q> has aroused in me a throng of ideas, about which I will write you when they are a little more mature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>Meanwhile, please tell me: <num value="1">1</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>What is this Society?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/><num value="2">2</num>. Of what persons is it composed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/><num value="3">3</num>. What is its principal aim?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>Tell me, also, in what way you propose to distribute your libraries at small expense, and how large they are to be . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>I could not be more satisfied than I am with my stay here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>I lead a monotonous but an exceedingly pleasant life, withdrawn from the crowd of students and seeing them but little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>When our lectures are over we meet in the evening at <persName n="Braun,,,,," id="n0258.0003.00067.00211" reg="nearbymention:Braun,Alexander,,,"><surname>Braun</surname></persName>'s room or mine, with <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> intimate acquaintances, and talk of scientific matters, each <num value="1">one</num> in his turn presenting a subject which is <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> developed by him, and then discussed by all. These exercises are very instructive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>As my share, I have begun to give a course of natural history, or rather of pure zoology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/><persName n="Braun,,,,," id="n0258.0003.00067.00212" reg="nearbymention:Braun,Alexander,,,"><surname>Braun</surname></persName> talks to us of botany, and another of our company, Mahir, who is an excellent fellow, teaches us mathematics and physics in his turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>In <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> our friend <persName n="Schimper,,,,," id="n0258.0003.00067.00213" reg="nearbymention:Schimper,William,,,"><surname>Schimper</surname></persName>, whom we left at <placeName key="tgn,7005177" n="1.000 1" reg="heidelberg,karlsruhe,baden-wurttemberg,deutschland,europe">Heidelberg</placeName>, will join us, and he will then be our professor of philosophy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>Thus we shall form a little university, instructing each other and at the same time learning what we teach more thoroughly, because we shall be obliged <pb id="p.68" n="68"/> to demonstrate it. Each session lasts <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure>, during which the professor in charge retails his merchandise without aid of notes or book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>You can imagine how useful this must be in preparing us to speak in public and with coherence; the experience is the more important, since we all desire nothing so much as sooner or later to become professors in very truth, after having played at professor in the university.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>This brings me naturally to my projects again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>Your letter made me feel so keenly the anxiety I had caused you by my passion for travel, that I will not recur to it; but as my object was to make in that way a name that would win for me a professorship, I venture upon another proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>If during the course of my studies I succeed in making myself known by a work of distinction, will you not then consent that I shall study, at least during <num value="1">one</num> year, the natural sciences alone, and then accept a professorship of natural history, with the understanding that in the first place, and in the time agreed upon, I shall take my <rs type="role2">Doctor</rs>'s degree?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>This is, indeed, essential to my obtaining what I wish, at least in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 6" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>You will object that, before thinking of anything beyond, I ought <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to <pb id="p.69" n="69"/> fulfill the condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>But let me say that the more clearly a man sees the road before him, the less likely he is to lose his way or take the wrong turn,&mdash;the better he can divide his stages and his resting-places . . .</p></body></text>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>. . . I have had a long talk about you with your uncle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>He does not at all disapprove of your letters, of which I told him the contents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>He only insists, as we do, on the necessity of a settled profession as absolutely essential to your financial position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>Indeed, the natural sciences, however sublime and attractive, offer nothing certain in the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>Agreed that you have now an invincible repugnance to the practice of medicine, it is evident from your last <num value="2">two</num> letters that you would have no less objection to any <pb id="p.70" n="70"/> other profession by which money is to be made, and, besides, it is too late to make another selection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>This being so, we will come to an understanding in <num value="1">one</num> word: Let the sciences be the balloon in which you prepare to travel through higher regions, but let medicine and surgery be your parachutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>I think, my dear <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName></persName>, you cannot object to this way of looking at the question and deciding it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>Probably I shall not stir during the vacation, and shall even give up the little trip in the <name>Tyrol</name>, which I had thought of making as a rest from occupations that bind me very closely at present, but from which I hope to free myself in the course of the holidays.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>Don't be angry with me for not telling you at once what they are. When you know, I hope to be forgiven for keeping you so long in the dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>I have kept it a secret from papa too, though in his last letter he asks me what is my especial work just now. A few months more of patience, and I will give you a strict account of <pb id="p.76" n="76"/> my time since I came here, and then I am sure you will be satisfied with me. I only wish to guard against <num value="1">one</num> thing: do not take it into your head that I am about to don the fool's cap suddenly and surprise you with a <rs type="role2">Doctor</rs>'s degree; that would be going a little too fast, nor do I think of it yet. . . . I want to remind you not to let the summer pass without getting me fishes according to the list in my last letter, which I hope you have not mislaid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>You would give me great pleasure by sending them as soon as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>He names the countries also from which he has received contributions, and regrets that he has nothing from <placeName key="tgn,7003669" n="1.000 15" reg="bayern">Bavaria</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>Now I possess several specimens of all the native species, and have even discovered some <num value="10">ten</num> not hitherto known to occur here, beside <num value="1">one</num> completely new to science, which I have named Cyprinus <pb id="p.77" n="77"/> uranoscopus on account of the position of the eyes, placed on the top instead of the sides of the head,&mdash;otherwise very like the gudgeon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>I have therefore thought I could not better launch myself in the scientific world than by sending <persName n="Cuvier,,,,," id="n0258.0004.00077.00235" reg="nearbymention:Cuvier,M.,,,"><surname>Cuvier</surname></persName> my fishes with the observations I have made on their natural history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>I gave him your letter to read, and since then he has asked me a dozen times at least if I had not forgotten to forward the remittance you asked for, saying that I must not delay it.

There we asked a peasant how far we had still to go, and when he had answered our question he told us, evidently with kind intention, that we should find good company in the village, for a few hours earlier <num value="3">three</num> journeymen laborers had arrived there; and then he added that we should no doubt be glad to meet comrades and have a gay evening with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>We were not astonished to be taken for workmen, since every <num value="1">one</num> who travels here on foot, with a knapsack on his back, is understood to belong to the laboring class. . . . Arrived at the village, we were delighted to find that the <num value="3">three</num> journeymen were our traveling companions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>They had come, like ourselves, from <placeName reg="Traunstein, Oberbayern, Bayern" key="tgn,7004676">Traunstein</placeName>, where we had missed each other in the crowd, and they were going likewise to sleep at Adelstaetten, to avoid the custom-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>Finally, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, at <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time>, we crossed the long bridge over the <name>Saala</name>, between the white coats with yellow trimmings on guard there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/><pb id="p.87" n="87"/> On the <name>Bavarian</name> frontier we had hardly remembered that there was a custom-house, and the name of student sufficed to pass us without our showing any passports; here, on the contrary, it was another reason for the strictest examination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/><q direct="unspecified">Have you no forbidden books?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>By good fortune, before crossing the bridge, I had advised Trettenbach to hide his song-book in the lining of his boot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>I am assured that had it been taken upon him he would not have been allowed to pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>In ransacking <persName n="Braun,,,,," id="n0258.0004.00087.00254" reg="nearbymention:Braun,Alexander,,,"><surname>Braun</surname></persName>'s bag, <num value="1">one</num> of the officials found a shell such as are gathered by the basketful on the shores of the <rs type="place">Lake of Neuchatel</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impulse was to go to the office and inquire whether we should not pay duty on this, saying that it was no doubt for the fabrication of false pearls, and we probably had plenty more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>We had all the difficulty in the world to make him understand that not <num value="50">fifty</num> steps from the custom-house the shores of the river were strewn with them . . . . After all this we had to empty our purses to show that we had money enough for our journey, and that we should not be forced to beg in order to get through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>While we underwent this inquisition, another officer made a tour of inspection around us, to observe our general <pb id="p.88" n="88"/> bearing, etc. . . . After having kept us thus on coals for <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> they gave us back our passports, and we went our way. At <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time> we arrived at <placeName reg="Salzburg, Salzburg, Osterreich" key="tgn,7003256">Salzburg</placeName> as hungry as wolves, but at the gate we had still to wait and give up our passports again in exchange for receipts, in virtue of which we could obtain permits from the police to remain in the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>From our inn, we sent a waiter to get these permits, but he presently returned with the news that we must go in person to take them; there was, however, no hurry; it would do in <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure>! We had no farther difficulty except that it was made a condition of our stay that we should not appear in student's dress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>This dress, they said, was forbidden in <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>They begged More to have his hair cut, otherwise it would be shortened gratis, and also informed us that at our age it was not becoming to dispense with cravats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>It astonished me, also, to see that we were not entered on the list of strangers published every evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>So it was also, as we found, with other students, though the persons who came with them by the same conveyance, even the children, were duly inscribed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>. . .I will tell you how we have laid out our time for this term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>Our human consciousness may be said to begin at <time value="5:30oclock">half-past 5 o'clock</time> in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>The hour from <num value="6">six</num> to <num value="7">seven</num> is appointed for mathematics, namely, geometry and trigonometry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>To this appointment we are faithful, unless the professor oversleeps himself, or <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0004.00089.00261" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,L.,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> happens to have grown to his bed, an event which sometimes occurs at the opening of the term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>From <num value="7">seven</num> to <num value="8">eight</num> we do as we like, including breakfast.

At <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time> comes the clinical lecture of Ringseis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>As Ringseis is introducing an entirely new medical system, this is not wholly without general physiological and philosophical interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>At <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time> we go to dinner, for which we have at last found a comfortable and regular place, at a private house, after having dined everywhere and anywhere, at prices from <num value="9">nine</num> to <num value="20">twenty</num> kreutzers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>This will sound strangely to you, because, till now, men have not believed that revelation could be a subject for philosophical treatment; to some it has seemed too sacred; to others too irrational. . . . This lecture brings us to <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time>, when the public courses are at an end: we go home, and now begin the private lectures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>He was at that time scarcely <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> old, and was already the most prominent among the students at <placeName key="tgn,7004333" n="1.000 3" reg="munchen,oberbayern,bayern,deutschland,europe">Munich</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>They loved him, and had a high consideration for him. I had seen him at the <name>Swiss</name> students' club several times, and had observed him among the <hi rend="italics">jolly</hi> students; he liked merry society, but he himself was in general reserved and never noisy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>He picked out the gifted and highlylearned students, and would not waste his time <pb id="p.94" n="94"/> in ordinary conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>Often, when he saw a number of students going off on some empty pleasure-trip, he said to me, <quote> There they go with the other fellows; their motto is, <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Ich">Ich</placeName> gehe mit den andern.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>In all his doings there was an ease and calm which was remarkable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>His studio was a perfect <name>German</name> student's room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>It was large, with several wide windows; the furniture consisted of a couch and about half a dozen chairs, beside some tables for the use of his artists and himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>Being botanists, they, too, brought home what they collected in their excursions, and all this found a place in the atelier, on the couch, on the seats, on the floors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>Books filled the chairs, <num value="1">one</num> alone being left for the other artist, while I occupied a standing desk with my drawing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>No visitor could sit down, and sometimes there was little room to stand or move about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>The walls were white, and diagrams were drawn on them, to which, by and by, we artists added skeletons and caricatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>In short, it was quite original.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>Brought together in various ways, partly by himself, partly in exchange for duplicates, partly as pay for arranging specimens in the <rs>Munich Museum</rs>, they had already acquired, when compared with his small means, a considerable pecuniary value, and a far higher scientific importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>They included fishes, some rare mammalia, reptiles, shells, birds, an herbarium of some <num value="3000">three thousand</num> species of plants collected by himself, and a small cabinet of minerals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>After enumerating them in a letter to his parents he continues: <q direct="unspecified">You can imagine that all these things are in my way now that I cannot attend to them, and that for want of room and care they are piled up and in danger of spoiling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>You see by my list that the whole collection is valued at <num value="200">two hundred</num> louis; and this is so low an estimate that even those who sell objects of natural history <pb id="p.96" n="96"/> would not hesitate to take them at that price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>You will therefore easily understand how anxious I am to keep them intact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>Can you not find me a place where they might be spread out?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>Be so kind as to propose it to him, and if he consents I will then tell you what I shall need for its arrangement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>Remember that on this depends, in great part, the preservation of my specimens, and answer as soon as possible.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>This hope is revealed in his next home letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>The letter is a long <num value="1">one</num>, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> half is omitted since it concerns only the arrangements for his collections, the care to be taken of them, etc. <pb id="p.97" n="97"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>You will not have forgotten either that you exacted this only that I might have a profession, and that you promised, should I be able to make my way in the career of letters and natural history, you would not oppose my wishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>I am indeed aware that in the latter case you see but <num value="1">one</num> obstacle, that of absence from my country and separation from all who are dear to me. But you know me too well to think that I would voluntarily impose upon myself such an exile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>Weigh all my reasons, for in this my peace of mind and my future happiness are concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>Let us see in what these means consist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>[Here follows the summing up of his reasons for preferring a professorship of natural history to the practice of medicine, and his intention of trying for a diploma as <rs type="role2">Doctor</rs> of Philosophy in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 6" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>.] But how obtain a professorship, you will say,&mdash;that is the important point?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>I answer, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step is to make myself a European name, and for that I am on the right road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>In the first place my work on the fishes of <placeName reg="Brasil, South America, " key="tgn,1000047">Brazil</placeName>, just about to appear, will make me favorably known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>I <pb id="p.99" n="99"/> am sure it will be kindly received; for at the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> of <name>German</name> naturalists and medical men last <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>, in <placeName reg="Berlin, Berlin, Deutschland" key="tgn,7003712">Berlin</placeName>, the part already finished and presented before the <name>Assembly</name> was praised in a manner for which I was quite unprepared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>You already know that I have been arranging my collections at Cudrefin, <pb id="p.119" n="119"/> and spending very happy days with my grandfather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>But he is now very ill, and even should we have better news of him to-day, the thought weighs heavily on my heart, that I must take leave of him when he is perhaps on his death-bed. . . .

For this I have to thank you, dear Alex., and it gives me pleasure to tell you so and to be reminded of it. What a succession of glorious memories came up to me as I turned them over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>Free from all disturbing incidents, I enjoyed anew our life together, and even more, if possible, than in actual experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>Every talk, every walk, was present to me again, and in reviewing it all I saw how our minds had been drawn to each other in an ever-strengthening union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/>In you I see my own intellectual development reflected as in a mirror, for to you, and to my intercourse with you, I owe my entrance upon this path of the noblest and most lasting enjoyment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>But the naturalist was stronger than the physician.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>. . . My resolve to study medicine is now confirmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>I feel all that may be done to render this study worthy the name of science, which it has so long usurped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>Its intimate alliance with the natural sciences and the enlightenment it promises me regarding them <pb id="p.121" n="121"/> are indeed my chief incitements to persevere in my resolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>In order to gain time, and to strike while the iron is hot (don't be afraid it will grow cold; the wood which feeds the fire is good), I have proposed to <persName n="Euler,,,,," id="n0258.0005.00121.00353" reg="mostcommon:Euler,nomatch:0"><surname>Euler</surname></persName>, with whom I am very intimate, to review the medical course with me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>In this way, although I devote my whole day to my own work about fishes, I hope to finish my professional studies before summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>I shall then pass my examination for the <name>Doctorate</name> in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 6" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>, and afterward do the same in <placeName key="tgn,7007299" n="1.000 2" reg="lausanne,vaud,schweiz,europe">Lausanne</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>I hope that this decision will please mama.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>My character and conduct are the pledge of its accomplishment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>This, then, is my night-work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>I have still to tell you what I do by day, and this is more important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>My <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> duty is to complete my Brazilian Fishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>To be sure, it is only an honorary work, but it must be finished, and is an additional means of making subsequent works profitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>This is my morning occupation, and I am sure of bringing it to a close about <persName n="Easter,,,,," id="n0258.0005.00121.00354" reg="mostcommon:Easter,nomatch:0"><surname>Easter</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>After much reflection, I have decided that the best way to turn my Fresh-<pb id="p.122" n="122"/> Water Fishes to account, is to finish them completely before offering them to a publisher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>All the expenses being then paid, I could afford, if the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> publisher should not feel able to take them on my own terms, to keep them as a safe investment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>The publisher himself seeing the material finished, and being sure of bringing it out as a complete work, the value of which he can on that account better estimate, will be more disposed to accept my proposals, while I, on my side, can be more exacting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>The text for this I write in the afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>My greatest difficulty at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was the execution of the plates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>But here, also, my good star has served me wonderfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>I told you that beside the complete drawings of the fishes I wanted to represent their skeletons and the anatomy of the soft parts, which has never been done for this class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>I shall thereby give a new value to the work, and make it desirable for all who study comparative anatomy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>The puzzle was to find some <num value="1">one</num> who was prepared to draw things of this kind; but I have made the luckiest hit, and am more than satisfied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>My former artist continues to draw the fishes, a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> draws the skeletons (<num value="1">one</num> who had already been engaged for several years in the same way, for a work <pb id="p.123" n="123"/> upon reptiles), while a young physician, who is an admirable draughtsman, makes my anatomical figures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>For my share, I direct their work while writing the text, and thus the whole advances with great strides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>I do not, however, stop here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>Having by permission of the <rs>Director</rs> of the <name>Museum</name> <num value="1">one</num> of the finest collections of fossils in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 6" reg="germany">Germany</placeName> at my disposition, and being also allowed to take the specimens home as I need them, I have undertaken to publish the ichthyological part of the collection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>Since it only makes the difference of <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> people more to direct, I have these specimens also drawn at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>Nowhere so well as here, where the <orgName n="Fine Arts Academy" type="academy">Academy of Fine Arts</orgName> brings together so many draughtsmen, could I have the same facility for completing a similar work; and as it is an entirely new branch, in which no <num value="1">one</num> has as yet done anything of importance, I feel sure of success; the more so because <persName n="Cuvier,,,,," id="n0258.0005.00123.00355" reg="nearbymention:Cuvier,B.,G.,,"><surname>Cuvier</surname></persName>, who alone could do it (for the simple reason that every <num value="1">one</num> else has till now neglected the fishes), is not engaged upon it. Add to this that just now there is a real need of this work for the determination of the different geological formations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>Once before, at the <name>Heidelberg</name> meeting, it had been proposed to me; the <pb id="p.124" n="124"/> <rs type="role" reg="Director">Director</rs> of the <name>Mines</name> at <placeName reg="Strasbourg, Bas-Rhin, Alsace" key="tgn,7012346">Strasbourg</placeName>, <persName n="Voltz,,M.,,," id="n0258.0005.00124.00356" reg="default:Voltz,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Voltz</surname></persName>, even offered to send me at <placeName key="tgn,7004333" n="1.000 3" reg="munchen,oberbayern,bayern,deutschland,europe">Munich</placeName> the whole collection of fossil fishes from their Museum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>I did not speak to you of this at the time because it would have been of no use. But now that I have it in my power to carry out the project, I should be a fool to let a chance escape me which certainly will not present itself a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time so favorably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>It is therefore my intention to prepare a general work on fossil ichthyology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>I hope, if I can command another <num value="100">hundred</num> louis, to complete everything of which I have spoken before the end of the summer, that is to say, in <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>I shall then have on hand <num value="2">two</num> works which should surely be worth a <num value="1000">thousand</num> louis to me. This is a low estimate, for even ephemeral pieces and literary ventures are paid at this price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>You can easily make the calculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>They allow <num value="3">three</num> louis for each plate with the accompanying text; my fossils will have about <num value="200">two hundred</num> plates, and my fresh-water fishes about <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>This seems to me plausible. . . . .</p></body></text> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>I speak of the university, the hospitals, libraries, and collections of all sorts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>I have learned, and am still learning, the care of the eyes and how to operate upon them; as to medicine, the physicians, however good, do not surpass those I have already known; and as I do not believe it important that a young physician should familiarize himself with a great variety of curative methods, I try to observe carefully the patient and his disease rather than to remember the medicaments applied in special cases.

<p>I am conscious that at successive periods of my life I have employed very different means and followed very different systems of study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1066"/>I may, therefore, be allowed to offer the result of my experience as a contribution toward the building up of a sound method for the promotion of the study of nature.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1067"/>A <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, when a mere boy, <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> of age, I did what most beginners do. I picked up whatever I could lay my hands on, and tried, by such books and authorities as I had at my command, to find the names of these <pb id="p.145" n="145"/> objects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>My highest ambition, at that time, was to be able to designate the plants and animals of my native country correctly by a Latin name, and to extend gradually a similar knowledge in its application to the productions of other countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1069"/>This seemed to me, in those days, the legitimate aim and proper work of a naturalist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1070"/>I still possess manuscript volumes in which I entered the names of all the animals and plants with which I became acquainted, and I well remember that I then ardently hoped to acquire the same superficial familiarity with the whole creation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/>I did not then know how much more important it is to the naturalist to understand the structure of a few animals, than to command the whole field of scientific nomenclature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/>Since I have become a teacher, and have watched the progress of students, I have seen that they all begin in the same way; but how many have grown old in the pursuit, without ever rising to any higher conception of the study of nature, spending their life in the determination of species, and in extending scientific terminology!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1073"/>Long before I went to the university, and before I began to study natural history under the guidance of men who were masters in the science during the early part of <pb id="p.146" n="146"/> this century, I perceived that while nomenclature and classification, as then understood, formed an important part of the study, being, in fact, its technical language, the study of living beings in their natural element was of infinitely greater value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1074"/>At that age, namely, about <num value="15">fifteen</num>, I spent most of the time I could spare from classical and mathematical studies in hunting the neighboring woods and meadows for birds, insects, and land and freshwater shells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1075"/>My room became a little menagerie, while the stone basin under the fountain in our yard was my reservoir for all the fishes I could catch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1076"/>Indeed, collecting, fishing, and raising caterpillars, from which I reared fresh, beautiful butterflies, were then my chief pastimes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/>What I know of the habits of the fresh-water fishes of <placeName reg="Europe" key="tgn,1000003">Central Europe</placeName> I mostly learned at that time; and I may add, that when afterward I obtained access to a large library and could consult the works of Bloch and Lacedpede, the only extensive works on fishes then in existence, I wondered that they contained so little about their habits, natural attitudes, and mode of action with which I was so familiar.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1078"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> course of lectures on zoology I attended was given in <placeName key="tgn,7007299" n="1.000 2" reg="lausanne,vaud,schweiz,europe">Lausanne</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1079"/>It <pb id="p.147" n="147"/> consisted chiefly of extracts from <persName n="Cuvier,,,,," id="n0258.0005.00147.00394" reg="nearbymention:Cuvier,M.,,,"><surname>Cuvier</surname></persName>'s <quote>Regne animal,</quote> and from Lamarck's <quote>Animaux sans Vertebres.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/>I now became aware, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, that the learned differ in their classifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/>With this discovery, an immense field of study opened before me, and I longed for some knowledge of anatomy, that I might see for myself where the truth was. During <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> spent in the <orgName n="Medical School" type="school">Medical School of <placeName key="tgn,7007302" n="1.000 3" reg="zurich,zurich,schweiz,europe">Zurich</placeName></orgName>, I applied myself exclusively to the study of anatomy, physiology, and zoology, under the guidance of <persName n="Schinz,Professor,,,," id="n0258.0005.00147.00395" reg="mostcommon:Schinz,M.,,,:1"><roleName n="Professor">Professors</roleName> <surname>Schinz</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hirzel,Professor,,,," id="n0258.0005.00147.00396" reg="mostcommon:Hirzel,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Professor"></roleName><surname>Hirzel</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1082"/>My inability to buy books was, perhaps, not so great a misfortune as it seemed to me; at least, it saved me from too great dependence on written authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/>I spent all my time in dissecting animals and in studying human anatomy, not forgetting my favorite amusements of fishing and collecting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/>I was always surrounded with pets, and had at this time some <num value="40">forty</num> birds flying about my study, with no other home than a large pine-tree in the corner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/>I still remember my grief when a visitor, entering suddenly, caught <num value="1">one</num> of my little favorites between the floor and the door, and he was killed before I could extricate him. <persName n="Schinz,Professor,,,," id="n0258.0005.00147.00397" reg="mostcommon:Schinz,M.,,,:1"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Schinz</surname></persName>'s private collection of birds was my daily resort, and I then described every <pb id="p.148" n="148"/> bird it contained, as I could not afford to buy even a text-book of ornithology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/>I also copied with my own hand, having no means of purchasing the work, <num value="2">two</num> volumes of Lamarck's <quote>Animaux sans Vertebres,</quote> and my dear brother copied another half volume for me. I finally learned that the study of the things themselves was far more attractive than the books I so much coveted; and when, at last, large libraries became accessible to me, I usually contented myself with turning over the leaves of the volumes on natural history, looking at the illustrations, and recording the titles of the works, that I might readily consult them for identification of such objects as I should have an opportunity of examining in nature.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>After spending in this way <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> in <placeName key="tgn,7007302" n="1.000 3" reg="zurich,zurich,schweiz,europe">Zurich</placeName>, I was attracted to <placeName key="tgn,7005177" n="1.000 1" reg="heidelberg,karlsruhe,baden-wurttemberg,deutschland,europe">Heidelberg</placeName> by the great reputation of its celebrated teachers, <persName n="Tiedemann,,,,," id="n0258.0005.00148.00398" reg="mostcommon:Tiedemann,M.,,,:1"><surname>Tiedemann</surname></persName>, <persName n="Leuckart,,,,," id="n0258.0005.00148.00399" reg="mostcommon:Leuckart,M.,,,:1"><surname>Leuckart</surname></persName>, Bronn, and others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>It is true that I was still obliged to give up a part of my time to the study of medicine, but while advancing in my professional course by a steady application to anatomy and physiology, I attended the lectures of <persName n="Leuckart,,,,," id="n0258.0005.00148.00400" reg="mostcommon:Leuckart,M.,,,:1"><surname>Leuckart</surname></persName> in zoology, and those of Bronn in paleontology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>I had no idea of its direct connection with geology, or of its bearing on the problem of the successive introduction of animals on the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>I had never thought of the larger and more philosophical view of nature as <num value="1">one</num> great world, but considered the study of animals only as it was taught by descriptive zoology in those days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>At about this time, however, I made the acquaintance of <num value="2">two</num> young botanists, <persName n="Braun,,,,," id="n0258.0005.00149.00402" reg="mostcommon:Braun,Alexander,,,:18"><surname>Braun</surname></persName> and <persName n="Schimper,,,,," id="n0258.0005.00149.00403" reg="mostcommon:Schimper,Karl,,,:4"><surname>Schimper</surname></persName>, both of whom have since become distinguished in the annals of science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>The metamorphosis of plants was the chief study of my friends, and I could not but feel that descriptive zoology had not spoken the last word in our science, and that grand generalizations, such as were opening upon botanists, must be preparing for zoologists also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>Intimate contact with <name>German</name> students made me feel that I had neglected my philosophical education; and when, in the <pb id="p.150" n="150"/> year <dateStruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></dateStruct>, the new <placeName reg="University of Munich">University of Munich</placeName> opened, with <persName n="Schelling,,,,," id="n0258.0005.00150.00405" reg="mostcommon:Schelling,nomatch:0"><surname>Schelling</surname></persName> as professor of philosophy, <persName n="Oken,,,,," id="n0258.0005.00150.00406" reg="mostcommon:Oken,nomatch:0"><surname>Oken</surname></persName>, <persName n="Schubert,,,,," id="n0258.0005.00150.00407" reg="mostcommon:Schubert,nomatch:0"><surname>Schubert</surname></persName>, and Wagler as professors of zoology, <persName n="Dollinger,,,,," id="n0258.0005.00150.00408" reg="mostcommon:Dollinger,nomatch:0"><surname>Dollinger</surname></persName> as professor of anatomy and physiology, <persName n="Martius,,,,," id="n0258.0005.00150.00409" reg="mostcommon:Martius,M.,,,:10"><surname>Martius</surname></persName> and Zuccarini as professors of botany, <persName n="Fuchs,,,,," id="n0258.0005.00150.00410" reg="mostcommon:Fuchs,nomatch:0"><surname>Fuchs</surname></persName> and Kobell as professors of mineralogy, I determined to go there with my <num value="2">two</num> friends and drink new draughts of knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>My experience in <placeName key="tgn,7004333" n="1.000 3" reg="munchen,oberbayern,bayern,deutschland,europe">Munich</placeName> was very varied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/>He gave his intellectual capital to his pupils without stint or reserve, and nothing delighted him more than to sit down for a quiet talk on scientific matters with a few students, or to take a ramble with them into the fields outside the city, and explain to them as he walked the result of any recent investigation he had made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>If he found himself understood by his listeners he was satisfied, and cared for no farther publication of his researches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/>I could enumerate many works of masters in our science, which had no other foundation at the outset than these inspiriting conversations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>A master in the art of teaching, he exercised an almost irresistible influence over his students.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/>Constructing the <pb id="p.152" n="152"/> universe out of his own brain, deducing from <hi rend="italics">a priori</hi> conceptions all the relations of the <num value="3">three</num> kingdoms into which he divided all living beings, classifying the animals as if by magic, in accordance with an analogy based on the dismembered body of man, it seemed to us who listened that the slow laborious process of accumulating precise detailed knowledge could only be the work of drones, while a generous, commanding spirit might build the world out of its own powerful imagination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/>The temptation to impose <num value="1">one</num>'s own ideas upon nature, to explain her mysteries by brilliant theories rather than by patient study of the facts as we find them, still leads us away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1111"/>With the school of the physiophilosophers began (at least in our day and generation) that overbearing confidence in the abstract conceptions of the human mind as applied to the study of nature, which still impairs the fairness of our classifications and prevents them from interpreting truly the natural relations binding together all living beings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1112"/>And yet, the young naturalist of that day who did not share, in some degree, the intellectual stimulus given to scientific pursuits by physio-philosophy would have missed a part of his training.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>There is a great distance <pb id="p.153" n="153"/> between the man who, like <persName n="Oken,,,,," id="n0258.0005.00153.00416" reg="mostcommon:Oken,nomatch:0"><surname>Oken</surname></persName>, attempts to construct the whole system of nature from general premises and the <num value="1">one</num> who, while subordinating his conceptions to the facts, is yet capable of generalizing the facts, of recognizing their most comprehensive relations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>No thoughtful naturalist can silence the suggestions, continually arising in the course of his investigations, respecting the origin and deeper connection of all living beings; but he is the truest student of nature who, while seeking the solution of these great problems, admits that the only true scientific system must be <num value="1">one</num> in which the thought, the intellectual structure, rises out of and is based upon facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1115"/>The great merit of the physio-philosophers consisted in their suggestiveness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1116"/>They did much in freeing our age from the low estimation of natural history as a science which prevailed in the last century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1117"/>They stimulated a spirit of independence among observers; but they also instilled a spirit of daring, which, from its extravagance, has been fatal to the whole school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1118"/>He is lost, as an observer, who believes that he can, with impunity, affirm that for which he can adduce no evidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1121"/>Among my fellow-students were many young men who now rank among the highest lights in the various departments of science, and others, of equal promise, whose early death cut short their work in this world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1122"/>Some of us had already learned at this time to work for ourselves; not merely to attend lectures and study from books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1123"/>The best spirit of emulation existed among us; we met often to discuss our observations, undertook frequent excursions in the neighborhood, delivered lectures to our fellow-students, and had, not infrequently, the gratification of seeing our university professors among the listeners.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1153"/>Thus quietly engaged in his ichthyological studies, carrying on his work on the fossil <pb id="p.159" n="159"/> fishes, together with that on the fresh-water fishes of <placeName reg="Europe" key="tgn,1000003">Central Europe</placeName>, he passed nearly a year at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1154"/>He was not without patients also in the village and its environs, but had, as yet, no prospect of permanent professional employment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1156"/>There, also, he could continue and complete to the best advantage his medical studies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1157"/>His poverty was the greatest hindrance to any such move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1161"/>On the road he made several halts for purposes of study, combining, as usual, professional with scientific <pb id="p.160" n="160"/> objects, hospitals with museums.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1162"/>He was, perhaps, a little inclined to believe that the most favorable conditions for his medical studies were to be found in conjunction with the best collections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1219"/>Let us now return to the natural order.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1223"/>Meanwhile <num value="1">one</num> daily anxiety embittered his scientific happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1224"/>The small means at his command could hardly be made, even with the strictest economy, to cover the necessary expenses of himself and his artist, in which were included books, drawing materials, fees, etc. He was in constant terror lest he should be obliged to leave <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, to give up his investigations on the fossil fishes, and to stop work on the costly plates he had begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1229"/>I shall be very sorry if it comes too late, but I could not help it. . . . . In the first place I had not money enough to pay for it without being left actually penniless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1230"/>You can imagine that after the fuel bill for the winter is paid, little remains for other expenses out of my <num value="200">200</num> francs a month, <num value="5">five</num> louis of which are always due to my companion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1231"/>Far from having anything in advance, my month's supply is thus taken up at once . . . Beside this cause of delay, you can have no idea what it is to hunt for anything in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> when you are a stranger there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1232"/>As I go out only in <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> directions leading to my work, and might not otherwise leave my own street for a month at a time, I naturally find myself astray when I am off this beaten track. . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1233"/>Frankly, after <pb id="p.171" n="171"/> having delivered a few of my letters, I have never been again, because I cannot, in my position, spare time for visits. . . . Another excellent reason for staying away now is that I have no presentable coat.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1237"/>. . . Much as your letter to your uncle delighted us, that to your brother has saddened us. It seems, my dear child, that you are painfully straitened in means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1238"/>I understand it by personal experience, and in your case I have foreseen it; it is the cloud which has always darkened your prospects to me. I want to talk to you, my dear <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName></persName>, of your <pb id="p.172" n="172"/> future, which has often made me anxious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1239"/>You know your mother's heart too well to misunderstand her thought, even should its expression be unacceptable to you. With much knowledge, acquired by assiduous industry, you are still at <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure> of age living on brilliant hopes, in relation, it is true, with great people, and known as having distinguished talent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1240"/>Now, all this would seem to me delightful if you had an income of <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> francs; but, in your position, you must absolutely have an occupation which will enable you to live, and free you from the insupportable weight of dependence on others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1241"/>From this day forward, my dear child, you must look to this end alone if you would find it possible to pursue honorably the career you have chosen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1242"/>Otherwise constant embarrassments will so limit your genius, that you will fall below your own capacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1243"/>If you follow our advice you will perhaps reach the result of your work in the natural sciences a little later, but all the more surely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1244"/>Let us see how you can combine the work to which you have already consecrated so much time, with the possibility of self-support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1245"/>It appears from your letter to your brother that you see no <num value="1">one</num> in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>; the reason seems to me a sad <num value="1">one</num>, but it <pb id="p.173" n="173"/> is unanswerable, and since you cannot change it, you must change your place of abode and return to your own country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1246"/>You have already seen in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> all those persons whom you thought it essential to see; unless you are strangely mistaken in their good-will, you will be no less sure of it in <placeName key="tgn,7011731" n="1.000 54" reg="switzerland">Switzerland</placeName> than in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, and since you cannot take part in their society, your relations with them will be the same at the distance of a <num value="100">hundred</num> leagues as they are now. You must therefore leave <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> for <placeName reg="Geneve, Geneve, Schweiz" key="tgn,7007279">Geneva</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7007299" n="1.000 2" reg="lausanne,vaud,schweiz,europe">Lausanne</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Nechatel">Nechatel</placeName>, or any city where you can support yourself by teaching. . . . This seems to me the most advantageous course for you. If before fixing yourself permanently you like to take your place at the parsonage again, you will always find us ready to facilitate, as far as we can, any arrangements for your convenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1247"/>Here you can live in perfect tranquillity and without expense.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1248"/>There are <num value="2">two</num> other subjects which I want to discuss with you, though perhaps I shall not make myself so easily understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1249"/>You have seen the handsome public building in process of construction at <placeName reg="Nechatel">Nechatel</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1250"/>It will be finished this year, and I am told that the <name>Museum</name> will be placed there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1251"/>I believe the <pb id="p.174" n="174"/> collections are very incomplete, and the city of <placeName key="tgn,7007292" n="1.000 5" reg="neuchatel,neuchatel,schweiz,europe">Neuchatel</placeName> is rich enough to expend something in filling the blanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1252"/>It has occurred to me, my dear, that this would be an excellent opportunity for disposing of your alcoholic specimens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1253"/>They form, at present, a capital yielding no interest, requiring care, and to be enjoyed only at the cost of endless outlay in glass jars, alcohol, and transportation, to say nothing of the rent of a room in which to keep them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1254"/>All this, beside attracting many visitors, is too heavy a burden for you, from which you may free yourself by taking advantage of this rare chance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1255"/>To this end you must have an immediate understanding with <persName n="Coulon,,M.,,," id="n0258.0006.00174.00472" reg="default:Coulon,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Coulon</surname></persName>, lest he should make a choice elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1256"/>Your brother, being on the spot, might negotiate for you. . . . Finally, my last topic is <persName n="Dinkel,Mister,,,," id="n0258.0006.00174.00473" reg="mostcommon:Dinkel,Joseph,,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Dinkel</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1257"/>You are very fortunate to have found in your artist such a thoroughly nice fellow; nevertheless, in view of the expense, you must make it possible to do without him. I see you look at me aghast; but where a sacrifice is to be made we must not do it by halves; we must pull up the tree by the roots.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1259"/>. . . .It is true, dear mother, that I am greatly straitened; that I have much less money to spend than I could wish, or even than I need; on the other hand, this makes me work the harder, and keeps me away from distractions which might otherwise tempt me. . . . With reference to my work, however, things are not quite as you suppose, as regards either my stay here or my relations with <persName n="Cuvier,,M.,,," id="n0258.0006.00175.00474" reg="default:Cuvier,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Cuvier</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1260"/>Certainly, I hope that I should lose neither his good &mdash; will nor his protection on leaving here; on the contrary, I am sure that he would be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to advise me to accept any professorship, or any place which might be advantageous for me, however removed from my present occupations, and that his counsels would follow me there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1261"/>But what cannot follow me, and what I owe quite as much to him, is the privilege of examining all the collections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1262"/>These I can have nowhere but in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, since even if he would consent to it I could not carry away with me a <num value="100">hundred</num> quintals of fossil fish, which, for the sake of comparison, I must have before my eyes, nor <num value="1000">thousands</num> of fish-skeletons, which would alone <pb id="p.176" n="176"/> fill some <num value="50">fifty</num> great cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1263"/>It is this which compels me to stay here till I have finished my work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1264"/>I should add that M. <persName n="Beaumont,,Elie,,,de" id="n0258.0006.00176.00475" reg="expanded:Beaumont,Elie,,,"><foreName>Elie</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Beaumont</surname></persName> has also been kind enough to place at my disposition the fossil fishes from the collection at the <rs type="place">Mining School</rs>, and that <persName n="Brongniart,,M.,,," id="n0258.0006.00176.00476" reg="default:Brongniart,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Brongniart</surname></persName> has made me the same offer regarding his collection, which is <num value="1">one</num> of the finest among those owned by individuals in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1265"/>As to my collections, I had already thought of asking either the <name>Vaudois</name> government or the city of <placeName reg="Nechatel">Nechatel</placeName> to receive them into the <name>Museum</name>, merely on condition that they should provide for the expenses of exhibition and preservation, making use of them, meanwhile, for the instruction of the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1266"/>I should be sorry to lose all right to them, because I hope they may have another final destination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1267"/>I do not despair of seeing the different parts of <placeName key="tgn,7011731" n="1.000 54" reg="switzerland">Switzerland</placeName> united at some future day by a closer tie, and in case of such a union a truly Helvetic university would become a necessity; then, my aim would be to make my collection the basis of that which they would be obliged to found for their courses of lectures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1268"/>It is really a shame that <placeName key="tgn,7011731" n="1.000 54" reg="switzerland">Switzerland</placeName>, richer and more extensive than <pb id="p.177" n="177"/> many a small kingdom, should have no university, when some states of not half its size have even <num value="2">two</num>; for instance, the grand duchy of <persName n="Baden,,,,," id="n0258.0006.00177.00477" reg="mostcommon:Baden,nomatch:0"><surname>Baden</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of whose universities, that of <placeName key="tgn,7005177" n="1.000 1" reg="heidelberg,karlsruhe,baden-wurttemberg,deutschland,europe">Heidelberg</placeName>, ranks among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in all <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 6" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1269"/>If ever I attain a position allowing me so to do, I shall make every effort in my power to procure for my country the greatest of benefits: namely, that of an intellectual unity, which can arise only from a high degree of civilization, and from the radiation of knowledge from <num value="1">one</num> central point.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1270"/>I, too, have considered the question about <persName n="Dinkel,,,,," id="n0258.0006.00177.00478" reg="mostcommon:Dinkel,Joseph,,,:2"><surname>Dinkel</surname></persName>, and if, when I have finished my work here, my position is not changed, and I have no definite prospect, such as would justify me in keeping him with me,&mdash;well!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1271"/>then we must part!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1272"/>I have long been preparing myself for this, by employing him only upon what is indispensable to the publication of my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> numbers, hoping that these may procure me the means of paying for such illustrations as I shall further need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1273"/>As my justification for having engaged him in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance, and continued this expense till now, I can truly say that it is in a great degree through his drawings that <persName n="Cuvier,,M.,,," id="n0258.0006.00177.00479" reg="default:Cuvier,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Cuvier</surname></persName> has been able to judge of my work, and so has been led to <pb id="p.178" n="178"/> make a surrender of all his materials in my favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1274"/>I foresaw clearly that this was my only chance of competing with him, and it was not without reason that I insisted so strongly on having <persName n="Dinkel,,,,," id="n0258.0006.00178.00480" reg="mostcommon:Dinkel,Joseph,,,:2"><surname>Dinkel</surname></persName> with me in passing through <placeName reg="Strasbourg, Bas-Rhin, Alsace" key="tgn,7012346">Strasbourg</placeName> and subsequently at <placeName key="tgn,7004424" n="1.000 10" reg="Karlsruhe,Karlsruhe,Baden-Wurttemberg,Deutschland,Europe">Carlsruhe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1275"/>Had I not done so, <persName n="Cuvier,,M.,,," id="n0258.0006.00178.00481" reg="default:Cuvier,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Cuvier</surname></persName> might still be in advance of me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1279"/>For this reason, above all, I regret my want of means; but for that I could have the drawings made at once, and the <name>Academy</name> report, considered as a recommendation, would certainly help on the publication greatly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1280"/>But in this respect I have long been straitened; <persName><foreName>Auguste</foreName></persName> knows that I had at <placeName key="tgn,7004333" n="1.000 3" reg="munchen,oberbayern,bayern,deutschland,europe">Munich</placeName> an artist who was to complete what I had left there for execution, and that I stopped his work on leaving Concise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1281"/>If the stagnation of the book-trade continues I shall, perhaps, be forced to give up <persName n="Dinkel,,,,," id="n0258.0006.00178.00483" reg="mostcommon:Dinkel,Joseph,,,:2"><surname>Dinkel</surname></persName> also; for if I cannot begin <pb id="p.179" n="179"/> the publication, which will, I hope, bring me some return, I must cease to accumulate material in advance.

I have spoken of my project to <persName n="Humboldt,,M.,,,de" id="n0258.0007.00191.00519" reg="expanded:Humboldt,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Humboldt</surname></persName>, whom I often see, and who kindly interests himself about my prospects and helps me with his advice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1355"/>He thinks that under the circumstances, and especially in my position, measures should be taken in advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1356"/>There is another point of great importance for me about which I wished also to speak to you. Though you have seen but a small part of it, you nevertheless know that in my different journeys, partly through my relations with other naturalists, partly by exchange, I have made a very fair collection of natural history, especially rich in just those classes which are less fully represented in your museum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1357"/>My collection might, therefore, fill the gaps in that of the city of <placeName key="tgn,7007292" n="1.000 5" reg="neuchatel,neuchatel,schweiz,europe">Neuchatel</placeName>, and make the latter more than adequate for the illustration of a full course of natural history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1358"/>Should an increase of your zoological collection make part of your plans for the <name>Lyceum</name>, I venture to believe that mine would fully answer your purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1359"/>In that case I would offer it to you, since the expense of arranging it, the rent of a room in which to keep it, and, in short, its <pb id="p.192" n="192"/> support in general, is beyond my means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1360"/>I must find some way of relieving myself from this burden, although it will be hard to part with these companions of my study, upon which I have based almost all my investigations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1361"/>I have spoken of this also to <persName n="Humboldt,,M.,,,de" id="n0258.0007.00192.00520" reg="expanded:Humboldt,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Humboldt</surname></persName>, who is good enough to show an interest in the matter, and will even take all necessary steps with the government to facilitate this purchase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1362"/>You would render me the greatest service by giving me your directions about all this, and especially by telling me: <num value="1">1</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1363"/>On whom the nomination to the professorship depends?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1364"/><num value="2">2</num>. With whom the purchase of the collection would rest?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1365"/><num value="3">3</num>. What you think I should do with reference to both?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1366"/>Of course you will easily understand that I cannot give up my collections except under the condition that I should be allowed the free use of them. . . . .</p></body></text> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1373"/>He tells me that he has proposed to the <orgName n="Education Board" type="board">Board of Education</orgName> the establishment of a professorship of natural history, to be offered to me. The proposition met with a cordial hearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1374"/>The need of such a professorship was unanimously recognized, but the <rs>President</rs> explained that neither would the condition of the treasury allow its establishment in the present year, nor could the proposition be brought before the <orgName n="State Council" type="council">Council of State</orgName> until the opening of the new Lyceum.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/>He requests a prompt answer in order that he may make all needful preparations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1377"/>Only too <pb id="p.194" n="194"/> gladly would I have consulted you about various propositions made to me here in the last few days, and have submitted my course to your approval, had it not been that here, as in <placeName key="tgn,7007292" n="1.000 5" reg="neuchatel,neuchatel,schweiz,europe">Neuchatel</placeName>, a prompt answer was urged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1378"/>Although guided rather by instinct than by anything else, I think, nevertheless, that I have chosen rightly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1379"/>In such moments, when <num value="1">one</num> cannot see far enough in advance to form an accurate judgment upon deliberation, feeling is, after all, the best adviser; that inner impulse, which is a safe guide if other considerations do not confuse the judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1380"/>This says to me, <q direct="unspecified">Go to <placeName key="tgn,7007292" n="1.000 5" reg="neuchatel,neuchatel,schweiz,europe">Neuchatel</placeName>; do not stay in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1381"/>But I speak in riddles; I must explain myself more clearly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1382"/>Last Monday Levrault sent for me in order to propose that <persName n="Valenciennes,,,,," id="n0258.0007.00194.00527" reg="nearbymention:Valenciennes,M.,,,"><surname>Valenciennes</surname></persName> and I should jointly undertake the publication of the <name>Cuvierian</name> fishes. . . . I was to give a positive answer this week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1383"/>I have carefully considered it, and have decided that an unconditional engagement would lead me away from my nearest aim, and from what I look upon as the task of my life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1384"/>The already published volumes of the <name>System</name> of Ichthyology lie too far from the road on which I intend to pursue my researches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1385"/>Finally, it seems to me that in a quiet retired place <pb id="p.195" n="195"/> like <placeName key="tgn,7007292" n="1.000 5" reg="neuchatel,neuchatel,schweiz,europe">Neuchatel</placeName>, whatever may be growing up within me will have a more independent and individual development than in this restless <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, where obstacles or difficulties may not perhaps divert me from a given purpose, but may disturb or delay its accomplishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1386"/>I will therefore so shape my answer to Levrault as to undertake only single portions of the work, the choice of these, on account of my interest in the fossil and the fresh-water fishes, being allowed me, with the understanding, also, that I should be permitted to have these collections in <placeName key="tgn,7011731" n="1.000 54" reg="switzerland">Switzerland</placeName> and work them up there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1387"/>From <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, also, it would not be so easy to transfer myself to <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 6" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>, whereas I could consider <placeName key="tgn,7007292" n="1.000 5" reg="neuchatel,neuchatel,schweiz,europe">Neuchatel</placeName> as a provisional position from which I might be called to a German university. . . .</p></body></text> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1398"/>I have received your kind letter with great pleasure and hasten to reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1399"/>What you write gives me the more satisfaction because it opens to me in the near future the hope of establishing myself in your neighborhood and devoting to my country the fruits of my labor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1400"/>It is true, as you suppose, that the death of <persName n="Cuvier,,M.,,," id="n0258.0007.00197.00541" reg="default:Cuvier,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Cuvier</surname></persName> has sensibly changed my position; indeed, I have already been asked to continue his work on fishes in connection with <persName n="Valenciennes,,M.,,," id="n0258.0007.00197.00542" reg="default:Valenciennes,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Valenciennes</surname></persName>, who made me this proposition the day after your letter reached me. The conditions offered me are, indeed, very tempting, <pb id="p.198" n="198"/> but I am too little French by character, and too anxious to live in <placeName key="tgn,7011731" n="1.000 54" reg="switzerland">Switzerland</placeName>, not to prefer the place you can offer me, however small the appointments, if they do but keep me above actual embarrassment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1401"/>I say thus much only in order to answer that clause in your letter where you touch upon this question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1402"/>I would add that I leave the field quite free in this respect, and that I am yours without reserve, if, indeed, within the fortnight, the urgency of the <name>Parisians</name> does not carry the day, or, rather, as soon as I write you that I have been able finally to withdraw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1403"/>You easily understand that I cannot bluntly decline offers which seem to those who make them so brilliant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1404"/>But I shall hold out against them to the utmost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1405"/>My course with reference to my own publications will have shown you that I do not care for a lucrative position from personal interest; that, on the contrary, I should always be ready to use such means as I may have at my disposition for the advancement of the institution confided to my care.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1408"/>But you have shown me so much kindness that I may well leave to your care, in concert with your friends, the decision of this point; the more so since you are willing to take charge of my interests, until you see the success of what you are pleased to look upon as an advantage to your institution, while for me it is the realization of a sincere desire to do what I can for the advancement of science, and the instruction of our youth. . . .</p></body></text> </p>

<p>Ein blaues Meerwunder.</p></note> and I must exert myself to the utmost lest my actual presence should give the lie to fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1428"/>It is all right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1429"/>I shall be the less likely to relax in devotion to my work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1430"/>The real reason of my silence has been that I was unwilling to acknowledge so many evidences of efficient sympathy and friendly encouragement by an empty letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1431"/>I wished especially to share with you the final result of my investigations on the fossil fishes, and for that purpose it was necessary to revise my <pb id="p.203" n="203"/> manuscripts and take an account of my tables in order to condense the whole in a few phrases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1432"/>I have already told you that the investigation of the living fishes had suggested to me a new classification, in which families as at present circumscribed respectively received new, and to my thinking more natural positions, based upon other considerations than those hitherto brought forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1433"/>I did not at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lay any special stress on my classification. . . .My object was only to utilize certain structural characters which frequently recur among fossil forms, and which might therefore enable me to determine remains hitherto considered of little value. . . . Absorbed in the special investigation, I paid no heed to the edifice which was meanwhile unconsciously building itself up. Having however completed the comparison of the fossil species in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, I wanted, for the sake of an easy revision of the same, to make a list according to their succession in geological formations, with a view of determining the characteristics more exactly and bringing them by their enumeration into bolder relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1434"/>What was my joy and surprise to find that the simplest enumeration of the fossil fishes according to their geological succession was also a complete statement <pb id="p.204" n="204"/> of the natural relations of the families among themselves; that <num value="1">one</num> might therefore read the genetic development of the whole class in the history of creation, the representation of the genera and species in the several families being therein determined; in <num value="1">one</num> word, that the genetic succession of the fishes corresponds perfectly with their zoological classification, and with just that classification proposed by me. The question therefore in characterizing formations is no longer that of the numerical preponderance of certain genera and species, but of distinct structural relations, carried through all these formations according to a definite direction, following each other in an appointed order, and recognizable in the organisms as they are brought forth. . . . If my conclusions are not overturned or modified through some later discovery, they will form a new basis for the study of fossils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1435"/>Should you communicate my discovery to others I shall be especially pleased, because it may be long before I can begin to publish it myself, and many may be interested in it. This seems to me the most important of my results, though I have also, partly from perfect specimens, partly from fragments, identified some <num value="500">five hundred</num> extinct species, and <pb id="p.205" n="205"/> more than <num value="50">fifty</num> extinct genera, beside reestablishing <num value="3">three</num> families no longer represented.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1441"/>His opening lecture <q direct="unspecified">Upon the <name>Relations</name> between the different branches of Natural History and the then prevailing tendencies of all the <name>Sciences</name></q> was given on the <dateStruct value="1832-11-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month>, <year>1832</year>,</dateStruct> at the <rs type="place">Hotel</rs> de Ville.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1442"/>Judged by the impression made upon the listeners as recorded at the time, this introductory discourse must have been characterized by the same broad spirit of generalization which marked <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0008.00206.00568" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,M.,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName>'s later teaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1443"/>Facts in his hands fell into their orderly relation as parts of a connected whole, and were never presented <pb id="p.207" n="207"/> merely as special or isolated phenomena.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1444"/>From the beginning his success as an instructor was undoubted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1445"/>He had, indeed, now entered upon the occupation which was to be from youth to old age the delight of his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1446"/>Teaching was a passion with him, and his power over his pupils might be measured by his own enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1447"/>He was intellectually, as well as socially, a democrat, in the best sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1448"/>He delighted to scatter broadcast the highest results of thought and research, and to adapt them even to the youngest and most uninformed minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1449"/>In his later American travels he would talk of glacial phenomena to the driver of a country stage-coach among the mountains, or to some workman, splitting rock at the road-side, with as much earnestness as if he had been discussing problems with a brother geologist; he would take the common fisherman into his scientific confidence, telling him the intimate secrets of fish-structure or fish-embryology, till the man in his turn grew enthusiastic, and began to pour out information from the stores of his own rough and untaught habits of observation.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1451"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7007292" n="1.000 5" reg="neuchatel,neuchatel,schweiz,europe">Neuchatel</placeName> the presence of the young professor was felt at once as a new and stimulating influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1452"/>The little town suddenly became a centre of scientific activity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1453"/>A society for the pursuit of the natural sciences, of which he was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> secretary, sprang into life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1454"/>The scientific collections, which had already attained, under the care of <persName n="Coulon,,M.,Louis,," id="n0258.0008.00208.00570" reg="default:Coulon,M.,Louis,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Coulon</surname></persName>, considerable value, presently assumed the character and proportions of a wellor-dered museum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1456"/>Together they worked in arranging, enlarging, and building up a <orgName n="Natural History Museum" type="museum">museum of natural history</orgName> which soon became known as <num value="1">one</num> of the best local institutions of the kind in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1457"/>Beside his classes at the gymnasium, <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0008.00208.00572" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,M.,Coulon,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> collected about him, by invitation, a small audience of friends and neighbors, to whom he lectured during the winter on botany, on zoology, on the philosophy of nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1458"/>The instruction was of the most familiar and informal character, and was continued in later <pb id="p.209" n="209"/> years for his own children and the children of his friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1459"/>In the latter case the subjects were chiefly geology and geography in connection with botany, and in favorable weather the lessons were usually given in the open air. <num value="1">One</num> can easily imagine what joy it must have been for a party of little playmates, boys and girls, to be taken out for long walks in the country over the hills about <placeName key="tgn,7007292" n="1.000 5" reg="neuchatel,neuchatel,schweiz,europe">Neuchatel</placeName>, and especially to Chaumont, the mountain which rises behind it, and thus to have their lessons, for which the facts and scenes about them furnished subject and illustration, combined with pleasant rambles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1460"/>From some high ground affording a wide panoramic view <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0008.00209.00573" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,M.,Coulon,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> would explain to them the formation of lakes, islands, rivers, springs, water-sheds, hills, and valleys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1461"/>He always insisted that physical geography could be better taught to children in the vicinity of their own homes than by books or maps, or even globes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1462"/>Nor did he think a varied landscape essential to such instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1463"/>Undulations of the ground, some contrast of hill and plain, some sheet of water with the streams that feed it, some ridge of rocky soil acting as a water-shed, may be found everywhere, and the relation of facts shown perhaps as well on a small as on a large scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1464"/><pb id="p.210" n="210"/></p> 
<p>When it was impossible to give the lessons out of doors, the children were gathered around a large table, where each <num value="1">one</num> had before him or her the specimens of the day, sometimes stones and fossils, sometimes flowers, fruits, or dried plants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1465"/>To each child in succession was explained separately what had <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> been told to all collectively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1466"/>When the talk was of tropical or distant countries pains were taken to procure characteristic specimens, and the children were introduced to dates, bananas, cocoa-nuts, and other fruits, not easily to be obtained in those days in a small inland town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1467"/>They, of course, concluded the lesson by eating the specimens, a practical illustration which they greatly enjoyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1468"/>A very large wooden globe, on the surface of which the various features of the earth as they came up for discussion could be shown, served to make them more clear and vivid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1469"/>The children took their own share in the instruction, and were themselves made to point out and describe that which had just been explained to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1470"/>They took home their collections, and as a preparation for the next lesson were often called upon to classify and describe some unusual specimen by their own unaided efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1471"/>There was no tedium in the class.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1473"/>His instructions to his older pupils were based on the same methods, and were no less acceptable to them than to the children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1474"/>In winter his professional courses to the students were chiefly upon zoology and kindred topics; in the summer he taught them botany and geology, availing himself of the fine days for excursions and practical instruction in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/>Since I wrote you, some things have become more clear to me, as, for instance, my purpose of publishing the <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Fishes,,Fossil,,," id="n0258.0008.00220.00615" reg="default:Fishes,Fossil,,,"><foreName>Fossil</foreName> <surname>Fishes</surname></persName></q> here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1689"/></p> 
<p>The most novel results comprised in this work were: <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the remodeling of the classification of the whole type of fishes, fossil and living, and especially the separation of the <name>Ganoids</name> from all other fishes, under the rank of a distinct order; <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, the recognition of those combinations of reptilian and birdlike characters in the earlier geological fishes, which led the author to call them prophetic types; and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, his discovery of an analogy between the embryological phases of the higher present fishes and the gradual introduction of the whole type on earth, the series in growth and the series in time revealing a certain mutual correspondence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1690"/>As these comprehensive laws have thrown light upon other types of the animal kingdom beside that of fishes, their discovery may be said to have advanced general zoology as well as ichthyology.

<p>The Introduction presents, as it were, the prelude to this vast chapter of natural history in the simultaneous appearance of the <num value="4">four</num> great types of the animal kingdom: Radiates, Mollusks, Articulates, and Vertebrates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1692"/>Then comes the orderly development of the class by which the vertebrate plan was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> expressed, namely, the fishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1693"/>Underlying all its divisions and subdivisions, is the average expression of the type in the past and present; the <name>Placoids</name> and Ganoids, with their combination of reptilian and fishlike features, characterizing the earlier geological epochs, while in the later the simple bony fishes, the <name>Cycloids</name> and Ctenoids, take the ascendency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1695"/>No less striking than these general views of structural relations are the clearness and simplicity with which the distribution of the whole class of fishes in relation to the geological formations, or, in other words, to the physical history of the earth, is shown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1697"/>Indeed, his whole future work in ichthyology, and <num value="1">one</num> might almost say in general zoology, was here sketched.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/><num value="1">One</num> should flatter neither the king, nor the people, nor <num value="1">one</num>'s dearest friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>I maintain, therefore, that no <num value="1">one</num> has told you forcibly enough how the very persons who justly admire your work, constantly complain of this fragmentary style of publication, which is the despair of those who have not the leisure to place your scattered sheets where they belong and disentangle the skein.<note anchored="yes">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1858"/>I think you would do well to publish for a while more text than plates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/>You could do <pb id="p.267" n="267"/> this the better because your text is excellent, full of new and important ideas, expressed with admirable clearness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>The charming letter (again without a date) which preceded your package impressed me painfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1861"/>I see you are ill again; you complain of congestion of the head and eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1862"/>For mercy's sake take care of your health which is so dear to us. I am afraid you work too much, and (shall I say it frankly?) that you spread your intellect over too many subjects at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1863"/>I think that you should concentrate your moral and also your pecuniary strength upon this beautiful work on fossil fishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1864"/>In so doing you will render a greater service to positive geology, than by these general considerations (a little icy withal) on the revolutions of the primitive world; considerations which, as you well know, convince only those who give them birth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1865"/>In accepting considerable sums from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, you have, so to speak, contracted obligations to be met only by completing a work which will be at once a monument to your own glory and a landmark in the history of science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1866"/>Admirable and exact as your researches on other fossils are, your contemporaries claim from you the fishes above all. You will say that this is making you the slave <pb id="p.268" n="268"/> of others; perfectly true, but such is the pleasing position of affairs here below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1867"/>Have I not been driven for <measure n="33years" type="date">thirty-three years</measure> to busy myself with that tiresome <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, and am I not, even yet, daily insulted because, after publishing <num value="32">thirty-two</num> volumes of the great edition in folio and in quarto, and <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> plates, <num value="1">one</num> volume of the historical section is wanting?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/>We men of letters are the servants of an arbitrary master, whom we have imprudently chosen, who flatters and pets us <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and then tyrannizes over us if we do not work to his liking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>You see, my dear friend, I play the grumbling old man, and, at the risk of deeply displeasing you, place myself on the side of the despotic public. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1870"/>With reference to the general or periodical lowering of the temperature of the globe, I have never thought it necessary, on account of the elephant of the <rs>Lena</rs>, to admit that sudden frost of which <persName n="Cuvier,,,,," id="n0258.0009.00268.00764" reg="mostcommon:Cuvier,M.,,,:16"><surname>Cuvier</surname></persName> used to speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>What I have seen in <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 5" reg="rossiya">Siberia</placeName>, and what has been observed in <persName n="Beechey,Captain,,,," id="n0258.0009.00268.00765" reg="mostcommon:Beechey,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Beechey</surname></persName>'s expedition on the northwest coast of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, simply proves that there exists a layer of frozen drift, in the fissures of which (even now) the muscular flesh of any animal which should accidentally fall into them would be preserved intact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1872"/><pb id="p.269" n="269"/> It is a slight local phenomenon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1873"/>To me, the ensemble of geological phenomena seems to prove, not the prevalence of this glacial surface on which you would carry along your boulders, but a very high temperature spreading almost to the poles, a temperature favorable to organizations resembling those now living in the tropics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1874"/>Your ice frightens me, and gladly as I would welcome you here, my dear friend, I think, perhaps, for the sake of your health, and also that you may not see this country, always so hideous, under a sheet of snow and ice (in <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>), you would do better to come <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> later, with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> verdure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1875"/>This is suggested by a letter received yesterday by M. d'o&mdash;&mdash;, which alarmed me a little, because the state of your eyes obliged you to write by another hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1876"/>Pray do not think of traveling before you are quite well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1877"/>I close this letter, feeling sure that it does not contain a line which is not an expression of friendship and of the high esteem I bear you. The magnificence of your last numbers, <num value="8">eight</num> and <num value="9">nine</num>, cannot be told.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1878"/>How admirably executed are your Macropoma, the <name>Ophiopris</name> procerus, <persName n="Mantell,,,,," id="n0258.0009.00269.00766" reg="mostcommon:Mantell,nomatch:0"><surname>Mantell</surname></persName>'s great beast, the minute details of the <name>Dercetis</name>, Psammodus, . . . . the skeletons. . . . There is nothing <pb id="p.270" n="270"/> like it in all that we possess upon vertebrates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1879"/>I have also begun to study your text, so rich in well arranged facts; the monograph of the <name>Lepidostei</name>, the passage upon the bony rays, and, dear <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0009.00270.00767" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,M.,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName>, I could hardly believe my eyes, <num value="65">sixty-five</num> continuous pages of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> volume, without interruption!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1880"/>You will spoil the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1882"/>You say your work can go on if you have <num value="200">two hundred</num> subscribers; but if you continue to support <num value="2">two</num> traveling draughtsmen, I predict, as a practical man, that it cannot go on. You cannot even publish what you have gathered in the last <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure>. Consider that in attempting to give a review of all the fossil fishes which now exist in collections, you pursue a phantom which ever flies before you. Such a work would not be finished in less than <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure>, and besides, this <hi rend="italics">now</hi> is an uncertain element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1883"/>Cannot you conquer yourself so far as to finish what you have in your possession at present?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1884"/>Recall your artists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1885"/>With the reputation you enjoy in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, whatever might essentially change your opinion on certain organisms would willingly be sent to you. If you continue to keep <num value="2">two</num> ambassadors in foreign <pb id="p.271" n="271"/> lands, the means you destine for the engraving and printing will soon be absorbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1886"/>You will struggle with domestic difficulties, and at <measure n="60years" type="date">sixty years</measure> of age (tremble at the sight of this number!) you will be as uncertain as you are to-day, whether you possess, even in your collection of drawings, all that is to be found among amateurs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1887"/>How exhaust an ocean in which the species are indefinitely increasing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1888"/>Finish, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, what you have this <dateStruct value="1837-12-"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1837">1837</year></dateStruct>, and then, if the subject does not weary you, publish the supplements in <dateStruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/>New species.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>Only the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> kind of supplement would be really desirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/>Furthermore, you must regain your intellectual independence and not let yourself be scolded any more by <persName n="Humboldt,,M.,,,de" id="n0258.0009.00271.00768" reg="expanded:Humboldt,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Humboldt</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2264"/>In this great semicircular space, inclosed by the <name>Jungfrau</name>, the <name>Monch</name>, and the lesser peaks of this mountain group, lies the <name>Aletsch</name> reservoir of snow or neve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2265"/>As this spot presented a natural pause between the laborious ascent already accomplished and the immense declivities which lay before them yet to be climbed, they named it Le Repos, and halted there for a short rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2266"/>Here they left also every needless incumbrance, taking only a little bread and wine, in case of exhaustion, some meteorological instruments, and the inevitable ladder, axe, and ropes of the <name>Alpine</name> climber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2267"/>On their left, to the west of the amphitheatre, a vast passage opened between the <name>Jungfrau</name> and the <name>Kranzberg</name>, and in this could be distinguished a series of terraces, <num value="1">one</num> above the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2268"/>The story is the usual <num value="1">one</num>, of more or less steep slopes, where they sank in the softer snow or cut their steps in the icy surfaces; of open crevasses, crossed by the ladder, <pb id="p.327" n="327"/> or the more dangerous ones, masked by snow, over which they trod cautiously, tied together by the rope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2269"/>But there was nothing to appall the experienced mountaineer with firm foot and a steady head, until they reached a height where the summit of the <name>Jungfrau</name> detached itself in apparently inaccessible isolation from all beneath or around it. To all but the guides their farther advance seemed blocked by a chaos of precipices, either of snow and ice or of rock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2270"/>Leuthold remained however quietly confident, telling them he clearly saw the course he meant to follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2271"/>It began by an open gulf of unknown depth, though not too wide to be spanned by their ladder <measure n="23feet" type="distance">twenty-three feet</measure> in length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2272"/>On the other side of this crevasse, and immediately above it, rose an abrupt wall of icy snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2273"/>Up this wall Leuthold and another guide led the way, cutting steps as they went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2274"/>When half way up they lowered the rope, holding <num value="1">one</num> end, while their companions fastened the other to the ladder, so that it served them as a kind of hand-rail, by which to follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2275"/>At the top they found themselves on a terrace, beyond which a far more moderate slope led to the <rs>Col</rs> of Roththal, overlooking the <rs type="place">Aletsch valley</rs> on <num value="1">one</num> side, the <name>Roththal</name> on the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2276"/><pb id="p.328" n="328"/> From this point the ascent was more and more steep and very slow, as every step had to be cut. Their difficulties were increased, also, by a mist which gathered around them, and by the intense cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2277"/>Leuthold kept the party near the border of the ridge, because there the ice yielded more readily to the stroke of the axe; but it put their steadiness of nerve to the greatest test, by keeping the precipice constantly in view, except when hidden by the fog.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2281"/>There was still a certain distance to be passed before they actually reached the base of the extreme peak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2282"/>Here they paused, not without a certain hesitation, for though the summit lay but a few feet <pb id="p.329" n="329"/> above them, they were separated from it by a sharp and seemingly inaccessible ridge.

To so steep an apex does this famous peak narrow, that but <num value="1">one</num> person can stand on the summit at a time, nor was even this possible till the snow was beaten down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2285"/>Returning on his steps, Leuthold, whose quiet, unflinching audacity of success was contagious, assisted each <num value="1">one</num> to stand for a few moments where he had stood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2286"/>The fog, the effect of which they had so much feared, now lent something to the beauty of the view from this sublime foothold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2287"/>Masses of vapor rolled up from the <name>Roththal</name> on the southwest, but, instead of advancing to envelop them, paused at a little distance arrested by some current from the plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2288"/>The temperature being below freezing point, the drops of moisture in <pb id="p.330" n="330"/> this wall of vapor were congealed into ice-crystals, which glittered like gold in the sunlight and gave back all the colors of the rainbow.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2290"/>Of living things they saw only a hawk, poised in the air above their heads; of plants, a few lichens, where the surface of the rock was exposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2291"/>It was <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time> in the afternoon before they started on their downward path, turning their faces to the icy slope, and feeling for the steps behind them, some <num value="700">seven hundred</num> in all, which had been cut in ascending.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2292"/>In about an hour they reached the <rs>Col</rs> of the <name>Roththal</name>, where the greatest difficulties of the ascent had begun and the greatest dangers of the descent were over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2293"/>So elated were they by the success of the day, and so regardless of lesser perils after those they had passed through, that they were now inclined to hurry forward incautiously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2425"/>In order to ascertain this, colored liquids were introduced into the glacier by means of boring, and it was found that they threaded their way through the mass of the ice and reappeared at lower points with astonishing rapidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2628"/>Your great work on fossil fishes is now before me, and I also possess the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> number of your monograph upon the fishes of the <rs>Old Red Sandstone</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2629"/>I trust the new numbers will follow the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in rapid succession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2630"/>I love now and then to find a resting-place; and your works always give me <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2631"/>The opinions of <persName n="St. Hilaire,,Geoffroy,,," id="n0258.0013.00383.01119" reg="expanded:St. Hilaire, Hilaire.Geoffroy,,,"><foreName>Geoffroy</foreName> <surname>St. Hilaire</surname></persName> and his dark school seem to be gaining some ground in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2632"/>I <pb id="p.384" n="384"/> detest them, because I think them untrue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2633"/>They shut out all argument from <hi rend="italics">design</hi> and all notion of a Creative <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, and in so doing they appear to me to deprive physiology of its life and strength, and language of its beauty and meaning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2634"/>I am as much offended in taste by the turgid mystical bombast of <persName><foreName>Geoffroy</foreName></persName> as I am disgusted by his cold and irrational materialism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2635"/>When men of his school talk of the elective affinity of organic types, I hear a jargon I cannot comprehend, and I turn from it in disgust; and when they talk of spontaneous generation and transmutation of species, they seem to me to try nature by an hypothesis, and not to try their hypothesis by nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2636"/>Where are their facts on which to form an inductive truth?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2637"/>I deny their starting condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2638"/><q direct="unspecified">Oh! but</q> they reply, <q direct="unspecified">we have progressive development in geology.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2639"/>Now, I allow (as all geologists must do) a <hi rend="italics">kind</hi> of <hi rend="italics">progressive development</hi>. For example, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fish are below the reptiles; and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reptiles older than man. I say, we have successive forms of animal life adapted to successive conditions (so far, proving design), and not derived in natural succession in the ordinary way of generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2640"/>But if no single fact in actual nature allows <pb id="p.385" n="385"/> us to suppose that the new species and orders were produced successively in the natural way, how did they begin?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2641"/>I reply, by a way out of and above common known, material nature, and this way I call <hi rend="italics">creation</hi>. Generation and creation are <num value="2">two</num> distinct ideas, and must be described by <num value="2">two</num> distinct words, unless we wish to introduce utter confusion of thought and language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2642"/>In this view I think you agree with me; for I spoke to you on the subject when we met (alas, <hi rend="italics"><num value="10">ten</num></hi> years since!) at <placeName reg="Dublin, Dublin, Dublin" key="tgn,7001306">Dublin</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2643"/>Would you have the great kindness to give me your most valuable opinion on <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> points?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2644"/>(<num value="1">1</num>.) Is it possible, according to the known laws of actual nature, or is it probable, on any analogies of nature, that the vast series of fish, from those of the <rs type="place">Ludlow rock</rs> and the <rs>Old Red Sandstone</rs> to those of our actual seas, lakes, and rivers, are derived from <num value="1">one</num> common original low type, in the way of development and by propagation or natural breeding?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2645"/>I should say, <hi rend="italics">no</hi>. But my knowledge is feeble and at <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2646"/>Yours is strong and from the fountain-head.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2647"/>(<num value="2">2</num>.) Is the organic type of fish higher now than it was during the carboniferous period, when the <name>Sauroids</name> so much abounded?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2648"/>If <pb id="p.386" n="386"/> the progressive theory of <persName><foreName>Geoffroy</foreName></persName> be true, in his sense, each class of animals ought to be progressive in its organic type.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2649"/>It appears to me that this is not true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2650"/>Pray tell me your own views on this point.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2651"/>(<num value="3">3</num>.) There are <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">odd fish</hi></q> (as we say in jest) in the <rs>Old Red Sandstone</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2652"/>Do these so graduate into crustaceans as to form anything like such an organic link that <num value="1">one</num> could, by generation, come naturally from the other?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2653"/>I should say, <hi rend="italics">no</hi>, being instructed by your labors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2654"/>Again, allowing this, for the sake of argument, are there not much higher types of fish which are contemporaneous with the lower types (if, indeed, they be lower), and do not these nobler fish of the <rs>Old Red Sandstone</rs> stultify the hypothesis of natural generative development?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2655"/>(<num value="4">4</num>.) Will you give me, in a few general words, your views of the scale occupied by the fish of the Old Red, considered as a natural group?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2656"/>Are they so rudimentary as to look like abortions or creatures derived from some inferior class, which have not yet by development reached the higher type of fish?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2657"/>Again, I should say, <hi rend="italics">no;</hi> but I long for an answer from a great authority like yours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2658"/>I am most anxious for a good general conception <pb id="p.387" n="387"/> of the fish of the Old Red, with reference to some intelligible scale.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2659"/>(<num value="5">5</num>.) Lastly, is there the shadow of ground for supposing that by any natural generative development the <name>Ichthyosaurians</name> and other kindred forms of reptile have come from Sauroid, or any other type of fish?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2660"/>I believe you will say, no. At any rate, the facts of geology lend no support to such a view, for the nobler forms of Reptile appear in strata below those in which the <name>Ichthyosaurians</name>, etc., are <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2661"/>But I must not trouble you with more questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2665"/>. . . I reproach myself for not acknowledging at once your most interesting letter of <dateStruct value="-04-10"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="10">10th</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2666"/>But you will easily understand that in the midst of the rush of work consequent upon my preparation for a journey of several years' duration I have not noticed the flight of time since I received it, until to-day, <pb id="p.388" n="388"/> when the sight of the date fills me with confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2667"/>And yet, for years, I have not received a letter which has given me greater pleasure or moved me more deeply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2668"/>I have felt in it and have received from it that vigor of conviction which gives to all you say or write a virile energy, captivating alike to the listener or the reader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2669"/>Like you, I am pained by the progress of certain tendencies in the domain of the natural sciences; it is not only the arid character of this philosophy of nature (and by this I mean, not <hi rend="italics">natural philosophy</hi>, but the <q direct="unspecified">Natur-philosophie</q> of the <name>Germans</name> and <name>French</name>) which alarms me. I dread quite as much the exaggeration of religious fanaticism, borrowing fragments from science, imperfectly or not at all understood, and then making use of them to prescribe to scientific men what they are allowed to see or to find in Nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2670"/>Between these <num value="2">two</num> extremes it is difficult to follow a safe road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2671"/>The reason is, perhaps, that the domain of facts has not yet received a sufficiently general recognition, while traditional beliefs still have too much influence upon the study of the sciences.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2672"/>Wishing to review such ideas as I had formed upon these questions, I gave a public course this winter upon the plan of creation <pb id="p.389" n="389"/> as shown in the development of the animal kingdom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2673"/>I wish I could send it to you, for I think it might please you. Unhappily, I had no time to write it out, and have not even an outline of it. But I intend to work further upon this subject and make a book upon it <num value="1">one</num> of these days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2674"/>If I speak of it to-day it is because in this course I have treated all the questions upon which you ask my opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2675"/>Let me answer them here after a somewhat aphoristic fashion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2676"/>I find it impossible to attribute the biological phenomena, which have been and still are going on upon the surface of our globe, to the simple action of physical forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2677"/>I believe they are due, in their entirety, as well as individually, to the direct intervention of a creative power, acting freely and in an autonomic way. . . . I have tried to make this intentional plan in the organization of the animal kingdom evident, by showing that the differences between animals do not constitute a material chain, analogous to a series of physical phenomena, bound together by the same law, but present themselves rather as the phases of a thought, formulated according to a definite aim. I think we know enough of comparative anatomy to abandon forever the idea of <pb id="p.390" n="390"/> the transformation of the organs of <num value="1">one</num> type into those of another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2678"/>The metamorphoses of certain animals, and especially of insects, so often cited in support of this idea, prove, by the fixity with which they repeat themselves in innumerable species, exactly the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2679"/>In the persistency of these metamorphoses, distinct for each species and known to repeat themselves annually in a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> species, and to have done so ever since the present order of things was established on the earth, have we not the most direct proof that the diversity of types is not due to external natural influences?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2680"/>I have followed this idea in all the types of the animal kingdom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2681"/>I have also tried to show the direct intervention of a creative power in the geographical distribution of organized beings on the surface of the globe when the species are definitely circumscribed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2682"/>As evidence of the fixity of generic types and the existence of a higher and free causal power, I have made use of a method which appears to me new as a process of reasoning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2683"/>The series of reptiles, for instance, in the family of lizards, shows apodal forms, forms with rudimentary feet, then with a successively larger number of fingers until we reach, by seemingly insensible gradations, <pb id="p.391" n="391"/> the genera <rs>Anguis</rs>, Ophisaurus, and Pseudopus, the <name>Chamosauria</name>, Chirotes, Bipes, Sepo, Scincus, and at last the true lizards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2684"/>It would seem to any reasonable man that these types are the transformations of a single primitive type, so closely do the modifications approach each other; and yet I now reject any such supposition, and after having studied the facts most thoroughly, I find in them a direct proof of the creation of all these species.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2685"/>It must not be forgotten that the genus <rs>Anguis</rs> belongs to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, the <name>Ophisaurus</name> to <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName>, the <name>Pseudopus</name> to <placeName key="tgn,7015451" n="1.000 1" reg="dalmacija">Dalmatia</placeName> and the <rs>Caspian</rs> steppe, the <name>Sepo</name> to <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 5" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, etc. Now, I ask how portions of the earth so absolutely distinct could have combined to form a continuous zoological series, now so strikingly distributed, and whether the idea of this development could have started from any other source than a creative purpose manifested in space?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2686"/>These same purposes, this same constancy in the employment of means toward a final end, may be read still more clearly in the study of the fossils of the different creations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2687"/>The species of all the creations are materially and genealogically as distinct from each other as those of the different points on the surface of the globe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2688"/>I have compared hundreds of species <pb id="p.392" n="392"/> reputed identical in various successive deposits,&mdash;species which are always quoted in favor of a transition, however indirect, from <num value="1">one</num> group of species to another,&mdash;and I have always found marked specific differences between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2689"/>In a few weeks I will send you a paper which I have just printed on this subject, where it seems to me this view is very satisfactorily proved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2690"/>The idea of a procreation of new species by preceding ones is a gratuitous supposition opposed to all sound physiological notions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2691"/>And yet it is true that, taken as a whole, there is a gradation in the organized beings of successive geological formations, and that the end and aim of this development is the appearance of man. But this serial connection of all successive creatures is not material; taken singly these groups of species show no relation through intermediate forms genetically derived <num value="1">one</num> from the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2692"/>The connection between them becomes evident only when they are considered as a whole emanating from a creative power, the author of them all. To your special questions I may now very briefly reply.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2693"/>Have fishes descended from a primitive type?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2694"/>So far am I from thinking this possible, that I do not believe there is a single <pb id="p.393" n="393"/> specimen of fossil or living fish, whether marine or fresh-water, that has not been created with reference to a special intention and a definite aim, even though we may be able to detect but a portion of these numerous relations and of the essential purpose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2695"/>Are the present fishes superior to the older ones?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2696"/>As a general proposition, I would say, <hi rend="italics">no;</hi> it seems to me even that the fishes which preceded the appearance of reptiles in the plan of creation were higher in certain characters than those which succeeded them; and it is a strange fact that these ancient fishes have something analogous with reptiles, which had not then made their appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2697"/><num value="1">One</num> would say that they already existed in the creative thought, and that their coming, not far removed, was actually anticipated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2698"/>Can the fishes of the Old Red be considered the embryos of those of later epochs?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2699"/>Of course they are the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> types of the vertebrate series, including the most ancient of the <name>Silurian</name> system; but they each constitute an independent fauna, as numerous in the places where these earlier fishes are found, as the present fishes in any area of similar extent on our sea-shore to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2700"/>I now know <num value="104">one hundred and four</num> species of fossil fish from <pb id="p.394" n="394"/> the Old Red, belonging to <num value="44">forty-four</num> genera, comprised under <num value="7">seven</num> families, between several of which there is but little analogy as to organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2701"/>It is therefore impossible to look upon them as coming from <num value="1">one</num> primitive stock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2702"/>The primitive diversity of these types is quite as remarkable as that of those belonging to later epochs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2703"/>It is nevertheless true that, regarded as part of the general plan of creation, this fauna presents itself as an inferior type of the vertebrate series, connecting itself directly in the creative thought with the realization of later forms, the last of which (and this seems to me to have been the general end of creation) was to place man at the head of organized beings as the key-stone and term of the whole series, the final point in the premeditated intention of the primitive plan which has been carried out progressively in the course of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2704"/>I would even say that I believe the creation of man has closed creation on this earth, and I draw this conclusion from the fact that the human genus is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> cosmopolite type in Nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2705"/><num value="1">One</num> may even affirm that man is clearly announced in the phases of organic development of the animal kingdom as the final term of this series.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2706"/>Lastly: Is there any reason to believe that <pb id="p.395" n="395"/> the <name>Ichthyosaurians</name> are descendants of the <name>Sauroid</name> fishes which preceded the appearance of these reptiles?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2707"/>Not the least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2708"/>I should consider any naturalist who would seriously present the question in this light as incapable of discussing it or judging it. He would place himself outside of the facts and would reason from a basis of his own creating. . .</p></body></text> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3069"/>. . .I have waited to write until I should have some facts sufficiently important to claim your attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3070"/>In truth, the study of the marine animals, which I am, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, able to observe in their natural conditions of existence, has engrossed me almost exclusively since I came to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and only incidentally, as it were, I have turned my attention to paleontology and geology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3071"/>I must, however, except the glacial phenomena, a problem, the solution of which always interests me deeply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3072"/>This great question, far from presenting itself more simply here, is complicated by peculiarities never brought to my notice in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3073"/>Happily for me, <persName n="Desor,Mister,,,," id="n0258.0015.00446.01257" reg="nearbymention:Desor,E.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Desor</surname></persName>, who had been in <placeName key="tgn,7016881" n="1.000 1" reg="scandinavia">Scandinavia</placeName> before joining me here, called my attention <pb id="p.447" n="447"/> at once to certain points of resemblance between the phenomena there and those which I had seen in the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3074"/>Since then, we have made several excursions together, have visited <placeName reg="Niagara, New York, United States" key="tgn,1002718">Niagara</placeName>, and, in short, have tried to collect all the special facts of glacial phenomena in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>. . . . You are, no doubt, aware that the whole rocky surface of the ground here is polished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3075"/>I do not think that anywhere in the world there exist polished and rounded rocks in better preservation or on a larger scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3076"/>Here, as elsewhere, erratic debris are scattered over these surfaces, scratched pebbles impacted in mud, forming unstratified masses mixed with and covered by large erratic boulders, more or less furrowed or scratched, the upper ones being usually angular and without marks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3077"/>The absence of moraines, properly so-called, in a country so little broken, is not surprising; I have, however, seen very distinct ones in some valleys of the <rs type="place">White Mountains</rs> and in <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3078"/>Up to this time there had been nothing very new in the aspect of the phenomena as a whole; but on examining attentively the internal arrangement of all these materials, especially in the neighborhood of the sea, <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.448" n="448"/> soon becomes convinced that the ocean has partially covered and more or less remodeled them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3079"/>In certain places there are patches of stratified sand interposed between masses of glacial drift-deposit; elsewhere, banks of sand and pebbles crown the irregularities of the glacial deposit, or fill in its depressions; in other localities the glacial pebbles may be washed and completely cleared of mud, retaining, however, their markings; or again, these markings may have disappeared, and the material is arranged in lines or ramparts, as it were, of diverse conformation, in which <persName n="Desor,Mister,,,," id="n0258.0015.00448.01258" reg="nearbymention:Desor,E.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Desor</surname></persName> recognized all the modifications of the <q direct="unspecified">oesars</q> of <placeName key="tgn,7016881" n="1.000 1" reg="scandinavia">Scandinavia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3080"/>The disposition of the oesars, as seen here, is evidently due entirely to the action of the waves, and their frequency along the coast is a proof of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3081"/>In a late excursion with <persName n="Davis,Captain,,,," id="n0258.0015.00448.01259" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Charles,Henry,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> on board a government vessel I learned to understand the mode of formation of the submarine dikes bordering the coast at various distances, which would be oesars were they elevated; with the aid of the dredge I satisfied myself of their identity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3082"/>With these facts before me I cannot doubt that the oesars of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> consist essentially of glacial material remodeled by the sea; while <pb id="p.449" n="449"/> farther inland, though here and there reaching the sea-coast, we have unchanged glacial drift deposit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3180"/>Glacial phenomena had, as we have seen, met him at every turn since <pb id="p.464" n="464"/> his arrival in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, but nowhere had he found them in greater distinctness than on the shores of <placeName reg="Lake Superior, Sullivan, New York" key="tgn,2705250">Lake Superior</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3181"/>As the evidence accumulated about him, he became more than ever satisfied that the power which had modeled and grooved the rocks all over the country, and clothed it with a sheet of loose material reaching to the sea, must have been the same which had left like traces in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3182"/>In a continent of wide plains and unbroken surfaces, and, therefore, with few centres of glacial action, the phenomena were more widely and uniformly scattered than in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3183"/>But their special details, down to the closest minutiae, were the same, while their definite circumscription and evenness of distribution forbade the idea of currents or floods as the moving cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3184"/>Here, as elsewhere, <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0016.00464.01322" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,Louis,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> recognized at once the comprehensive scope of the phenomena.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3186"/>He made also a careful survey of the local geology of <placeName reg="Lake Superior, Sullivan, New York" key="tgn,2705250">Lake Superior</placeName>, and especially of the system of dykes, by the action of which <pb id="p.465" n="465"/> he found that its bed had been excavated, and the outline of its shores determined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3187"/>But perhaps the inhabitants of the lake itself occupied him even more than its conformation or its surrounding features.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3188"/>Not only for its own novelty and variety, but for its bearing on the geographical distribution of animals, the fauna of this great sheet of fresh water interested him deeply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3190"/>From this type he had learned more perhaps than from any other, of the relations between the past and the present fishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3191"/>When a student of <measure n="19years" type="date">nineteen years</measure> of age, his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sight of a stuffed skin of a gar-pike in the <name>Museum</name> of <placeName key="tgn,7004424" n="1.000 10" reg="Karlsruhe,Karlsruhe,Baden-Wurttemberg,Deutschland,Europe">Carlsruhe</placeName> told him that it stood alone among living fishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3192"/>Its true alliance with the <name>Lepidosteus</name> of the early geological ages became clear to him only later in his study of the fossil fishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3193"/>He then detected the reptilian character of the type, and saw that from the articulation of the vertebrae the head must have moved more freely on the trunk than that of any fish of our days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3194"/>To his great delight, when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> living specimen of the gar-pike, or modern Lepidosteus, <pb id="p.466" n="466"/> was brought to him, it moved its head to the right and left and upward, as a Saurian does and as no other fish can.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3239"/>With his article I send you <num value="1">one</num> of my own, written about <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> ago for the same periodical, as the subject is <num value="1">one</num> in which, from its connection with your master study,&mdash;the natural history of fishes,&mdash;you may take more interest than most men. It embodies, from observation, what may be regarded as <hi rend="italics">the natural history of the fisherman</hi>, and describes some curious scenes and appearances which I witnessed many years ago when engaged, during a truant boyhood, in prosecuting the herring fishery as an amateur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3240"/>Many of my observations of natural phenomena date from this idle, and yet not wholly wasted, period of my life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3241"/>With the volumes I send also a few casts of my less fragile specimens of Asterolepis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3242"/><num value="2">Two</num> of the number, those of the external and internal surfaces of the creature's cranial buckler, <pb id="p.474" n="474"/> are really very curious combinations of plates, and when viewed in a slant light have a decidedly sculpturesque and not ungraceful effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3243"/>I have seen on our rustic tombstones worse representations of angels, winged and robed, than that formed by the central plates of the interior surface when the light is made to fall along their higher protuberances, leaving the hollows in the shade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3244"/>You see how truly your prediction regarding the flatness of the creature's head is substantiated by these casts; it is really not easy to know how, placed on so flat a surface, the eyes could have been very available save for star-gazing; but as nature makes no mistakes in such matters, it is possible that the creature, like the flatfishes, may have lived much at the bottom, and that most of the seeing it had use for may have been seeing in an upward direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3245"/>None of my other specimens of bucklers are so entire and in so good a state of keeping as the <num value="2">two</num> from which I have taken the casts, but they are greatly larger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3246"/><num value="1">One</num> specimen, nearly complete, exhibits an area about <num value="4">four</num> times as great as the largest of these <num value="2">two</num>, and I have fragments of others which must have belonged to fish still more gigantic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3247"/>The <num value="2">two</num> other casts are of specimens of gill covers, <pb id="p.475" n="475"/> which in the <name>Asterolepis</name>, as in the sturgeon, consisted each of a single plate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3248"/>In both the exterior surface of the buckler and of the operculum the tubercles are a good deal enveloped in the stone, which is of a consistency too hard to be removed without injuring what it overlies; but you will find them in the smaller cast which accompanies the others, and which, as shown by the thickness of the plate in the original, indicates their size and form in a large individual, very characteristically shown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3249"/>So coral-like is their aspect, that if it was from such a cast, not a fossil (which would, of course, exhibit the peculiarities of the bone), that Lamarck founded his genus Monticularia, I think his apology for the error might almost be maintained as good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3250"/>I am sorry I cannot venture on taking casts from some of my other specimens; but they are exceedingly fragile, and as they are still without duplicates I am afraid to hazard them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3251"/>Since publishing my little volume I have got several new plates of Asterolepis,&mdash;a broad palatal plate, covered with tubercles, considerably larger than those of the creature's external surface,&mdash;a key-stone shaped plate, placed, when <hi rend="italics">in situ</hi>, in advance of the little plate between the eyes, which form the head <pb id="p.476" n="476"/> and face of the effigy in the centre of the buckler,&mdash;and a side-plate, into which the condyloid processes of the lower jaw were articulated, and which exhibited the processes on which these hinged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3252"/>There are besides some <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> plates more, whose places I have still to find.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3253"/>The small cast, stained yellow, is taken from an instructive specimen of the jaws of coccosteus, and exhibits a peculiarity which I had long suspected and referred to in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> edition of my volume on the <rs>Old Red Sandstone</rs> in rather incautious language, but which a set of my specimens now fully establishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3254"/>Each of the under jaws of the fish was furnished with <num value="2">two</num> groups of teeth: <num value="1">one</num> group in the place where, in quadrupeds, we usually find the molars; and another group in the line of the symphyses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3255"/>And how these both could have acted is a problem which our anatomists here&mdash;many of whom have carefully examined my specimen &mdash;seem unable, and in some degree, indeed, afraid to solve.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3279"/>It is extremely important to ascertain what they are and how formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3280"/><num value="1">One</num> account treats them as growing corals, another as masses of something resembling oolite, piled together, barrier-wise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3281"/>You see that this lies at the root of the progress of the reef, so important to <pb id="p.481" n="481"/> navigation, of the use to be made of it in placing our signals, of the use as a foundation for light-houses, and of many other questions practically important and of high scientific interest.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3326"/>. . . What a time has passed since my last letter!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3327"/>Had you not been constantly in my thoughts, and your counsels always before me as my guide, I should reproach myself for my silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3328"/>I hope my <num value="2">two</num> papers on the medusae, forwarded this year, have reached you, and also <num value="1">one</num> upon the classification of insects, as based upon their development.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3329"/>I have devoted myself especially to the organization of the invertebrate animals, and to the facts bearing upon the perfecting of their classification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3330"/>I have succeeded in tracing the same identity of structure between the <num value="3">three</num> classes of radiates, and also between those of mollusks, as has already been recognized in the vertebrates, and partially in the articulates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3331"/>It is truly a pleasure for me now to be able to demonstrate in my lectures the insensible gradations existing between polyps, medusae, and echinoderms, and to designate by the same name organs seemingly so different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3332"/>Especially has the minute examination of the thickness of the test in echinoderms revealed <pb id="p.489" n="489"/> to me unexpected relations between the sea-urchin and the medusa.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3333"/>No <num value="1">one</num> suspects, I fancy, at this moment, that the solid envelope of the <name>Scutellae</name> and the <name>Clypeasters</name> is traversed by a net-work of radiating tubes, corresponding to those of the medusae, so well presented by <persName n="Ehrenberg,,,,," id="n0258.0017.00489.01385" reg="mostcommon:Ehrenberg,nomatch:0"><surname>Ehrenberg</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="Aurelia, Ward, North Dakota" key="tgn,7020581">Aurelia</placeName> aurita.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3334"/>If the <name>Berlin</name> zoologists will take the trouble to file off the surface of the test of an Echinarachnius parma, they will find a circular canal as large and as continuous as that of the medusae.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3335"/>The aquiferous tubes specified above open into this canal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3336"/>But the same thing may be found under various modifications in other genera of the family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3337"/>Since I have succeeded in injecting colored liquid into the beroids, for instance, and keeping them alive with it circulating in their transparent mass, I am able to show the identity of their zones of locomotive fringes (combs), from which they take their name of Ctenophorae, with the ambulacral (locomotive) apparatus of the echinoderms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3338"/>Furnished with these facts, it is not difficult to recognize true beroidal forms in the embryos of sea-urchins and star-fishes, published by <persName n="Muller,,,,," id="n0258.0017.00489.01386" reg="mostcommon:Muller,Johannes,,,:2"><surname>Muller</surname></persName> in his beautiful plates, and thus to trace the medusoid origin of the echinoderms, as the polypoid origin of the <pb id="p.490" n="490"/> medusae has already been recognized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3339"/>I do not here allude to their primitive origin, but simply to the general fact that among radiates the embryos of the higher classes represent, in miniature, types of the lower classes, as, for instance, those of the echinoderms resemble the medusae, those of the medusa the polyps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3340"/>Having passed the greater part of last winter in <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, where I was especially occupied in studying the coral reefs, I had the best opportunity in the world for prosecuting my embryological researches upon the stony corals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3341"/>I detected relations among them which now enable me to determine the classification of these animals according to their mode of development with greater completeness than ever before, and even to assign a superior or inferior rank to their different types, agreeing with their geological succession, as I have already done for the fishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3342"/>I am on the road to the same results for the mollusks and the articulates, and can even now say in general terms, that the most ancient representatives of all the families belonging to these great groups, strikingly recall the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> phases in the embryonic development of their successors in more recent formations, and even that the embryos of comparatively recent <pb id="p.491" n="491"/> families recall families belonging to ancient epochs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3343"/>You will find some allusion to these results in my Lectures on Embryology, given in my <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Lake Superior, Sullivan, New York" key="tgn,2705250">Lake Superior</placeName>,</q> of which I have twice sent you a copy, that it might reach you the more surely; but these <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impressions have assumed greater coherence now, and I constantly find myself recurring to my fossils for light upon the embryonic forms I am studying and <hi rend="italics">vice versa</hi>, consulting my embryological drawings in order to decipher the fossils with greater certainty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3344"/>The proximity of the sea and the ease with which I can visit any part of the coast within a range of some <num value="20">twenty</num> degrees give me inexhaustible resources for the whole year, which, as time goes on, I turn more and more to the best account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3345"/>On the other hand, the abundance and admirable state of preservation of the fossils found in our ancient deposits, as well as the regular succession of the beds containing them, contribute admirable material for this kind of comparative study. . .</p></body></text> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3347"/>While more fatiguing than class-room work, these scattered lectures had a less educational value, though, on the other hand, they awakened a very wide-spread interest in the study of nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3348"/>The strain of constant traveling for this purpose, the more harassing because so unfavorable to his habits of continuous work, had already told severely upon his health; and from this point of view also the new professorship was attractive, as promising a more quiet, though no less occupied, life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3349"/>The lectures were to be given during the <num value="3">three</num> winter months, thus occupying the interval between his <rs type="season">autumn</rs> and <rs type="season">spring</rs> courses at <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3352"/>His studies here were of the greater interest to him because they connected themselves with his previous researches, not only upon the fishes, but also upon the lower marine animals of the coast of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> and of the <rs>Florida</rs> reefs; so that he had now a basis for comparison of the fauna scattered along the whole <placeName reg="Atlantic coast">Atlantic coast</placeName> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3381"/>. . . I am again working at the human races, and have opened another line of investigation in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3382"/>The method followed by former investigators does not seem to me to have been altogether the best, since there is so little agreement between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3383"/>The difficulty has, no doubt, arisen on <num value="1">one</num> side from the circumstance that the inquirer sought for evidence of the unity of all races, expecting the result to agree with the prevailing interpretation of Genesis; and on the other from too zoological a point of view in weighing the differences observed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3384"/>Again, both have almost set aside all evidence not directly derived from the examination of the <pb id="p.499" n="499"/> races themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3385"/>It has occurred to me that as a preliminary inquiry we ought to consider the propriety of applying to man the same rules as to animals, examining the limits within which they obtain, and paying due attention to all circumstances bearing upon the differences observed among men, from whatever quarter in the study of nature they may be gathered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3386"/>What do the monkeys say to this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3387"/>or, rather, what have they to tell in reference to it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3388"/>There are among them as great, and, indeed, even greater, differences than among men, for they are acknowledged to constitute different genera, and are referred to many, indeed to more than a <num value="100">hundred</num>, species; but they are the nearest approach to the human family, and we may at least derive some hints from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3389"/>How much mixture there is among these species, if any, is not at all ascertained; indeed, we have not the least information respecting their intercourse; but <num value="1">one</num> point is certain,&mdash;zoologists agree as little among themselves respecting the limits of these species as they do respecting the affinities of the races of men. What some consider as distinct species, others consider as mere varieties, and these varieties or species differ in particulars neither more constant nor more <pb id="p.500" n="500"/> important than those which distinguish the human races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3390"/>The fact that they are arranged in different genera, species, and varieties does not lessen the value of the comparison; for the point in question is just to know whether nations, races, and what have also been called families of men, such as the <name>Indo</name>-Germanic, the <name>Semitic</name>, etc., do not in reality correspond to the families, genera, and species of monkeys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3391"/>Now the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> great subdivisions among the true monkeys (excluding Makis and Arctopitheci) are founded upon the form of the nose, those of the new world having a broad partition between the nostrils, while those of the old world have it narrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3392"/>How curious that this fact, which has been known to naturalists for half a century, as presenting a leading feature among monkeys, should have been overlooked in man, when, in reality, the negroes and Australians differ in precisely the same manner from the other races; they having a broad partition, and nostrils opening sideways, like the monkeys of <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName>, while the other types of the human family have a narrow partition and nostrils opening downward, like the monkeys of <placeName reg="Asia" key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Africa" key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3393"/>Again, the minor differences, such as the obliquity of the anterior <pb id="p.501" n="501"/> teeth, the thickness of the lips, the projection of the cheek-bones, the position of the eyes, the characteristic hair, or wool, afford as constant differences as those by which the chimpanzees, orangs, and gibbons are separated into distinct genera; and their respective species differ no more than do the <name>Greeks</name>, Germans, and Arabs,&mdash;or the <name>Chinese</name>, Tartars, and Finns,&mdash;or the New Zealanders and Malays, which are respectively referred to the same race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3394"/>The truth is, that the different <hi rend="italics">species</hi> admitted by some among the orangs are in reality <hi rend="italics">races</hi> among monkeys, or else the races among men are nothing more than what are called species among certain monkeys. . . . Listen for a moment to the following facts, and when you read this place a map of the world before you.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3396"/>Why, then, should not the primitive theatre of a nation of men have been circumscribed within similar boundaries, and from the beginning have been as independent as the chimpanzee of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 7" reg="africa">Guinea</placeName>, or the orangs of <placeName reg="Borneo" key="tgn,7015963">Borneo</placeName> and <placeName reg="Sumatera" key="tgn,7016484">Sumatra</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3397"/>Of course, the superior powers of man have enabled him to undertake migrations, but how limited are these, and how slight the traces they have left behind them. . . . Unfortunately for natural history, history so-called has recorded more faithfully the doings of handfuls of adventurers than the real history of the primitive nations with whom the migrating tribes came into contact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3398"/>But I hope it will yet be possible <pb id="p.503" n="503"/> to dive under these waves of migration, to remove, as it were, the trace of their passage, and to read the true history of the past inhabitants of the different parts of the world, when it will be found, if all analogies are not deceptive, that every country equaling in extent those within the limits of which distinct nationalities are known to have played their part in history, has had its distinct aborigines, the character of which it is now the duty of naturalists to restore, if it be not too late, in the same manner as paleontologists restore fossil remains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3399"/>I have already made some attempts, by studying ancient geography, and I hope the task may yet be accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3400"/>Look, for instance, at <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 4" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3401"/>The <rs>Iberians</rs> are known as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> inhabitants, never extending much beyond the <placeName reg="Pyrenees" key="tgn,7016876">Pyrenees</placeName> to the <rs>Garonne</rs>, and along the gulfs of <persName n="Lyons,,,,," id="n0258.0017.00503.01406" reg="mostcommon:Lyons,nomatch:0"><surname>Lyons</surname></persName> and <placeName key="tgn,7008546" n="1.000 5" reg="genova,genova,liguria,italia,europe">Genoa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3402"/>As early as during the period of Phoenician prosperity they raised wool from their native sheep, derived from the <name>Mouflon</name>, still found wild in <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, <placeName reg="Corsica" key="tgn,7001093">Corsica</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Sardegna" key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>; they had a peculiar breed of horses, to this day differing from all other horses in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3403"/>Is this not better evidence of their independent origin, than is the fancied lineage with the <name>Indo</name>-Germanic family of their <pb id="p.504" n="504"/> <placeName reg="Oriental, Okfuskee, Oklahoma" key="tgn,2560760">Oriental</placeName> descent?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3404"/>For we must not forget, in connection with this, that the <name>Basque</name> language was once the language of all <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 4" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, that which the <name>Iberian</name> spoke, and which has no direct relation to Sanskrit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3405"/>I have alluded but slightly to the negro race, and not at all to the <name>Indians</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3406"/>I would only add with reference to these that I begin to perceive the possibility of distinguishing different centres of growth in these <num value="2">two</num> continents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3407"/>If we leave out of consideration fancied migrations, what connection can be traced, for instance, between the <name>Eskimos</name>, along the whole northern districts of this continent, and the <name>Indians</name> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, those of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, those of <placeName reg="Peru, Berkshire, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050386">Peru</placeName>, and those of <placeName key="tgn,1000047;tgn,2031163" n="0.012 000000.7068	placename;tgn,1000047;brasil,South America;0.007 000000.3968	placename;tgn,2031163;brazil, clay, indiana,Clay,Indiana,United States,North and Central America" reg="brasil,South America;brazil, clay, indiana,Clay,Indiana,United States,North and Central America">Brazil</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3408"/>Is there any real connection between the coast tribes of the northwest coast, the mound builders, the <rs>Aztec</rs> civilization, the <name>Inca</name>, and the <name>Gueranis</name>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3409"/>It seems to me no more than between the <rs>Assyrian</rs> and <rs>Egyptian</rs> civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3410"/>And as to negroes, there is, perhaps, a still greater difference between those of <placeName key="tgn,1129270;tgn,1000189" n="0.012 000000.2480	placename;tgn,1129270;Senegal,Africa,Africa;0.012 000000.2480	placename;tgn,1000189;Senegal,Africa,Africa" reg="Senegal,Africa,Africa;Senegal,Africa,Africa">Senegal</placeName>, of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 7" reg="africa">Guinea</placeName>, and the <name>Caffres</name> and Hottentots, when compared with the <name>Gallahs</name> and Mandingoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3432"/>But the cost of keeping them was counted by <num value="1000">thousands</num>, not by hundreds, and the greater part of what <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0018.00508.01420" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,L.,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> could make by his lectures outside of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> was swallowed up in this way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3444"/>. . . It seems, indeed, to me as if in the study of the geographical distribution of animals the present condition of the animal kingdom was too exclusively taken into consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3445"/><pb id="p.510" n="510"/> Whenever it can be done, and I hope before long it may be done for all classes, it will be desirable to take into account the relations of the living to the fossil species.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3446"/>Since you are as fully satisfied as I am that the location of animals, with all their peculiarities, is not the result of physical influences, but lies within the plans and intentions of the <name>Creator</name>, it must be obvious that the successive introduction of all the diversity of forms which have existed from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> appearance of any given division of the animal kingdom up to the present creation, must have reference to the location of those now in existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3447"/>For instance, if it be true among mammalia that the highest types, such as quadrumana, are essentially tropical, may it not be that the prevailing distribution of the inferior pachyderms within the same geographical limits is owing to the circumstance that their type was introduced upon earth during a warmer period in the history of our globe, and that their present location is in accordance with that fact, rather than related to their degree of organization?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3448"/>The pentacrinites, the lowest of the echinoderms, have only <num value="1">one</num> living representative in tropical America, where we find at the same time the highest and largest <pb id="p.511" n="511"/> spatangi and holothuridae.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3449"/>Is this not quite a parallel case with the monkeys and pachyderms?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3450"/>for once crinoids were the only representatives of the class of echinoderms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3451"/>May we not say the same of crocodiles when compared with the ancient gigantic saurians?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3452"/>or are the crocodiles, as an order, distinct from the other saurians, and really higher than the turtles?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3453"/>Innumerable questions of this kind, of great importance for zoology, are suggested at every step, as soon as we compare the present distribution of animals with that of the inhabitants of former geological periods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3454"/>Among crustacea, it is very remarkable that trilobites and limulus-like forms are the only representatives of the class during the paleozoic ages; that macrourans prevailed in the same manner during the secondary period; and that brachyurans make their appearance only in the tertiary period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3455"/>Do you discover in your results any connection between such facts and the present distribution of crustacea?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3456"/>There is certainly <num value="1">one</num> feature in their classification which must appear very striking,&mdash;that, taken on a large scale, the organic rank of these animals agrees in the main with their order of succession in geological times; and this fact is of no small <pb id="p.512" n="512"/> importance when it is found that the same correspondence between rank and succession obtains through all classes of the animal kingdom, and that similar features are displayed in the embryonic growth of all types so far as now known.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3475"/>It concerns a decision of vital importance to my whole life, and in such a case <num value="1">one</num> must not decide hastily, nor even with too exclusive regard for <num value="1">one</num>'s own preference in the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3476"/>You cannot doubt that the thought of joining an institution of my native country, and thus helping to stimulate scientific progress in the land of my birth, my home, and my early friends, appeals to all I hold dear and honorable in life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3477"/>On the other side I have now been <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> in <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>, have learned to understand the advantages of my position here, and have begun undertakings <pb id="p.515" n="515"/> which are not yet brought to a conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3478"/>I am aware also how wide an influence I already exert upon this land of the future, &mdash;an influence which gains in extent and intensity with every year,&mdash;so that it becomes very difficult for me to discern clearly where I can be most useful to science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3479"/>Among my privileges I must not overlook that of passing much of my time on the immediate sea-shore, where the resources for the zoologist and embryologist are inexhaustible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3480"/>I have now a house distant only a few steps from an admirable locality for these studies, and can therefore pursue them uninterruptedly throughout the whole year, instead of being limited, like most naturalists, to the short summer vacations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3481"/>It is true I miss the larger museums, libraries, etc., as well as the stimulus to be derived from association with a number of likeminded co-workers, all striving toward the same end.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3484"/>Museums also are already founded; . . . and beside these there are a number of private collections in single departments of zoology. . . . Better than all this, however, is the lively and general interest taken in the exploration of the country itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3509"/>For this purpose I will for the present limit myself to the fresh-water fishes and shells, and for the sake of comparison I will try to collect carefully all the species living in the rivers of <placeName reg="Connecticut" key="tgn,7007159">Connecticut</placeName>, New York, and <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName>, and <pb id="p.520" n="520"/> see whether they are identical with those of the island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3514"/>The question at once arises, do our smaller rivers present similar differences?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3515"/>I have already taken steps to obtain complete collections of fishes, shells, and crayfishes from various stations on the <rs>Connecticut</rs> and the <rs>Hudson</rs>, and their tributaries; and I should be very happy if I could include the <rs>Susquehanna</rs>, Delaware, and <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> in my comparisons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3516"/>My object in writing now is to inquire whether you could assist me in making separate collections, as complete as possible, of all these animals from the <name>north</name> and <name>west</name> branches of the <rs>Susquehanna</rs>, from the main river either at <placeName reg="Harrisburg, Dauphin, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013694">Harrisburg</placeName> or <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName>, and from the <rs>Juniata</rs>, also from the <rs>Schuylkill</rs>, <orgName type="university" n="Lehigh university">Lehigh</orgName>, and <placeName reg="Delaware" key="tgn,7007239">Delaware</placeName>, and from the <rs>Alleghany</rs> and <rs>Monongahela</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3519"/>I would, of course, gladly repay all their expenses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3520"/>The subject seems to me so important as to justify any effort in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3521"/>Little may be added to the knowledge of the fishes themselves, for I suppose most of the species have been described either by <persName n="De Kay,,,,," id="n0258.0018.00522.01437" reg="mostcommon:De Kay,nomatch:0"><surname>De Kay</surname></persName>, <placeName key="tgn,2080244" n="1.000 6" reg="kirtland, lake, ohio">Kirtland</placeName>, or <persName n="Storer,,,,," id="n0258.0018.00522.01438" reg="mostcommon:Storer,nomatch:0"><surname>Storer</surname></persName>; but a careful study of their special geographical distribution may furnish results as important to zoology as the knowledge of the species themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3527"/>Though very simple, it was on a liberal scale with respect to space; partly in order to accommodate his library, consisting of several <num value="1000">thousand</num> volumes, now for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time collected and arranged in <num value="1">one</num> room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3528"/>He became very fond of this <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> home, where, with few absences, he spent the remainder of his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3529"/>The architect, <persName n="Greenough,Mister,Henry,,," id="n0258.0018.00523.01443" reg="default:Greenough,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Greenough</surname></persName>, was his <pb id="p.524" n="524"/> personal friend, and from the beginning the house adapted itself with a kindly readiness to whatever plans developed under its roof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3530"/>As will be seen, these were not few, and were sometimes of considerable moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3531"/>For his work also the house was extremely convenient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3532"/>His habits in this respect were, however, singularly independent of place and circumstance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3533"/>Unlike most studious men, he had no fixed spot in the house for writing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3534"/>Although the library, with the usual outfit of well-filled shelves, maps, large tables, etc., held his materials, he brought what he needed for the evening by preference to the drawing-room, and there, with his paper on his knee, and his books for reference on a chair beside him, he wrote and read as busily as if he were quite alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3535"/>Sometimes when dancing and music were going on among the young people of the family and their guests, he drew a little table into the corner of the room, and continued his occupations as undisturbed and engrossed as if he had been in complete solitude,&mdash;only looking up from time to time with a pleased smile or an apt remark,which showed that he did not lose but rather enjoyed what was going on about him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3536"/>His children's friends were his friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3537"/>As <pb id="p.525" n="525"/> his daughters grew up, he had the habit of inviting their more intimate companions to his library for an afternoon weekly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3538"/>On these occasions there was always some subject connected with the study of nature under discussion, but the talk was so easy and so fully illustrated that it did not seem like a lesson.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3539"/>It is pleasant to remember that in later years <persName n="Emerson,Mister,Ralph,Waldo,," id="n0258.0018.00525.01444" reg="default:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Ralph</foreName> <foreName>Waldo</foreName> <surname>Emerson</surname></persName> revived this custom for his own daughters; and their friends (being, indeed, with few changes, the same set of young people as had formerly met in <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0018.00525.01445" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,L.,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName>'s library) used to meet in <persName n="Emerson,Mister,,,," id="n0258.0018.00525.01446" reg="nearbymention:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Emerson</surname></persName>'s study at <placeName reg="Concord, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1123016">Concord</placeName> for a similar object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3540"/>He talked to them of poetry and literature and philosophy as <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0018.00525.01447" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,L.,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> had talked to them of nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3541"/>Those were golden days, not to be forgotten by any who shared their happy privilege.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3542"/>In the winter of <dateStruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></dateStruct> <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0018.00525.01448" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,L.,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> endeavored to resume his public lectures as a means of increasing his resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3543"/>He was again, however, much exhausted when spring came, and it seemed necessary to seek some other means of support, for without considering scientific expenses, his salary of <measure n="1500dollars" type="currency">fifteen hundred dollars</measure> did not suffice for the maintenance of his family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3544"/>Under these circumstances it occurred <pb id="p.526" n="526"/> to his wife and his <num value="2">two</num> older children, now of an age to assist her in such a scheme, that a school for young ladies might be established in the upper part of the new and larger house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3545"/>By the removal of <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> partitions, ample room could be obtained for the accommodation of a sufficient number of pupils, and if successful such a school would perhaps make good in a pecuniary sense the lecturing tours which were not only a great fatigue to <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0018.00526.01449" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,L.,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName>, but an interruption also to all consecutive scientific work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3546"/>In consultation with friends these plans were partly matured before they were confided to <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0018.00526.01450" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,L.,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3547"/>When the domestic conspirators revealed their plot, his surprise and pleasure knew no bounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3548"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> idea had been simply to establish a private school on the usual plan, only referring to his greater experience for advice and direction in its general organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3549"/>But he claimed at once an active share in the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3550"/>Under his inspiring influence the outline enlarged, and when the circular announcing the school was issued, it appeared under his name, and contained these words in addition to the programme of studies: <q direct="unspecified">I shall myself superintend the methods of instruction and tuition, and while maintaining that regularity <pb id="p.527" n="527"/> and precision in the studies so important to mental training shall endeavor to prevent the necessary discipline from falling into a lifeless routine, alike deadening to the spirit of teacher and pupil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3551"/>It is farther my intention to take the immediate charge of the instruction in Physical Geography, Natural History, and Botany, giving a lecture daily, <date value="--6">Saturdays</date> excepted, on <num value="1">one</num> or other of these subjects, illustrated by specimens, models, maps, and drawings.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3552"/></p> 
<p>In order not to interrupt the course of the narrative, the history of this undertaking in its sequence and general bearing on his life and work may be completed here in a few words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3553"/>This school secured to him many happy and comparatively tranquil years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3554"/>It enabled him to meet both domestic and scientific expenses, and to pay the heavy debt he had brought from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> as the penalty of his <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Fishes,,Fossil,,," id="n0258.0018.00527.01451" reg="default:Fishes,Fossil,,,"><foreName>Fossil</foreName> <surname>Fishes</surname></persName></q> and his investigations on the glaciers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3555"/>When the school closed after <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> he was again a free man. With an increased salary from the college, and with such provision for the <name>Museum</name> (thanks to the generosity of the <rs>State</rs> and of individuals) as rendered it in a great degree independent, he was never again involved in the pecuniary <pb id="p.528" n="528"/> anxieties of his earlier career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3556"/>The occupation of teaching was so congenial to him that his part in the instruction of the school did not at any time weigh heavily upon him. He never had an audience more responsive and more eager to learn than the <num value="60">sixty</num> or <num value="70">seventy</num> girls who gathered every day at the close of the morning to hear his daily lecture; nor did he ever give to any audience lectures more carefully prepared, more comprehensive in their range of subjects, more lofty in their tone of thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3557"/>As a teacher he always discriminated between the special student, and the <num value="1">one</num> to whom he cared to impart only such a knowledge of the facts of nature, as would make the world at least partially intelligible to him. To a school of young girls he did not think of teaching technical science, and yet the subjects of his lectures comprised very abstruse and comprehensive questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3558"/>It was the simplicity and clearness of his method which made them so interesting to his young listeners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3559"/><q direct="unspecified">What I wish for you,</q> he would say, <q direct="unspecified">is a culture that is alive, active, susceptible of farther development.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3560"/>Do not think that I care to teach you this or the other special science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3561"/>My instruction is only intended to show you the thoughts in nature which <pb id="p.529" n="529"/> science reveals, and the facts I give you are useful only, or chiefly, for this object.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3562"/></p> 
<p>Running over the titles of his courses during several consecutive years of this school instruction they read: Physical Geography and Paleontology; Zoology; Botany; <persName n="Reefs,,Coral,,," id="n0258.0018.00529.01452" reg="default:Reefs,Coral,,,"><foreName>Coral</foreName> <surname>Reefs</surname></persName>; Glaciers; Structure and Formation of Mountains; Geographical Distribution of Animals; Geological Succession of Animals; Growth and Development of Animals; Philosophy of Nature, etc. With the help of drawings, maps, bas-reliefs, specimens, and countless illustrations on the blackboard, these subjects were made clear to the pupils, and the lecture hour was anticipated as the brightest of the whole morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3563"/>It soon became a habit with friends and neighbors, and especially with the mothers of the scholars, to drop in for the lectures, and thus the school audience was increased by a small circle of older listeners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3564"/>The corps of teachers was also gradually enlarged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3565"/>The neighborhood of the university was a great advantage in this respect, and <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0018.00529.01453" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,L.,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> had the cooperation not only of his brother-in-law, <persName n="Felton,Professor,,,," id="n0258.0018.00529.01454" reg="mostcommon:Felton,C.,C.,,:2"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Felton</surname></persName>, but of others among his colleagues, who took classes in special departments, or gave lectures in history and literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3566"/><pb id="p.530" n="530"/></p> 
<p>This school opened in <dateStruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></dateStruct> and closed in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3567"/>The civil war then engrossed all thoughts, and interfered somewhat also with the success of private undertakings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3568"/>Partly on this account, partly also because it had ceased to be a pecuniary necessity, it seemed wise to give up the school at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3569"/>The friendly relations formed there did not, however, cease with it. For years afterward on the last <rs>Thursday</rs> of <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> (the day of the annual closing of the school) a meeting of the old pupils was held at the <name>Museum</name>, which did not exist when the school began, but was fully established before its close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3570"/>There <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0018.00530.01455" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,L.,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> showed them the progress of his scientific work, told them of his future plans for the institution, and closed with a lecture such as he used to give them in their school-days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3571"/>The last of these meetings took place in <dateStruct value="1873--"><year reg="1873">1873</year></dateStruct>, the last year of his own life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3572"/>The memory of it is connected with a gift to the <name>Museum</name> of <measure n="4050dollars" type="currency">four thousand and fifty dollars</measure> from a number of the scholars, now no longer girls, but women with their own cares and responsibilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3573"/>Hearing that there was especial need of means for the care of the more recent collections, they had subscribed this sum among themselves to express their affection for their <pb id="p.531" n="531"/> old teacher, as well as their interest in his work, and in the institution he had founded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3574"/>His letter of acknowledgment to the <num value="1">one</num> among them who had acted as their treasurer makes a fitting close to this chapter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3587"/>This was the prospectus for his <q direct="unspecified">Contributions to the <rs>Natural History</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3588"/>It was originally planned in <num value="10">ten</num> volumes, every volume to be, however, absolutely independent, so that the completeness of each part should not be impaired by any possible interruption of the sequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3589"/>The mass of original material accumulated upon his hands ever since his arrival in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> made such a publication almost imperative, but the costliness of a large illustrated work <pb id="p.534" n="534"/> deterred him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3592"/>The result far exceeded the most sanguine expectations of those interested in its success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3593"/>Indeed, considering the purely scientific character of the work, the number of subscribers for it was extraordinary, and showed again the hold <rs>Agassiz</rs> had taken upon the minds and affections of the people in general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3747"/>In laying out the general plan, which was rarely absent from his thought, he distinguished between the demands which the specialist and the general observer might make upon an institution intended to instruct and benefit both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3748"/>Here the special student should find in the laboratories and work rooms all the needed material for his investigations, stored in large collections, with duplicates enough to allow for that destruction of specimens which is necessarily involved in original research.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3749"/>The casual visitor meanwhile should walk through exhibition rooms, not simply crowded with objects to delight and interest him, but so arranged that the selection of every specimen should have reference to its part and place in nature; while the whole should be so combined as to explain, so far as known, the faunal and systematic relations of animals in the actual world, and in the geological formations; or, in other words, their succession in time, and their distribution in space.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3750"/><pb id="p.557" n="557"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3754"/>On the walls there were to be large, legible inscriptions, serving as a guide to the whole, and making this room a simple but comprehensive lesson in natural history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3755"/>It was intended to be the entrance room for visitors, and to serve as an introduction to the more detailed presentation of the same vast subject, given by the faunal and systematic collections in the other exhibition rooms.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3766"/>Though this bequest was not connected in set terms with the collections already existing in <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, its purpose was well understood; and <persName n="Gray,Mister,,,," id="n0258.0019.00559.01552" reg="nearbymention:Gray,Francis,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gray</surname></persName>'s nephew, <persName n="Gray,Mister,William,,," id="n0258.0019.00559.01553" reg="default:Gray,William,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Gray</surname></persName>, acting upon the intention of his uncle as residuary legatee, gave it into the hands of the <rs>President</rs> and Fellows of <orgName n="Harvard University" type="university">Harvard University</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3797"/>The transfer of the collections to their new and safe abode was made as rapidly as possible, and the work of developing the institution under these more favorable conditions moved steadily on. The lecture rooms were at once opened, not only to students but to other persons not connected with the university.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3798"/>Especially welcome were teachers of schools <pb id="p.565" n="565"/> for whom admittance was free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3799"/>It was a great pleasure to <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0020.00565.01576" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,Alexander,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> thus to renew and strengthen his connection with the teachers of the <rs>State</rs>, with whom, from the time of his arrival in this country, he had held most cordial relations, attending the <rs type="place">Teachers' Institutes</rs>, visiting the normal schools, and associating himself actively, as far as he could, with the interests of public education in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3800"/>From this time forward his college lectures were open to women as well as to men.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3801"/>The story of the next <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> was <num value="1">one</num> of unceasing but seemingly uneventful work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3802"/>The daylight hours from <num value="9">nine</num> or <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> in the morning were spent, with the exception of the hour devoted to the school, at the <name>Museum</name>, not only in personal researches and in lecturing, but in organizing, distributing, and superintending the work of the laboratories, all of which was directed by him. Passing from bench to bench, from table to table, with a suggestion here, a kindly but scrutinizing glance there, he made his sympathetic presence <pb id="p.566" n="566"/> felt by the whole establishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3803"/>No man ever exercised a more genial personal influence over his students and assistants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3804"/>His initiatory steps in teaching special students of natural history were not a little discouraging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3805"/>Observation and comparison being in his opinion the intellectual tools most indispensable to the naturalist, his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lesson was <num value="1">one</num> in <hi rend="italics">looking</hi>. He gave no assistance; he simply left his student with the specimen, telling him to use his eyes diligently, and report upon what he saw. He returned from time to time to inquire after the beginner's progress, but he never asked him a leading question, never pointed out a single feature of the structure, never prompted an inference or a conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3806"/>This process lasted sometimes for days, the professor requiring the pupil not only to distinguish the various parts of the animal, but to detect also the relation of these details to more general typical features.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3807"/>His students still retain amusing reminiscences of their despair when thus confronted with their single specimen; no aid to be had from outside until they had wrung from it the secret of its structure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3808"/>But all of them have recognized the fact that this <num value="1">one</num> lesson in looking, which forced them to such careful scrutiny of the <pb id="p.567" n="567"/> object before them, influenced all their subsequent habits of observation, whatever field they might choose for their special subject of study.

All his intellectual capital was thrown open to his pupils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3812"/>His original material, his unpublished investigations, his most precious specimens, his drawings and illustrations were at their command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3813"/>This liberality led in itself to a serviceable training, for he taught them to use with respect the valuable, often unique, objects intrusted to their care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3814"/>Out of the intellectual goodlowship <pb id="p.568" n="568"/> which he established and encouraged in the laboratory grew the warmest relations between his students and himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3815"/>Many of them were deeply attached to him, and he was extremely dependent upon their sympathy and affection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3816"/>By some among them he will never be forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3817"/>He is still their teacher and their friend, scarcely more absent from their work now than when the glow of his enthusiasm made itself felt in his personal presence.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3818"/>But to return to the distribution of his time in these busy days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3819"/>Having passed, as we have seen, the greater part of the day in the <name>Museum</name> and the school, he had the hours of the night for writing, and rarely left his desk before <num value="1">one</num> or <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> in the morning, or even later.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3820"/>His last <num value="2">two</num> volumes of the <q direct="unspecified">Contributions,</q> upon the <name>Acalephs</name>, were completed during these years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3821"/>In the mean time, the war between <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> had broken out, and no American cared more than he for the preservation of the <rs>Union</rs> and the institutions it represented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3822"/>He felt that the task of those who served letters and science was to hold together the intellectual aims and resources of the country during this struggle for national existence, to fortify the strongholds <pb id="p.569" n="569"/> of learning, abating nothing of their efficiency, but keeping their armories bright against the return of peace, when the better weapons of civilization should again be in force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3823"/>Toward this end he worked with renewed ardor, and while his friends urged him to suspend operations at the <name>Museum</name> and husband his resources until the storm should have passed over, he, on the contrary, stimulated its progress by every means in his power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3824"/>Occasionally he was assisted by the <name>Legislature</name>, and early in this period an additional grant of <measure n="10000dollars" type="currency">ten thousand dollars</measure> was made to the <name>Museum</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3825"/>With this grant was begun the series of illustrated publications already mentioned, known as the <q direct="unspecified">Bulletin of the <orgName n="Comparative Zoology Museum" type="museum">Museum of Comparative Zoology</orgName> in <placeName key="tgn,7013527;tgn,7010874" n="0.072 000000.4340	placename;tgn,7013527;cambridge, middlesex, massachusetts,Middlesex,Massachusetts,United States,North and Central America;0.045 000000.2727	placename;tgn,7010874;cambridge,cambridgeshire,england,united kingdom,europe,Cambridgeshire,England,United Kingdom,Europe" reg="cambridge, middlesex, massachusetts,Middlesex,Massachusetts,United States,North and Central America;cambridge,cambridgeshire,england,united kingdom,europe,Cambridgeshire,England,United Kingdom,Europe">Cambridge</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3827"/>With respect to this effort, and to those he was at the same time making for the <name>Museum</name>, he was wont to recall the history of the <orgName n="Berlin University" type="university">University of Berlin</orgName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3902"/>Every day the history of mankind is brought into more and more intimate connection with the natural history of the animal creation, and it is now indispensable that we should organize an extensive collection to illustrate the natural history of the uncivilized races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3903"/>Your personal acquaintance with business friends in almost every part of the globe has suggested to me the propriety of addressing to you a circular letter, setting forth the objects wanted, and requesting of you the favor to communicate it as widely as possible among your friends.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3906"/>As to articles of clothing, it would be preferable to select such specimens as have actually been worn or even cast off, rather than new things which may be more or less fanciful and not indicate the real natural condition and habits of a race.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3907"/>With regard to the collections intended to illustrate the physical constitution of the races it is more difficult to obtain instructive specimens, as the savage races are generally inclined to hold sacred all that relates to their dead; yet whenever an opportunity is afforded to obtain skulls of the natives of different parts of the world, it should be industriously improved, and good care taken to mark the <pb id="p.584" n="584"/> skulls in such a way that their origin cannot be mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3908"/>Beside this, every possible effort should be made to obtain perfect heads, preserved in alcohol, so that all their features may be studied minutely and compared.

<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3919"/>Rivers and lakes are isolated by the land and sea from <num value="1">one</num> another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3920"/>The question is, then, how they came to be peopled with inhabitants differing both from those on land and those in the sea, and how does it come that every hydrographic basin has its own inhabitants more or less different from those of any other basin?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3921"/>Take the <rs>Ganges</rs>, the <rs>Nile</rs>, and the <name>Amazons</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3925"/>If this alone were carried out, it would be, I believe, sufficient to settle the whole question.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3953"/><pb id="p.592" n="592"/></p> 
<p>The more I consider the subject to be examined and reported upon, the more I am impressed by its vastness; the more I see that its proper treatment requires a consideration of political, physiological, and ethnological principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3954"/>Before deciding upon any political policy, it is necessary to decide several important questions, which require more knowledge for their solution than I possess.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3955"/>Among these questions, this <num value="1">one</num> occupies me most now. Is it probable that the <name>African</name> race, represented by less than <num value="2000000">two million</num> blacks and a little more than <num value="2000000">two million</num> mulattoes, unrecruited by immigration, will be a persistent race in this country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3956"/>or will it be absorbed, diluted, and finally effaced by the white race, numbering <num value="24000000">twenty-four millions</num>, and continually increased by immigration, beside natural causes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3957"/>Will not the general practical amalgamation fostered by slavery become more general after its abolition?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3958"/>If so, will not the proportion of mulattoes become greater and that of the pure blacks less?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3959"/>With an increase and final numerical prevalence of mulattoes the question of the fertility of the latter becomes a very important element in the calculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3960"/>Can it be a persistent race here where <pb id="p.593" n="593"/> pure blacks are represented by <num value="2">2</num>, and the whites by <num value="20">20</num>-<num value="24">24</num>?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3961"/>Is it not true that in the <rs>Northern States</rs> at least the mulatto is unfertile, leaving but few children, and those mainly lymphatic and scrofulous?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3962"/>In those sections where the blacks and mulattoes together make from <num value="70">seventy</num> to <num value="80">eighty</num> and even <num value="0.9">ninety per cent.</num> of the whole population will there be, after the abolition of slavery, a sufficiently large influx of whites to counteract the present numerical preponderance of blacks?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3963"/>It looks now as if the whites would <hi rend="italics">exploiter</hi> the labors of the blacks, and that social servitude will continue long in spite of political equality.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3964"/>You will see the importance of considering carefully the natural laws of increase and their modification by existing causes before deciding upon any line of policy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3965"/>If there be irresistible natural tendencies to the growth of a persistent black race in the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> and river States, we must not make bad worse by futile attempts to resist it. If, on the other hand, the natural tendencies are to the diffusion and final disappearance of the black (and colored) race, then our policy should be modified accordingly.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3969"/>my dear <rs type="role2">Doctor</rs>,&mdash;When I acknowledged a few days ago the receipt of your invitation to put in writing my views upon the management of the negro race as part of the free population of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, I stated to you that there was a preliminary question of the utmost importance to be examined <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, since whatever convictions may be formed upon that point must necessarily influence everything else relating to the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3970"/>The question is simply this: Is there to be a permanent black population upon the continent after slavery is everywhere abolished and no inducement remains to foster its increase?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3971"/><pb id="p.595" n="595"/> Should this question be answered in the negative, it is evident that a wise policy would look to the best mode of removing that race from these States, by the encouragement and acceleration of emigration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3972"/>Should the question be answered, on the contrary, in the affirmative, then it is plain that we have before us <num value="1">one</num> of the most difficult problems, upon the solution of which the welfare of our own race may in a measure depend, namely, the combination in <num value="1">one</num> social organization of <num value="2">two</num> races more widely different from <num value="1">one</num> another than all the other races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3973"/>In effecting this combination it becomes our duty to avoid the recurrence of great evils, <num value="1">one</num> of which is already foreshadowed in the advantage which unscrupulous managers are taking of the freedmen, whenever the latter are brought into contact with new social relations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3974"/>I will, for the present, consider only the case of the unmixed negroes of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, the number of which I suppose to be about <num value="2000000">two millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3975"/>It is certainly not less,&mdash;it may be a little more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3976"/>From whatever point of view you look upon these people you must come to the conclusion that, left to themselves, they will perpetuate their race <hi rend="italics">ad infinitum</hi> where they are. According to the prevalent <pb id="p.596" n="596"/> theory of the unity of mankind it is assumed that the different races have become what they are in consequence of their settlement in different parts of the world, and that the whole globe is everywhere a fit abode for human beings who adapt themselves to the conditions under which they live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3977"/>According to the theory of a multiple origin of mankind the different races have <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> appeared in various parts of the globe, each with the peculiarities best suited to their primitive home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3978"/>Aside from these theoretical views the fact is, that some races inhabit very extensive tracts of the earth's surface, and are now found upon separate continents, while others are very limited in their range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3979"/>This distribution is such that there is no reason for supposing that the negro is less fitted permanently to occupy at least the warmer parts of North and <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName>, than is the white race to retain possession of their more temperate portions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3980"/>Assuming our pure black race to be only <num value="2000000">two millions</num>, it is yet larger than the whole number of several races that have held uninterrupted possession of different parts of the globe ever since they have been known to the white race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3981"/>Thus the <name>Hottentots</name> and the <name>Abyssinians</name> have maintained themselves in <pb id="p.597" n="597"/> their respective homes without change ever since their existence has been known to us, even though their number is less than that of our pure black population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3982"/>The same, also, is the case with the population of <placeName reg="Australia Island, Madison, Louisiana" key="tgn,2140674">Australia</placeName> and of the <rs type="place">Pacific islands</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3983"/>The Papuan race, the <name>Negrillo</name> race, the <name>Australian</name> race proper, distinct from <num value="1">one</num> another, as well as from all other inhabitants of the earth, number each fewer inhabitants than already exist of the negro race in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> alone, not to speak of Central and <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3984"/>This being the case there is, it seems to me, no more reason to expect a disappearance of the negro race from the continent of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> without violent interference, than to expect a disappearance of the races inhabiting respectively the <rs type="place">South Sea</rs> Islands, <placeName reg="Australia, Oceania, " key="tgn,7000490">Australia</placeName>, the <rs type="place">Cape of Good Hope</rs>, or any other part of the globe tenanted by the less populous races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3985"/>The case of the <rs>American Indians</rs>, who gradually disappear before the white race, should not mislead us, as it is readily accounted for by the peculiar character of that race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3986"/>The negro exhibits by nature a pliability, a readiness to accommodate himself to circumstances, a proneness to imitate those among whom he lives,&mdash;characteristics which are entirely foreign <pb id="p.598" n="598"/> to the <rs>Indian</rs>, while they facilitate in every way the increase of the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3987"/>I infer, therefore, from all these circumstances that the negro race must be considered as permanently settled upon this continent, no less firmly than the white race, and that it is our duty to look upon them as co-tenants in the possession of this part of the world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3988"/>Remember that I have thus far presented the case only with reference to the <rs>Southern States</rs>, where the climate is particularly favorable to the maintenance and multiplication of the negro race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3989"/>Before drawing any inference, however, from my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> assertion that the negro will easily and without foreign assistance maintain himself and multiply in the warmer parts of this continent, let us consider a few other features of this momentous question of race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3990"/>Whites and blacks may multiply together, but their offspring is never either <rs type="color">white</rs> or <rs type="color">black</rs>; it is always mulatto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3991"/>It is <num value="0.5">a half</num>-breed, and shares all the peculiarities of half-breeds, among whose most important characteristics is their sterility, or at least their reduced fecundity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3992"/>This shows the connection to be contrary to the normal state of the races, as it is contrary to the preservation of species in the animal kingdom. . . . Far <pb id="p.599" n="599"/> from presenting to me a natural solution of our difficulties, the idea of amalgamation is most repugnant to my feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3993"/>It is now the foundation of some of the most illadvised schemes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3994"/>But wherever it is practiced, amalgamation among different races produces shades of population, the social position of which can never be regular and settled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3995"/>From a physiological point of view, it is sound policy to put every possible obstacle to the crossing of the races, and the increase of half-breeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3996"/>It is unnatural, as shown by their very constitution, their sickly physique, and their impaired fecundity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3997"/>It is immoral and destructive of social equality as it creates unnatural relations and multiplies the differences among members of the same community in a wrong direction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3998"/>From all this it is plain that the policy to be adopted toward the miscellaneous colored population with reference to a more or less distant future should be totally different from that which applies to the pure black; for while I believe that a wise social economy will foster the progress of every pure race, according to its natural dispositions and abilities, and aim at securing for it a proper field for the fullest development of all its capabilities, <pb id="p.600" n="600"/> I am convinced also that no efforts should be spared to check that which is inconsistent with the progress of a higher civilization and a purer morality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3999"/>I hope and trust that as soon as the condition of the negro in the warmer parts of our States has been regulated according to the laws of freedom, the colored population in the more northern parts of the country will diminish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4000"/>By a natural consequence of unconquerable affinities, the colored people in whom the negro nature prevails will tend toward the <rs>South</rs>, while the weaker and lighter ones will remain and die out among us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4001"/>Entertaining these views upon the fundamental questions concerning the races, the next point for consideration is the policy to be adopted under present circumstances, in order to increase the amount of good which is within our grasp and lessen the evil which we may avert.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4004"/>my dear <rs type="role2">Doctor</rs>,&mdash;I am so deeply impressed with the dangers awaiting the progress <pb id="p.601" n="601"/> of civilization, should the ideas now generally prevalent about amalgamation gain sufficient ascendency to exert a practical influence upon the management of the affairs of the nation, that I beg leave to urge a few more considerations upon that point.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4005"/>In the first place let me insist upon the fact that the population arising from the amalgamation of <num value="2">two</num> races is always degenerate, that it loses the excellences of both primitive stocks to retain the vices or defects of both, and never to enjoy the physical vigor of either.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4006"/>In order clearly to appreciate the tendencies of amalgamation, it is indispensable to discriminate correctly between the differences distinguishing <num value="1">one</num> race from another and those existing between different nationalities of the same race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4007"/>For while the mixture of nationalities of the same race has always proved beneficial as far as we are taught by history, the mixture of races has produced a very different result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4008"/>We need only look at the inhabitants of <placeName reg="Central America" key="tgn,7016739">Central America</placeName>, where the white, the negro, and the <rs>Indian</rs> races are more or less blended, to see the baneful effects of such an amalgamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4009"/>The condition of the <name>Indians</name> on the borders of civilization in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and in <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, <pb id="p.602" n="602"/> in their contact with the <name>Anglo</name>-Saxons as well as with the <rs>French</rs>, testifies equally to the pernicious influence of amalgamation of races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4010"/>The experience of the <rs type="place">Old World points</rs> in the same direction at the <rs type="place">Cape of Good Hope</rs>, in <placeName reg="Australia, Oceania, " key="tgn,7000490">Australia</placeName>; everywhere, in fact, history speaks as loudly in favor of the mixture of clearly related nations as she does in condemnation of the amalgamation of re. mote races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4011"/>We need only think of the origin of the <rs>English</rs> nation, of that of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, etc. The question of breeding inand-in, that of marriage among close relations, is again quite distinct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4012"/>In fact, there is hardly a more complicated subject in physiology, or <num value="1">one</num> requiring nicer discriminations, than that of the multiplication of man, and yet it is constantly acted upon as if it needed no special knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4013"/>I beseech you, therefore, while you are in a position to exert a leading influence in the councils of the nation upon this most important subject to allow no preconceived view, no favorite schemes, no immediate object, to bias your judgment and mislead you. I do not pretend to be in possession of absolute truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4014"/>I only urge upon you the consideration of unquestionable facts before you form a final opinion and decide <pb id="p.603" n="603"/> upon a fixed policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4015"/>Conceive for a moment the difference it would make in future ages for the prospects of republican institutions, and our civilization generally, if instead of the manly population descended from cognate nations the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> should be inhabited by the effeminate progeny of mixed races, half <address><street n="Indian burial">Indian</street></address>, half negro, sprinkled with white blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4016"/>Can you devise a scheme to rescue the <name>Spaniards</name> of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> from their degradation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4017"/>Beware, then, of any policy which may bring our own race to their level.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4018"/>These considerations lead me naturally to the inquiry into the peculiarities of the <num value="2">two</num> races, in order to find out what may be most beneficial for each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4019"/>I rejoice in the prospect of universal emancipation, not only from a philanthropic point of view, but also because hereafter the physiologist and ethnographer may discuss the question of the races and advocate a discriminating policy regarding them, without seeming to support legal inequality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4020"/>There is no more <num value="1">one</num>-sided doctrine concerning human nature than the idea that all men are equal, in the sense of being equally capable of fostering human progress and advancing civilization, especially in the various spheres of intellectual and moral activity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4021"/>If this be <pb id="p.604" n="604"/> so, then it is <num value="1">one</num> of our primary obligations to remove every obstacle that may retard the highest development, while it is equally our duty to promote the humblest aspirations that may contribute to raise the lowest individual to a better condition in life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4022"/>The question is, then, what kind of common treatment is likely to be the best for all men, and what do the different races, taken singly, require for themselves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4023"/>That legal equality should be the common boon of humanity can hardly be matter for doubt nowadays, but it does not follow that social equality is a necessary complement of legal equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4024"/>I say purposely legal equality, and not political equality, because political equality involves an equal right to every public station in life, and I trust we shall be wise enough not to complicate at once our whole system with new conflicting interests, before we have ascertained what may be the practical working of universal freedom and legal equality for <num value="2">two</num> races, so different as the whites and negroes, living under <num value="1">one</num> government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4025"/>We ought to remember that what we know of the negro, from the experience we have had of the colored population of the <rs>North</rs>, affords but a very inadequate standard by which to judge <pb id="p.605" n="605"/> of the capabilities of the pure blacks as they exist in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4026"/>We ought, further, to remember that the black-population is likely at all times to outnumber the white in the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4027"/>We should therefore beware how we give to the blacks rights, by virtue of which they may endanger the progress of the whites before their temper has been tested by a prolonged experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4028"/>Social equality I deem at all times impracticable,&mdash; a natural impossibility, from the very character of the negro race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4029"/>Let us consider for a moment the natural endowments of the negro race as they are manifested in history on their native continent, as far as we can trace them back, and compare the result with what we know of our own destinies, in order to ascertain, within the limits of probability, whether social equality with the negro is really an impossibility.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4030"/>We know of the existence of the negro race, with all its physical peculiarities, from the <rs>Egyptian</rs> monuments, several <measure n="1000years" type="date">thousand years</measure> before the <orgName n="Christian Era" type="newspaper">Christian era</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4031"/>Upon these monuments the negroes are so represented as to show that in natural propensities and mental abilities they were pretty much what we find them at the present day,&mdash;indolent, <pb id="p.606" n="606"/> playful, sensual, imitative, subservient, good-natured, versatile, unsteady in their purpose, devoted and affectionate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4032"/>From this picture I exclude the character of the half-breeds, who have, more or less, the character of their white parents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4033"/>Originally found in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, the negroes seem at all times to have presented the same characteristics wherever they have been brought into contact with the white race; as in <placeName reg="Misr" key="tgn,7016833">Upper Egypt</placeName>, along the borders of the <name>Carthaginian</name> and <name>Roman</name> settlements in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, in <placeName key="tgn,1129270;tgn,1000189" n="0.027 000000.5450	placename;tgn,1129270;Senegal,Africa,Africa;0.027 000000.5450	placename;tgn,1000189;Senegal,Africa,Africa" reg="Senegal,Africa,Africa;Senegal,Africa,Africa">Senegal</placeName> in juxtaposition with the <rs>French</rs>, in <placeName reg="Congo, Shannon, Missouri" key="tgn,2252385">Congo</placeName> in juxtaposition with the <name>Portuguese</name>, about the <name>Cape</name> and on the eastern coast of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> in juxtaposition with the <rs>Dutch</rs> and the <rs>English</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4034"/>While <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> and <placeName reg="Carthage, Jasper, Missouri" key="tgn,2058276">Carthage</placeName> grew into powerful empires and attained a high degree of civilization; while in <placeName reg="Babylon, White Pine, Nevada" key="tgn,2141869">Babylon</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,1000140" n="1.000 36" reg="suriyah">Syria</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> were developed the highest culture of antiquity, the negro race groped in barbarism and <hi rend="italics">never originated a regular organization among themselves</hi>. This is important to keep in mind, and to urge upon the attention of those who ascribe the condition of the modern negro wholly to the influence of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4035"/>I do not mean to say that slavery is a necessary condition for the organization of the negro <pb id="p.607" n="607"/> race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4036"/>Far from it. They are entitled to their freedom, to the regulation of their own destiny, to the enjoyment of their life, of their earnings, of their family circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4037"/>But with all this nowhere do they appear to have been capable of rising, by themselves, to the level of the civilized communities of the whites, and therefore I hold that they are incapable of living on a footing of social equality with the whites in <num value="1">one</num> and the same community without becoming an element of social disorder.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4038"/> 
<p>I fear the expression <q direct="unspecified">social equality</q> may be misunderstood in this connection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4039"/>It means here only the relations which would arise from the mixture of the <num value="2">two</num> races, and thus affect the organization of society as a whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4040"/>It does not refer to any superficial or local social rules, such as sharing on common ground public conveyances, public accommodations and the like.&mdash;Ed.</p></note> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4041"/>I am not prepared to state what political privileges they are fit to enjoy now; though I have no hesitation in saying that they should be equal to other men before the law. The right of owning property, of bearing witness, of entering into contracts, of buying and selling, of choosing their own domicile, would give them ample opportunity of showing in a comparatively short time what political rights might properly and safely be granted to them in successive installments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4042"/>No man has a right <pb id="p.608" n="608"/> to what he is unfit to use. Our own best rights have been acquired successively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4043"/>I cannot, therefore, think it just or safe to grant at once to the negro all the privileges which we ourselves have acquired by long struggles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4044"/>History teaches us what terrible reactions have followed too extensive and too rapid changes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4045"/>Let us beware of granting too much to the negro race in the beginning, lest it become necessary hereafter to deprive them of some of the privileges which they may use to their own and our detriment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4046"/>All this I urge with reference to the pure blacks of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4047"/>As to the half-breeds, especially in the <rs>Northern States</rs>, I have already stated it to be my opinion that their very existence is likely to be only transient, and that all legislation with reference to them should be regulated with this view, and so ordained as to accelerate their disappearance from the <rs>Northern States</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4048"/>Let me now sum up my answer to some of your direct questions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4049"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4050"/>Is it probable that the <name>African</name> race will be a persistent race in this country, or will it be absorbed, diluted, and finally effaced by the white race?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4051"/>I believe it will continue in the <rs>Southern States</rs>, and I hope it may gradually die out at <pb id="p.609" n="609"/> the <rs>North</rs>, where it has only an artificial foothold, being chiefly represented by half-breeds, who do not constitute a race by themselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4052"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4053"/>Will not the practical amalgamation fostered by slavery become more general after its abolition?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4054"/>Being the result of the vices engendered by slavery, it is to be hoped that the emancipation of the blacks, by securing to them a legal recognition of their natural ties, will tend to diminish this unnatural amalgamation and lessen everywhere the number of these unfortunate half-breeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4055"/>My reason for believing that the colored population of the <rs>North</rs> will gradually vanish is founded in great degree upon the fact that that population does not increase where it exists now, but is constantly recruited by an influx from the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4056"/>The southern half-breeds feel their false position at the <rs>South</rs> more keenly than the blacks, and are more inclined to escape to the <rs>North</rs> than the individuals of purer black blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4057"/>Remove the oppression under which the colored population now suffers, and the current will at once be reversed; blacks and mulattoes of the <rs>North</rs> will seek the sunny <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4058"/>But I see no cause which should check the increase of the black population in the <rs>Southern</rs> <pb id="p.610" n="610"/> States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4059"/>The climate is genial to them; the soil rewards the slightest labor with a rich harvest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4060"/>The country cannot well be cultivated without real or fancied danger to the white man, who, therefore, will not probably compete with the black in the labors of the field, thus leaving to him an opportunity for easy and desirable support.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4061"/><num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4062"/>In those sections where the blacks and mulattoes together make from <num value="70">seventy</num> to <num value="80">eighty</num> and even <num value="0.9">ninety per cent.</num> of the population will there be, after the abolition of slavery, a sufficiently large influx of whites to counteract the present numerical preponderance of blacks?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4063"/>To answer this question correctly we must take into consideration the mode of distribution of the white and of the colored population in the more Southern States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4064"/>The whites inhabit invariably the sea-shores and the more elevated grounds, while the blacks are scattered over the lowlands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4065"/>This peculiar localization is rendered necessary by the physical constitution of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4066"/>The lowlands are not habitable in summer by the whites between sunset and sunrise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4067"/>All the wealthy whites, and in the less healthy regions even the overseers, repair in the evening to the sea. <pb id="p.611" n="611"/> shore or to the woodlands, and return only in the morning to the plantation, except during the winter months, after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> hard frost, when the country is everywhere habitable by all. This necessarily limits the area which can be tenanted by the whites, and in some States that area is very small as compared with that habitable by the blacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4068"/>It is therefore clear that with a free black population, enjoying identical rights with the whites, these States will sooner or later become negro States, with a comparatively small white population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4069"/>This is inevitable; we might as soon expect to change the laws of nature as to avert this result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4070"/>I believe it may in a certain sense work well in the end. But any policy based upon different expectations is doomed to disappointment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4071"/><num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4072"/>How to prevent the whites from securing the lion's share of the labor of the blacks?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4073"/>This is a question which my want of familiarity with the operations of the laboring classes prevents me from answering in a manner satisfactory to myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4074"/>Is it not possible to apply to the superintendence of the working negroes something like the system which regulates the duties of the foreman in all our manufacturing establishments?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4075"/><pb id="p.612" n="612"/></p> 
<p>I should like to go on and attempt to devise some scheme in conformity with the convictions I have expressed in these letters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4076"/>But I have little ability in the way of organizing, and then the subject is so novel that I am not prepared to propose anything very definite.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4079"/>Be assured I shall try to keep my mind open to conviction and to forbear forming any theory before observing a wide circle of facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4080"/>I do not know how you got the idea that I had decided in favor of anything about the future of the colored population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4081"/>I have corresponded with the founders of <q direct="unspecified">La Societe Cosmopolite pour la fusion des races humaines</q> in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 5" reg="france">France</placeName>,&mdash;an amalgamation society, founded upon the theory that the perfect man is to be the result of the fusion of all the races upon earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4082"/>I have not, however, the honor of being a member thereof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4083"/>Indeed, <pb id="p.613" n="613"/> I think it hardly exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4084"/>I hear, too, that several of our prominent anti-slavery gentlemen, worthy of respect for their zeal and ability, have publicly advocated the doctrines of amalgamation; but I do not know upon what grounds.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4085"/>I do, indeed, hold that in this, as in other matters, we are to do the manifest right, regardless of consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4086"/>If you ask me who is to decide what is the manifest right, I answer, that in morals, as well as in mathematics, there are certain truths so simple as to be admitted at sight as axioms by every <num value="1">one</num> of common intelligence and honesty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4087"/>The right to life is as clear as that <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="2">two</num> make <num value="4">four</num>, and none dispute it. The right to liberty and to ownership of property fairly earned is just as clear to the enlightened mind as that <num value="5">5</num> X <num value="6">6</num> = <num value="30">30</num>; but the less enlightened may require to reflect about it, just as they may want concrete signs to show that <num value="5">five</num> times <num value="6">six</num> do really make <num value="30">thirty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4088"/>As we ascend in numbers and in morals, the intuitive perceptions become less and less; and though the truths are there, and ought to be admitted as axiomatic, they are not at once seen and felt by ordinary minds.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4089"/>Now so far as the rights of blacks and the <pb id="p.614" n="614"/> duties of whites are manifest to common and honest minds, so far would I admit the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and perform the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, though the heavens fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4090"/>I would not only advocate entire freedom, equal rights and privileges, and open competition for social distinction, but what now seems to me the shocking and downward policy of amalgamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4091"/>But the heavens are not going to fall, and we are not going to be called upon to favor any policy discordant with natural instincts and cultivated tastes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4092"/>A case may be supposed in which the higher race ought to submit to the sad fate of dilution and debasement of its blood,&mdash;as on an island, and where long continued wrong and suffering had to be atoned for. But this is hardly conceivable, because, even in what seems punishment and atonement, the law of harmonious development still rules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4093"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> does not punish wrong and violence done to <num value="1">one</num> part of our nature, by requiring us to do wrong and violence to another part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4095"/>We need take no step backward, but only aside, to get sooner into the right path.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4096"/>Slavery has acted as a disturbing force in the development of our national character and <pb id="p.615" n="615"/> produced monstrous deformities of a bodily as well as moral nature, for it has impaired the purity and lowered the quality of the national blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4097"/>It imported Africans, and, to prevent their extinction by competition with a more vigorous race, it set a high premium on colored blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4098"/>It has fostered and multiplied a vigorous black race, and engendered a feeble mulatto breed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4099"/>Many of each of these classes have drifted northward, right in the teeth of thermal laws, to find homes where they would never live by natural election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4100"/>Now, by utterly rooting out slavery, and by that means alone, shall we remove these disturbing forces and allow fair play to natural laws, by the operation of which, it seems to me, the colored population will disappear from the <rs>Northern</rs> and Middle States, if not from the continent, before the more vigorous and prolific white race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4101"/>It will be the duty of the statesman to favor, by wise measures, the operation of these laws and the purification and elevation of the national blood.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4102"/>In the way of this is the existence of the colored population of the <rs>Northern</rs> and Middle States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4103"/>Now, while we should grant to every human being all the rights we claim for ourselves, and bear in mind the cases of individual <pb id="p.616" n="616"/> excellence of colored people, we must, I think, admit that mulattoism is hybridism, and that it is unnatural and undesirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4104"/>It has been brought to its present formidable proportions by several causes,&mdash;mainly by slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4105"/>Its evils are to be met and lessened as far as may be, by wise statesmanship and by enlightenment of public opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4106"/>These may do much.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4107"/>Some proclaim amalgamation as the remedy, upon the theory that by diluting black blood with white blood in larger and larger proportions, it will finally be so far diluted as to be imperceptible and will disappear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4108"/>They forget that we may not do the wrong that right may come of it. They forget that no amount of diffusion will exterminate whatever exists; that a pint of ink diffused in a lake is still there, and the water is only the less pure.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4109"/>Others persist that mulattoism is not and cannot be persistent beyond <num value="4">four</num> generations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4110"/>In other words, that like some other abnormal and diseased conditions it is selflimit-ing, and that the body social will be purged of it.</p>

<p>I cannot defend my lectures,&mdash;they are prone to be clumsy and hurried botches,&mdash; still less answer for any report,&mdash;which I never dare read; but I can tell you the amount of my chiding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4139"/>I vented some of the old grudge I owe the college now for <measure n="45years" type="date">forty-five years</measure>, for the cruel waste of <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> of college time on mathematics without any attempt to adapt, by skillful tutors, or by private instruction, these tasks to the capacity of slow learners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4140"/>I still remember the useless pains I took, and my serious recourse to my tutor for aid which he did not know how to give me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4141"/>It is both natural and laudable in each professor to magnify his department, and to seek to make it the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in the world if he can. But of course this tendency must be corrected by securing in the constitution of the college a power in the head (whether singular or plural) of coordinating all the parts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4142"/>Else, important departments will be overlaid, as in <placeName reg="Oxford, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050367">Oxford</placeName> and in <placeName reg="Harvard Station, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2379301">Harvard</placeName>, natural history was until now.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4189"/>. . . All those who know me seem to have combined to heighten the attraction of the journey, and facilitate it in every respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4193"/>The letter was written in the kindest terms, and gratified me the more because it was quite unsolicited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4210"/>For greater efficiency and promptness he divided his party into companies, each working separately, some in collecting, others in geological surveys, but all under <num value="1">one</num> combined plan of action.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4211"/>The next <measure n="10months" type="date">ten months</measure> were passed in the <placeName reg="Amazonian">Amazonian</placeName> region.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4212"/>This part of the journey had the charm of purely tropical scenery, and <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0022.00630.01669" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,Louis,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName>, who was no less a lover of nature than a naturalist, enjoyed to the utmost its beauty and picturesqueness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4213"/>Much of the time he and his companions were living on the great river itself, and the deck of the steamer was by turns laboratory, dining-room, and dormitory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4214"/>Often, as they passed close under the banks of the river, or between the many islands which break its broad expanse into narrow channels, their improvised working room was overshadowed by the lofty wall <pb id="p.631" n="631"/> of vegetation, which lifted its dense mass of trees and soft drapery of vines on either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4215"/>Still more beautiful was it when they left the track of the main river for the water-paths hidden in the forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4216"/>Here they were rowed by Indians in <q direct="unspecified">montarias,</q> a peculiar kind of boat used by the natives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4217"/>It has a thatched hood at <num value="1">one</num> end for shelter from rain or sun. Little sun penetrates, however, to the shaded <q direct="unspecified">igarape</q> (boat-path), along which the montaria winds its way under a vault of green.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4218"/>When traveling in this manner, they stopped for the night, and indeed sometimes lingered for days, in <name>Indian</name> settlements, or in the more secluded single <name>Indian</name> lodges, which are to be found on the shores of almost every lake or channel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4219"/>In this net-work of fresh waters, threading the otherwise impenetrable woods, the humblest habitation has its boat and landing-place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4220"/>With his montaria and his hammock, his little plantation of bananas and mandioca, and the dwelling, for which the forest about him supplies the material, the <rs>Amazonian Indian</rs> is supplied with all the necessities of life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4221"/>Sometimes the party were settled, for weeks at a time, in more civilized fashion, in the towns or villages on the banks of the main <pb id="p.632" n="632"/> river, or its immediate neighborhood, at <placeName key="tgn,1022014" n="1.000 10" reg="Manaus,Amazonas,Norte,Brasil,South America">Manaos</placeName>, Ega, Obydos, and elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4222"/>Wherever they sojourned, whether for a longer or a shorter time, the scientific work went on uninterruptedly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4230"/>On starting he had set before himself <num value="2">two</num> subjects of inquiry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4231"/>These were, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the freshwater fauna of <placeName reg="Brasil, South America, " key="tgn,1000047">Brazil</placeName>, of the greater interest to him, because of the work on the <rs>Brazilian Fishes</rs>, with which his scientific career had opened; and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, her glacial history, for he believed that even these latitudes must have been, to a greater or less degree, included in the ice-period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4233"/>The distribution of life in the rivers and lakes of <placeName reg="Brasil, South America, " key="tgn,1000047">Brazil</placeName>, the immense number of species and their local circumscription, as distinct faunae in definite areas of the same water-basin, amazed him; while the character of the soil and other geological features confirmed him in his preconceived belief that the glacial period could not have been less than cosmic in its influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4234"/>He was satisfied that the tropical, as well as the temperate and arctic regions, had been, although in a less degree, fashioned by ice.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4250"/>In the first place, the emperor gave me as a traveling companion an extremely intelligent and well-educated Brazilian, the man of all others whom I should have chosen had I been consulted beforehand; and for the <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> during which we have been on our journey here, I have not been able to spend a dollar except for my personal comfort, and for my collections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4251"/>All charges for transportation of persons and baggage in public conveyances, as well as for specimens, have everywhere been remitted by order of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4270"/>I have passed nearly <measure n="16months" type="date">sixteen months</measure> in the uninterrupted enjoyment of this incomparable tropical nature, and I have learned many things which have enlarged my range of thought, both concerning organized beings and concerning the structure of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4271"/>I have found traces of glaciers under this burning sky; a proof that our earth has undergone changes of temperature more considerable than even our most advanced glacialists have dared to suggest.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4338"/>dear Sir,&mdash;Far from considering your request a tax upon my time, it gives me the greatest pleasure to have an opportunity of laying before you some statements and reflections, which I trust may satisfy you that geology and natural history can be made subservient to the great interests of a civilized community, to a far greater extent than is generally admitted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4339"/>The question of the harbor of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, for instance, has a geological and zoological side, thus far only indirectly considered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4340"/>In order to ascertain whence the materials are derived which accumulate in the harbor, the shores ought to be studied geologically with a kind of accuracy and minuteness, never required by geological surveys made for economical purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4341"/>The banks of the harbor, wherever it is not rock-bound, consist of drift, which itself <pb id="p.649" n="649"/> rests upon the various rock formations of the district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4342"/>Now this drift, as I have ascertained, formerly extended many miles beyond our present shores, and is still slowly washed away by the action of tides, winds, and currents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4343"/>Until you know with precision the mineralogical composition of the drift of the immediate vicinity, so accurately indeed as to be able to recognize it in any new combination into which it may be brought when carried off by the sea, all your examination of soundings may be of little use. Should it, however, be ascertained that the larger amount of loose material spreading over the harbor is derived from some <num value="1">one</num> or other of the drift islands in the bay, the building of sea-walls to stop the denudation may be of greater and more immediate use than any other operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4344"/>Again, it is geologically certain that all the drift islands of the harbor have been formed by the encroachment of the sea upon a sheet of drift, which once extended in unbroken continuity from <placeName reg="Cape Ann, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013541">Cape Ann</placeName> to <placeName reg="Cape Cod, Barnstable, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013542">Cape Cod</placeName> and farther south.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4345"/>This sheet of drift is constantly diminishing, and in centuries to come, which, notwithstanding the immeasurable duration of geological periods, may be reached, I trust, while the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> still remains a flourishing <pb id="p.650" n="650"/> empire, it will be removed still further; so far indeed, that I foresee the time when the whole peninsula of <placeName reg="Cape Cod, Barnstable, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013542">Cape Cod</placeName> shall disappear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4346"/>Under these circumstances, it is the duty of a wise administration to establish with precision the rate and the extent of this destruction, that the coming generations may be forewarned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4347"/>In connection with this I would advise the making of a thorough survey of the harbor, to ascertain the extent of rock surface and of drift, and the relative position of the <num value="2">two</num>, with maps to show their relations to the different levels of the sea, whereby the unequal action of the tides upon the various beaches may be estimated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4348"/>The zoological side of the question relates to the amount of loose materials accumulating in consequence of the increase of animal and vegetable life, especially of those microscopic beings which, notwithstanding their extraordinary minuteness, form in course of time vast deposits of solid materials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4349"/><persName n="Ehrenberg,,,,," id="n0258.0022.00650.01710" reg="mostcommon:Ehrenberg,nomatch:0"><surname>Ehrenberg</surname></persName> has shown that the harbor of <placeName reg="Wismar, Rostock, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern" key="tgn,7004719">Wismar</placeName>, on the <rs type="place">Prussian coast</rs> of the <rs>Baltic</rs>, is filling, not in consequence of the accumulation of inorganic sediments, but by the rapid increase and decay of innumerable animalcules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4350"/>To what extent such deposits may accumulate has also been shown <pb id="p.651" n="651"/> by <persName n="Ehrenberg,,,,," id="n0258.0022.00651.01711" reg="mostcommon:Ehrenberg,nomatch:0"><surname>Ehrenberg</surname></persName>, who ascertained, many years ago, that the city of <placeName reg="Berlin, Berlin, Deutschland" key="tgn,7003712">Berlin</placeName> rests upon a deposit of about <measure n="18feet" type="distance">eighteen feet</measure> in thickness, consisting almost exclusively of the solid parts of such microscopic beings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4351"/>These <measure n="2cases" type="mass">two cases</measure> may suffice to show how important may be a zoological investigation of the harbor deposits.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4352"/>I need hardly add that the deposits floated into the harbor, by the numerous rivers and creeks which empty into it, ought to be investigated with the same care and minuteness as the drift materials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4353"/>This investigation should also include the drainage of the city.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4354"/>But this is only a small part of the application I would recommend to be made of geological and zoological knowledge, to the purposes of the <orgName n="Coast Survey" type="military">Coast Survey</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4355"/>The reefs of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> are of the deepest interest, and the mere geodetic and hydrographic surveys of their whole range would be far from exhausting the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4356"/>It is my deliberate opinion that the great reefs of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> should be explored with as much minuteness and fullness as the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> Stream, and that the investigation will require as much labor as has thus far been bestowed on the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> Stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4357"/>Here again geological and zoological knowledge is <pb id="p.652" n="652"/> indispensable to the completion of the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4358"/>The reef is formed mainly by the accumulation of solid materials from a variety of animals and a few plants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4359"/>The relations of these animals and plants to <num value="1">one</num> another while alive, in and upon the reef, ought to be studied more fully than has been the case heretofore, in order to determine with certainty the share they have in the formation of these immense submarine walls so dangerous to navigation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4360"/>The surveys, as they have been made thus far, furnish only the necessary information concerning the present form and extent of the reef.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4361"/>But we know that it is constantly changing, increasing, enlarging, spreading, rising in such a way and at such a rate, that the surveys of <num value="1">one</num> century become insufficient for the next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4362"/>A knowledge of these changes can only be obtained by a naturalist, familiar with the structure and mode of growth of the animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4363"/>The survey I made about <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure> ago, at the request of your lamented predecessor, could only be considered as a reconnaissance, in view of the extent and importance of the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4364"/>I would, therefore, recommend you to organize a party specially detailed to carry on these investigations in connection with, and by the side of, <pb id="p.653" n="653"/> the regular geodetic and hydrographic survey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4365"/>Here, also, would geological knowledge be of great advantage to the explorer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4366"/>In confirmation of my recommendation I need only remind you of a striking fact in the history of our science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4367"/>More than <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> ago, before <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0258.0022.00653.01712" reg="mostcommon:Dana,James,D.,,:10"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> and <persName n="Darwin,,,,," id="n0258.0022.00653.01713" reg="mostcommon:Darwin,Charles,,,:7"><surname>Darwin</surname></persName> had published their beautiful investigations upon the coral reefs, a pupil of mine, the late <rs>Armand Gressly</rs>, had traced the structure and mode of growth of coral reefs and atolls in the <rs type="place">Jura mountains</rs>, thus anticipating, by a geological investigation, results afterward obtained by dredging in the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4368"/>The structure of the reefs of our shores is, therefore, more likely to be fully understood by <num value="1">one</num> who is entirely familiar with zoology and geology than by a surveyor who has no familiarity with either of these sciences.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4369"/>There is another reason why I would urge upon you the application of natural sciences to the work of the survey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4370"/>The depth of the ocean is a great obstacle to a satisfactory exploration of its bottom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4371"/>But we know now that nearly all dry land has been sea bottom before it was raised above the level of the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4372"/>This is at least the case with all the stratified rocks and aqueous deposits forming <pb id="p.654" n="654"/> part of the earth's crust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4373"/>Now it would greatly facilitate the study of the bottom of the sea if, after ascertaining by soundings the <orgName n="General Character" type="misc">general character</orgName> of the bottom in any particular region, corresponding bottoms on dry land were examined, so that by a comparison of the <num value="1">one</num> with the other, both might be better understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4374"/>The shoals of the southern coast of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> have been surveyed, and their position is now known with great accuracy; but their internal structure, their mode of formation, is only imperfectly ascertained, owing to the difficulty of cutting into them and examining <hi rend="italics">in situ</hi> the materials of which they are composed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4375"/>Nothing, on the contrary, is easier than to explore the structure or composition of drift hills which are cut through by all our railroad tracks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4376"/>Now the shoals and rips of <placeName reg="Nantucket Island, Nantucket, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1008293">Nantucket</placeName> have their counterparts on the main-land; and even along the shores of <placeName key="tgn,1114422" n="1.000 1" reg="boston harbor, massachusetts, united states">Boston Harbor</placeName>, in the direction of <placeName reg="Dorchester, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7013575">Dorchester</placeName> and <persName n="Milton,,,,," id="n0258.0022.00654.01714" reg="mostcommon:Milton,nomatch:0"><surname>Milton</surname></persName>, such shoals may be examined, far away from the waters to which they owe their deposits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4377"/>Here, then, is the place to complete the exploration, for which soundings and dredgings give only imperfect information.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4378"/>I need not extend these remarks further in <pb id="p.655" n="655"/> order to satisfy you of the importance of geological and zoological researches in connection with the regular operations of the <orgName n="Coast Survey" type="military">Coast Survey</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4379"/>Permit me, however, to add a few words upon some points which, as it seems to me, belong legitimately to the <orgName n="Coast Survey" type="military">Coast Survey</orgName>, and to which sufficient attention has not yet been paid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4380"/>I allude, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, to the salt marshes of our shores, their formation and uses, as well as their gradual disappearance under the advance of the sea; <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, to the extended low islands in the form of reefs along the coast of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, the bases of which may be old coral reefs; <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, the form of all our estuaries, which has resulted from the conflict of the sea with the drift formation, and is therefore, in a measure, a geological problem; <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>, the extensive deposits of foraminifera along the coast, which ought to be compared with the deposits of tripoli found in many tertiary formations; <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num>, the general form and outline of our continent, with all its indentations, which are due to their geological structure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4381"/>Indeed, the shore everywhere is the result of the conflict of the ocean with the rock formation of the land, and therefore as much a question for geology as geodesy to answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4382"/><pb id="p.656" n="656"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4460"/>The past history of our science rises before me with its lessons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4461"/>Thinking men in every part of the world have been stimulated to grapple with the infinite variety of problems, connected with the countless animals scattered without apparent order throughout sea and land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4462"/>They have been led to discover the affinities of various living beings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4463"/>The past has yielded up its secrets, and has shown them that the animals now peopling the earth are but the successors of countless populations which have preceded them, and whose remains are buried in the crust of our globe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4464"/>Further study has revealed relations between the animals of past time and those now living, and between the law of succession in the former and the laws of growth and distribution in the latter, so intimate and comprehensive that this labyrinth of organic life assumes the character of a connected history, which opens before us with greater clearness in proportion as our knowledge increases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4465"/>But when the museums of the Old World were founded, these relations were not even suspected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4466"/>The collections of natural history, gathered at immense <pb id="p.670" n="670"/> expense in the great centres of human civilization, were accumulated mainly as an evidence of man's knowledge and skill in exhibiting to the best advantage, not only the animals, but the products and curiosities of all sorts from various parts of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4467"/>While we admire and emulate the industry and perseverance of the men who collected these materials, and did in the best way the work it was possible to do in their time for science, we have no longer the right to build museums after this fashion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4468"/>The originality and vigor of <num value="1">one</num> generation become the subservience and indolence of the next, if we only repeat the work of our predecessors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4469"/>They prepared the ground for us by accumulating the materials for extensive comparison and research.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4470"/>They presented the problem; we ought to be ready with the solution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4471"/>If I mistake not, the great object of our museums should be to exhibit the whole animal kingdom as a manifestation of the <rs>Supreme Intellect</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4472"/>Scientific investigation in our day should be inspired by a purpose as animating to the general sympathy, as was the religious zeal which built the <rs type="place">Cathedral of Cologne</rs> or the <name>Basilica</name> of <placeName key="tgn,2055458" n="1.000 3" reg="saint peter, nicollet, minnesota">St. Peter</placeName>'s. The time is passed when men expressed their deepest convictions by these <pb id="p.671" n="671"/> wonderful and beautiful religious edifices; but it is my hope to see, with the progress of intellectual culture, a structure arise among us which may be a temple of the revelations written in the material universe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4473"/>If this be so, our buildings for such an object can never be too comprehensive, for they are to embrace the infinite work of Infinite Wisdom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4484"/>From what I have seen of the deep-sea bottom, I am already led to infer that among the rocks forming the bulk of the stratified crust of our globe, from the oldest to the youngest formation, there are probably none which have been formed in very deep waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4485"/>If this be so, we shall have to admit that the areas now respectively occupied by our continents, as <pb id="p.673" n="673"/> circumscribed by the <num value="200">two hundred</num> fathom curve or thereabout, and the oceans at greater depth, have from the beginning retained their relative outline and position; the continents having at all times been areas of gradual upheaval with comparatively slight oscillations of rise and subsidence, and the oceans at all times areas of gradual depression with equally slight oscillations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4486"/>Now that the geological constitution of our continent is satisfactorily known over the greatest part of its extent, it seems to me to afford the strongest evidence that this has been the case; while there is no support whatever for the assumption that any part of it has sunk again to any very great depth after its rise above the surface of the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4488"/>Of the western part of the continent I am not prepared to speak with the same confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4489"/>Moreover, the position of the cretaceous and tertiary formations along <pb id="p.674" n="674"/> the low grounds east of the <rs>Alleghany</rs> range is another indication of the permanence of the ocean trough, on the margin of which these more recent beds have been formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4621"/>In a letter to <persName n="Peirce,Mister,,,," id="n0258.0023.00692.01823" reg="nearbymention:Peirce,Benjamin,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Peirce</surname></persName>, published in the <rs>Museum Bulletin</rs> at this time, there is this passage: <q direct="unspecified">If this world of ours is the work of intelligence and not merely the product of force and matter, the human mind, as a part of the whole, should so chime with it, that from what is known it may reach the unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4622"/>If this be so, the knowledge gathered should, within the limits of error which its imperfection renders unavoidable, enable us to foretell what we are likely to find in the deepest abysses of the sea.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4623"/>He looked, in short, for the solution of special <pb id="p.693" n="693"/> problems directly connected with all his previous work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4624"/>He believed the deeper sea would show forms of life akin to animals of earlier geological times, throwing new light on the relation between the fossil and the living world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4625"/>In the letter above quoted, he even named the species he expected to find most prevalent in those greater depths: as, for instance, representatives of the older forms of Ganoids and Selachians; Cephalopods, resembling the more ancient chambered shells; Gasteropods, recalling the tertiary and cretaceous types; and Acephala, resembling those of the jurassic and cretaceous formations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4626"/>He expected to find Crustaceans also, more nearly approaching the ancient Trilobites than those now living on the surface of the globe; and among Radiates he looked for the older forms of sea-urchins, star-fishes, and corals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4627"/>Although the collections brought together on this cruise were rich and interesting, they gave but imperfect answers to these comprehensive questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4628"/>Owing to defects in the dredging apparatus, the hauls from the greatest depths were lost.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4629"/>With reference to the glacial period he anticipated still more positive results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4630"/>In the same letter the following passage occurs: <pb id="p.694" n="694"/> <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4631"/></p> 
<p>There is, however, still <num value="1">one</num> kind of evidence wanting, to remove all doubt that the greater extension of glaciers in former ages was connected with cosmic changes in the physical condition of our globe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4632"/>Namely, all the phenomena relating to the glacial period must be found in the southern hemisphere, accompanied by the same characteristic features as in the north, but with this essential difference,&mdash; that everything must be reversed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4633"/>The trend of the glacial abrasions must be from the south northward, the lee-side of abraded rocks must be on the north side of the hills and mountain ranges, and the boulders must have traveled from the south to their present position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4634"/>Whether this be so or not, has not yet been ascertained by direct observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4635"/>I expect to find it so throughout the temperate and cold zones of the southern hemisphere, with the exception of the present glaciers of Terra del Fuego and <placeName key="tgn,7016766" n="1.000 1" reg="patagonia,argentina,south america">Patagonia</placeName>, which may have transported boulders in every direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4636"/>Even in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, geologists have not yet sufficiently discriminated between local glaciers and the phenomena connected with their different degrees of successive retreat on the <num value="1">one</num> hand; and, on the other, the facts indicating the action of an extensive sheet of ice moving <pb id="p.695" n="695"/> over the whole continent from north to south.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4637"/>Among the facts already known from the southern hemisphere are the so-called rivers of stone in the <rs type="place">Falkland Islands</rs>, which attracted the attention of <persName n="Darwin,,,,," id="n0258.0023.00695.01824" reg="mostcommon:Darwin,Charles,,,:7"><surname>Darwin</surname></persName> during his cruise with <persName n="Fitzroy,Captain,,,," id="n0258.0023.00695.01825" reg="mostcommon:Fitzroy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Fitzroy</surname></persName>, and which have remained an enigma to this day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4641"/>But I believe it will be found in the end, that so far from being accumulated by the sea, the drift of the <name>Patagonian</name> lowlands has been worn away by the sea to its present outline, like the northern shores of <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName> and <placeName reg="Brasil" key="tgn,1000047">Brazil</placeName>.<gap/></p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4662"/>You may hardly feel an interest in my zoological observations, but I am sure you will be glad to learn that we had the best opportunity of carefully examining most of the animals known to inhabit the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> weed, and some also which I did not know to occur among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4663"/>The most interesting discovery of our voyage thus far, however, is that of a nest built by a fish, and floating on the broad ocean with its living freight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4664"/>On the <dateStruct value="--13"><day reg="2">13th</day></dateStruct>, <persName n="Mansfield,Mister,,,," id="n0258.0024.00699.01831" reg="mostcommon:Mansfield,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Mansfield</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of our officers, brought me a ball of <persName n="Gulf,,,,," id="n0258.0024.00699.01832" reg="mostcommon:Gulf,nomatch:0"><surname>Gulf</surname></persName> weed which he had just picked up, and which excited my curiosity to the utmost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4665"/>It was a round mass of Sargassum about the size of <num value="2">two</num> fists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4666"/>The bulk of the ball was made up of closely packed branches and leaves, held together by fine threads, running through them in every direction, while other branches hung more loosely from the margin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4667"/>Placed in a large bowl of water it became apparent that the loose branches <pb id="p.700" n="700"/> served to keep the central mass floating, cradle-like, between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4668"/>The elastic threads, which held the ball of <persName n="Gulf,,,,," id="n0258.0024.00700.01833" reg="mostcommon:Gulf,nomatch:0"><surname>Gulf</surname></persName> weed together, were beaded at intervals, sometimes <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> beads close together, or a bunch of them hanging from the same cluster of threads, or occasionally scattered at a greater distance from each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4669"/>Nowhere was there much regularity in the distribution of the beads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4670"/>They were scattered pretty uniformly throughout the whole ball of sea-weed, and were themselves about the size of an ordinary pin's head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4671"/>Evidently we had before us a nest of the most curious kind, full of eggs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4672"/>What animal could have built this singular nest?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4673"/>It did not take long to ascertain the class to which it belonged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4674"/>A common pocket lens revealed at once <num value="2">two</num> large eyes on the side of the head, and a tail bent over the back of the body, as in the embryo of ordinary fishes shortly before the period of hatching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4675"/>The many empty egg cases in the nest gave promise of an early opportunity of seeing some embryos, freeing themselves from their envelope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4676"/>Meanwhile a number of these eggs containing live embryos were cut out of the nest and placed in separate glass jars, in order to multiply the chances of preserving them; <pb id="p.701" n="701"/> while the nest as a whole was secured in alcohol, as a memorial of our discovery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4677"/>The next day I found <num value="2">two</num> embryos in my glass jars; they moved occasionally in jerks, and then rested a long time motionless on the bottom of the jar. On the <dateStruct value="--3"><day reg="2">third</day></dateStruct> <time>day</time> I had over a dozen of these young fishes, the oldest beginning to be more active.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4678"/>I need not relate in detail the evidence I soon obtained that these embryos were actually fishes. . . . But what kind of fish was it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4679"/>At about the time of hatching, the fins differ too much from those of the adult, and the general form has too few peculiarities, to give any clew to this problem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4680"/>I could only suppose it would prove to be <num value="1">one</num> of the pelagic species of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4681"/>In former years I had made a careful study of the pigment cells of the skin in a variety of young fishes, and I now resorted to this method to identify my embryos.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4682"/>Happily we had on board several pelagic fishes alive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4683"/>The very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> comparison I made gave the desired result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4684"/>The pigment cell of a young Chironectes pictus proved identical with those of our little embryos.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4685"/>It thus stands, as a well authenticated fact, that the common pelagic Chironectes of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, named Ch. pictus by <persName n="Cuvier,,,,," id="n0258.0024.00701.01834" reg="mostcommon:Cuvier,M.,,,:16"><surname>Cuvier</surname></persName>, builds a nest for <pb id="p.702" n="702"/> its eggs in which the progeny is wrapped up with the materials of which the nest itself is composed; and as these materials consist of the living <rs>Gulf</rs> weed, the fish cradle, rocking upon the deep ocean, is carried along as in an arbor, which affords protection and afterwards food also, to its living freight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4686"/>This marvelous story acquires additional interest, when we consider the characteristic peculiarities of the genus <rs>Chironectes</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4687"/>As its name indicates, it has fin-like hands; that is to say, the pectoral fins are supported by a kind of long wrist-like appendage, and the rays of the ventrals are not unlike rude fingers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4688"/>With these limbs these fishes have long been known to attach themselves to sea-weeds, and rather to walk than to swim in their natural element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4689"/>But now that we know their mode of reproduction, it may fairly be asked if the most important use of their peculiarly constructed fins is not the building of their nest? . . . There thus remains <num value="1">one</num> closing chapter to the story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4690"/><dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> some naturalist, becalmed among the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> weed, have the good fortune to witness the process by which the nest is built. . . .</p></body></text> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4691"/>This whole investigation was of the greatest interest to <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0024.00702.01835" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,Alexander,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName>, and, coming so early in <pb id="p.703" n="703"/> the voyage, seemed a pleasant promise of its farther opportunities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4692"/>The whole ship's company soon shared his enthusiasm, and the very sailors gathered about him in the intervals of their work, or hung on the outskirts of the scientific circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4693"/>A pause of a few days was made at <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of the <name>West Indian</name> islands, at <placeName key="tgn,7013107;tgn,7005136" n="0.045 000000.1364	placename;tgn,7013107;saint thomas, ontario,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America;0.023 000000.0682	placename;tgn,7005136;Saint Thomas, Virgin Islands,Virgin Islands of the United States,North and Central America" reg="saint thomas, ontario,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America;Saint Thomas, Virgin Islands,Virgin Islands of the United States,North and Central America">St. Thomas</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7004770" n="1.000 8" reg="barbados">Barbadoes</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4694"/>At the latter, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> cast of the large dredge was made on a ledge of shoals in a depth of <num value="80">eighty</num> fathoms, and, among countless other things, a number of stemmed crinoids and comatulae were brought up. An ardent student of the early fossil echinoderms, it was a great pleasure to <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0024.00703.01836" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,Alexander,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> to gather their fresh and living representatives.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4696"/>my dear <persName n="Peirce,,,,," id="n0258.0024.00703.01838" reg="nearbymention:Peirce,Benjamin,,,"><surname>Peirce</surname></persName>,&mdash;I should have written to you from <placeName key="tgn,7004770" n="1.000 8" reg="barbados">Barbadoes</placeName>, but the day before we left the island was favorable for dredging, and our success in that line was so unexpectedly great, that I could not get away from the specimens, and made the most of them for study while I had the chance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4697"/>We made only <num value="4">four</num> <pb id="p.704" n="704"/> hauls, in between <num value="75">seventy-five</num> and <num value="120">one hundred and twenty</num> fathoms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4698"/>But what hauls!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4699"/>Enough to occupy half a dozen competent zoologists for a whole year, if the specimens could be kept fresh for that length of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4700"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> haul brought up a Chemidium-like sponge; the next gave us a crinoid, very much like the <name>Rhizocrinus</name> lofotensis, but probably different; the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, a living Pleurotomaria; the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>, a new genus of Spatangoids, etc., etc., not to speak of the small fry. We had the crinoid alive for <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="12hours" type="date">twelve hours</measure>. When contracted, the pinnules are pressed against the arms, and the arms themselves shut against <num value="1">one</num> another, so that the whole looks like a swash made up of a few long, coarse twines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4701"/>When the animal opens, the arms at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> separate without bending outside, so that the whole looks like an inverted pentapod; but gradually the tips of the arms bend outward as the arms diverge more and more, and when fully expanded the crown has the appearance of a lily of the L. martagon type, in which each petal is curved upon itself, the pinnules of the arms spreading laterally more and more, as the crown is more fully open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4702"/>I have not been able to detect any motion in the stem traceable to contraction, <pb id="p.705" n="705"/> though there is no stiffness in its bearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4703"/>When disturbed, the pinnules of the arms <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> contract, the arms straighten themselves out, and the whole gradually and slowly closes up. It was a very impressive sight for me to watch the movements of the creature, for it not only told of its own ways, but at the same time afforded a glimpse into the countless ages of the past, when these crinoids, so rare and so rarely seen nowadays, formed a prominent feature of the animal kingdom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4704"/>I could see, without great effort of the imagination, the shoal of <placeName key="tgn,7013900" n="1.000 24" reg="lockport, niagara, new york">Lockport</placeName> teeming with the many genera of crinoids which the geologists of New York have rescued from that prolific Silurian deposit, or recall the formations of my native country, in the hill-sides of which also, among fossils indicating shoal water deposits, other crinoids abound, resembling still more closely those we find in these waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4705"/>The close affinities of Rhizocrinus with Apiocrinoids are further exemplified by the fact that when the animal dies, it casts off its arms, like Apiocrinus, the head of which is generally found without arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4706"/>And now the question may be asked, what is the meaning of the occurrence of these animals in deep waters at the present day, when, in former <pb id="p.706" n="706"/> ages, similar types inhabited shallow seas?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4707"/>Of the fact there can be no doubt, for it is not difficult to adduce satisfactory evidence of the shoal-like character of the <name>Silurian</name> deposits of the <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">State of New York</placeName>; their horizontal position, combined with the gradual recession of the higher beds in a southerly direction, leaves no doubt upon this point; and in the case of the jurassic formation alluded to above, the combination of the crinoids with fossils common upon coral reefs, and their presence in atolls of that period, are satisfactory proofs of my assertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4708"/>What does it mean, then, when we find the <name>Pentacrinus</name> and Rhizocrinus of the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West Indies</placeName> in deep water only?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4709"/>It seems to me that there is but <num value="1">one</num> explanation of the fact, namely, that in the progress of the earth's growth, we must look for such a displacement of the conditions favorable to the maintenance of certain lower types, as may recall most fully the adaptations of former ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4710"/>It was in this sense I alluded, in my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> letter to you, to the probability of our finding in deeper water representatives of earlier geological types; and if my explanation is correct, my anticipation is also fully sustained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4711"/>But do the deeper waters of the present constitution of our globe really approximate <pb id="p.707" n="707"/> the conditions for the development of animal life, which existed in the shallower seas of past geological ages?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4712"/>I think they do, or at least I believe they approach it as nearly as anything can in the present order of things upon earth; for the depths of the ocean alone can place animals under a pressure corresponding to that caused by the heavy atmosphere of earlier periods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4713"/>But, of course, such high pressure as animals meet in great depths cannot be a favorable condition for the development of life; hence the predominance of lower forms in the deep sea. The rapid diminution of light with the increasing depth, and the small amount of free oxygen in these waters under greater and greater pressure, not to speak of other limitations arising from the greater uniformity of the conditions of existence, the reduced amount and less variety of nutritive substances, etc., etc., are so many causes acting in the same direction and with similar results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4714"/>For all these reasons, I have always expected to find that the animals living in great depths would prove to be of a standing, in the scale of structural complications, inferior to those found in shoal waters or near shore; and the correlation elsewhere pointed out between the standing of animals <pb id="p.708" n="708"/> and their order of succession in geological times (see <q direct="unspecified">Essay on Classification</q>) justifies another form of expression of these facts, namely, that in deeper waters we should expect to find representatives of earlier geological periods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4715"/>There is in all this nothing which warrants the conclusion that any of the animals now living are lineal descendants of those of earlier ages; nor does their similarity to those of earlier periods justify the statement that the cretaceous formation is still extant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4716"/>It would be just as true to nature to say that the tertiaries are continued in the tropics, on account of the similarity of the miocene mammalia to those of the torrid zone.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4717"/>We have another case in the <name>Pleurotomaria</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4718"/>It is not long since it has been made known that the genus <rs>Pleurotomaria</rs> is not altogether extinct, a single specimen having been discovered about <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> ago in the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West Indies</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4719"/>Even <persName n="Pictet,,,,," id="n0258.0024.00708.01839" reg="mostcommon:Pictet,nomatch:0"><surname>Pictet</surname></persName>, in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> edition of his Paleontology, still considers Pleurotomaria as extinct, and as belonging to the fossiliferous formations which extend from the <name>Silurian</name> period to the <name>Tertiary</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4720"/>Of the living species found at <placeName reg="Marie-Galante" key="tgn,7004576">Marie Galante</placeName>, nothing is known except the specific characteristics of the shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4721"/>We dredged it in <num value="120">one hundred and twenty</num> <pb id="p.709" n="709"/> fathoms, on the west side of <placeName key="tgn,7004770" n="1.000 8" reg="barbados">Barbadoes</placeName>, alive, and kept it alive for <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>, during which time the animal expanded and showed its remarkable peculiarities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4722"/>It is unquestionably the type of a distinct family, entirely different from the other Mollusks with which it has been hitherto associated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4723"/><persName n="Blake,Mister,,,," id="n0258.0024.00709.01840" reg="mostcommon:Blake,J.,H.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Blake</surname></persName> has made fine colored drawings of it, which may be published at some future time. . . . The family of the <name>Pleurotomariae</name> numbers between <num value="4">four</num> and <num value="500">five hundred</num> fossil species, beginning in the <name>Silurian</name> deposits, but especially numerous in the carboniferous and jurassic formations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4724"/>The sponges afford another interesting case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4725"/>When the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> number of the great work of Goldfuss, on the fossils of <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 6" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>, made its appearance, about half a century ago, the most novel types it made known were several genera of sponges from the jurassic and cretaceous beds, described under the names of Siphonia, Chemidium, and Scyphia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4726"/>Nothing of the kind has been known among the living to this day; and yet, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> haul of the dredge near <placeName key="tgn,7004770" n="1.000 8" reg="barbados">Barbadoes</placeName> gave us a Chemidium, or, at least, a sponge so much like the fossil Chemidium, that it must remain for future comparisons to determine whether there are <pb id="p.710" n="710"/> any generic differences between our living sponge and the fossil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4727"/>The next day brought us a genuine Siphonia, another genus thus far only known from the jurassic beds; and it is worth recording, that I noticed in the collection of <persName n="Rawson,Governor,,,," id="n0258.0024.00710.01841" reg="mostcommon:Rawson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Rawson</surname></persName> another sponge,&mdash; brought to him by a fisherman who had caught it on his line, on the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7004770" n="1.000 8" reg="barbados">Barbadoes</placeName>,&mdash;which belongs to the genus <rs>Scyphia</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4728"/>Thus the <num value="3">three</num> characteristic genera of sponges from the secondary formation, till now supposed to be extinct, are all <num value="3">three</num> represented in the deep waters of the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West Indies</placeName>. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4729"/>Another family of organized beings offers a similar testimony to that already alluded to. If there is a type of Echinoderms characteristic of a geological period, it is the genus <rs>Micraster</rs> of the cretaceous formation, in its original circumscription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4730"/>No species of this genus is known to have existed during the <name>Tertiary</name> era, and no living species has as yet been made known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4731"/>You may therefore imagine my surprise when the dredge <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> yielded <num value="3">three</num> specimens of a small species of that particular group of the genus, which is most extensively represented in the upper cretaceous beds.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4732"/>Other examples of less importance might be <pb id="p.711" n="711"/> enumerated; suffice it now to add that my expectation of finding in deep waters animals already known, but thus far exceedingly rare in museums, is already in a measure realized. . . .</p></body></text> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4736"/>This was made necessary partly by the delays in starting,&mdash;in consequence of which the season would be less favorable than had been anticipated along certain portions of the proposed route,&mdash;and partly by the defective machinery, which had already given some trouble to the <rs>Captain</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4738"/>The next pause was at Monte Video; but as there was a strict <pb id="p.712" n="712"/> quarantine, <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0024.00712.01842" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,Alexander,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> was only allowed to land at the <name>Mount</name>, a hill on the western side of the bay, the geology of which he was anxious to examine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4740"/>The hill itself had also the character of the <q direct="unspecified">roches moutonees</q> modeled by ice in the northern hemisphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4741"/>As these were the most northern erratics and glaciated surfaces reported in the southern hemisphere, the facts there were very interesting to him.</p>

As seen from the vessel, they seemed to be stratified with extraordinary evenness and regularity to within a few feet of the top, the summit being crowned with loose sand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4744"/>Farther on, they sank to sand <pb id="p.713" n="713"/> dunes piled into rounded banks and softly moulded ledges, like snow-drifts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4745"/>Landing the next day at a bold bluff marked Cliff End on the charts, he found the lower stratum to consist of a solid mass of tertiary fossils, chiefly immense oysters, mingled, however, with sea-urchins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4746"/>Superb specimens were secured,&mdash; large boulders crowded with colossal shells and perfectly preserved echini.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4747"/>From the top of the cliff, looking inland, only a level plain was seen, stretching as far as the eye could reach, broken by no undulations, and covered with low, scrubby growth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4748"/>The seine was drawn on the beach, and yielded a good harvest for the fish collection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4749"/>At evening the vessel anchored at the head of the bay, off the <rs type="place">Port of San Antonio</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4854"/>During the middle of the day, it advanced at the rate of <measure n="10inches" type="distance">ten inches</measure> and a fraction <pb id="p.728" n="728"/> in <measure n="5hours" type="date">five hours</measure>. <num value="1">One</num> such isolated observation is of course of little comparative value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4856"/>He spent the day in cruising about the bay in the steam-launch, landing at every point he wished to investigate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4857"/>His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> care was to examine minutely the valley walls over which the glacier must once have moved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4858"/>Every characteristic feature, known in the <placeName reg="Alps" key="tgn,7007746">Alps</placeName> as the work of the glaciers, was not only easily recognizable here, but as perfectly preserved as anywhere in <placeName key="tgn,7011731" n="1.000 54" reg="switzerland">Switzerland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4859"/>The rounded knolls to which <persName n="De Saussure,,,,," id="n0258.0024.00728.01870" reg="mostcommon:De Saussure,nomatch:0"><surname>De Saussure</surname></persName> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gave the name of <hi rend="italics">roches moutonees</hi> were smoothed, polished, scratched, and grooved in the direction of the ice movement, the marks running mostly from south to north, or nearly so. The general trend of the scratches and furrows showed them to have been continuous from <num value="1">one</num> knoll to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4860"/>The furrows were of various dimensions, sometimes shallow and several inches broad, sometimes narrow with more defined limits, gradually passing into mere lines on a very smoothly-polished surface.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4861"/>Even the curious notches scooped out of the even surfaces, and technically called <q direct="unspecified">coups de gouge,</q> were not <pb id="p.729" n="729"/> wanting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4862"/>In some places the seams of harder rock stood out for <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of an inch or so above adjoining decomposed surfaces; in such instances the dike alone retained the glacial marks, which had been worn away from the softer rock.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4863"/>The old moraines were numerous and admirably well preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4864"/><persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0024.00729.01871" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,Alexander,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> examined with especial care <num value="1">one</num> colossal lateral moraine, standing about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> below the present terminus of the ice and <measure n="500feet" type="distance">five hundred feet</measure> above the sea-level.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4865"/>It consisted of the same rocks as those found on the present terminal moraine, part of them being rounded and worn, while large, angular boulders rested above the smaller materials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4866"/>This moraine forms a dam across a trough in the valley wall, and holds back the waters of a beautiful lake, about a <measure n="1000feet" type="distance">thousand feet</measure> in length and <num value="500">five hundred</num> in width, shutting it in just as the <rs type="place">Lake of Meril</rs> in <placeName key="tgn,7011731" n="1.000 54" reg="switzerland">Switzerland</placeName> is held in its basin by the glacier of Aletsch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4867"/>There are erratics some <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="300feet" type="distance">three hundred feet</measure> above this great moraine, showing that the glacier must have been more than <measure n="500feet" type="distance">five hundred feet</measure> thick when it left this accumulation of loose materials at such a height.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4868"/>It then united, however, with a large glacier more to the <pb id="p.730" n="730"/> west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4869"/>Its greatest thickness, as an independent glacier, is no doubt marked, not by the boulders lying higher up, but by the large moraine which shuts in the lake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4870"/>The direct connection of this moraine with the glacier in its former extension is still further shown by <num value="2">two</num> other moraines, on lower levels and less perfect, but having the same relation to the present terminus of the ice. The lower of these is only <measure n="150feet" type="distance">one hundred and fifty feet</measure> above the actual level of the glacier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4871"/>These <num value="3">three</num> moraines occur on the western slope of the bay. The eastern slope is more broken, and while the rounded knolls are quite as distinct and characteristic, the erratics are more loosely scattered over the surface.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4872"/>In mineralogical character they agree with those on the western wall of the bay. Upon the summits of some small islands at the entrance of the bay, there are also some remnants of terminal moraines, formed by the glacier when it reached the main channel; that is, when it was some <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> longer than now.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4873"/>The more recent oscillations, marking the advance and retreat of the glacier within certain limits, are shown by the successive moraines heaped up in advance of the present terminal wall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4874"/>The central motion here, as in <pb id="p.731" n="731"/> all the <name>Swiss</name> glaciers, is greater than the lateral, the ice being pushed forward in the middle faster than on the sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4875"/>But there would seem to be more than <num value="1">one</num> axis of progression in this broad mass of ice; for though the centre is pushed out beyond the rest, the terminal wall does not present <num value="1">one</num> uniform curve, but forms a number of more or less projecting angles or folds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4876"/>A few feet in front of this wall is a ridge of loose materials, stones, pebbles, and boulders, repeating exactly the outline of the ice where it now stands; a few feet in advance of this, again, is another ridge precisely like it; still a few feet beyond, another; and so on, for <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> concentric zigzag crescent-shaped moraines, followed by <num value="2">two</num> others more or less marked, till they fade into the larger morainic mass, upon which stands the belt of wood dividing the present glacier from the bay. <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0024.00731.01872" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,Alexander,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> counted <num value="8">eight</num> distinct moraines between the glacier and the belt of wood, and <num value="4">four</num> concentric moraines in the wood itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4877"/>It is plain that the glacier has ploughed into the forest within some not very remote period, for the trees along its margin are loosened and half uprooted, though not yet altogether decayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4878"/>In the presence of the glacier <pb id="p.732" n="732"/> <num value="1">one</num> ceases to wonder at the effects produced by so powerful an agent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4879"/>This sheet of ice, even in its present reduced extent, is about a mile in width, several miles in length, and at least <measure n="200feet" type="distance">two hundred feet</measure> in depth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4880"/>Moving forward as it does ceaselessly, and armed below with a gigantic file, consisting of stones, pebbles, and gravel, firmly set in the ice, who can wonder that it should grind, furrow, round, and polish the surfaces over which it slowly drags its huge weight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4881"/>At once destroyer and fertilizer, it uproots and blights hundreds of trees in its progress, yet feeds a forest at its feet with countless streams; it grinds the rocks to powder in its merciless mill, and then sends them down, a fructifying soil, to the wooded shore below.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4883"/>But the southern winter was opening, and already gave signs of its approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4884"/>At dawn on the <dateStruct value="-03-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, therefore, the <rs>Hassler</rs> left her beautiful anchorage in <placeName reg="Playa Parda Cove">Playa Parda Cove</placeName>, <num value="6">six</num> large glaciers being in sight from her deck as she came out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4885"/>He could thus better compare the differences between the <num value="2">two</num> walls of the <rs type="place">Strait</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4886"/>The fact that the northern wall is more evenly worn, more rounded than the southern, had a special significance for him, as corresponding with like facts in <placeName key="tgn,7011731" n="1.000 54" reg="switzerland">Switzerland</placeName>, and showing that the ice-sheet had advanced across the <rs type="place">Strait</rs> with greater force in its ascending than in its descending path.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4887"/>The north side being the strike side, the ice would have pushed against it with greater force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4888"/>Such a difference between the <num value="2">two</num> sides of any hollow or depression in the direct path of the ice is well known in <placeName key="tgn,7011731" n="1.000 54" reg="switzerland">Switzerland</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4889"/>Later in the day, a pause was made in <placeName reg="Chorocua Bay">Chorocua Bay</placeName>, where <persName n="Mayne,Captain,,,," id="n0258.0024.00733.01875" reg="mostcommon:Mayne,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Mayne</surname></persName>'s chart makes mention of a glacier descending into the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4890"/>There is, indeed, a large glacier on its western side, but so inaccessible, that any examination of it would have required days rather than hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4891"/>No <num value="1">one</num>, however, regretted the afternoon spent here, for the bay was singularly beautiful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4892"/>On either side, deep gorges, bordered by richly-wooded cliffs and overhung by ice and snow-fields, were cut into <pb id="p.734" n="734"/> the mountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4893"/>Where these channels might lead, into what dim recesses of ocean and mountain, could only be conjectured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4894"/>The bay, with all its inlets and fiords, was still as a church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4895"/>Voices and laughter seemed an intrusion, and a louder shout came back in echoes from far-off hidden retreats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4896"/>Only the swift steamer-ducks, as they shot across, broke the glassy surface of the water with their arrow-like wake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4900"/>The next day forces were divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4901"/>The vessel put out into the <rs type="place">Strait</rs> again for sounding and dredging, while <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0025.00735.01877" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,Alexander,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName>, with a smaller party, landed in <placeName reg="Sholl Bay">Sholl Bay</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4902"/>Here, after having made a fire and pitched a tent in which to deposit wraps, provisions etc., the company dispersed in various directions along the shore, geologizing, botanizing, and collecting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4903"/><persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0025.00735.01878" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,Alexander,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> was especially engaged in studying the structure of the beach itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4904"/>He found that the ridge of the beach was formed by a glacial moraine, while accumulations of boulders, banked up in morainic ridges, concentric with <pb id="p.736" n="736"/> <num value="1">one</num> another and with the beach moraine, extended far out from the shore like partly sunken reefs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4905"/>The pebbles and boulders of these ridges were not local, or, at least, only partially so; they had the same geological character as those of the drift material throughout the <rs type="place">Strait</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4906"/>The day was favorable for work, and there was little to remind <num value="1">one</num> of approaching winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4907"/>A creek of fresh water, that ran out upon <num value="1">one</num> part of the beach, led up to a romantic brook, rushing down through a gorge bordered by moss-grown trees and carpeted by ferns and lichens in all its nooks and corners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4908"/>This brook took its rise in a small lake lying some half a mile behind the beach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4909"/>The collections made along the shore in this excursion were large and various: star-fish, volutas, sea-urchins, sea-anemones, medusae, doris; many small fishes, also, from the tide-pools, beside a number drawn in the seine.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4910"/>Later in the day, when the party had assembled around the beach fire for rest and refreshment, before returning to the vessel, their lunch was interrupted by strange and unexpected guests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4911"/>A boat rounded the point of the beach, and, as it came nearer, proved to be full of Fuegian natives, men, women, children, <pb id="p.737" n="737"/> and dogs, their invariable companions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4912"/>The men alone landed, some <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="7">seven</num> in number, and came toward the tent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4913"/>Nothing could be more coarse and repulsive than their appearance, in which the brutality of the savage was in no way redeemed by physical strength or manliness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4914"/>They were almost naked, for the short, loose skins tied around the neck, and hanging from the shoulders, over the back, partly to the waist, could hardly be called clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4915"/>With swollen bodies, thin limbs, and stooping forms; with a childish, yet cunning, leer on their faces, they crouched over the fire, spreading their hands toward its genial warmth, and all shrieking at once, <q direct="unspecified">Tabac!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4916"/>tabac!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4917"/>and <q direct="unspecified">Galleta!</q>&mdash;biscuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4918"/>Tobacco there was none; but the remains of the lunch, such as it was,&mdash;hard bread and pork,&mdash;was distributed among them, and they greedily devoured it. Then the <num value="1">one</num> who, judging from a certain deference paid him by the others, might be the chief, or leader, seated himself on a stone and sang in a singular kind of monotonous, chanting tone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4919"/>The words, as interpreted by the gestures and expressions, seemed to be an improvisation concerning the strangers they had found upon the beach, and were <pb id="p.738" n="738"/> evidently addressed to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4920"/>There was something curious in the character of this Fuegian song.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4921"/>Rather recitative than singing, the measure had, nevertheless, certain divisions or pauses, as if to mark a kind of rhythm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4922"/>It was brought to a close at regularly recurring intervals, and ended always in the same way, and on the same note, with a rising inflection of the voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4923"/>When the song was finished, a certain surprise and expectancy in the listeners kept them silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4924"/>This seemed to trouble the singer, who looked round with a comical air of inquiring disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4925"/>Thus reminded, the audience were quick to applaud, and then he laughed with pleasure, imitated the clapping of the hands in an awkward way, and nothing <num value="10" type="ordinal">10th</num>, began to sing again.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4926"/>The recall gun from the <rs>Hassler</rs> brought this strange scene to a close, and the party hastened down to the beach, closely followed by their guests, who still clamorously demanded tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4927"/>Meanwhile the women had brought the boat close to that of the <rs>Hassler</rs> at the landing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4928"/>They all began to laugh, talk, and gesticulate, and seemed a noisy crew, chattering unceasingly, with amazing rapidity, and all together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4929"/>Their boat, with the babies and dogs to add to the tumult, was a perfect <pb id="p.739" n="739"/> babel of voices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4930"/>They put off at once, keeping as close as they could to the <rs>Hassler</rs> boat, and reaching the vessel almost at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4931"/>They were not allowed to come on board, but tobacco and biscuit, as well as bright calico and beads for the women, were thrown down to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4932"/>They scrambled and snatched fiercely, like wild animals, for whatever they could catch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4933"/>They had some idea of barter, for when they found they had received all that they were likely to get gratuitously, they held up bows and arrows, wicker baskets, birds, and the large sea-urchins, which are an article of food with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4934"/>Even after the steamer had started, they still clung to the side, praying, shrieking, screaming, for more <q direct="unspecified">tabac.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4935"/>When they found it a hopeless chase, they dropped off, and began again the same chanting recitative, waving their hands in farewell.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4943"/>In front is always a scorched spot on the ground, where their handful of fire has smouldered; and at <num value="1">one</num> side, a large heap of empty shells, showing that they had occupied this place until they had exhausted the supply of mussels, on which they chiefly live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4944"/>When this is the case, they move to some other spot, gather a few branches, reconstruct their frail shelter, and continue the same life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4945"/>Untaught by their necessities, they wander thus, naked and homeless, in snow, mist, and rain, as they have done <pb id="p.741" n="741"/> for ages, asking of the land only a strip of beach and a handful of fire; and of the ocean, shell-fish enough to save them from starvation.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5060"/>my dear <persName n="Peirce,,,,," id="n0258.0025.00756.01911" reg="mostcommon:Peirce,Benjamin,,,:5"><surname>Peirce</surname></persName>,&mdash;. . . I have another new chapter concerning glacial phenomena, gathered during our land-journey from Talcahuana to <placeName key="possibilities=30" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Santiago</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5061"/>It is so complicated a story that I do not feel equal now to recording the details in a connected statement, but will try to give you the main facts in a few words.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5062"/>There is a broad valley between the <name>Andes</name> and the <rs type="place">Coast</rs> Range, the valley of Chilian, extending from the <placeName reg="Gulf of Ancud">Gulf of Ancud</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Port de Mott">Port de Mott</placeName>, to <placeName key="possibilities=30" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Santiago</placeName> and farther north.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5063"/>This valley is a continuation, upon somewhat higher level, of the channels which, from the <rs type="place">Strait of Magellan</rs> to Chiloe, separate the islands from the main-land, with the sole interruption of Tres Montes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5064"/>Now this great valley, <pb id="p.757" n="757"/> extending for more than <num value="25">twenty-five</num> degrees of latitude, is a <hi rend="italics">continuous glacier bottom</hi>, showing plainly that for its whole length the great southern ice-sheet has been retreating southward in it. I could find nowhere any indication that glaciers descending from the <name>Andes</name> had crossed this valley and reached the shores of the <rs>Pacific</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5065"/>In a few brief localities only did I notice Andean, <hi rend="italics">i.e</hi>. volcanic, erratics upon the loose materials filling the old glacier bottom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5066"/>Between Curicu and <placeName key="possibilities=30" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Santiago</placeName>, however, facing the gorge of Tenon, I saw <num value="2">two</num> distinct lateral moraines, parallel to <num value="1">one</num> another, chiefly composed of volcanic boulders, resting upon the old drift, and indicating by their position the course of a large glacier that once poured down from the <name>Andes</name> of Tenon, and crossed the main valley, without, however, extending beyond the eastern slope of the <rs type="place">Coast</rs> Range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5067"/>These moraines are so well marked that they are known throughout the country as the cerillos of Tenon, but nobody suspects their glacial origin; even the geologists of <placeName key="possibilities=30" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Santiago</placeName> assign a volcanic origin to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5068"/>What is difficult to describe in this history are the successive retrograde steps of the great southern ice-field that, step by step, left larger or smaller <pb id="p.758" n="758"/> tracts of the valley to the north of it free of ice, so that large glacial lakes could be formed, and seem, indeed, always to have existed along the retreating edge of the great southern glacier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5069"/>The natural consequence is that there are everywhere stratified terraces without border barriers (since these were formed only by the ice that has vanished), resting at successively higher or lower levels, as you move <name>north</name> or <name>south</name>, upon unstratified drift of older date; the northernmost of these terraces being the oldest, while those further south belong to later steps in the waning of the ice-fields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5070"/>From these data I infer that my suggestion concerning the trend of the strike upon the polished and glaciated surface of the vicinity of Talcahuana, alluded to in the postscript of my last letter, is probably correct. . . .</p></body></text> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5086"/><placeName reg="Albemarle Island">Albemarle Island</placeName> was, perhaps, the most interesting of all. It is a barren mountain rising from the sea, its base and slope covered with small extinct craters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5089"/>The anchorage was in <placeName reg="Tagus Sound">Tagus Sound</placeName>, a deep, quiet bay, less peaceful once, for its steep sides are formed by the walls of an old crater.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5090"/>The next <time>day</time>, <dateStruct value="-06-15"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="15">15</day></dateStruct>, was spent by the whole scientific party in a ramble on shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5091"/>The landing was at the foot of a ravine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5092"/>Climbing its left bank, they were led by a short walk to the edge of a large crater, which held a beautiful lake in its cup. It was, in fact, a crater within a crater, for a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <num value="1">one</num>, equally symmetrical, rose outside and above it. Following the brink of this lake to <pb id="p.761" n="761"/> its upper end, they struck across to the head of the ravine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5093"/>It terminated in a ridge, which looked down upon an immense field or sea of hardened lava, spreading over an area of several miles till it reached the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5094"/>This ancient bed of lava was full of the most singular and fantastic details of lava structure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5095"/>It was a field of charred ruins, among which were more or less open caves or galleries, some large enough to hold a number of persons standing upright, others hardly allowing room to creep through on hands and knees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5096"/>Rounded domes were common, sometimes broken, sometimes whole; now and then some great lava bubble was pierced with a window blasted out of the side, through which <num value="1">one</num> could look down to the floor of a deep, underground hollow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5097"/>The whole company, some <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> persons, lunched in <num value="1">one</num> of the caves, resting on the seats formed by the ledges of lava along its sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5098"/>It had an entrance at either end, was some <measure n="40feet" type="distance">forty feet</measure> long, at least <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure> high in the centre, and perhaps <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure> wide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5099"/>Probably never before had it served as a banqueting hall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5100"/>Such a hollow tunnel or arch had been formed wherever the interior of a large mass of lava, once cooled, <pb id="p.762" n="762"/> had become heated again, and had flowed out, leaving the outside crust standing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5101"/>The whole story of this lava bed is so clearly told in its blackened and extinct remains, that it needs no stretch of the imagination to recreate the scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5102"/>It is again a heaving, palpitating sheet of fire; the dead slags are aglow, and the burned-out furnaces cast up their molten, blazing contents, as of old. Now it is the home of the large red and orange-colored iguanas, of which a number were captured, both alive and dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5103"/>These islands proved, indeed, admirable collecting grounds, the more interesting from the peculiarity of their local fauna.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5104"/>. . .Our visit to the <name>Galapagos</name> has been full of geological and zoological interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5105"/>It is most impressive to see an extensive archipelago, of <hi rend="italics">most recent origin</hi>, inhabited by creatures so different from any known in other parts of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5106"/>Here we have a positive limit to the length of time that may have been granted for the transformation of these animals, if indeed they are in any way derived from others dwelling in different parts <pb id="p.763" n="763"/> of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5108"/>Some parts of their surface are entirely bare, and a great many of the craters and lava streams are so fresh, that the atmospheric agents have not yet made an impression on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5109"/>Their age does not, therefore, go back to earlier geological periods; they belong to our times, geologically speaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5110"/>Whence, then, do their inhabitants (animals as well as plants) come?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5111"/>If descended from some other type, belonging to any neighboring land, then it does not require such unspeakably long periods for the transformation of species as the modern advocates of transmutation claim; and the mystery of change, wi th such marked and characteristic differences between existing species, is only increased, and brought to a level with that of creation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5148"/>It was, therefore, most suitable that it should bear his name, and so it was agreed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5149"/>Thus the material problem was solved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5150"/>Name and habitation were found; it remained only to organize the work for which so fitting a home had been provided.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5152"/>Few men would have thought it feasible to build dormitories and laboratories, and provide working apparatus for <num value="50">fifty</num> pupils as well as for a large corps of teachers, between <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5153"/>But to <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0026.00769.01932" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,Santiago,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> no obstacles seemed insurmountable where great aims were involved, and the opening of the school was announced for the <dateStruct value="-07-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5154"/>He left <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> on <date>Friday</date>, the <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, for the island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5155"/>At New Bedford he was met by a warning from the architect that it would be simply impossible to open the school at the appointed date.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5156"/>With characteristic disregard of practical difficulties, he answered that it must be possible, for postponement was out of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5157"/>He reached the island on <date>Saturday</date>, the <dateStruct value="--5"><day reg="5">5th</day></dateStruct>, in the afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5158"/>The aspect was certainly discouraging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5159"/>The dormitory was up, but only the frame was completed; there were no floors, nor was the roof shingled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5160"/>The next day was <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5162"/>He told them that the scheme was neither for money, nor for the making of money; no personal gain was involved in it. It was for the best interests of education, and for that alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5163"/>Having explained the object, and stated the emergency, he asked whether, under these circumstances, <pb id="p.770" n="770"/> the next day was properly for rest or for work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5164"/>They all answered <q direct="unspecified">for work.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5165"/>They accordingly worked the following day from dawn till dark, and by night-fall the floors were laid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5166"/>On <date>Monday</date>, the <dateStruct value="--7"><day reg="7">7th</day></dateStruct>, the partitions were put up, dividing the upper story into <num value="2">two</num> large dormitories; the lower, into sufficiently convenient working-rooms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5167"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> (the <num value="8" type="ordinal">8th</num>), with the help of a few volunteers, chiefly ladies connected with the school, who had arrived a day or <num value="2">two</num> in advance, the dormitories, which were still encumbered by shavings, sawdust, etc., were swept, and presently transformed into not unattractive sleeping-halls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5168"/>They were divided by neat sets of furniture into equal spaces, above each of which was placed the name of the person to whom it was appropriated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5169"/>When all was done, the large open rooms, with their fresh pine walls, floors, and ceilings, the rows of white beds down the sides, and the many windows looking to the sea, were pretty and inviting enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5170"/>If they somewhat resembled hospital wards, they were too airy and cheerful to suggest sickness either of body or mind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5171"/>Next, a large barn belonging to <persName n="Anderson,Mister,,,," id="n0258.0026.00770.01934" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>'s former establishment was cleared, and a <pb id="p.771" n="771"/> new floor laid there also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5172"/>This was hardly finished (the last nails were just driven) when the steamer, with its large company, touched the wharf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5173"/>There was barely time to arrange the seats and to place a table with flowers where the guests of honor were to sit, and <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0026.00771.01935" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,Santiago,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> himself was to stand, when all arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5174"/>The barn was, on the whole, not a bad lecture-room on a beautiful summer day. The swallows, who had their nests without number in the rafters, flew in and out, and twittered softly overhead; and the wide doors, standing broadly open to the blue sky and the fresh fields, let in the sea-breeze, and gave a view of the little domain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5176"/>But, as he looked upon his pupils gathered there to study nature with him, by an impulse as natural as it was unpremeditated, he called upon them to join in silently asking <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> blessing on their work together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5177"/>The pause was broken by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> words of an address no less fervent than its unspoken prelude.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5178"/>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5179"/>Thus the day, which had been anticipated <pb id="p.772" n="772"/> with so much anxiety, passed off, unclouded by any untoward accident, and at evening the guests had departed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5180"/>Students and teachers, a company of some <num value="50">fifty</num> or <num value="60">sixty</num> persons, were left to share the island with the sea-gulls whose haunt it was.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5181"/>We will not enter into the daily details of the school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5182"/>It was a new phase of teaching, even for <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0026.00772.01939" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,Santiago,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName>, old as he was in the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5183"/>Most of his pupils were mature men and women, some of whom had been teachers themselves for many years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5184"/>He had, therefore, trained minds to deal with, and the experience was at that time as novel as it was interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5185"/>The novelty has worn off now. Summer schools for advanced students, and especially for teachers, have taken their place in the general system of education; and, though the <rs type="place">Penikese school</rs> may be said to have died with its master, it lives anew in many a sea-side laboratory organized on the same plan, in summer schools of Botany and field classes of Geology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5186"/>The impetus it gave was not, and cannot be, lost, since it refreshed and vitalized methods of teaching.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5191"/>It was their last meeting in this world, and together they lived over their days of youthful adventure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5192"/>The lectures of the morning and afternoon would sometimes be followed by an informal meeting held on a little hill, which was a favorite resort at sunset.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5193"/>There the whole community gathered around the <num value="2">two</num> old friends, to hear them talk of their glacial explorations, <num value="1">one</num> recalling what the other had forgotten, till the scenes lived again for themselves, and became almost equally vivid for their listeners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5194"/>The subject came up naturally, for, strange to say, this island in a <pb id="p.774" n="774"/> <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> bay was very suggestive of glacial phenomena.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5195"/>Erratic materials and boulders transported from the north were scattered over its surface, and <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0026.00774.01948" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,Santiago,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> found the illustrations for his lectures on this topic ready to his hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5196"/>Indeed, some of his finest lectures on the ice-period were given at Penikese.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5197"/>Nothing could be less artificial, more free from constraint or formality, than the intercourse between him and his companions of this summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5198"/>He was at home with every member of the settlement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5199"/>Ill-health did not check the readiness of his sympathy; languor did not chill the glow of his enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5200"/>All turned to him for help and inspiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5201"/>Walking over their little sovereignty together, hunting for specimens on its beaches, dredging from the boats, in the laboratory, or the lecture-room, the instruction had always the character of the freest discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5202"/>Yet the work, although combined with out-of-door pleasures, and not without a certain holiday element, was no play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5203"/>On the part of the students, the application was close and unremitting; on the part of the teachers, the instruction, though untrammeled by routine, was sustained and systematic.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5204"/><persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0026.00774.01949" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,Santiago,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> himself frequently gave <num value="2">two</num> lectures <pb id="p.775" n="775"/> a day. In the morning session he would prepare his class for the work of the day; in the afternoon he would draw out their own observations by questions, and lead them, by comparison and combination of the facts they had observed, to understand the significance of their results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5205"/>Every lecture from him at this time was a lesson in teaching as well as in natural history, and to many of his hearers this gave his lectures a twofold value, as bearing directly upon their own occupation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5206"/>In his opening address he had said to them: <q direct="unspecified">You will find the same elements of instruction all about you wherever you may be teaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5207"/>You can take your classes out, and give them the same lessons, and lead them up to the same subjects you are yourselves studying here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5208"/>And this mode of teaching children is so natural, so suggestive, so true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5209"/>That is the charm of teaching from Nature herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5210"/>No <num value="1">one</num> can warp her to suit his own views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5211"/>She brings us back to absolute truth as often as we wander.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5212"/></p> 
<p>This was the bright side of the picture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5213"/>Those who stood nearest to <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0026.00775.01950" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,Santiago,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName>, however, felt that the strain not only of work, but of the anxiety and responsibility attendant upon a new and important undertaking, was perilous <pb id="p.776" n="776"/> for him. There were moments when this became apparent, and he himself felt the danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5214"/>He persevered, nevertheless, to the end of the summer, and only left Penikese when the school broke up.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5215"/>In order to keep the story of this final effort unbroken, some events of great interest to <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0026.00776.01951" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,Santiago,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> and of importance to the <name>Museum</name> have been omitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5216"/>In the spring the <name>Museum</name> had received a grant of <measure n="25000dollars" type="currency">$25,000</measure> from the <name>Legislature</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5217"/>To this was added <measure n="100000dollars" type="currency">$100,000</measure>, a birthday gift to <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0258.0026.00776.01952" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,Santiago,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> in behalf of the institution he so much loved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5218"/>This last sum was controlled by no official body and was to be expended at his own good will and pleasure, either in collections, publications, or scientific assistance, as seemed to him best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5219"/>He therefore looked forward to a year of greater ease and efficiency in scientific work than he had ever enjoyed before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5220"/>On returning from Penikese, full of the new possibilities thus opened to him, he allowed himself a short rest, partly at the sea-shore, partly in the mountains, and was again at his post in the <name>Museum</name> in <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5221"/>His last course of lectures there was on <num value="1">one</num> of his favorite topics,&mdash;the type of Radiates as connected with the physical history of the <pb id="p.777" n="777"/> earth, from the dawn of organic life till now. In his opening lecture he said to his class: <q direct="unspecified">You must learn to look upon fossil forms as the antiquarian looks upon his coins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5222"/>The remains of animals and plants have the spirit of their time impressed upon them, as strongly as the spirit of the age is impressed upon its architecture, its literature, its coinage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5223"/>I want you to become so familiar with these forms, that you can read off at a glance their character and associations.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5224"/>In this spirit his last course was conceived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5225"/>It was as far-reaching and as clear as usual, nor did his delivery evince failure of strength or of mental power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5226"/>If he showed in any way the disease which was even then upon him, it was by an over-tension of the nerves, which gave increased fervor to his manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5227"/>Every mental effort was, however, succeeded by great physical fatigue.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5228"/>At the same time he had undertaken a series of articles in the <q direct="unspecified"><orgName n="Atlantic monthly" type="newspaper">Atlantic Monthly</orgName>,</q> entitled, <q direct="unspecified">Evolution and Permanence of Type.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5229"/>They were to have contained his own convictions regarding the connection between all living beings, upon which his studies had led him to conclusions so different from the philosophy of the day. Of these papers, only <pb id="p.778" n="778"/> <num value="1">one</num> was completed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5230"/>It was his last word upon science; the correction of the proof-sheets was the last act of his working life, and the article was published after his death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5231"/>In it he claimed that the law of evolution, in a certain sense as true to him as to any so-called evolutionist, was a law <q direct="unspecified">controlling development, and keeping types within appointed cycles of growth.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5232"/>He maintained that this law acts within definite limits, and never infringes upon the great types, each <num value="1">one</num> of which is, in his view, a structural unit in itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5233"/>Even metamorphoses, he adds, <q direct="unspecified">have all the constancy and invariability of other modes of embryonic growth, and have never been known to lead to any transition of <num value="1">one</num> species into another.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5234"/>Of heredity he says: <q direct="unspecified">The whole subject of inheritance is exceedingly intricate, working often in a seemingly capricious and fitful way. Qualities, both good and bad, are dropped as well as acquired, and the process ends sometimes in the degradation of the type, and the survival of the unfit rather than the fittest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5235"/>The most trifling and fantastic tricks of inheritance are quoted in support of the transmutation theory; but little is said of the sudden apparition of powerful original qualities, which almost always rise like pure creations, and are <pb id="p.779" n="779"/> gone with their day and generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5236"/>The noblest gifts are exceptional, and are rarely inherited; this very fact seems to me an evidence of something more and higher than mere evolution and transmission concerned in the problem of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5237"/>In the same way the matter of natural and sexual selection is susceptible of very various interpretations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5238"/>No doubt, on the whole, Nature protects her best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5239"/>But it would not be difficult to bring together an array of facts as striking as those produced by the evolutionists in favor of their theory, to show that sexual selection is by no means always favorable to the elimination of the chaff, and the preservation of the wheat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5240"/>A natural attraction, independent of strength or beauty, is an unquestionable element in this problem, and its action is seen among animals as well as among men. The fact that fine progeny are not infrequently the offspring of weak parents, and <hi rend="italics">vice versa</hi>, points, perhaps, to some innate power of redress by which the caprices of choice are counterbalanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5241"/>But there can be no doubt that types are as often endangered as protected by the so-called law of sexual selection.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5242"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">As to the influence of climate and physical conditions,</q> he continues, <q direct="unspecified">we all know <pb id="p.780" n="780"/> their power for evil and for good upon living beings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5243"/>But there is, nevertheless, nothing more striking in the whole book of nature than the power shown by types and species to resist physical conditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5244"/>Endless evidence may be brought from the whole expanse of land and air and water, showing that identical physical conditions will do nothing toward the merging of species into <num value="1">one</num> another, neither will variety of conditions do anything toward their multiplication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5245"/><num value="1">One</num> thing only we know absolutely, and in this treacherous, marshy ground of hypothesis and assumption, it is pleasant to plant <num value="1">one</num>'s foot occasionally upon a solid fact here and there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5246"/>Whatever be the means of preserving and transmitting properties, the primitive types have remained permanent and unchanged,&mdash;in the long succession of ages, amid all the appearance and disappearance of kinds, the fading away of <num value="1">one</num> species and the coming in of another,&mdash;from the earliest geological periods to the present day. How these types were <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> introduced, how the species which have successively represented them have replaced <num value="1">one</num> another,&mdash; these are the vital questions to which no answer has been given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5247"/>We are as far from any satisfactory solution of this problem as <pb id="p.781" n="781"/> if development theories had never been dis-Cussed.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5248"/></p> 
<p>In conclusion, he sketches the plan of these articles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5249"/><q direct="unspecified">I hope in future articles to show, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that, however broken the geological record may be, there is a complete sequence in many parts of it, from which the character of the succession may be ascertained; secondly, that, since the most exquisitely delicate structures, as well as embryonic phases of growth of the most perishable nature, have been preserved from very early deposits, we have no right to infer the disappearance of types because their absence disproves some favorite theory; and, lastly, that there is no evidence of a direct descent of later from earlier species in the geological succession of animals</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5250"/>This paper contained the sentence so often quoted since, <q direct="unspecified">A physical fact is as sacred as a moral principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5251"/>Our own nature demands from us this double allegiance.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5252"/>This expressed the secret of his whole life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5253"/>Every fact in nature was sacred to him, as part of an intellectual conception expressed in the history of the earth and the beings living upon it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5254"/>On the <dateStruct value="-12-2"><day reg="2">2d</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, he was called to a meeting of the <rs>Massachusetts Board</rs> of <pb id="p.782" n="782"/> Agriculture at <placeName key="tgn,7013763" n="1.000 19" reg="fitchburg, worcester county, massachusetts">Fitchburg</placeName>, where he lectured in the evening on <q direct="unspecified">The structural growth of domesticated animals.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5255"/>Those who accompanied him, and knew the mental and physical depression which had hung about him for weeks, could not see him take his place on the platform, without anxiety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5256"/>And yet, when he turned to the blackboard, and, with a single sweep of the chalk, drew the faultless outline of an egg, it seemed impossible that anything could be amiss with the hand or the brain that were so steady and so clear.</p> 
<p>
