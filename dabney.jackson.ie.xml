<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>The cause for which <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0001.00000.00002" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Thomas,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> fought and died, has been overthrown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>But it is believed that this fact has not diminished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>the affectionate reverence for his memory, and interest in his exploits, felt by those who labored with him in that cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>On the contrary, they regard the events which have occurred since his lamented death, as farther evidences of his genius and prowess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Although he who undertakes to write the history of an acknowledged failure usually has a hopeless and discouraging topic, yet the lustre of <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s exploits and character is too bright to be dimmed, even by disaster: and his is universally admitted, by his friends and foes; to be a name so spotless that it shines independent of the cause with which he was connected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>My chief motive for supplying this customary exordium to my book, is the wish to answer the natural question in the reader's mind, what right I suppose myself to have, to claim qualification for the task I have assumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>My answer is, that it has been entrusted to me by the widow and family of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0001.00000.00003" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Thomas,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, supported by the urgency of his successor in command, <persName n="Ewell,Lieutenant-General,,,," id="n0013.0001.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</roleName> <surname>Ewell</surname></persName>, of his venerable pastor, and of many other friends, in, and out of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/><num value="1">One</num> advantage for my work, I may claim, which brings far more of responsibility than of credit to me, in the possession of the fullest collection of materials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The correspondence of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0001.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Thomas,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> with his family, his pastor, and his most prominent friends in public life, has been in my hands, together with copies of all the important official papers on file in the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> of the late <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>I have had the advantage of the fullest illustrations of the battle-fields and the <pb id="p.vi" n="vi"/> theatre of war where <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0001.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Thomas,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> acted, from the topographical department of the same government, and from careful personal inspection: It was also my privilege to enjoy his friendship, although not under his orders, during the campaign of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>; and to serve next his person, as chief of his Staff, during the memorable campaigns of the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> and the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, in <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>So that I had personal knowledge of the events on which the structure of his military fame was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reared. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>My prime object has been to portray and vindicate his <name>Christian</name> character, that his countrymen may possess it as a precious example, and may honor that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in it, whom he so delighted to honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It is for this purpose that the attempt was made so carefully to explain and defend his action, as citizen and soldier, in recent events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Next, it was desired to unfold his military genius, as displayed in his campaigns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The prominent characteristic of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0001.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Thomas,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was his scrupulous truthfulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>This Life has been written under the profound impression, that no quality could be so appropriate as this, in the narrative which seeks to commemorate his noble character Hence, the most laborious pains have been taken to verify every fact, and to give the story in its sober accuracy, and with impartial justice to all. I am well aware that perfection is not the privilege of man, in any of his works; and hence I must be prepared to be convinced, by the criticisms of others, that I have not been wholly successful in this aim. But I trust I have been so far successful, as to receive credit for right intentions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>And especially would I declare, that in relating the share borne by <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0001.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Thomas,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>'s comrades and subordinates in his campaigns, I have been actuated by a cordial and friendly desire to do justice to all. If I shall seem to any to have done less than this, it will be my misfortune, and not my intention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>If my story presents the hero without any of those <hi rend="italics">bizarre</hi> traits, which the popular fancy loves to find in its especial favorites, it is hoped that the picture will be, for this reason, more symmetrical, and if not so startling, more pleasing to every cultivated mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The reader may at least have the satisfaction of knowing that it is the correct picture, save that no pencil can do justice to his <pb id="p.vii" n="vii"/> devoted patriotism, his diligence, his courage, and the sanctity of his morals. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The reader will note a certain polemic tone in the discussions which attend the narrative; and while strict truthfulness has been studied, candid expression has been given to the feelings natural to a participant in the recent struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The explanation is, in part, this: that the whole work was written before the termination of the contest ; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> portion, containing all the controversial matter, was published in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> more than a year ago, and has been circulated in that country and this; and the remainder of the biography was in process of publication when the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> surrendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The <foreign lang="la">animus</foreign> of my book will not appear strange to any <num value="1">one</num> who remembers, that when it was published, my fellow-citizens were universally engaged in a strenuous war against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and I was myself in the <orgName n="Military Commission" type="commission">military commission of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The question may be asked, Does not the termination of that contest by the complete submission of the <rs>South</rs>, point out the propriety of modifying the tone of the work?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>After a careful consideration of this question, I have been constrained to believe, that it was best to leave my original work substantially untouched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>As has been stated, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="8">eight</num> chapters, containing all that is most controversial, had been irrevocably given to the public, many months before the end of the war. To attempt to recall and suppress it now, would appear rather a foolish scrupulosity than sound wisdom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Nor would this course be consistent with the interests of literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It has been often said, that cotemporaries cannot write impartial histories of their own times, because of their too lively sympathy with the passions which agitate the actors; It is more certainly true, that if cotemporaries do not write, with such partiality or impartiality as they may, it will be impossible for any other historian in posterity, to write a truthful narrative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>None but eye-witnesses and actors can contribute the facts, which are to be the materials of future history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>And their facts are esteemed by the philosophic and judicial compiler of the subsequent age, as scarcely more important than their <hi rend="italics">animus</hi>. He wishes to know, not only what men did, but how they felt,--how the events transpiring <pb id="p.viii" n="viii"/> affected them,--from what impulses and views they acted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>While he does not blindly adopt the passions of either party, it is these which enable him to reproduce the very complexion and color of the times he describes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Hence, it is for the interests of historic truth that those who describe cotemporary events, should give candid expression to the emotions of their times. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>It may also be asked: Does not the duty of promoting mutual forbearance, and the restoration of good feeling between the sections lately at war, require the suppression of controverted opinions, and of accusations, which, however true, can now be urged with no good result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>In answering this objection, I shall candidly acknowledge myself utterly sceptical, both by temperament and conviction, of that deceitful and glozing philosophy, by which it is dictated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>There is no true and solid basis for public well-being, but rectitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The truth, manfully spoken, can never be unwholesome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>If the complaints of the conquered section are just, then they ought to be stated and discussed, until a stable foundation for peace, good government, good feeling, and prosperity, is laid in just and magnanimous treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>If those complaints are unjust, still it is best that they be candidly stated, respectfully listened to, and calmly discussed, as long as they are sincerely entertained in the hearts of the sufferers: for only in this way can they be eradicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>It is to me simply incredible, that a people so shrewd and practical as those of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, should expect us to have discarded, through the logic of the sword merely, the convictions of a lifetime; or that they could be deceived by us, should we be base enough to assert it of ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>They know that the people of the <rs>South</rs> were conquered, and not convinced; and that the authority of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was accepted by us from necessity, and not from preference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Should they hear the <rs>Southern</rs> people now disclaiming and reprobating the principles which are unfolded in my book as the animating principles of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0001.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Thomas,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, they must inevitably remember, that this Southern people, <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> ago, was unanimously applauding and inciting him in acting them out: so that it would be self-evident to our conquerors, that we were either traitorously false to our darling hero, then; or are equally false to them, <pb id="p.ix" n="ix"/> now. The people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have too much shrewdness ever to suppose, that the sons of the <name>Revolutionary</name> sires who, as their comrades, assisted in winning liberty from the <rs>British Lion</rs>, and who have recently given new proofs of their undegenerate manhood, are spaniels, to be made affectionate by stripes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The people of the <rs>South</rs> went to war, because they sincerely believed (what their political fathers had taught them, with <num value="1">one</num> voice, for <num value="2">two</num> generations) that the doctrine of State-sovereignty for which they fought, was absolutely essential as the bulwark of the liberties of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>They have been convinced by main force, that they are unable to save that doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The only way to make them truly loyal again to the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, is to convince them by just treatment, that they went to war under a misapprehension, and that their liberties may still be securely and fully enjoyed under a consolidated government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It would be only a useless and degrading concealment, for the people of the <rs>South</rs> to profess a suppression of the honest convictions upon which they have lately acted, either at the dictate of deceit on their part, or of persecution on the part of their conquerors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>For these reasons, it has appeared to me every way most manly and beneficial, to leave this explication and defence of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0001.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Thomas,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>'s resistance to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, as it was written during the progress of the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Its suppression would conceal nothing, and deceive nobody: its publication will give to subsequent generations a lively picture of the temper of the times. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>But I am ready to add, with equal candor, that when I thus declare boldly the principles upon which the <name>Virginians</name> of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> acted, I do not intend to be understood as retracting that acquiescence in the result of the arbitrament of the sword, and that submission promised by me in common with almost the whole <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>I have voluntarily sworn to obey the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, as at present established and expounded to us by force of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>That oath it is my purpose to keep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The Federal agent who administered it to me taught me expressly that its obligation was of this extent, and no more: that it did not bind me to think or say the principles on which <pb id="p.x" n="x"/> I had acted were erroneous; but to abstain, in future, from the assertion of them by force of arms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>It only remains to add a few words in explanation of the illustrations which accompany the text.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It is earnestly recommended to the attentive reader, that he shall connect his perusal of the descriptive parts of the narrative with a careful study of the map of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 32" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>This is so accessible to all <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0013.0001.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>, that it was thought superfluous to burden this work with the expense of its insertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>A simple diagram is inserted, to facilitate the comprehension of each of the more important battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>These plates have been carefully prepared, from actual inspections and surveys, made by <orgName n="Confederate Engineers" type="org">Confederate engineers</orgName>; but they are simplified by leaving out all except the most essential lines and features.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The intelligent reader, even though not a military man, will readily apprehend, that the representation of the positions of brigades and divisions of troops in action, by lines upon a diagram, can only be approximately correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The lines of ink are, of course, stationary; the lines of troops in action are never long so. The relative position assigned to <num value="2">two</num> divisions on the diagram may be a correct representation of their relation on the field of actual strife, for a fleeting moment only; a minute more may have changed it. The diagram must, perforce, either contain both of <num value="2">two</num> divisions at once, which in fact only occupied the field successively; or it must suggest a still graver error, by the total omission of <num value="1">one</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>But if these obvious considerations are borne in mind, and the illustrations are studied in connection with the narrative, they will convey no mistake, and will be found to represent, with general correctness, the positions and movements of the <rs>Confederate</rs> troops. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>His kind hostess remonstrated against this purpose as a childish whim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>It would seem that the husband of his aunt, though an honest, was an exacting man, and had made the mistake of attempting to govern the orphan through force, instead of through his understanding and conscience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>And the singular child, having concluded that his stay under his authority would never be congenial, had calmly determined, with the same inexorable will which he displayed in after years, to end the connexion at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>From <persName n="Jackson,Judge,,,," id="n0013.0002.00013.00073" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,John,G.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>'s he went to a favorite cousin's, lately married and living in her own house, and asked leave of her to spend the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>In the course of the evening he announced his purpose of leaving his home, and, after listening respectfully to her remonstrances likewise, returned resolutely to his old formula: <quote>No; <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Brake</foreName></persName> and I don't agree; I have quit there; I shall not go back any more.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Accordingly, the next morning, he set out from <placeName reg="Clarksburg, Harrison, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117793">Clarksburg</placeName> alone, and travelled on foot to the former home of his grandfather, in <placeName reg="Lewis, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002271">Lewis County</placeName>, about <measure n="18miles" type="distance">eighteen miles distant</measure>, then belonging to <persName n="Jackson,,Cummins,,," id="n0013.0002.00013.00074" reg="default:Jackson,Cummins,,,"><foreName>Cummins</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, the half-brother of his father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>It was the more attractive to him that his elder brother, <persName n="Warren,,,,," id="n0013.0002.00013.00077" reg="mostcommon:Warren,nomatch:0"><surname>Warren</surname></persName>, was now sharing the same refuge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>This remarkable man deserves our notice, not only for his paternal kindness to the orphan, but for the influence which he exerted, and for that which, contrary to all human calculation, he failed to exert upon him. He was <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> then approaching middle life, a bachelor, of lofty stature and most athletic frame, and full of all the rugged energy of his race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>The native powers of his mind, although not cultivated by a liberal education, were so strong, that some of his acquaintances have declared him to be, in their opinion, the ablest man they ever knew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>His will was as strong as his understanding, and his passions were vehement and enduring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>As a friend, he was steadfast, and generous, without stint; and, though forbearing and slow to take offence, as an enemy he was equally bitter and unforgiving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>Such was his liberality, that his poorer neighbors and dependants adored him. He never had political aspirations for himself, but his unbounded influence usually gave the honors of his country to the person whom he favored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>Yet his business morals, save when he was bound by his own voluntary promises, which he always sacredly fulfilled, were accounted unscrupulous; and he was so passionately fond of litigation, that his legal controversies consumed a large part of the income of a liberal estate and the earnings of his own giant industry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>He owned a valuable farm and mills, and was <num value="1">one</num> of the largest slaveholders in the county of <placeName reg="Lewis, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002271">Lewis</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>His occupations were agriculture, and the preparation of lumber and flour, diversified with the hardy sports of a forest country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>He received all the privileges of a son of the family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>The relation existing between him and his uncle was, from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, remarkable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>He treated the little boy more as a companion than as a child, soothing for him all the ruggedness of his nature, imparting to him his plans and thoughts as though to an equal and counsellor, making him his delighted pupil in all the rural arts in which he was himself an unrivalled adept, and always rather requesting than demanding <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> his compliance with the discipline of his household.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>The child was thus stimulated in the work of his own self-government from a very early period, and left to an independence of action more suited for a man. But he did not disappoint his uncle's confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>His peculiar method with the boy may perhaps be accounted for in part by the singular temperament of the race &mdash; passionately attached to the idea of independence; in part by the relaxation of parental restraints, which usually prevails in new countries; and partly by the profound sagacity of the guardian, who saw at a glance the noble nature with which he had to deal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>He showed his affection, also, by earnestly seeking for <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0013.0002.00015.00079" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, as well as for his elder brother, the best education he could place within their reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>He required of them a regular attendance upon the country school of the neighborhood, which <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0013.0002.00015.00080" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName> was prompt to render; but <persName n="Warren,,,,," id="n0013.0002.00015.00081" reg="mostcommon:Warren,nomatch:0"><surname>Warren</surname></persName> chafed under its restraints.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>He was now a hardy lad of <measure n="14years" type="date">fourteen years</measure> old, and, Jackson-like, began to feel his self-reliance, and to find the bread of dependence irksome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>His discontent was probably increased by the consciousness that his little brother was more the favorite than himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>He therefore demanded that he should be allowed to seek his own fortunes, and choose his own home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>His uncle, characteristically, gave him leave to please himself; and he departed, after a few months' residence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>But he also induced <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0013.0002.00015.00082" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, partly by his affection for him, and partly by the assumption of the authority of a senior, to go with him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>This relative also received them with cordial kindness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>He soon wearied again of the restraint, and, taking his little brother, the next spring he went down the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio river</placeName>, and disappeared from the knowledge of his friends for a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>In the fall of the year they returned, by the charity of some steamboat-master, travel-soiled, ragged, and emaciated by the ague.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>Their story was that they had floated down to the junction of the <rs>Ohio</rs> with the <rs>Father</rs> of Waters, seeking adventures and a livelihood, until at length they contracted to cut firewood for the furnaces of the steamers, on <num value="1">one</num> of the lonely islands of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, near the southwestern corner of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Here the <num value="2">two</num> children had spent the summer alone, living in a temporary cabin, earning their bread by this rough labor, amidst the dreary forests of cottonwood, and encircled by the turbid river; until their sufferings from the ague compelled them to seek a way homewards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>How strange a world this for the fair and pensive child of <num value="9">nine</num> summers!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>But such was the sturdiness of his nature, that he seemed scarcely to feel either its incongruity or its hardship.

Thenceforward /his opportunities for education were just such as they would have been, had he been the heir of such a citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Classical academies were, unknown in the country; and the sons of the most respectable persons, with the exception of a few who were sent Eastward for an education, were content with the plain studies of a country school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>But the practical success and usefulness of many of the sons of the soil, besides <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0002.00017.00095" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Cummins,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, have given proof that book-learning is by no means the only instrument of an efficient education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>He seems to have been at all times eager for self-improvement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>A worthy man, <persName n="Ray,Mister,Robert,P.,," id="n0013.0002.00017.00096" reg="default:Ray,Robert,P.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Ray</surname></persName>, then taught an English school at <placeName reg="Cummins Jackson's mills">Cummins Jackson's mills</placeName>, where <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0013.0002.00017.00097" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, in company with the sons of the surrounding landholders, received the usual plain education of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Out of that school came several others who have not only been respectable citizens of their district, but have risen to influence as legislators or professional men. <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0013.0002.00017.00098" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName> showed no quickness of aptitude for any of his studies, except arithmetic; in this he always outstripped his schoolmates, seemingly without effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>In all other branches his acquisitions were only made by patient labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>If he professed to be prepared for a recitation, all might be certain that he was thoroughly prepared; from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the intense honesty of his nature, and the sober judgment, with which <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> he preferred the substance to the name of an acquisition, were singular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Nothing could induce him to leave a lesson behind him unmastered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>If he had not been able to finish a previous <num value="1">one</num> at the same time with his class-mates, he would continue to study it while they proceeded to the next, and when called on for his share of the succeeding recitation, he would flatly declare that he knew nothing about it, that he had not yet had time to begin it, and that all his time had been occupied upon the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Thus he was, not seldom, nominally behind his class; but whatever he once gained was his forever; and his knowledge, though limited, was perfect as far as it went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>His temperament at this time was cheerful, amiable, and generous; and his demeanor instinctively courteous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>His truthfulness was at all times proverbial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>To an intimate friend he once said, that so far as he remembered he had never violated the exact truth in his life, save once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>This instance was <num value="1">one</num> which many would justify, and most would palliate; but he himself condemned it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>At length the young lieutenant went alone, far before his men, and waving his sword shouted to them: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>You see there is no danger; forward!</p></quote> Yet, as he confessed, he knew at the moment that he was in extreme peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>At school he was also noted for a strong sense of justice, which made him as respectful towards the rights of others as tenacious of his own. As long as he was fairly treated by his playmates, <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> his temper was perfectly gentle and complying; but if be believed himself wronged, his resistance was inexorable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>In his occasional combats with his fellows, while superiorstrength might sometimes overpower him, it could never force him to acknowledge defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>The victor might cuff him until he desisted from sheer weariness, but <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0013.0002.00019.00100" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName> was still unsubdued, and ready to renew the fight whenever his antagonist dared to assail him. He was withal never moping nor surly, but always ready for the merry romp or play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>He was not peculiarly swift of foot, but he usually led his playmates in jumping and climbing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>When the school was divided into <num value="2">two</num> companies for a game of bat and ball, or prisoners'-base, he was always captain of <num value="1">one</num>, and his side was sure to win. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>In all <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, the owners of land and their sons were accustomed to labor on their farms with their own hands, more than any population of equal wealth and comfort in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>This was the consequence partly, of the industrious habits which the <rs>Presbyterian Scotch</rs> and <rs>Irish</rs>, the ruling caste in those regions, brought from their native lands; partly of the comparative scarcity of labor, both slave and hired; and partly, of the absence of the abundant means of literary and professional cultivation, which an older society offers to the wealthy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Even in the households of slaveholders, like <persName n="Jackson,,Cummins,,," id="n0013.0002.00019.00101" reg="default:Jackson,Cummins,,,"><foreName>Cummins</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, who in that country were few, the males, when not at school, were regularly occupied in rural labors, except in that large allowance of time reserved for country sports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>The reader will thus understand that <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0013.0002.00019.00102" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, although in no sense reduced by his orphanage to a condition beneath that of the youths around him, was occupied, like his uncle, in the works of the farm and mills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Here he was always resolute and efficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/><num value="1">One</num> of his most frequent tasks seems to have been, to transport from the woods the huge stems of the poplars and <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> oaks, to be converted by the saw-mill into lumber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>He became thus a famous driver of oxen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>If any tree was to be moved from ground of unusual difficulty, or if it was more gigantic than the rest, the party of laborers was put under his command, and the work was sure to be effected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>In this manner his life was passed from <num value="9">nine</num> to <measure n="16years" type="date">sixteen years</measure> of age, between the labors of the school and of the farm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>He was then, like his father, of short stature, but compact and muscular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>He was capable of fatigue, and of indomitable physical endurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>His bearing was unpretending, but manly and courteous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>But his constitution, even then, gave signs of infirmity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>An obscure disease of the stomach and other organs of nutrition had seized upon him, harassing him with chronic irritations or prostrations of the nerves, sleepless nights, and lassitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>A year or <num value="2">two</num> later, notwithstanding the means used to re-establish his constitution, these symptoms assumed the more ominous form of a slight paralysis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>The latter, however, wore away after a time; and, about his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> year at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> his system seemed to escape a part of its burdens; he grew rapidly to a tall stature, and thus, instead of remaining short, like his father, he was conformed to the usual standard of his race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>But the other affection clave to him, like a Nemesis, during his whole youth and the war with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, and never relaxed its hold until after he came to <placeName reg="Lexington, Fayette, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013887">Lexington</placeName> as <rs type="role2">Professor</rs> in the <orgName n="Military Institute" type="institute">Military Institute</orgName>, when he subdued it by means of the waters of the alum springs of <placeName key="tgn,2002186" n="1.000 7" reg="rockbridge, virginia, united states">Rockbridge</placeName>, in connection with his admirable temperance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>His habits of uncomplaining endurance, and his modest reluctance to every display savoring of egotism, concealed the larger part of these sufferings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>It should be remembered, in order that we may appreciate his capacity and energy, that his arduous studies at the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">military academy</orgName>, and his brilliant <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> services in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, were performed by him while hag-ridden from time to time by this wretched tormentor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>The post of Constable in the northern half of <placeName reg="Lewis, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002271">Lewis County</placeName> became about this time vacant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>His friends procured the appointment for him, for <num value="2">two</num> reasons: <num value="1">one</num> was, that the life on horseback, it was hoped, might remove his disease and give him a firm constitution; the other was, that the little salary of the place might enable him to realize his ardent desire for a liberal education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>So general was the favor borne him, and the desire to forward his aspirations for advancement, that the <rs type="place">Court</rs> winked at the irregularity of appointing a minor to this office, accepting the suretyship of his uncle as a sufficient guarantee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>We now see the manly youth, with his account-book and bag of bills and executions, traversing on horseback the hills of <persName n="Lewis,,,,," id="n0013.0002.00021.00103" reg="mostcommon:Lewis,nomatch:0"><surname>Lewis</surname></persName>, a county then so large that the major parts of <num value="5">five</num> counties have since been carved out of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>The Justices of the <name>Peace</name>, besides the <rs type="place">County</rs> Courts which they hold jointly, are authorized to decide singly, in their own neighborhood, upon controversies for property or money, where the sum in dispute does not exceed <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">twenty dollars</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>The Justice, as conservator of the peace, may also issue his warrant for the arrest and examination of any person suspected of crime, however grave; and in this preliminary stage of proceedings, the <rs>Constable</rs> is his agent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>This officer is also charged with the regulating of certain misdemeanors, and with the enforcement on slaves and free negroes of the police regulations peculiar to their condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>He is, in a word, a sort of minor sheriff. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>In everything he was scrupulously exact; his engagements were uniformly kept; and the little claims intrusted to him for collection were always safe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>While never cruel in the exercise of the powers of his place, he strictly enforced upon others a punctual compliance with their promises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>In these duties his nerve was sometimes tried; but he always carried his point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/><num value="1">One</num> instance may be related, as illustrating his courage and resource.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>About <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> from the little village of <placeName reg="Weston, Lewis, West Virginia" key="tgn,2120416">Weston</placeName>, the county seat of <persName n="Lewis,,,,," id="n0013.0002.00022.00106" reg="mostcommon:Lewis,nomatch:0"><surname>Lewis</surname></persName>, there lived a man, who, under a garb of great religiousness, concealed an unscrupulous character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/><persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0002.00022.00107" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Cummins,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> held an execution against his property for a little claim of <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollars</measure>, which the creditor had more than once urged him to collect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>After indulging the debtor for a time, and advising him rather to earn or borrow the sum than suffer the sale of some article of his property, he exacted from him a firm promise that, on a certain day, he would meet him in <placeName reg="Weston, Lewis, West Virginia" key="tgn,2120416">Weston</placeName>, and, without further trouble, pay him the debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>He then told the creditor that, on the evening of that day, his money would be ready for him. At the appointed day, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0002.00022.00108" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Cummins,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was in <placeName reg="Weston, Lewis, West Virginia" key="tgn,2120416">Weston</placeName>, but no debtor appeared; and when the creditor came to receive his claim, he redeemed his punctuality by paying it out of his own purse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>He then quietly remained in the village until the next morning, when, as he expected, the delinquent appeared in the street with a very good horse., It seems that there was, in their rude community, a sort of <hi rend="italics">lex non script</hi>, established by usage, and more sacredly observed, perhaps, than many of the statutes of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, forbidding that any person should be taken by force, on any plea, from the back of his horse, and justifying the most extreme resistance to such a disgrace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>Selecting a time, therefore, when his debtor was dismounted, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0002.00022.00109" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Cummins,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> went up and taxed him with his breach of promise, reminded him of his long <pb id="p.23" n="23"/> endurance of these deceptions, and was proceeding to seize the horse to satisfy his execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>The other party, who had no idea of ever paying his debts, resisted, and a furious fight began in the street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>During the engagement, he availed himself of a momentary advantage, and remounted his horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>Here, now, was a dilemma for the young representative of the law. On the <num value="1">one</num> hand, his adversary seemed safely enthroned in that position which the sacred custom of the vicinage pronounced unassailable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>But, on the other hand, it was not in his nature to accept defeat where his conscience told him he was in the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Clinging to the horse's bridle, he looked around, and perceived at some distance the low-browed door of a friend's stable standing open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>To this he forced the horse, amidst a shower of unregarded cuffs from his enemy, who found himself, by these ludicrous tactics, placed between the alternatives of being struck off by the lintel of the door, or else sliding from the saddle and relinquishing the horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>He prudently adopted the latter, and <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0002.00023.00110" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Cummins,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> secured the prize triumphantly in the stable, while yet he respected, at least in the letter, the common law of the neighborhood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>But these occupations proved more favorable to the health of his body than of his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>They necessarily separated him much from home influences, and brought him acquainted with the worst people of his vicinage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Nor could his home influences be considered very auspicious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>His aunts, before this period, had married, and the establishment of his uncle was that of a bachelor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>He kept race-horses, made up country race-matches, and employed his nephew as his favorite rider, whenever he expected a close <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>It was the gossip of all the country-side, that if a horse had any winning qualities in him, they would inevitably come out when young <persName n="Jackson,,Tom,,," id="n0013.0002.00024.00112" reg="default:Jackson,Tom,,,"><foreName>Tom</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> rode him in the race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Moreover, the general morals of the community were loose, and irregularities too often found most countenance from those of highest station.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>The Christianity of the region was not influential; ministers were few, and deficient in intelligence and weight, being chiefly the most uncultivated members of the <rs>Baptist</rs> communion, or of the itinerant fraternity of the <name>Methodists</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>If the citizens saw anything of Episcopacy or Presbyterianism, it was only from the transient visits and sermons of ministers from a distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>The state of religious opinion was just what the observing man would expect from such influences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>The profession of Christianity was chiefly confined to the more ignorant classes; and among them Church discipline and <name>Christian</name> morals were relaxed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Men of the ruling houses, like the <name>Jacksons</name>, were too often found to be corrupted by the power and wealth, with which the teeming fertility of their new country was rewarding their talents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Minds such as theirs, self-educated by the activity and competition of their bustling times, were too vigorous to acknowledge the intellectual sway of a class of ministers who dispensed, for sermons, their crude notions of experimental piety, in barbarous <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0013.0002.00024.00113" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>There were few cultivated minds to represent the authority of the gospel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Consequently, most of the men of position were openly neglectful of Christianity, and some were infidels. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>No <num value="1">one</num> will wonder, then, that as young <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0002.00024.00114" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> approached manhood, his conduct became somewhat irregular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>He was, as he himself declared, an ardent frequenter of races, of <quote>houseraisings,</quote> and of country-dances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>But still his industry remained; his truthfulness and honesty continued untarnished; and the substantial foundations of integrity were never undermined <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> in his nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>His irregularities were never more than temporary foibles, and they yielded to the wholesome influences of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> discipline at,the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">military academy</orgName>, and to the encouragement of better prospects and gratified aspirations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>During the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year's course, the <quote>demerits</quote> incurred show some remains of his wilder habits; but even then his comrades found in him nothing low or vile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>And thenceforward he appeared at home, during vacations, perfectly exemplary in his demeanor, and at the school, regular, laborious, truthful, scorning everything base; modest, yet self-reliant; and although inexperienced in some of the forms of society, ever full of intrinsic dignity and courtesy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>It is manifest that his nature was intensely ambitious and aspiring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>He thirsted eagerly for knowledge, and for wellearned distinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>He knew himself to be a depressed scion of a noble and influential stock; and while he felt no morbid shame at his poverty, he longed to reinstate himself in the foremost ranks of the kindred, from which orphanage and destitution had thrust him down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>This was the ruling desire, the purpose of his early manhood, and it gives us the key to many of the singularities of his character; to his hunger for selfimprovement; to his punctilious observance, from a boy, of the essentials of a gentlemanly bearing, even where he was ignorant of its conventionalities; to the uniform assertion of his selfrespect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>The wonder is, that the circumstances which surrounded him did not make him, simply, another <persName n="Jackson,,Cummins,,," id="n0013.0002.00025.00115" reg="default:Jackson,Cummins,,,"><foreName>Cummins</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>The generous kindness of this uncle, the force of his example, the similarity of the <num value="2">two</num> in the strength and ardor of their natures, and the impress of a will so energetic and commanding, would seem naturally to tend to that result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>Was it not due to that noble constitution of his nature, that reverence for the true and the right, that manly courage which the <name>Creator</name> impressed upon it, for his own ulterior ends, coupled with the purifying force of a Christian mother's teachings and prayers? </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>The officer thus incurs a responsibility from which he must absolve himself, either by collecting and paying over to him the <pb id="p.27" n="27"/> amount of the claim, or by making every lawful effort to do so, and showing that it was impracticable, by reason either of the insolvency or evasion of the creditor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>It chanced that this was a season of stringency in the currency of the region, and his uncle found himself unable at the time to raise ready money for his outfit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>The consequence was, that a few suits were brought against the latter, as his security, for the payment of sums thus claimed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>He, indeed, probably regarded this as rather good luck than ill, as it gave him additional occasion to exercisehis restless mind in his beloved work of litigation; and his generosity to <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0013.0002.00027.00121" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName> made him cheerfully pay the deficit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>To <num value="1">one</num> claimant, for whom he had collected a variety of small sums at different times, thus making a somewhat intricate series of transactions, he said that this party ought to be able to remetmber the receipt of various payments on account, for which the written evidence was now lost; and that when the recollection <pb id="p.28" n="28"/> was distinct and undeniable, he should insist on having credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>He required his antagonist to go over the whole account on this plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>In the next class, the studies were more extended and abstruse; but the examination at the end of his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> year showed him <num value="18" type="ordinal">18th</num> in mathematics, <num value="52" type="ordinal">52d</num> in <persName n="French,,,,," id="n0013.0003.00034.00153" reg="mostcommon:French,nomatch:0"><surname>French</surname></persName>, <num value="68" type="ordinal">68th</num> in drawing, and <num value="55" type="ordinal">55th</num> in engineering studies; while he had incurred <num value="26">26</num> demerits, and ranked <num value="30" type="ordinal">30th</num> in general merit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>In the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> class, he proceeded from pure mathematics to chemistry and natural philosophy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>His course was still more decidedly improved, and placed him at the end of the year in natural philosophy, <num value="11" type="ordinal">11th</num>; in chemistry, <num value="25" type="ordinal">25th</num>; in drawing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/><num value="59" type="ordinal">59th</num>; with no demerit for the year, and in general merit, <num value="20" type="ordinal">20th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>In the studies of the final year, he was <num value="12" type="ordinal">12th</num> in engineering, <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num> in ethics, <num value="11" type="ordinal">11th</num> in artillery, <num value="21" type="ordinal">21st</num> in infantry-tactics, and <num value="11" type="ordinal">11th</num> in mineralogy and geology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>His demerit marks were <num value="7">seven</num>, but, as he assured his friends, he might have wholly escaped these by laying the delinquencies charged to him upon comrades to whom they rightly belonged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>He preferred to bear the undeserved blame, rather than break silence against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>His general standing as a graduate was <num value="17" type="ordinal">17th</num>, notwithstanding the less successful years at the beginning, which were taken into <pb id="p.35" n="35"/> the account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>An examination of these records will show a steady progress; and, if the deficient preparation of his beginning be considered, there is evidence of a scholastic ability and acquirement very little below the highest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>But scholastic ability is not the real test of a great mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>It also appears that he was usually least successful in a study when it was novel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>In the science of military engineering, for instance, his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year's study placed him only <num value="55" type="ordinal">55th</num>, but his last year <num value="12" type="ordinal">12th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>He seems never to have become an adept in drawing; indeed nature had not gifted him with much of that manual dexterity, which is here more essential than even taste and correctness of eye. His greatest success was in ethics, where his grade was <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num>-a correct prognostic of that transcendent ability in statesmanship and moral reasoning, which every great commander must possess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>His teachers and comrades judged his mind sound and strong, but not quick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>It was a frequent remark among the latter, that if the course were <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> longer than it was, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0003.00035.00154" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> would assuredly graduate at the head of his class. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>His manners, when he appeared at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, have been already described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>When He returned upon furlough to his friends, they noted a great and progressive change in his person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> year he grew, as it were by a leap, to the height of <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure>. His bearing, though still deficient in ease, was punctiliously courteous and dignified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>He was scrupulously neat in all his appointments, and, in his handsome cadet uniform, made a most soldierly appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>At the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">military academy</orgName> he was not morose, but reserved almost to shyness; fond of animated conversation and of the collision of intellect, when alone with <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of his few intimates, but in a larger circle, a silent interested listener.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>The society there was usually stratified very distinctly, <pb id="p.36" n="36"/> according to the classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>The <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>-class men, under the humble title of <hi rend="italics">plebes</hi>, were the fags of all above them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>At each stage of his advancement the cadet gained new privileges, which made him look down, like a superior mortal, on the younger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>Hence the intimacies of the students were confined to their own classes, save where some more aspiring youth, by reason of distinguished scholarship or social advantages, sought the society of those above him. But <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0003.00036.00155" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, in selecting his few friends, disregarded all these bonds of caste, and most frequently chose them from the classes below him. His favorite recreation was walking; and almost every afternoon he might be seen, with a single companion, striding rapidly over the picturesque hills, or sitting upon <num value="1">one</num> of the headlands which overhang the waters of the <rs>Hudson</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>In these confidential walks, his favorite topics were the graver subjects of moral reasoning, mental science, ethics, politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>He had enjoyed no collegiate training in these studies, the instruction in them at the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">military academy</orgName> was limited, and his favorite associate in these discussions was a graduate of <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs type="place">Colleges</rs> which made this branch of science prominent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>Yet, although his knowledge of the speculations of metaphysicians was limited, his friend found his notions always original, and usually correct, and his reasonings so ingenious and forcible, that he was never an easy antagonist to overcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most pleasing and noteworthy traits of his nature was his tenderness to the distressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>A case of sickness or bereavement, among the younger cadets especially, awakened all his sympathies; and he would devote himself to their help with a zeal so womanly, as to evoke the gibes of coarser natures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>Perhaps, his profound impressions of the infirmity of his own frame quickened these sensibilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>He seemed to be under a habitual fear of some chronic and fatal disease, and began even then that rigid observance of such <pb id="p.37" n="37"/> laws of health as he apprehended to be suitable to him. <num value="1">One</num> of these rules was, never to bend his body in studying, lest the compression of some of the important organs within should increase their tendency to disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>Hence he sat always bolt upright; his chair might as well have been without a back. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>It does not appear that <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0003.00037.00156" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was under the influence of vital Christianity at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>Speculatively, he was a believer; outwardly, he was observant of the decencies of religion, and his morals were pure; but the sacred impression of his mother's piety and teachings was as yet dormant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>The most authentic disclosure of his moral nature at that time is a code of behavior which he compiled for himself, and carefully engrossed in a blank book (in a large, correct, formal handwriting, that surprisingly contrasts with the indistinct, cursive style of later years) under the title of <quote>Maxims.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>These seem to have been in part selected from books of that character, and in part adopted from his own experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>They relate to morals, manners, dress, the choice of friends, and the aims of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>The standard of principle is simply that of a high secular virtue, with such reference to religious responsibilities as every thoughtful and reverent nature prompts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>But they show already that devotion to the sentiment of duty which his after-life manifested so grandly; and they reveal the loftiest aims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>It is plain that he habitually nourished the honorable ambition to make himself the very greatest of which his nature was capable; and that the limits which he assigned to this possibility were far removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>Beneath his modest reserve and silence, so contrasted with all the tricks of egotism, there burned the steady but intense purpose, to place his character and his name high upon the scale of true merit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>Perhaps the most characteristic of <pb id="p.38" n="38"/> these maxims is the following, written in a conspicuous place:-- <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/><emph rend="caps">You may be whatever you resolve to be.</emph></p></quote> We shall see that this was, to him, a most practical dogma. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>His temper was recognized at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> to be inflexible, without being petulant or aggressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>The only personal difficulty which he ever had with a fellow-student illustrates this trait; and the contrasted destiny of the <num value="2">two</num> antagonists may well impress on every young man, the dreadfulness of base and relaxed principles, and the value of integrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>The cadet who was <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s sole enemy, resembled him in capacity and the conditions of his career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>He was an orphan, from the far <rs>West</rs>, of rural training, of sound mind, and energetic and forcible character, capable of strenuous exertion, poor, and eager to advance himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>His early education had been neglected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>Like <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0003.00038.00157" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> he incurred the sportive malice of the students, on his arrival at the <name>Academy</name>, by his appearance of rusticity and inexperience, and he defended himself with so much courage and good sense, and made such progress in his studies that all were at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> inclined in his favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>There appeared no reason why he and <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0003.00038.00158" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> might not run parallel courses of honor and usefulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>But, in his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> year, he disclosed a laxity of principle, told less than the truth in order to evade <quote>demerits,</quote> and contracted degrading associations in the neighboring village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/><persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0003.00038.00159" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to perceive his lack of principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/><num value="1">One</num> day his musket, which was always scrupulously clean, was replaced by <num value="1">one</num> in most slovenly order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>He called the attention of his captain (himself a senior cadet) to this loss, and described to him his private mark by which he identified his gun. That evening at the inspection of arms, it was found in the hands of the student who has been described, and when taxed with purloining it, the latter endeavored to <pb id="p.39" n="39"/> shield himself by falsehood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/><persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0003.00039.00160" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> had been indignant that he should commit such an act from mere indolence, but now his anger was unbounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>He declared that such a nuisance should not continue a member of the <name>Academy</name>, and demanded that he should be tried by a court-martial, upon his information, and expelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>It was only by means of the most persevering remonstrances of his comrades, and of the professors, that he could be induced to waive his right of pursuing the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>The event proved that his estimate was more correct than that of his seniors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>It was not long before his opponent was under arrest for disgraceful conduct, violated his parole, and was expelled on that account, a short time before he would have graduated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>He resorted to the new <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">State of Texas</placeName>, and professed for a time to engage in the study of law. Not prospering in this, he embarked for <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>, endeavored to swindle the master of the ship out of his fare, and was summarily thrust ashore at <placeName key="tgn,1017843" n="1.000 10" reg="Mazatlan,Sinaloa,Mexico,North and Central America">Mazatlan</placeName>, on the western coast of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, without money or friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>There he wandered into the mountains, and attached himself to a roving tribe of the <rs>Tuscon Indians</rs>, among whom his skill in savage warfare, robbery, and murder, raised him to a sort of chieftainship, and the possession of half-a-dozen tawny wives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>The last intelligence which reached the civilized world concerning him was, that he and his subjects had quarrelled concerning the murder of a poor pedlar, whom he had slain for his wares; and his miserable band, less savage than himself, had expelled him from their society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/><persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0003.00039.00161" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, meantime, has filled <num value="2">two</num> hemispheres with his fame for every quality which is great and good. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>His friends asked him if he felt no trepidation when so many were falling around him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>Many Mexicans, moreover, regarded the invading army rather in the light of deliverers from a disorderly and oppressive government, than of intruders and oppressors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>Immediately after the occupation of the city, therefore, the places of amusement were re-opened, and frequented by a mingled crowd of <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0013.0004.00053.00241" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> and Mexicans, the ladies walked the streets in crowds, and the young officers began to cultivate the acquaintance of the most distinguished families. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>To qualify himself for enjoying this society more freely, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0004.00053.00242" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, with a young comrade, addressed himself to the study of the <rs>Spanish</rs> language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>His active mind was, besides, incapable of absolute repose, and he wished to improve his leisure by acquiring knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>He was ignorant of Latin, which is not taught at <placeName reg="West Point, Orange, New York" key="tgn,7014609">West Point</placeName>, and the only grammar of <persName><foreName>Spanish</foreName></persName> he could find was written in that ancient tongue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>Yet he bought it, and nothing daunted, set himself to learn <pb id="p.54" n="54"/> the paradigms of the language from it; and by the help of reading and constant conversation with the people, became in a few months a good Spanish scholar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>It was an amusing trait of his character that he appeared afterwards proud of this accomplishment, and fond of exercising it, so far as his modest nature could be said to make any manifestation of pride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>He ever took pleasure in testifying to the cultivation, hospitality, and flowing courtesy of the <rs>Spanish</rs> gentry in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>; and, like <persName n="Napier,,,,," id="n0013.0004.00054.00243" reg="mostcommon:Napier,nomatch:0"><surname>Napier</surname></persName>, among their kindred in their mother-country, acknowledged the fascination of their accomplished manners, and their noble and sonorous tongue, and the indescribable grace and beauty of their women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>Having formed the acquaintance of some educated ecclesiastics of the <rs type="place">Romish Church</rs> (probably of the order of Canons), he went, by their invitation, to reside with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>He found their bachelor abode the perfection of luxurious comfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>Upon awaking in the morning, the servants brought him, before he arose from bed, a light repast, consisting of a few diminutive spiced cakes, and a single cup of that delicious chocolate which is found only in Spanish houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>He then dressed, went out, and attended to the drill of his company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>Later in the morning, when the sun began to display his power, he returned to a breakfast of coffee, fruits, and game.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>The greater part of the day was then spent in study or visiting; and it closed with a dinner in which <placeName reg="Parisian">Parisian</placeName> art vied with the tropical fruits native to the climate in conferring enjoyment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/><num value="1">One</num> family especially among his Spanish acquaintances extended to him a hospitality for which he was always grateful, and it possessed the attraction of several charming daughters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>He confessed, years after, that he found it advisable to discontinue his visits there; and when asked the reason, said with a blush, that he found the fascination of some of the female charms which he met there was likely to become too strong for <pb id="p.55" n="55"/> his prudence, unless he escaped them in good time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>He declared that if the people of the city had been equal to their beautiful climate, in integrity and character, <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> would have been the most alluring home for him in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>But while his taste felt the charms of the <rs>Spanish</rs> grace and lofty courtesy, his sturdy <name>English</name> sense and pure honor taught him the incompatibility of a hollow and corrupt state of morals, and a debasing religion, with all his radical principles; and so he firmly withdrew himself, before his self-respect was tarnished. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>But we have now reached the most important era in <placeName reg="Jackson, Madison, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099733">Jackson</placeName>'s life; the beginning of a vital change in his religious character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>This good man was accustomed to labor as a father for the religious welfare of his young officers; and <placeName reg="Jackson, Madison, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099733">Jackson</placeName>'s manly nature seems to have awakened his especial interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>During the campaign of the summer, his instruction and prayers had produced so much effect as to awaken an abiding anxiety and spirit of inquiry in <placeName reg="Jackson, Madison, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099733">Jackson</placeName>'s mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>He acknowledged his former practical neglect of this transcendent subject, and deplored the vagueness of his religious knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>It seems to have been almost a law of his nature even before it was sanctified, that, with him, to be convinced in his understanding of a duty was to set straightway about its performance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>He resolved to make the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> his study, and with a characteristic independence of mind, to take nothing, as to his own religious duties, from prejudice, or from the claims of the various denominations into which he saw the religious world divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>His attitude towards all creeds and sects was at this time singularly unbiassed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>His parentage cannot be said to have belonged to any party in religion; his youth had been passed in a household where <pb id="p.56" n="56"/> Christianity was practically unknown; and his later education was obtained among a great company of young men, assembled from every church, under the slender instructions of an army chaplain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>His own religious knowledge was at this time extremely scanty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>Resolved to examine for himself and decide conscientiously, he concluded that there was now a rare opportunity to inform himself concerning <num value="1">one</num> church at least, the <name>Popish</name>, from a high and authentic source.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>He was surrounded by educated Papists; and he determined to hear the very best they could say in commendation of their system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>He therefore sought the acquaintance of the <rs>Archbishop</rs> of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, introduced, probably, by his monastic friends, and had a number of interviews, in which that prelate entered at large into an explanation of the <name>Romish</name> system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/><persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0004.00056.00245" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> always declared that he believed him a sincere and honest advocate of that Church, and that he found him not only affable, but able and learned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>He also said that the system, as expounded by intelligent Romanists, was by no means so gross or so obnoxious to common sense as is represented by the mass of decided Protestants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>The truth is (and herein is the subtlety of that form of error), the statements of doctrines are so artfully drawn up by the welltrained doctor of the <rs type="place">Romish Church</rs>, that they may bear always <num value="2">two</num> phases of meaning; the <num value="1">one</num> more decided and gross, the other more akin to the evangelical truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>When, for instance, <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> requires her teachers to say that, in the sinner's justification, the <quote>meritorious cause</quote> is the righteousness of <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n0013.0004.00056.00246" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName>, while the <quote>formal cause</quote> is the personal holiness inwrought by the grace of the gospel in the <rs>Christian</rs>'s soul; the words in the hands of a Jansenist, may be made almost to mean that precious truth which every evangelical <persName n="Christian,,,,," id="n0013.0004.00056.00247" reg="mostcommon:Christian,nomatch:0"><surname>Christian</surname></persName>, in every church, embraces in substance, that our acceptance before <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is only in the merits of the <name>Redeemer</name>; while, in the hands of a <pb id="p.57" n="57"/> self-righteous Jesuit, they will teach essentially a Pharisaic dependence on our own observances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>So the doctrine of peD ance and absolution, in the instruction of the former, will be made to mean little more than that the minister of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> church is commissioned to publish'therein His mercy to the truly penitent soul; while, in the teachings of the latter, it will encourage the ignorant to believe, with a gross literality, that the priest, and the priest alone, can forgive sins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>Doubtless, in the case of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0004.00057.00248" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, the skilful polemic saw that his mind was too clear and strong to be hoodwinked by the darker phase of these dogmas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>But with all the casuist's plausibility, he failed to commend Popery to his' convictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>The inquirer departed unsatisfied, clearly convinced that the system of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> and that of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> were irreconcilable, and that the true religion of <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n0013.0004.00057.00249" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName> was to be sought by him elsewhere. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>His progress towards the full light was extremely gradual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>He was henceforward conscientious, and more than ever punctilious about the purity of his life; he never remitted his interest in the great question of his own salvation; yet, for more than <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> after, he still remained in suspense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>His life here was uneventful, save in his spiritual progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>The duties of the garrison fell lightly upon him; his rank as an officer of artillery entitled him to keep a horse, and thus indulge his passion for equestrian exercise; and the society of the post, enlivened by the presence of the superior officers' families, was attractive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>Best of all, his <name>Christian</name> friend and father, <persName n="Taylor,Colonel,,,," id="n0013.0005.00059.00253" reg="nearbymention:Taylor,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>, was residing near him, and continued to extend to him his pious advice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>But his ecclesiastical views having undergone a change, he took orders in the <orgName n="Episcopal Church" type="church">Episcopal Church</orgName>; and, as a clergyman of that communion, had, at <num value="1">one</num> time, a post <pb id="p.60" n="60"/> at <placeName reg="West Point, Hardin, Kentucky" key="tgn,2041899">West Point</placeName>, and, at another, at <placeName reg="Hamilton, Butler, Ohio" key="tgn,7015730">Fort Hamilton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>His ardent nature found much that was congenial in <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s. Under his ministry, the latter arrived at a comfortable hope of salvation, insomuch that he felt it his duty and privilege to apply for baptism, which he had never received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>His conscientious inquiries into the claims of the different denominations of Christians were still continued, without, however, bringing him to any final conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>Popery he had examined, and rejected as anti-scriptural.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>Episcopacy he admitted to be an evangelical system; but some of its features he was unwilling to accept as of scriptural authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>This state of mind he explicitly avowed in asking for baptism at her door, stating that he should consider himself, if he obtained that privilege, not a member of the <rs>Episcopal</rs> denomination, but of the catholic body of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00060.00256" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>; and that, if ever his conscience and judgment were satisfied as to the most scriptural form of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>, he should feel himself perfectly free to join it, whether it should be that or some other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>But as his separation from civil life, and the society of other Christians, deprived him of the means of comparing and judging at that time, he felt that it was his duty, meanwhile, to assume, in the appointed rite, the name and service of the <name>Redeemer</name>, who, he hoped, had saved him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>His abode at this post seems to have been as uneventful as it was short, for he rarely made any allusion to it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>The fortunate issue of their selection illustrates the wisdom of that rule so often violated by the people of the <rs>South</rs>, to their own injury and reproach, to give the preference, in all appointments of trust, to citizens <quote>to the manor born.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>The salary offered him was the modest sum of <measure n="1200dollars" type="currency">twelve hundred dollars</measure>, with commutation for quarters. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/><persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00061.00265" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was no lover of garrison life, and accepted this <pb id="p.62" n="62"/> place promptly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>He afterwards explained to an intimate friend, that while campaigning was extremely congenial to his tastes, the life of a military post in times of peace was just as repulsive; that he perceived the officers of the army usually neglected self-improvement, and rusted, in trivial amusements, at these fortresses; and that, on the recurrence of a war, the man who had turned, with a good military reputation, into the pursuits of a semi-civilian, and who thus vigorously prosecuted his mental improvement, might expect even more promotion in the army than those who had remained in the dull tread-mill of the garrison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>But he declared that he knew war to be his true vocation, that his constant aim in life would ever be the career of the soldier, that he only accepted a scholastic occupation during peace, and that he was mainly induced to this by the military character of the school, and by the opportunities which, as professor of the art of the artillerist, he would enjoy of continuing his practical acquaintance with his chosen calling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>He therefore repaired to the <orgName n="Military Institute" type="institute">Military Institute</orgName> in <dateStruct value="1851-07-"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1851">1851</year></dateStruct>; and in this honorable retirement spent nearly <num value="10">ten</num> yea's. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>The department of instruction committed to him, embraced the theory and practice of gunnery, and the sciences of mechanics, optics, and astronomy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>These were taught in part by experiment, and in part by the application of mathematical analysis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>To determine the theories of light and of motion, and the doctrines of astronomy, he employed the most abstruse and refined applications of geometry, and of the calculus of fluxions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>The cadet was introduced from the simpler studies of pure mathematics to this arduous course, and, consequently, it was generally feared and disliked by him. Indeed, it may well be questioned, whether the minds of most youths have sufficient maturity, at the age when they usually complete their <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <pb id="p.63" n="63"/> year in the military school, to grapple with these discussions successfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>The major part of the classes were, probably, overcome by the demands made upon their powers of abstraction and logic, and floundered along, in the rear of their instructor, catching only occasional glimpses of the recondite truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/><persName n="Jackson,Major,,,," id="n0013.0005.00063.00266" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> had never been a teacher, nor had the bustle of the life into which he plunged, at his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step from <placeName reg="West Point, Clay, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057765">West Point</placeName>, left him much opportunity to review these abstruse studies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>When asked by a friend (after his success had long been assured) whether he had not been diffident of himself in undertaking so untried and arduous a course of instruction, he replied, <quote>No; he expected to be able to study sufficiently in advance of his class; for <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num> could always do what he willed to accomplish</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/></p> 
<p>His career as a professor was respectable, but never popular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>None doubted the strength of his mind, nor his thorough scholarship, nor his conscientious industry, nor his justice and impartiality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>But, while all his better students were accustomed to assert his thorough competency, discontent with his labors was not infrequent, both among his pupils and the <hi rend="italics">alumni</hi> of the school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>To all the better intellects of his class he communicated accurate scholarship, and the thoroughness of his mental drill was most useful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>But the laggards lagged very far in the rear, and he was unsuccessful in bringing them up. This resulted, as has been already intimated, in part from the difficult nature of his department; but in part also from the constitution of <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>He lacked some of the peculiar tact of the eminent teacher; and this was precisely because of the greatness of his endowments as a soldier and commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>The perceptions of his mind were so vigorous and distinct, and seized so exclusively on the main points of consideration, that all conclusions were with him perfectly defined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>Hence <pb id="p.64" n="64"/> there was, to him, but <num value="1">one</num> formula of words which gave an exact expression to his thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>If <num value="1">one</num> complained that his comprehension was imperfect, and asked for another statement, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00064.00267" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> had no answer to make save to repeat his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> formula.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>Now, to the leader, whose function it is to give orders to be obeyed, this trait is invaluable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>In the teacher, whose work is to assist the comprehension of weaker minds, it is a defect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>The very force and clearness with which <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s mind moved along from its premises to its conclusions, made it improbable that it would travel any <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> path, less plain than the <num value="1">one</num> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> perceived by his strong intuition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>Hence, he lacked versatility and powers of elucidation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>His intolerance of laziness, also, concurred to make the youth of defective comprehension dissatisfied with his teachings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>But in the art of examining, <num value="1">one</num> most essential to the efficiency of the teacher, he was eminent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>His questions were always fair, always well chosen to eviscerate the subject, and always put in words carefully selected-words absolutely perspicuous, and true to the thought he aimed to propound, without the use of <num value="1">one</num> superfluous phrase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>If the pupil said he did not comprehend the point of the inquiry, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00064.00268" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was sure to repeat precisely the same words, with yet more deliberation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>He held that when the form of the question was already perspicuous, an inability to comprehend it was, in fact, evidence of an inability to answer it. It may easily be conceived that this method was not likely to be peculiarly pleasing to an indolent youth, who, coming half prepared to his recitation, desired to extract a hint to assist his own ignorance, in the shape of a <quote>leading question</quote> from the teacher. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>Another cause which detracted from <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s success as a teacher of the natural sciences, was the lack of practical skill in performing physical experiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>As has been remarked, he <pb id="p.65" n="65"/> was not gifted with much of the minute manual dexterity which goes to the making of a skilful artisan or musician; nor had his mind that <quote>mechanical turn</quote> which <persName n="Scott,Sir,Walter,,," id="n0013.0005.00065.00269" reg="default:Scott,Walter,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Walter</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> declared to be, in his opinion, the usual index of a little trumpery understanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>His experiments were not brilliant, and sometimes they resulted in ludicrous blunders, at which he laughed as heartily as any of the lads of his class. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most painful consequences of his ill health was a weakness of the eyes, which rendered reading by any artificial light injurious, and threatened total blindness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>This infirmity was not usually revealed by any visible inflammation, but rather affected the nerves of vision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>He made it a conscientious duty, as well as found it a necessity, to forego all reading after nightfall, except the short portion of the <name>Scriptures</name> with which he invariably closed the day. But as the hours of daylight were necessarily much occupied with the duties of the class-room, the drill, and the <name>Faculty</name>, this deprivation of.the quiet hours of night, which most scholars find so precious, was a serious difficulty, and imposed on him a peculiar method of study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>During that part of the day which remained after his morning recitation, he carefully read over the text of the subjects which he wished to study for the next day, fixing the outlines of the discussion in his retentive memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>After devoting the remainder of his afternoon to domestic or social duties, he took his frugal supper, and proceeded to complete the studies of the morning without lamp, book or diagram, either pacing the floor of his chamber, or quietly seated with his face to the wall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>In this mental review, he passed over every link of the logic of the discussion, completed its method in his own mind, and assured his perfect recollection of it, so as to be prepared to teach it on the morrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>This study completed in <num value="1">one</num> or <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>, he pleasantly wheeled his chair towards the fire, removed the <pb id="p.66" n="66"/> injunction which he laid, at beginning, against addressing conversation to him, and passed into whatever topic engaged the attention of his family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>His instructions in the class-room were accordingly conducted without ever referring to books, although very closely conformed to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>Not only was his recollection of their contents perfect, but even of the place upon the page where each proposition might be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>Now, when his department of instruction is remembered, which involved the constant use of the most refined mathematical analysis, and discussion of figure, dimensions, motions, and relations of bodies in space, which most minds comprehend with difficulty, even by the aid of diagrams and models, the best scholar will best understand how astonishing was the exercise of memory, abstraction, imagination, and logical power in these studies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>Some may notice with incredulity the word imagination, included in this enumeration, and may rejoin, that <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00066.00270" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was notoriously unimaginative and prosaic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>If the name of this noble faculty, the imagination, be degraded, as it is popularly, to express the habitude of employing many tropes, either invented, or recollected and borrowed, in the expression of the thoughts, then it is conceded that he was not imaginative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>He was not prone to indulge his fancy; but, whether through incapacity, the reader will perhaps discover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>If, however, imagination is used in its proper sense, to express the creative power of the mind, the ability to reproduce in the chambers of the soul, and without the aid of sensation, the elements of conception, and to combine them, with a vivid distinctness, in new relations, then <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00066.00271" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> had the faculty in great strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>And, hence, it becomes true, that there is no better cultivation of this faculty, than in the distinct comprehension of the subjects of the applied mathematics, in their higher branches, by this purely mental study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>The great mathematician may not be accustomed <pb id="p.67" n="67"/> to bedizen his discourses with similes concerning purling brooks and silvery moonbeams; <note anchored="yes" id="n.67.1">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>He can so produce, before his thought, things that are not seen, and things that shall be, with the palpable reality of things that are seen, and of things that are, as to awaken by them all the strong emotions of the soul, which in natures less noble wait upon the actual information of sensation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>And this is most essentially that faculty of the intellect which raises man from the sensuous animal toward the all-knowing Spirit, in whose image he is made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>This is the faculty which, in the great statesman and commander, groups the data for the inspection of the profound judgment, which enables him for the clear comprehension of vast and multiplex affairs, and which ministers to his soul the stimulus of grand resolves. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/><num value="1">One</num> can now comprehend how valuable was the training which <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s mind received, in these meditations without book upon abstract truths, for his work as a soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>Command over his attention was formed into a habit which no tempest of confusion could disturb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>His power of abstraction became unrivalled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>His imagination was trained and invigorated, until it became competent for grouping the most extensive and complex considerations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>The power of his mind to endure its own tension, <pb id="p.68" n="68"/> in the labors of reflection and volition, was drilled like the strength of the athlete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>His self-concentration became unsurpassed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>Having fixed upon his mind the positions of his forces and of the enemy's, and the relations of the routes, rivers, mountains and fortresses, by the inspection of a map; he could study all the possible combinations of movements as he rode, rapt in thought, at the head of his columns, with as much maturity as though alone in his chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>Hence, in part, it resulted, that while no commander gave more scope to his own versatility and resource in the progress of events, there was never <num value="1">one</num> whose foresight was more complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>Nothing emerged which had not been considered before in his mind; no possibility was overlooked; he was never surprised. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/><placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s life at the military school in <placeName reg="Lexington, Fayette, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013887">Lexington</placeName> was regular, and marked by few incidents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>It was, however, the season when his personal character received its shape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>It therefore appears a suitable place in this narrative, to proceed with its delineation, illustrating it by the few events of the period. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>He was, without doubt, of a nature intensely ambitious and aspiring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>The depression of his poverty and orphanage, in his youth, had only stimulated this passion in him. The evidences of its existence have been already given, in his zeal for military distinction during the <rs>Mexican War</rs>, and for scholarship at <placeName reg="West Point, Clay, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057765">West Point</placeName>, as well as in his ulterior purposes of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>To his intimate friend he once remarked, that the officer should always make the attainment of rank supreme, within honorable bounds, over every other consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>Some sacrificed advancement to convenience, to secure service in a post where residence was pleasant, or to evade the authority of a harsh or unpopular superior; but his rule had been to secure promotion, if possible, at the cost of all such considerations; because, with the advancement in rank, the chances for distinction must usually <pb id="p.69" n="69"/> improve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>But his love of truth and rectitude was too strong and instinctive to permit his thirsting for any other than deserved distinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>He drew broadly the mark between notoriety and true fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>His passion deserved, as nearly as any man's could, the poets description as-- <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/></p><l>The last infirmity of noble minds.</l></quote> Yet it was, as he himself avowed, an infirmity; that is to say, it was unquestionably an unsanctified principle, and inconsistent with <name>Christian</name> holiness &mdash; as it is in the breasts of all natural men. His <name>Christian</name> character was then in its germ, and the spirit of the military profession in which he had long been immersed, far away from all churches and their influences, blinded him to the nature of his aspirations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>Very soon, he listened to no other than a sanctified ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>In <dateStruct value="1854-06-"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, the <name>Visitors</name> of the <orgName n="University of Virginia" type="university">University of Virginia</orgName> held an election for <rs type="role" reg="Professor">Professor</rs> of Mathematics, to succeed <persName n="Courtenay,Mister,,,," id="n0013.0005.00069.00272" reg="mostcommon:Courtenay,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Courtenay</surname></persName>, himself an <hi rend="italics">alumnus</hi> of <placeName reg="West Point, Clay, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057765">West Point</placeName>, who had long filled that place usefully and respectably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>This University was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, in the thoroughness of its instructions, and the dignities and emoluments of its professors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/><persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00069.00273" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> presented himself as a candidate, and procured many testimonials in support of his claims from persons of distinction, in which they concurred in ascribing to him competent scholarship, while they dwelt on his energy, devotion to duty, and courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>Among these were many teachers of the <orgName n="West Point Academy" type="academy">West-Point Academy</orgName>, and <persName n="Lee,Lieutenant-Colonel,Robert,E.,," id="n0013.0005.00069.00274" reg="default:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieut.-Col.</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, then its Superintendent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>When <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00069.00275" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> mentioned his project to his friend, he said to him: <quote>Have you not departed here from what you told me, upon coming to this military school, was the purpose of your life?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>[He referred to the declaration that war was his proper vocation.] <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00069.00276" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, who seemed never to forget his own most casual remarks, or to overlook the obligation <pb id="p.70" n="70"/> to maintain consistency with what he had once said, replied, <quote>I avow that my views have changed.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>He then proceeded to explain, that while he should ever retain the same conviction concerning his own adaptation to the soldier's life, his convictions concerning war as a pathway to distinction were greatly modified; and that he would now by no means accept a commission in any war which the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> might wage, irrespective of its morality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>He had never, he said, while an ungodly man, been inclined to tempt <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> by going in advance of his duty; he had never seen the day when he would have been likely to <hi rend="italics">volunteer</hi> for a forlorn hope, although indifferent to the danger of a service to which he was legitimately <hi rend="italics">ordered</hi>. But now, that he was endeavoring to live the life of faith, he would engage in no task in which he did not believe he should enjoy the <name>Divine</name> approbation; because, with this, he should feel perfectly secure under the disposal of <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name>; without it, he would have no right to be courageous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>If, then, his country were assailed in such a way as to justify an appeal to defensive war in <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> sight, he should desire to return to military life; but unless this happened, he should continue a simple citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>But as such he regarded it as every man's duty to seek the highest cultivation of his powers, and the widest sphere of activity within his reach; and therefore he desired to be transferred to the <orgName n="State University" type="university">State University</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>In this desire, however, he was disappointed; another gentleman was elected, and he acquiesced with perfect cheerfulness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>In politics, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00070.00277" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was always a Democrat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>This term, in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 32" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, always had reference more to the principles of Federal polity, the assertion of the sovereignty and reserved rights of the <name>States</name>, and the strict limitation of those of the <rs>Central Government</rs>, with the advocacy of a simple and unambitious exercise of its delegated powers, which were inculcated by <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> <pb id="p.71" n="71"/> <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00071.00278" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, than to a government for the individual States, strictly popular, and founded on universal suffrage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>To the latter, the most of the <rs>Virginian</rs> statesmen of the <name>States</name>' <placeName reg="Rights school">Rights school</placeName> were no friends; and the State-constitution of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, the most thoroughly democratic of all the <name>States</name> as to Federal politics, is the farthest removed from literal democracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>But it is probable that <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00071.00279" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> would have accepted the name of a Democrat in more of its literality than the statesmen we have described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>In Federal politics he was certainly a strict constructionist of the straitest sect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>He voted with his party uniformly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>To political discussions, in conversation, he was not given; and, while exceedingly exact in maintaining candor, he would usually content himself, when assailed by a political opponent, with a firm and polite declaration that he could not concur in his opinions, relapsing then into a silence from which no pertinacity could tempt him. With <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> intimates he conversed on public measures freely and with animation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>And they always found his thoughts original and profound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>He read little of the political journals; had there been no other reason for his disregard of them, his conscientious belief that it was his duty to employ his feeble eyesight in more important things, would have prevented him. His political opinions were, therefore, very far from being the echo of other men's. He approached each subject from his own point of view, and this was usually found to be as conclusive as it was original. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>Unaffected modesty was imprinted upon his countenance, and every trait of his manners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>No man ever lived who was further removed from egotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>Even his most intimate friend never heard him mention his own brilliant military career, of his own accord; nor did he ever speak of his family or kindred, many of whom, by their talents and social position, might have afforded topics for a boastful man. Yet his self-reliance was strong; as was <pb id="p.72" n="72"/> proved by his favorite maxim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>Mentioning to a friend, <num value="1">one</num> day the omission in his academic education at <placeName reg="West Point, Clay, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057765">West Point</placeName>, which left him ignorant of Latin, he added: <quote>But I think it probable that I shall some day repair this, and become as familiar with that language as with the <rs>Spanish</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>His friend replied, that perhaps he might acquire a partial knowledge of it by great effort; but it was generally held, that <num value="1">one</num> who had not imprinted the forms of the language on the plastic memory in childhood, could never repair that loss, so as to become a familiar master of the tongue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>He answered, <quote>No; if I attempt it, I shall become a master of the language; I can accomplish whatever I will to do.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>When he was a candidate for the <name>Chair</name> of Mathematics in the <orgName n="University of Virginia" type="university">University of Virginia</orgName>, <num value="1">one</num> of his few intimates suggested a fear that he had mistaken his own capacities, in seeking that place; because the method of teaching there was so largely by lecture; whereas his method was by the use of text-books; and he must be aware that he had little facility in extempore discourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>He acknowledged that he well knew that fact, and never dreamed of becoming eloquent; but, said he, <quote>by effort I shall succeed as a lecturer, for I can accomplish anything I will to perform.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>It may be added, that there is no instance known in which he failed of realizing his boast. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>The strength of his will was shown in his unfailing punctuality, in the vigor of his self-discipline &mdash; both bodily and mental, and in the energy of his actions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>Among other improvements of his powers, he determined that he would acquire the art of speaking in public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>To this end he became a member of the <quote><orgName n="Franklin Society" type="society">Franklin society</orgName>,</quote> a respectable literary association in Lexing ton endowed with a handsome hall and library &mdash; where the gentlemen of the town and of its scholastic institutions met for forensic debates, and other intellectual exercises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>Here he was always a punctual attendant, and always spoke in his turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>His <pb id="p.73" n="73"/> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> essays were as painful to his audience as they probably were to himself; confused, halting, and frequently ending in an abrupt silence, when the power of controlling his thoughts for the time deserted him. Thus arrested by his own embarrassment, he would sit down, nowise abashed; and so powerful was the impress of his modesty and manly purpose upon his fellowmembers, that none were ever seen to smile at these failures, although sometimes repeated a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> time, in the same evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>At a suitable moment he would rise again, and renew his effort, perhaps to end it with a similar painful halt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>But before the close of the debate he would succeed in expressing the substance of what he had in his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>By this dogged resolution, he gradually learned to control his diffidence, and became an effective speaker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>His manner was rapid and emphatic, his thoughts marked by great directness, and his discourse began and ended with exceedingly little of exordium and peroration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>So complete was his success, that he was said to have made, in a popular assemblage of his neighborhood, <num value="1">one</num> of the most effective speeches ever heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>It was but <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> long; but it produced unanimity in an assembly before divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>He might have said, like the patriarch of Uz, <quote>Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel: after my words, they spake not again.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/></p> 
<p>During nearly his whole life in <placeName reg="Lexington, Fayette, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013887">Lexington</placeName>, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00073.00280" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was a valetudinarian, and his regimen of body contributed no little to his character for singularity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>He was ever scrupulously neat, and having, in <num value="1">one</num> of his vacations, visited a hydropathic establishment in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> with supposed benefit, he became afterwards a still greater votary of cold water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>He seems to have studied physiology and the laws of health in the same conscientious and business-like manner in which he performed all his tasks, and to have formed his own conclusions as to diet from <pb id="p.74" n="74"/> observing his own sensations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>When these results were reached, he followed them out with an absolute self-denial, and without a particle of regard to their singularity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>Yet, unlike most invalids, he was as catholic towards others as he was strict to himself; and, allowing each person to be a law unto himself, never denounced their indulgences as excesses, because they would have been such if committed by him. Some of his self-denying customs appeared very odd to those around him; but their defence may be found in the fact, that this temperance repaired an enfeebled constitution, and made it capable of great endurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>The most learned physiologists now admit, that the surd antipathies and appetencies of the corporeal tastes are often the most profoundly accurate indications of the wants of the system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>Thus, when <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00074.00281" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> for a season refused the least trace of anything saccharine in his food, his conduct was probably wiser than that of the observers who called him whimsical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>It is noteworthy that, at all times, he preferred the simplest food, and that he lived absolutely without any stimulant; using neither tea, coffee, tobacco, nor wine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>This abstinence, however, was from principle, not from insensibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>Thus, reconnoitering the enemy's front on an occasion, in the winter of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, when prudence forbade the use of fire, he became so chilled, that his medical attendant, in real alarm for his safety, urged him to take some stimulant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>There was nothing at hand except ardent spirits, and so he consented to take some.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>As he experienced a difficulty in swallowing it, and it seemed to produce the sensation of choking, his friend asked if it was very unpleasant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/><quote>No,</quote> said he; <quote>no, I like it; I always did; <hi rend="italics">and that is the reason I never use it</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>At another time he took a long and exhausting walk with a brother officer, who was also a temperate and <name n="God" type="God">God</name>-fearing man. The walk terminating at his quarters, he proposed to <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0005.00074.00282" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, in consequence of their fatigue, <pb id="p.75" n="75"/> to join him in a glass of brandy and water: <quote>No,</quote> said he; <quote>I am much obliged, but I never use it; I am more afraid of it than of Federal bullets.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>What a rebuke is here to that vain conceit and pride of character, which resents the friendly caution, and the call to watchfulness as disparaging to <num value="1">one</num>'s strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>This mighty man of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> acknowledged that he was afraid of temptation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/><quote>When he was weak, then was I strong.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>How many a young man would have escaped the drunkard's grave if he had acted on this manly philosophy!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/><persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00075.00283" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> always professed his ability to exert an absolute control over his appetites; and declared that he could feel little sympathy with suffering in others, which was caused by selfindulgence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>When the people about him complained of headaches, or other consequences of imprudence, he would say: <quote>Do as I do; govern yourself absolutely, and you will not suffer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>My head never aches; if a thing disagrees with me, I never eat it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/></p> 
<p>His hours were early and regular; and rare must be the social obligation which induced him to depart from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>For in all these regulations, imposed on himself for the preservation of his health, he was accustomed to argue, that having determined any rule to be necessary, he was under a moral obligation to observe it. In vain did any friend plead that the <num value="1">one</num> instance of relaxation in his system could not possibly work an appreciable injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>His uniform answer was: <quote>Perfectly true; but it would become a precedent for another, and thus my rule would be broken down, and health would be injured, which would be a sin.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>Thus he carried out his self-denial in the use of his eyesight so rigidly, that even a letter received on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, if it was only <num value="1">one</num> of compliment or friendship, was not read by him until <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>; for his Sabbaths were sacredly reserved from the smallest secular distractions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>If his <pb id="p.76" n="76"/> friend exclaimed, <quote>Surely, <rs type="role2">Major</rs>, your eyes would not be injured by the reading of <num value="1">one</num> letter now;</quote> his answer was, <quote>I suppose they would not; but if I read this letter to-night, which it is not truly necessary to do, I shall be tempted to read something else that interests me to-morrow night, and the next, so that my rule will be broken down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>Then my eye-sight will undoubtedly be injured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>But if I thus incapacitate myself, by acts not really necessary, for my duties to my employers and my pupils in the institute, I shall commit sin.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>And once, when his most intimate friend knew that he had received a letter of affection late on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, the question was asked, as they were walking to church on Sabbath morning, <quote><rs type="role2">Major</rs>, surely you have read your letter?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/><quote>Assuredly not,</quote> said he. <quote>Where is it?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>asked his friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/><quote>Here,</quote> said he, tapping the pocket of his coat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/><quote><hi rend="italics">What</hi> obstinacy!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>exclaimed his friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/><quote>Do you not know that your curiosity to learn its contents will distract your attention from divine worship, far more than if you had done with reading it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>Surely, in this case, to depart from your rule would be promotive of a true Sabbath observance, instead of injurious to it?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/><quote>No,</quote> answered he, quietly, <quote>I shall make the most faithful effort I can to govern my thoughts, and guard them from unnecessary distraction; and as I do this from a sense of duty, I expect the divine blessing on it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>Accordingly, he afterwards declared, that his soul was on that day unusually composed and devout, and his spiritual enjoyment of the public and private worship of the day peculiarly rich. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>Under a similar sense of moral responsibility, he acquitted himself punctually of all social obligations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>When a single man, he went into society as frequently as other young men of regular habits, saying that he was constrained to do so by a sense of justice and humanity; for when an acquaintance took the trouble to prepare an entertainment, and honored him with <pb id="p.77" n="77"/> an invitation, to attend, where no duty interposed, was the only equitable return due for the kindness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>In such assemblages he was never entirely at ease; but it may be said with truth, that there, as everywhere, his courtesy was perfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>No attention due to the host and hostess was ever omitted; no salutation ever failed to meet the most polite return; the very slightest favor never went without thanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>No female ever came short of her fair share of the attentions of the other sex, that he did not at once relinquish his own preferences, and devote himself to her entertainment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>But when his early hour of retirement came, no allurements could detain him; and sometimes the ingenious plans laid by fair enemies to keep him, which he was too courteous to break through, placed him for a moment in amusing embarrassment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/><num value="1">One</num> of his most rigid rules was, never to eat a morsel after his frugal supper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>Hence, in the refreshments offered at a later hour, he refused to have any part, to the distress of his hostesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>Amidst the clatter of china and conversation, and the sparkle of wines and ices, the tall form of the <rs>Major</rs> stood firm; polite, yet constrained; in the gay throng, but not of it. When a friend urged him at least to avoid the awkwardness of the position for himself and the hostess, by seem ing to participate, his answer was that he did not consider it truthful to seem to do what he was not really doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>Indeed, his care not to transgress the strict truth seemed to others excessive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>He never talked at random, even in the most unguarded moment, or on the most trivial subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>All his statements were well-considered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>On rare occasions something might have escaped him which he regarded as an exception; and then, it mattered not how unessential the subject of it might be, and how impossible it might appear that any actual evil could emerge out of his mistake, he made it a part of the serious business of the next day to give a full explanation.

<p>His person was tall, erect, and muscular, with the large hands and feet characteristic of all his race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>His bearing was peculiarly <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00078.00284" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>; and therefore, in the somewhat free <orgName n="America Society" type="society">society of America</orgName>, was regarded as constrained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>Every movement was quick and decisive; his articulation was not rapid, but distinct and emphatic, and, accompanied by that laconic and perspicuous phrase to which it was so well adapted, it often made the impression of curtness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>He practised a military exactness in all the courtesies of good society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>Different opinions existed as to his comeliness, because it varied so much with the condition of his health and animal spirits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>His brow was exceedingly fair and expansive; his eyes were blue, large, and expressive, reposing usually in placid calm, but able none the less to flash lightning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>His nose was <persName n="Roman,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00078.00285" reg="mostcommon:Roman,nomatch:0"><surname>Roman</surname></persName>, and exceedingly well chiselled; his cheeks ruddy and sunburnt; his mouth firm and full of meaning; and his chin covered with a beard of comely brown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>The remarkable characteristic of his face was the contrast between its sterner and its gentler moods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>As he accosted a friend, or dispensed the hospitalities of his own house, his serious, constrained look gave place to a smile, so sweet and sunny in its graciousness, that he was another man. But hearty laughter, especially, was a complete metamorphosis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>His blue eyes then danced, and his countenance rippled with a glee and <hi rend="italics">abandon</hi> literally infantile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>This smile was indescribable to <num value="1">one</num> who never saw it. Had there been a painter with genius subtile enough to fix upon his canvas, side by side, the spirit of the countenance with which he caught the sudden jest of a child romping on his knees, and that with which, in the crisis of battle, he gave his generals the sharp and strident command, <quote>Sweep the field with the bayonet!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>he would have accomplished a miracle of art, which the spectator could scarcely credit as true to nature.

<p>In walking, his step was long and rapid, and at once suggested the idea of the dismounted horseman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>It has been said that he was an awkward rider, but incorrectly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>A sufficient evidence of this is the fact that he was never thrown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>It is true that on the march, when involved in thought, he was heedless of the grace of his posture; but in action, or as he rode with bare head along his column, acknowledging the shouts which rent tlh skies, no figure could be nobler than his. His judgment of horses was excellent, and it was very rare that he was not well mounted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>Such was the man as he left the quiet walks of the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName>, in the spring of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, to begin a career which was to fill the world with his fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>Most of those who were conversant with him were unconscious of his power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>A few intimates, indeed, were well aware of his capacity, and predicted for him an exalted destiny (for which they were usually held to be as singular as <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00079.00286" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> himself); but, with the many, he passed for a sensible, odd man, of undoubted courage, energy, and goodness; competent to a respectable success in anything to which he might bend his determined will, but to nothing more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>Yet the cadets of his school gloried in his military prowess, of discussing which they were never weary; and the universal feeling among them was, that if ever they were called into actual service, he was the man whom they would prefer for their leader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>The incorrect estimate which the many formed of him can be readily explained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/><persName n="Jackson,Major,,,," id="n0013.0005.00079.00287" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was a man whom it was no easy matter to know; not because he sought to hide himself from scrutiny, nor because he was in the slightest degree covert in what he said or did, but because there was a breadth and depth of character about him, that would never be suspected by the superficial and bigoted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>He was pre-eminently modest, and inexpressibly opposed to self-display, and equally consider.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/><pb id="p.80" n="80"/> ate of the taste and character of those with whom he held intercourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>He moulded his share of that intercourse accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>His scrupulous and delicate politeness made it always his aim to render others easy and comfortable in his presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thought on meeting with them seemed to be &mdash; what subjects of conversation would be most familiar to their thoughts, and most consonant to their feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>He never introduced a subject merely because it was <num value="1">one</num> with which he was most at home, or on which he could best exhibit his talents, or parade his information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>With a clergyman or lady, he never introduced party politics or military science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>Having led the conversation, with polite deference to that topic upon which his guest seemed best fitted to shine, he became usually an attentive but almost silent listener, and made no disclosure of his own stores of knowledge, or of profound and original reflections on the same subject; although they were often far more complete than those of the person whom he thus accepted as an instructor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>And had not subsequent facts evinced his superiority, his acquaintance would have felt it almost incredible that <num value="1">one</num> who was so well qualified to speak with confidence, should so entirely suppress the desire to speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>Thus many a minister of the gospel has been led by him to speak on ethical, ecclesiastical, or theological subjects, and has carried away the impression that the modest soldier, although almost ignorant of the alphabets of those sciences, had at least the merit of an earnest appetite for the knowledge of them, when in truth <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00080.00288" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> had read as much upon them as he had, and with more close attention, and posssessed more matured opinions concerning them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>The young person of literary tastes would be led to talk of the <rs>British</rs> classics, or the great writers of romance, and would leave him with the belief that he was innocent of all classical reading, except the great masters of holy writ; for his honesty <pb id="p.81" n="81"/> was so strict, that if his knowledge of any author or literary fact were taken for granted, he would never rest in a tacit acquiescence, but would stop his interlocutor to undeceive him, by declaring his ignorance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>Yet, while his feeble eye-sight and conscientious improvement of time had forbidden a promiscuous course of literary reading, he had studied the most important poets and historians with far more thorough judgment and taste than he permitted his young friends to divine. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>In the sphere which of right belonged to him, he rarely if ever asked advice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>No man knew his proper place better, or held it more tenaciously; and no man ever accorded this right to others more promptly or scrupulously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>As a member and officer of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>, he was eminently deferential to his pastor, as his superior officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>But, as a commander in camp, he would no more defer to the judgment of that pastor, than to that of the humblest of his own soldiers. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/>He had no peculiar gift for teaching; yet teaching was, at <placeName reg="Lexington, Fayette, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013887">Lexington</placeName>, his profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>In finding a solution of the erroneous estimate of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00081.00291" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> to which we have referred, something is also to be attributed to the character of the little society in which he moved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>It was cultivated, but limited in extent; and, accordingly, it had its own closely-defined standard, by comparison with which every man was tried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>In a society more cosmopolitan, such characters as <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00081.00292" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> are less apt to be misapprehended, because it consists not of <num value="1">one</num>, but of many coteries, and because contact with diversified forms of talent and cultivation, gives breadth and tolerance to the views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>This is but saying, in substance, what the voice of Fame has since pronounced, that <pb id="p.82" n="82"/> the wider the arena on which he acted, the greater his capacity appeared. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>But there were always a few, and they the most competent to understand a gifted nature, who declared <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00082.00293" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> to be a man of mark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>To these chosen intimates he unbosomed himself, modestly, yet without reserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>His views of public affairs were broad, and elevated far above the scope of the party journals which assumed to dictate public opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>His mind was <num value="1">one</num> which would have made him a subtile and profound jurist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>The few who attributed to him this type of intellect, had their estimate fully sustained, by the manner in which he discussed those numerous questions of a judicial nature which claim the attention of the leader of great armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>In the interpretation of orders and army regulations; in the settlement of rank between competing claimants; in the proceedings of courts-martial; in the discrimination between military and civil jurisdiction, which is often so difficult; his mind always approached the question from an original point of view, and rarely did it fail to be decisive to every attentive understanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>But it was especially in the discussion of military affairs that the mastery of his genius appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>When these topics were introduced, his mind assumed its highest animation, he disclosed a knowledge which surprised his auditors, and his criticisms were profound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/><num value="1">One</num> instance may be noted among many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>In the summer of <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>, he employed his long vacation in a European tour, in which he visited <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Switzerland" key="tgn,7011731">Switzerland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>During this journey he carefully examined the field of <placeName reg="Waterloo, Lauderdale, Alabama" key="tgn,2005702">Waterloo</placeName>, and traced out upon it the positions of the contending armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>When he returned home, he said that although <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00082.00294" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> was the greatest of commanders, he had committed an error in selecting the <name>Chateau</name> of Hougomont as the vital point of attack upon the <rs>British</rs> line, it should have been the village of <address><street n="Mont St">Mont St</street></address>. <persName><foreName>Jean</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/><pb id="p.83" n="83"/> This opinion has subsequently been corroborated by high authority in the military art. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>But the most important feature of <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s character was the religious; and this is the most appropriate topic for illustration at this place, because it was mainly developed at <placeName reg="Lexington, Fayette, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013887">Lexington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>His peculiar posture towards Christianity upon coming there, has been described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>He had been baptized, upon profession of his faith, by an Episcopal clergyman, but refused to be considered as committed to Episcopacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>In this state of opinion ho had been admitted, at least once, to the communion of the <rs>Lord</rs>'s Supper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>While his religious knowledge was defective, and his <name>Christian</name> character consequently failed at that time in symmetry, it was sincere and honest, and, from the purity of his morals and his devotional habits, it was consistent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>Upon removing to <placeName reg="Lexington, Fayette, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013887">Lexington</placeName>, where the <rs>Christian</rs> people were divided among the <name>Presbyterians</name>, Episcopalians, Wesleyan Methodists, and Baptists, he at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attended the public worship of all their churches indiscriminately, listening with exemplary respect and attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>But after a time he discontinued this promiscuous worship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>The pastor of the <name>Presbyterians</name> was <persName n="White,Reverend,William,S.,," id="n0013.0005.00083.00295" reg="default:White,William,S.,,"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev.</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>White</surname>, <roleName n="Doctor of Divinity">D.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/><persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00083.00296" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> sought an introduction to him in the autumn of <dateStruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></dateStruct>, and very soon paid him a confidential visit in his study, to lay before him his spiritual interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>He told him the steps he had taken, and declared his hope of his acceptance with <name n="God" type="God">God</name> through our <persName n="Christ,Lord,Jesus,,," id="n0013.0005.00083.00297" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName>; but said that he had not then: been able to determine with what branch of the <rs type="place">Church</rs> to connect himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>Popery he had examined under the most favorable auspices, and he had been constrained to reject it as <pb id="p.84" n="84"/> an apostasy from the system of Holy Writ.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>Of Episcopacy he had learned something from his friends <persName n="Taylor,Colonel,,,," id="n0013.0005.00084.00298" reg="mostcommon:Taylor,Richard,,,:2"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName> and <persName n="Parks,Reverend,,,," id="n0013.0005.00084.00299" reg="mostcommon:Parks,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev. Mr.</roleName> <surname>Parks</surname></persName>, whose religious principles and feelings he, to a great extent, approved and embraced; but with some of the features of that system he was not satisfied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>He had given equal consideration to the claims and peculiarities of other branches of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>He now, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, had a fair opportunity to observe the genius and working of Presbyterianism under its better auspices; and he found its worship congenial to his principles, and desired to know more of its character. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>The result of his inquiries was, that on the <dateStruct value="1851-11-22"><day reg="22">22d</day> of <month reg="11">November</month>, <year>1851</year>,</dateStruct> he was received, by profession of his faith, as a member of that church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>His accession in that mode was an avowal that he came in, not as <num value="1">one</num> transferred from some other denomination in the visible church to the <rs>Presbyterian</rs>, but as a new recruit from the world without.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>He did not, however, take this step until he had thoroughly studied the catechisms and Confession of Faith, which constitute the doctrinal standards of that church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>To some things embodied in these standards he strongly objected; and these objections he stated with the utmost clearness and frankness, not only to the pastor but to several intelligent laymen of the church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>His chief difficulty was found in the great truth of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> absolute sovereignty, in His purposes regarding the calling and government of His church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>His opinions, at that time, leaned strongly to the system known as Arminianism, nor were they immediately changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>Being informed, however, that the <orgName n="Presbyterian Church" type="church">Presbyterian Church</orgName> expected uniformity of belief on these points, of none but its officers, and only exacted of its private members a profession of those vital doctrines of redemption, in which all Christians agree, he preferred to adopt it as his own. Many months after, in conversation <pb id="p.85" n="85"/> with an intimate friend, he disclosed so serious a difficulty in his views concerning the doctrines of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> decree and sovereign providence, that the latter concluded with the half-jocular remark,--<quote><rs type="role2">Major</rs>, if you have these opinions, you had better become a Methodist.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>This suggestion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>the intense honesty of his nature made him take seriously; and he answered, <quote>If you think so, then come with me, and let us see <persName n="White,Doctor,,,," id="n0013.0005.00085.00300" reg="nearbymention:White,William,S.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>White</surname></persName> about it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>They went to the pastor's study, and had a long interview, as candid as it was kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>At the end of it the latter remarked, <quote>Well, <rs type="role2">Major</rs>, although your doctrinal theory is not in perfect accord with ours, yet in your practical life you are so good a Presbyterian, that I think you may safely remain where you are.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>In this conclusion he acquiesced; and it was not very long before all his difficulties gave way before his honest, persistent, and prayerful inquiries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>He became <num value="1">one</num> of the firmest though least bigoted advocates of the <name>Calvinistic</name> as distinguished from the <name>Arminian</name> scheme. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>In these proceedings, his candid and eclectic spirit was characteristic, and honorable to himself, as well as a valuable testimony to the denomination which he selected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>It would be hard to find a man reared in a Christian country, more uncommitted than he was, by education and association, to any sectarian preference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>His conscientiousness would not permit him to decide the matter as so many do, by the accidents of social relations, convenience, or taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>He made his church connection the subject of deliberate comparison, serious study, and prayer; and what Christian can justify himself for acting in any other way?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>It may be assumed, therefore, that <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s conclusion was dispassionate, and that he believed it to be the result of the force of truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>To make this remark in an aggressive party spirit against other denominations which <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00085.00301" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> passed over, in selecting the <rs>Presbyterian</rs>, would be most inconsistent with <pb id="p.86" n="86"/> his liberal and just temper towards them all; for he was as catholic in his heart as he was decided in his principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>But to demand the suppression of this fact in his life would be yet more invidious on the other hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>That would be an extravagant temper indeed which would impose, in narrating the truth, a reserve which left upon <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s memory the implication that he was either not hone'st, or not intelligent in his ecclesiastical opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>It is hoped that Presbyterians will not be so foolish as to claim that all the good and great are of their communion, or to hold that its true honor depends upon man, however exalted he may be. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>It may be safely declared, that, from the beginning, <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s religious character was strictly sincere, and conscientious, above that of most Christians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>This was a trait to be expected from the operation of the <rs>Holy Spirit</rs> upon a nature so decided in temper and clear in judgment as his. But his opinions concerning <name>Christian</name> duties were not wholly free from defect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>It would have been wonderful indeed if they had been perfectly correct, when he was reared with so little instruction, and when his manhood had been moulded under the very peculiar moral influences of the military caste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>But his exactness in performing what he perceived to be his duty, was always the same; some things which he afterwards saw to be obligatory, he had at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> failed to see in this light His aspirations for honorable fame were at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> less chastened than became a saint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>His deliberately expressed feelings concerning the resenting of injuries, were inconsistent with those inculcated by the law of love, as understood by the best Christians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>While his conviction of the sacredness of the <name>Sabbath</name> was, from the beginning, unusually clear, his interpretation of the exceptions made for <quote>works of necessity</quote> differed somewhat from those current among evangelical Christians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>But never was the healthy <pb id="p.87" n="87"/> and cleansing influence of a right conscience over the under standing, more clearly displayed than in him. The head could not long remain misguided, when presided over by so guileless a heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>He very soon attained the most firm and distinct perceptions of duty, which differed usually from those of the great body of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> best people, only in being more strict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most marked traits of his religious character then, was conscientiousness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>It ruled in every act and word; in things great, and things minute; in his social relations, and his most unrestrained remarks; in the regulation of his appetites; in his observance of the courtesies of life; in the disposition of his time and money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>Duty was with him the eVer present and supreme sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>Such was his dread of its violation, that no sin appeared to him small; and the distinction between great and little obligations, which most Christians make the pretext for a certain remissness of conduct, seemed scarcely to have any place in his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>To him, all duties were great, however trivial the affairs about which they were concerned, in human judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>The prominent trait of his mind was the sentiment of reverence directed supremely to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, as the standard of perfection, the rightful source of all authority, and the embodiment of infinite greatness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>It was this sentiment, in its lower aspects, which constituted his remarkable spirit of subordination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>As <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> nature and will were to him the standard of that which is right, and the fountain-head of obligation, so, whenever he found a fellow-creature clothed by the sanction of right, with legitimate authority over his conscience, he honored and obeyed him within his proper sphere, as a bearer of a delegated portion of the majesty of heaven; and his respect became a religious sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>Hence as a soldier no man was so prompt and exact in his military obedience; as a citizen none cherished so sacred a reverence for law, and for the offices of its magistrates <pb id="p.88" n="88"/> As a Christian layman, he honored and obeyed the pastor who had care of souls; and, while there was no man so little priestridden, there was none who so punctually paid to the ministers of religion, the captains in <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> sacramental host, however humble in person and talents, deference for their work's sake. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>Instances of his conscientiousness have already been given, but many others may be added.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>His convictions of the sin committed by the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, in the unnecessary transmission of mails, and the consequent imposition of secular labor on the <name>Sabbath</name> day, upon a multitude of persons, were singularly strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>His position was, that if no <num value="1">one</num> would avail himself of these <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> mails, save in cases of true and unavoidable necessity, the letters carried would be so few that the sinful custom would speedily be arrested, and the guilt and mischief prevented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>Hence, he argued, that as every man is bound to do whatever is practicable and lawful for him to do, to prevent the commission of sin, he who posted or received letters on the <name>Sabbath</name> day, or even sent a letter which would occupy that day in travelling, was responsible for a part of the guilt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>It was of no avail to reply to him, that this self-denial on the part of <num value="1">one</num> Christian would not close a single <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName>, nor arrest a single mail-coach in the whole country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>His answer was, that unless some Christians would begin singly to practise their exact duty, and thus set the proper example, the reform would never be begun; that his responsibility was to see to it that he, at least, was not <foreign lang="la">particeps criminis</foreign>; and that whether others would co-operate, was their concern, not his.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/><num value="1">One</num> instance he related with peculiar satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>It was, that proceeding on the <name>Sabbath</name> day to Divine worship with a Christian associate, his friend proposed to apply at the <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName> for his letters, on the plea that there was probably a letter from a dear relative, whose health was in a most critical state, and might, for aught he knew, demand his immediate aid. But he dissuaded him by the argument, that the necessity for departing in this from the <name>Sabbath</name> rest was not known, but only suspected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>They went together to church, and enjoyed a peaceful day.

<p>He always acted on the principle that he was as really bound to report the condition of himself and his family to his pastor, as the latter was to minister to their spiritual wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>In passing through several seasons of domestic sorrow, he called for his instructions and sympathy with equal delicacy and promptitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>Again, he called <num value="1">one</num> evening to say to <persName n="White,Doctor,,,," id="n0013.0005.00089.00303" reg="nearbymention:White,William,S.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>White</surname></persName>, that in the sermon preached the preceding Sabbath, he had not been able to discover whether the discussion of a certain duty, was to be <pb id="p.90" n="90"/> regarded in the light of mere advice, or as authoritative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>If it was the former, he was not clear that he should regard the duty as obligatory on him; but if the latter, then whatever his personal preferences might be, he should feel bound to comply with it, inasmuch as he could not plead conscience against doing it. Thus his pastor was to him the spiritual officer, under whose <quote>orders</quote> he was, and whom he therefore felt bound to obey, in all his admissible commands, for the sake of the authority and discipline of the spiritual host. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>He engaged <num value="1">one</num> day, with a Christian friend, in a conversation on the <name>Hebrews</name>' system of religious oblations, and was much interested in the assertion that, while the tithe was no longer enjoined, by express precept, on <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> people under the new dispensation, the usage of worshipping <name n="God" type="God">God</name> with stated offerings of our substance was in no degree abrogated; and that the <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> was probably, in most cases, a suitable proportion to be self-imposed by Christians, for this voluntary thank-offering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>The next day, on meeting his friend, he said that he had convinced him of a duty, not hitherto as fully understood as it should have been; and, with his usual courtesy, thanked him for the benefit thus conferred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>Thenceforward he scrupulously gave a <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> of his whole income to charitable uses (until he adopted a greatly enlarged ratio). </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>The Presbyterians and other evangelical churches in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 32" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, have long had the usage of meeting about the middle of the week in a social assemblage, under the superintendence of the pastor, for the especial purposes of concerted prayer and praise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>This custom has had the happiest effects, in promoting devotional habits, and fraternity and sympathy, among the <rs>Christian</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>The prayers were <pb id="p.91" n="91"/> usually offered, under the pastor's direction, by the elders of the church, or other experienced Christians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>In the course of the week, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00091.00307" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> called to ask him if he thought him <num value="1">one</num> of the persons to whom the latter exhortation was applicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>He proceeded to say that he was unused to all forms of continuous public speaking; that his embarrassment was extreme, especially upon so sacred a topic, in expressing himself before a crowd; and that he had therefore doubted whether it was for edification for him to attempt the leading of others at the throne of grace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>Yet, he knew that, inasmuch as these concerts of prayer were of eminent utility, the general duty of participating in their exercises was indisputable, as to <name>Christian</name> heads of families, and other suitable persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/><quote>You,</quote> he said, <quote>are my pastor, and the spiritual guide of the church; and if you think it my duty, then I shall waive my reluctance, and make the effort to lead in prayer, however painful.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>He closed by authorizing him to call upon him for that service, if he thought proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>And his diffidence in all this was so clearly unaffected, that no mortal could have mistaken it. After a time, the pastor called upon him to pray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>He obeyed, but with an embarrassment so great, that the service was almost as painful to his brethren as it obviously was to himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>The invitation was not repeated for a number of weeks, when, meeting <persName n="White,Doctor,,,," id="n0013.0005.00091.00308" reg="nearbymention:White,William,S.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>White</surname></persName>, he noted that fact, and indicated that he supposed the motive for sparing him was an unwillingness to inflict distress through his excessive diffidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>The good minister could not but admit that he had thought it best not to exact so painful a duty of him, lest his comfort in the meeting <pb id="p.92" n="92"/> should be seriously marred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>He was again called on; he succeeded in curbing his agitation in a good degree; and, after a time, became as eminent for the gift, as he was for the grace of prayer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>Another instance of his courage in doing good was given soon after he connected himself with the <orgName n="Presbyterian Church" type="church">Presbyterian Church</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>Visiting his native country during a vacation, he perceived that infidel opinions were prevalent among many, and had infected several of his friends and relatives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>He was anxious to do something to remedy this evil, but knew not what was best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>He held private conversations with some, and gave tracts to others, but this only increased his anxiety to attempt something on a larger scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>He accordingly determined to announce a brief course of public lectures on the evidences of Christianity, notwithstanding his diffidence and inexperience as a public speaker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>They were delivered in a church in the village of <placeName key="tgn,7010350" n="1.000 1" reg="beverley,east riding of yorkshire,england,united kingdom,europe">Beverley</placeName>, <placeName reg="Randolph county, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002291">Randolph county</placeName>, where his only sister resided; and as he declared, his success greatly exceeded his expectations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>It may be supposed that curiosity to see the novel spectacle of the young soldier and professor discussing such a theme, attracted many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>But his argument was declared to be excellent, and his manner far from bad, by the most competent hearers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>Doubtless the impression of his evident modesty, sincerity, and courage, was more valuable than would have been the most learned discussion from a professed divine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>The interest aroused in his mind concerning the evidences of Christianity led him, on his return to <placeName reg="Lexington, Fayette, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013887">Lexington</placeName>, to ask of <persName n="White,Doctor,,,," id="n0013.0005.00092.00310" reg="nearbymention:White,William,S.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>White</surname></persName> leave to collect a class of young men for the study of this subject in <pb id="p.93" n="93"/> connexion with the <orgName n="Sabbath School" type="school">Sabbath school</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>This class he taught with his accustomed earnestness and fidelity, and several of them served under him as soldiers in the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>He next proposed to gather the <name>African</name> slaves of the village in the afternoon of the <name>Sabbath</name>, and speedily he had a flourishing school of <num value="80">eighty</num> or a <num value="100">hundred</num> pupils, with <num value="12">twelve</num> teachers; the latter of whom were recruited from among the educated ladies and gentlemen of the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>This he continued to teach successfully from <dateStruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></dateStruct> until the spring of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>; when he reluctantly left it to enter the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>And to the end of his life, he inquired of every visitor at the camp from his church at home, how his black <orgName n="Sabbath School" type="school">Sabbath-school</orgName> was progressing; and if the answer was favorable, he did not fail to express his gratitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>But no other person could sustain it as efficiently as he did. His health required him to spend most of his vacations in journeys; and, upon setting out, he was accustomed to leave his school in the charge of some member of the church, for the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>On his return, he usually found it dwindled from <num value="80">eighty</num> to <num value="50">fifty</num> scholars; but his efforts soon restored it to its wonted prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>His method was to make the sessions extremely short, continuing from <time value="3pm">three P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>The exercises were <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, singing and prayer, and then a brief, pointed, and perspicuous exposition of an assigned passage of the <name>Scriptures</name>, addressed by him to the whole school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>The several teachers then took charge of their classes, and devoted the rest of the session to teaching them orally the <rs>Shorter Catechism</rs>, or some other suitable formula of truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>The exercises ended with the singing of a hymn, previously committed to memory, by the whole school, and a short prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/><orgName n="Once a month" type="newspaper">Once a month</orgName> he made a report of the punctuality and demeanor of each pupil, calling in person at the houses of their <pb id="p.94" n="94"/> masters for this purpose; and if any servant was frequently absent or inattentive, he was sure to inquire into the cause during the week. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>He gave notice that the bell would ring the next Sabbath <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of an hour before the opening as usual, and that when the assigned moment arrived, he should lock the doors and proceed immediately to the duties of the school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>Accordingly, the next <rs>Sunday</rs>, precisely at <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time>, he locked the doors and commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>Knocks were unheeded; and when, at the conclusion, the doors were opened, there was found a group in the street, consisting of a number of servants and a few mortified-looking ladies and gentlemen, whom he saluted as he passed on his way with his customary politeness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>There was no more lack of punctuality. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>While thus exacting in his discipline of the school, he was rendered extremely popular among all the more serious servants by these labors for their good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>He was indeed the black man's friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>His prayers were so attractive to them, that a number of those living in his quarter of the town, petitioned to be admitted on Sabbath nights, along with his own servants, to his evening domestic worship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>Before making them an answer, he called on <persName n="White,Doctor,,,," id="n0013.0005.00094.00312" reg="nearbymention:White,William,S.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>White</surname></persName> and stated their request to him, asking his sanction, and declaring that the assent of the masters of those servants must, of course, be also a necessary condition of his <pb id="p.95" n="95"/> gratifying them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>The approbation of the pastor and the masters was gladly given. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>To his own slaves, he was a methodical and exact, but conscientious master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>Absolute obedience was the rule of his household; and if he found chastisement was necessary to secure this, it was faithfully administered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>He required all his slaves to attend the domestic worship of his family morning and evening; and succeeded, where so many <name>Christian</name> masters have found entire success apparently impossible, in securing the presence of every <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>After his household was scattered by his absence in the camp, he found time &mdash; to write to those to whom his servants were hired, inquiring into their spiritual state, urging their employers to see that they attended church regularly, and giving minute directions for their welfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>On hearing of the death of <num value="1">one</num> of his female servants, he wrote expressing his gratitude for the attentions bestowed upon her in her illness and at her burial. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/>His conscience was too sensitive to tolerate known sin, at any prompting of conscience or interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>It will be a difficult problem for those who revile us, if they remember how gregarious vices are, and how surely even a sin of ignorance pollutes the soul and grieves the <rs>Holy Spirit</rs>, to explain how this most decided of slaveholders came to be so eminent for sanctity, and so richly crowned with the noblest graces and joys which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> ever conferred on man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1054"/>But yet, by a mode which is perhaps beyond the cognizance of the human reason, it secures the action designed by <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> intelligent purpose, from each created agent, in strict conformity with its nature and powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1055"/>The <name>Christian</name> doctrine <pb id="p.99" n="99"/> of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> does not reduce the universe into a pantheistic machine, with <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for the sole power and only real cause of its every motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1056"/>It teaches that the property which creatures have of acting as <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> causes is real, that their powers are actual powers, inherent in them, and not merely seeming; conferred, indeed, by <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, as Creator, and regulated in each specific action by his perpetual superintendence; yet, when conferred, intrinsic and efficient in the created agents, whenever the suitable relations or conjunctions for their action have place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/>And especially when those creature-agents are rational, voluntary spirits, does <name n="God" type="God">God</name> by His providence order the rise of those free purposes in them, which his eternal plan includes, in strict conformity with their free agency. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1058"/>The doctrine of Fate is, that all events, including the acts of free agents, are fixed by an immanent physical necessity in the series of causes and effects themselves; a necessity as blind and unreasoning as the tendency of the stone towards the earth, when unsupported from beneath; a necessity as much controlling the intelligence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> as of creatures; a necessity which admits of no modification of results through the agency of <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> causes, but renders them inoperative and passive as the mere stepping-stones in the inevitable progression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1059"/>The doctrine of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> teaches that the regular, natural agency of <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> causes is sustained, preserved, and regulated by the power and intelligence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and that, in and through that agency, every event is directed by His most wise and holy will, at once according to his plans and to the laws of nature which He has ordained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1060"/>Fatalism tends to apathy, to absolute inaction; a belief in the <rs>Providence</rs> of the <name>Scriptures</name>, to intelligent and hopeful effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1061"/>It does not overthrow, but rather establishes the agency of <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> causes; for it teaches that <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> method and rule of effectuating events only through them (save in the case <pb id="p.100" n="100"/> of miracles), is as steadfast as His purpose to carry out His decree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1062"/>Hence this faith produces a combination of courageous serenity, with cheerful diligence in the use of means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1065"/>His belief in the superintendence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> was equal to his industry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1067"/>In the very flush of triumph he has been known to seize the juncture for the earnest inculcation of this truth upon the minds of his subordinates; and, in the anxieties of great and critical moments, his soul drew composure and assurance from it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>While thd most pains-taking of commanders, he well knew that in these great operations many things must be done beyond the oversight of the commander, each of which by the manner of its performance may absolutely determine the event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1069"/>Hence when the issue was according to his prayers, he recognized the presence of an Eye more comprehensive than that of any creature, and ascribed all wisdom, power, and glory to it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1070"/>His perpetual recurrence to this special providence was displayed in his prayers for the divine guidance of his own judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/>It was well known that he was accustomed to seek this guidance not only in general terms, but most directly and particularly on specific occasions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/>And the frequent answers which he seemed to receive to these prayers, suggested to the unreflecting the idea of his actual inspiration.

<p>He would have modestly given an explanation less superstitious, and more scriptural.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1074"/>Mind has its natural laws as well as matter, to be learned in the same way, by correct induction from our observations; and they are just as regular in their operation as those of the stars, the waters, or the vegetable world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1075"/>For instance, conception follows conception in our thinking, by certain laws of suggestion, which we ascertain and know, at least to a good degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1076"/>By another law, the volition put forth upon a conception, in the act of spontaneous attention, tends to fix and brighten that conception before the mind, in preference to any other competing suggestion, just as regularly as sunlight promotes chemical action in matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/>Now, the very doctrine of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> is, that the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> who conferred upon spiritual substances these laws and powers of causation, as their inherent properties, regulates their action in strict consistency with their nature, with a constant superintendence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1078"/>The mode may be inscrutable to us, even as all His workings in providence are; but the fact is taught by the <name>Scriptures</name> and experience, and the consistency of it with our own reasonable and voluntary nature, as is assured to us by our consciousness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1079"/>Now then, when <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, in answer to prayer, leaving the mind to act strictly according to all its natural laws, yet gives such providential supervision to its functions, as to order that the judgment shall, of itself, come to a prosperous conclusion, why should men be more incredulous, or suppose a more supernatural interference, than when <name n="God" type="God">God</name> answers the prayers of his people with <quote>fruitful seasons, and rain from heaven,</quote> through the regular course of those meteoric laws, which before brought drought and blight?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/>No devout reader of the <name>Scriptures</name> can refuse the conviction that Satan, as a personal agent, has some mode consistent with the laws of mind, by which he often modifies the suggestions which arise, and thus the free determinations of the judgment and will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/>This <pb id="p.102" n="102"/> fact assists us to establish, and in part illustrates, the contrasted fact of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> providential concern in the thoughts and purposes of the children of men. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/>It was the cause of an intense sincerity of motive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/>He who goes before the <name>Searcher</name> of hearts with petitions for His light and guidance, can scarcely cherish there those corrupt and double purposes which he knows must be equally clear to His intelligence and hateful to <name n="his Holiness" type="role"><rs type="role" reg="Pope">His holiness</rs></name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/>There is then, an obvious natural influence which makes the very act of prayer as <quote>the euphrasy and rue</quote> to purge the mental vision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/>But faith teaches us that there is, moreover, a divine answer to prayer; and in what form is the <rs>Christian</rs>'s heart more familiar with this gracious power from above than in the purifying and chastening of its affections?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>No collisions of guilty desire with conscience, no side-views of selfish ambition, no itchings of avarice, no sensuality, no cravings for notoriety, no weakness of moral cowardice remained to disturb or jostle the steady adjustments of his judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>The functions of his understanding were actuated by <num value="1">one</num> supreme emotion, the sentiment of duty; a motive-power as pure as forcible, and hence they were almost perfectly correct and true, and at the same time full of intense vigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>His <quote>eye was single, and his whole body was full of light.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>This is the best explanation which can be given of that almost infallible judgment in practical affairs, which he never failed to display, whenever he felt it his duty to examine and decide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>And this refers his greatness primarily to his Christianity; a solution which <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00102.00324" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> <pb id="p.103" n="103"/> would have been himself most prompt to offer, if his modesty had permitted him to recognize greatness in himself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>Prayer implies a Providence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>For if <name n="God" type="God">God</name> hath not a present means of influencing the course of natural events, it is a waste of breath to petition for His intervention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>Hence it will be anticipated, that he who was so clear in his recognition of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> was also eminently a man of prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/>This was <num value="1">one</num> of the most striking traits of <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s religious character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>He prayed much, he had great faith in prayer, and took much delight in it. While his religion was the least obtrusive of all men's, no <num value="1">one</num> could know him and fail to be impressed with the regularity of his habits of private devotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>Morning and night he bent before <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in secret prayer, and rare must be the exigency which could deprive him of this valued privilege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/>There was in him an unusual combination of courage and modesty in this duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>If the presence of others was unavoidable, it had no effect whatever, be they who they might, however great or profane, to cause him to neglect his secret orisons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>Yet, it is presumed, no <num value="1">one</num> ever had the idea of ostentation suggested who witnessed <num value="1">one</num> of the sacred scenes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/>He was accustomed, during the active campaigns, to live in a common tent, like those of the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>Those who passed it at early dawn and at bed-time were likely to see the shadow of his kneeling form cast upon the canvas by the light of his candle; and the most careless soldier then trod lightly and held his breath with reverent awe.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/>This spirit of prayer was manifested by the change which it wrought in his whole manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1105"/>Everywhere else his speech was decided and curt; at the throne of grace all was different; his enunciation was soft and deliberate, and his tones mellow and <pb id="p.104" n="104"/> supplicatory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>His prayers were marked at once by profound reverence and filial confidence, and abounded much in ascriptions of praise and thanks, and the breathings of devout affections towards <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/>Besides his punctual observance of his private and domestic devotions, and of the weekly meetings for social prayer, he was accustomed to select from time to time some <num value="1">one</num> <persName n="Christian,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00104.00326" reg="mostcommon:Christian,nomatch:0"><surname>Christian</surname></persName>, with whom he held stated seasons of devotion, in order to avail himself of the promise, <quote>that if <num value="2">two</num> of you shall agree on earth, as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>And his partners in these fellowships were selected, not so much for their social as for their spiritual attractions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/>This narrative would be unjust to the truth, and to the memory of <num value="1">one</num> of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> most honored servants, if it omitted the mention of the chief instrument for cultivating in him this spirit of prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/>When <persName n="Jackson,Major,,,," id="n0013.0005.00104.00327" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> became a member of the congregation in <placeName reg="Lexington, Fayette, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013887">Lexington</placeName>, there was among its presbyters a man of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, whose memory yet smells sweet and blossoms in the dust, <persName n="Lyle,,John,B.,," id="n0013.0005.00104.00328" reg="default:Lyle,John,B.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Lyle</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1111"/>He was a bachelor, of middle age, well connected, but of limited fortune, who devoted nearly the whole of his leisure to the spiritual interests of his charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1112"/>He was constantly the friend of the afflicted, the restorer of the wayward, the counsellor of the doubting, a true shepherd of the sheep; and his inner <name>Christian</name> life was as elevated, as his outward was active.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>To him <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00104.00329" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> early learned to resort for counsel; for his spiritual state was not, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, marked by that established comfort and assurance which shed such a sunshine over his latter years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>He confessed to <persName n="Lyle,Mister,,,," id="n0013.0005.00104.00330" reg="nearbymention:Lyle,John,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lyle</surname></persName> great spiritual anxieties, and seasons of darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1115"/>The good man taught him that connexion between hearty obedience and access to the throne of grace, which is declared by the <name>Psalmist</name> when he says: <quote>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the <rs>Lord</rs> will not hear me.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1116"/>It was largely due to <pb id="p.105" n="105"/> his guidance, that <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00105.00331" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> attained to that thoroughness which marked all his subsequent <name>Christian</name> life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1117"/>Henceforward, like <persName><foreName>Joshua</foreName></persName> and <persName><foreName>Caleb</foreName></persName>, <quote>he had another spirit with him, and followed the <rs>Lord</rs> fully.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1118"/>His pious counsellor taught him by his example, by his instructions, and by suitable reading which he placed in his hands, to cherish a high value of prayer, and to expect, according to the scriptural warrant, a certain answer to it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1119"/>This prayerfulness was a profound inward spirit yet more than it was an outward manifestation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1120"/>How he compelled his own diffidence to pray with others, under a sense of duty, has been described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1121"/>But he was never forward to assume the lead of others at the throne of grace, where his station did not obviously make it proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1122"/>It has been said of him, that he was as often found leading his men in the prayer-meeting as in the field of battle; and those who knew not whereof they affirmed, have loved to represent him as a sort of Puritan Independent, of the school of <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00105.00332" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>, <persName n="Harrison,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00105.00333" reg="mostcommon:Harrison,nomatch:0"><surname>Harrison</surname></persName>, and Pride, assuming the functions of a preacher among his troops' No. Christian could possibly be further from all such intrusions, both in principle and in temper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1123"/>When called on by proper authority to lead his brethren in social prayer, he always obeyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1124"/>But he loved best to mingle with his rough and hardy soldiers, in the worship of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, as a simple lay-worshipper; with them to sit in the seat of the learner, with them to sing, with them to kneel, and with them to gather around the <rs>Lord</rs>'s table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1125"/>He would not pronounce the blessing over the plain food of his own mess-table, if a clergyman, or even an older <name>Christian</name> than himself, were present to do it. His whole nature and convictions were penetrated by a reverence for all constituted authority, and for right order in Church and State; the license of Independency was at least as opposed to his tastes as the restrictions of Prelacy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1126"/>It was in the secret communings of his heart that this spirit of <pb id="p.106" n="106"/> prayer was most prevalent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1127"/>Devotion was the very breath of his soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1128"/>Once only was he led to make a revelation of these constant aspirations, to a Christian associate peculiarly near to him; and his description of his intercourse with <name n="God" type="God">God</name> was too beautiful and characteristic to be suppressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1129"/>This friend expressed to him some embarrassment in comprehending literally the precept to <quote>pray always,</quote> and to <quote>pray without ceasing,</quote> and asked his help in construing it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1130"/>He answered, that if it might be permitted to him, without suspicion of religious display, he would explain by describing his own habits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1131"/>He then proceeded, with several parentheses, deprecating earnestly the charge of egotism, to say that, besides the stated daily seasons of secret and social prayer, he had long cultivated the habit of connecting the most trivial and customary acts of life with a silent prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/>When I take a draught of water, I always pause, as my palate receives the refreshment, to lift up my heart to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in thanks and prayer for the water of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1140"/>He added that the usage had become as delightful to him as it was regular. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1141"/>He had a higher and more unaffected sense of the value of the prayers of other Christians than of his own. To <num value="1">one</num> who did not know how abhorrent all cant and pretence were to the sincerity and truthfulness of his nature, the frequent assertions of this feeling in his letters would almost appear as unmeaning verbiage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1142"/>He never seemed to let slip an opportunity to urge Christians to prayer, for the <rs type="place">Church</rs> and for their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1143"/>Here are examples, which only express his habitual language and spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1171"/><quote>And never while life lasts,</quote> said the pastor, <quote>can I forget that prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1172"/>He thanked <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for sending me to visit the army, and prayed that He would own and bless my ministrations, both to officers and privates, so that many souls might be saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1173"/>He gave thanks for what it had pleased <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to do for the church in <placeName reg="Lexington, Fayette, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013887">Lexington</placeName>, <q direct="unspecified">to which both of us belong,</q> especially for the revivals He had mercifully granted to that church, and for the many preachers of the gospel sent forth from its membership.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1174"/>He then prayed for the pastor, and every member of his family, for the ruling elders, the deacons, and the private members of the church, such as were at home, and especially such as then belonged to the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1175"/>He then pleaded with such tenderness and fervor, that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> would baptize the whole army with His Holy Spirit, that my own hard heart was melted into penitence, gratitude, and praise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1176"/>When we had risen from our knees, he stood before his camp fire, with that calm dignity of mien and tender expression of countenance for which he was so remarkable, and said, <q direct="unspecified"> <rs type="role2">Doctor</rs>, I would be glad to learn more fully than I have yet done, what your views are of the prayer of faith.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1177"/>A conversation then commenced, which was continued long after the hour of midnight, in which, it <pb id="p.110" n="110"/> is candidly confessed, the pastor received more instruction than he imparted.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1178"/></p> 
<p>But perhaps the most impressive exhibition of his prayerful spirit was that which was sometimes witnessed on the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1179"/>More than once, as <num value="1">one</num> of his favorite brigades was passing into action, he had been noticed sitting motionless upon his horse, with his right hand uplifted, while the war-worn column swept, instern silence, close by his side, into the storm of shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1180"/>For a time, it seemed doubtful whether it was mere abstraction of thought, or a posture to relieve his fatigue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1181"/>But at length those who looked more narrowly were convinced by his closed eyes and moving lips, that he was wrestling in silent prayer for them!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1182"/>His fervent soul doubtless swelled with the solemn thoughts of his own responsibility and his country's crisis, of the precious blood he was compelled to put in jeopardy, and the souls passing, perhaps unprepared, to their everlasting doom; and of the orphanage and widowhood which was about to ensue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1183"/>Recognizing the sovereignty of the <name n="God" type="God"><rs type="role" reg="Lord">Lord</rs> of Hosts</name>, he interceded for his veterans, that <quote>the <name>Almighty</name> would cover them with his feathers, and that his truth might be their shield and buckler.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1184"/>The moral grandeur of this scene was akin to that when <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00110.00339" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName>, upon the <name>Mount</name> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, lifted up his hands while <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName> prevailed against Amalek. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1185"/>The <name>Christian</name> reader will easily comprehend that <num value="1">one</num> so conscientious, and believing, and devout, was a happy man. He had, while in <placeName reg="Lexington, Fayette, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013887">Lexington</placeName>, his domestic bereavements, and he felt them as every man of sensibility must; but the consolations of the gospel abounded in him at those seasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1186"/>His habitual frame was a calm sunshine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1187"/>He was never desponding, and never frivolous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1188"/>It is manifest, that in all the later years of his religious life, his soul dwelt continually in the blessed assurance of his acceptance through the <name>Redeemer</name>; and this steady spiritual <pb id="p.111" n="111"/> joy purified and elevated all his earthly affections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1189"/>It is the testimony of his pastor, that he was the happiest man he ever knew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1190"/>The assurance that <quote>all things work together for good to them that love <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, to them who are the called according to his purpose,</quote> was, to him, a living reality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1191"/>It robbed suffering of all its bitterness, and transmuted trials into blessings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1192"/>To his most intimate <name>Christian</name> associate, he was <num value="1">one</num> day expressing his surprise that this class of promises did not yield to other Christians a more solid peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1193"/>The suggestion arose in the mind of his friend hereupon to try the extent of his own faith, with the question, whether the trust in <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> love, and purposes of mercy to his own soul, would be sufficient to confer on him abiding happiness under the privation of all earthly good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1194"/>He answered, <quote>Yes; he was confident that he was reconciled and adopted through the work of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00111.00340" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:5"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>; and that therefore, inasmuch as every event was disposed by omniscience guided.by redeeming love for him, seeming evils must be real blessings; and that it was not in the power of any earthly calamity to overthrow his happiness.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1195"/>His friend knew his anxious care of his health, and asked, <quote>Suppose, <rs type="role2">Major</rs>, that you should lose your health irreparably, do you think you could be happy then?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1196"/>He answered, <quote>Yes; I should be happy still.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1197"/>His almost morbid fear of blindness was remembered, and the question was asked: <quote>But suppose, in addition to chronic illness, you should incur the total loss of your eyesight; would not that be too much for you?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1198"/>He answered firmly, <quote>No.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1199"/>His dislike of dependence was excessive; he was therefore asked once more: <quote>Suppose that, in addition to ruined health, and total blindness, you should lose all your property, and be left thus, incapable of any useful occupation, a wreck, to linger on a sick-bed, dependent on the charities of those who had no tie to you, would not this be too much for your faith?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1200"/>He pondered a moment, and then answered in a <pb id="p.112" n="112"/> reverent tone: <quote>If it were the will of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to place me there, He would enable me to lie there peacefully a <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1201"/></p> 
<p>Such was the man, as he appeared to those who knew him best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1202"/>The attempt has been made to enable the reader to see his <name>Christian</name> character just as it manifested itself, without concealing, abating, or exaggerating any traits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1203"/>Some of these will be pronounced by many to be singular, and some, perhaps, little worthy of applause or imitation; for, among those who observed it for themselves, there were not a few who regarded his conscience about little things as over-scrupulous, if not morbid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1204"/>And some affected to regard him as a sincere, odd, weak man, to be admired for his honesty, but for little else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1205"/>Whether his particularity concerning what have been called <quote>the minor morals,</quote> was unreasonable, or whether it was but the rectitude which the <name>Saviour</name> inculcates, when He says, <quote>He that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in much,</quote> may be left to each Christian to decide for himself, with the remark, that this strictness in little duties was attended with most noble fruits in the graver concerns of his life, and that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> crowned this religious character, such as it was, with peculiar honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1206"/>In view of these facts, it is hoped there will be many to join in the prayer, that, if <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s was a morbid conscience, all Christians may be infected with the same disease. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1207"/>He has been often compared to <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00112.00341" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName> and to <persName n="Havelock,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00112.00342" reg="mostcommon:Havelock,nomatch:0"><surname>Havelock</surname></persName>, but without justice in either case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1208"/>The latter he certainly resembled in energy, in directness, in bravery, and in the vigor of his faith; but his spiritual character was far more symmetrical, mellow, and noble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1209"/>His ambition was more thoroughly chastened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1210"/>He had risen to a calm and holy superiority to all the glitter of military glory, to which <persName n="Havelock,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00112.00343" reg="mostcommon:Havelock,nomatch:0"><surname>Havelock</surname></persName> never attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1211"/>Had <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00112.00344" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> reared sons to succeed to his name, he would never, like him, have directed them to the bustling pursuits of arms in preference <pb id="p.113" n="113"/> to the sacred office of the gospel ministry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1212"/>He would have said that, if his sons were clearly called by the providence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to fight, and even to die, for the necessary defence of their country, then he should desire to see them brave soldiers; but that otherwise, his warmest wish for them would be, that they might share the honor of winning souls, the calling which he most coveted for himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1213"/>Nor had he, either in manners or character, any of that abnormal vivacity which made <persName n="Havelock,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00113.00345" reg="mostcommon:Havelock,nomatch:0"><surname>Havelock</surname></persName> as peculiar as he was great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1214"/>The field on which his military genius was displayed, and the armies he wielded, were so large compared with those of the <rs>British</rs> captain, that a comparison on this point would be equally difficult and unfair. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1215"/>To liken <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00113.00346" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> to <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00113.00347" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName> is far more incorrect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1217"/>In place of harboring <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00113.00348" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>'s selfish ambition, which, under the veil of a religiousness that perhaps concealed it from himself, grew to the end, and fixed the foulest stain upon his memory, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00113.00349" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> crucified the not ignoble thirst for glory which animated his youth, until his abnegation of self became as pure and magnanimous as that of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 11" reg="district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1219"/>Every fibre of <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s being, as formed by nature and grace alike, was antagonistic to fanaticism and radicalism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1220"/>He believed indeed in the glorious doctrines of providence and redemption, with an appropriating faith; he believed in his own spiritual life and communion with <name n="God" type="God">God</name> through His grace, and lived upon the <name>Scripture</name> promises; but he would never have mistaken the heated impulses of excitement for the inspirations of the <rs>Holy Ghost</rs>, to be asserted even beyond <pb id="p.114" n="114"/> and against his own revealed word; nor would he have ever presumed on such a profane interpretation of His secret will, as to conclude that the victory of <persName n="Dunbar,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00114.00351" reg="mostcommon:Dunbar,nomatch:0"><surname>Dunbar</surname></persName> was sufficient proof, without the teachings of scriptural principles of duty, of the righteousness of the invasion of <placeName key="tgn,7002444" n="1.000 148" reg="scotland">Scotland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1221"/>There was never, in <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s piety, a particle of that false heat which could prompt a wish to intrude into clerical functions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1222"/>Every instinct of his soul approved the beauty of a regular and righteous order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1223"/>His religion was of the type of <persName n="Hampden,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00114.00352" reg="mostcommon:Hampden,nomatch:0"><surname>Hampden</surname></persName>, rather than of the <name>Independent</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1224"/>Especially was his character unlike <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00114.00353" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>'s, in its freedom from cant; his correct taste abhorred it. Sincerity was his grand characteristic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1225"/>With him profession always came short of the reality; he was incapable of affecting what he did not feel; and it would have been for him an impossibility to use speech with the diplomatic art of concealing, instead of expressing, his true intent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1226"/>His action, like <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00114.00354" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>'s, was always vigorous, and at the call of justice could be rigid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1227"/>But his career could never have been marked by a massacre like that of <persName n="Drogheda,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00114.00355" reg="mostcommon:Drogheda,nomatch:0"><surname>Drogheda</surname></persName>, or an execution like that of the <rs>King</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1228"/>The immeasurable superiority of his spiritual life over that of <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00114.00356" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>, may be justly illustrated by the contrast between their last days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1229"/>The approach of death found <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00114.00357" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>'s religion corrupted by power and riches, his faith tottering, his communion with <name n="God" type="God">God</name> interrupted, his comfort overclouded; and at last he faced the final struggle with no better support for his soul than a miserable perversion of the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints, by which he claimed the comfort of a former assurance, long since forfeited by backslidings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1230"/>But the piety of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0005.00114.00358" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Tom,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> continually repaired its benignant beams at the fountain of divine light and purity, becoming brighter and brighter unto the perfect day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1231"/>And his end, sustained by the peaceful triumphs of faith, was rather a translation than a death. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1237"/>It is related that his grief was so pungent, as not only to distress, but seriously to alarm his friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1238"/>Yet even then he was most anxious not to sin by questioning in his heart the wisdom and rectitude of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> dealings with him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1239"/>But for a long time his taste for secular occupations and pleasures was lost, and his only aspirations pointed to the other world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1242"/>This journey was the source of high enjoyment to him. But the opposition of his nature to all egotism was as strikingly shown here as elsewhere; he was no more <pb id="p.116" n="116"/> inclined to speak of his travels than of his exploits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1363"/>They also held that the very Government, being the creation of commonwealths which acted as independent <pb id="p.127" n="127"/> nations in forming it, and originating in a covenant which they voluntarily formed as such, derived its whole authority from its conformity to the terms of that covenant: that, if the covenant were destroyed, the <rs>Government</rs> was destroyed, and its rightful title to allegiance from any person was annihilated &mdash; that being gone which was the sole basis of it; and that, in the <hi rend="italics">dernier ressort</hi> upon any vital instance of usurpation, the <name>States</name> themselves must be the judges whether the covenant was destroyed, and judges too of the necessity and nature of their redress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1364"/>This right, to be. exercised, indeed, under those moral obligations which should govern all international intercourse, they held to be inherent in the <name>States</name> as originally sovereign; while to. suppose their federal compact divested them of it was preposterous, and what was, in the nature of the case, impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1365"/>It would represent their voluntary act in acceding to the covenant as a political suicide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1366"/>And it would have been equally preposterous for the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> formally to confer it; it would have been the absurdity of the offspring's attempting to confer on its own parent the rights of paternity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1367"/>Hence the absolute silence of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> concerning this inalienable right of the <name>States</name> was logically consistent, and is as incapable of implying anything against, as for, its just exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1368"/>How natural and fair this construction is, may be shown by the argument of the great <name>English</name> moralist, <persName n="Paley,,,,," id="n0013.0006.00127.00373" reg="mostcommon:Paley,nomatch:0"><surname>Paley</surname></persName>, against the theory which founds the government of States over individuals upon the fiction of a social compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1369"/>He reasons unanswerably, that if this were so, the violation of the original compact by the government of a commonwealth, in any <num value="1">one</num> point, would destroy the binding force of that covenant on the other party, the citizen, and so annihilate all right to allegiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1370"/>Whence we should reach the ruinous and absurd proposition, that any <num value="1">one</num> unconstitutional act in the ruler would release every citizen, in the future, from all rightful <pb id="p.128" n="128"/> obligation to obey any law he enjoined, just or unjust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1371"/>The argument is perfectly sound against the theory of a social contract between individuals, because the government of a State over them is not founded on any such contract, but on the ordinance of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1372"/>But in the case of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> the fact was precisely opposite, for the whole Central Government actually did originate avowedly in <quote>a social contract,</quote> to which the parties were States instead of persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1374"/>But its results are, here, in no wise absurd or disorganizing; because the creation of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> did not originate a social order or civic life for the <name>States</name>, and its destruction, therefore, would not destroy nor even relax it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1390"/>What more complete proof is needed of this truth, than the fact displayed in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, that in the very attempt to coerce States, the <rs>Constitution</rs> immediately perished?

<p>Another fact was, that when the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>, then the leading <num value="1">one</num> in fame, power, and the ability of her statesmen, gave her reluctant and chary adhesion to the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, she coupled it, in the very act accepting the <rs>Constitution</rs>, with this condition: that she should be for ever free to retract her adhesion, whenever she found the <rs>Union</rs> inconvenient, of which juncture she was to be sole judge; and to resume her separate independence, unmolested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/>Her reception upon these declared <pb id="p.131" n="131"/> terms, the only ones upon which she would have entered, was virtually a promise that her condition should be granted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1394"/>Nor was she the only State which made the same reservation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1395"/>New York and <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName>, the latter the smallest, and the former the most powerful State, next to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 32" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, both ncv among the covenant-breakers, which are persecuting the Old Dominion with a malignant treachery, for claiming her covenanted right, accepted the <rs>Union</rs> on the same condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1396"/>Their admission on such terms not only seals their right to retire at their option, but also demonstrates that all the other States understood the compact as, of course, implying such a right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1397"/>The attempt has been made to break the force of this fact, by the miserable subterfuge: That <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 32" reg="virginia">Virginia, New York</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName>, only stipulated for this right to retire if they found the <rs>Union</rs> inconvenient, because they feared it might prove a failure; and that since its splendid success, that condition had become antiquated, and expired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1398"/>It would be enough to expose this unprincipled sophism, to ask, how long a time might not be required to demonstrate that the <rs>Union</rs> had been successful?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1399"/>Do not the events which are now transpiring, keep that question yet in suspense: leading the most experienced minds in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to doubt whether such a scheme of government is not impracticable?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1400"/>But the very point of the stipulation made by <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 32" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> was, that she was to judge for herself, when, and how far, the <rs>Union</rs> proved inadequate to confer those benefits she sought under it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1401"/>It is thus abundantly proved that the right of the <name>States</name> to retire from the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, when the compact was broken, was inherent in them; and that the <rs>Constitution</rs> could neither <pb id="p.132" n="132"/> give nor take away this privilege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1403"/>Their revolution was a secession from the <rs>British Empire</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1404"/>They declared themselves to be the only rightful judges of its necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1405"/>So that every shadow of claim which they have to their present position is derived from the doctrine that the people of a commonwealth are entitled to change their form of government whenever they judge it necessary for their welfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1406"/>Nothing, therefore, can be more monstrous than the attempt of the <name>States</name> of the <rs>North</rs> to obstruct the exercise of this right by an inhuman war; when it is only by its exercise that they themselves exist. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1407"/>Once more; the formation of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> under their present Constitution, was an act of secession from the confederation previously existing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1408"/>It was made all the more glaring by the fact, that the articles of Confederation had very recently been perfected, and had been accepted by all the <name>States</name>, with the express injunction-<quote>And the <rs>Union</rs> shall be perpetual.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1409"/>That confederation did not dissolve itself: it did not grant its members leave to desert it, and form a new combination; on the contrary, it claimed an immortal existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1411"/>Accession to the new could only take place, by means of secession from the old Union; which had precisely the same claims to the adhesion of its members.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1418"/>It is objected again, that the admission of the right to retire from the <rs>Union</rs> renders its authority a rope of sand, and its character as a government a mere <hi rend="italics">simulacrum</hi>, which dissolves at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> touch of resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1421"/>It is a strange and disgraceful proposition to be asserted by Republicans, that no force is a real force except that which is sustained by an inexorable physical power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1422"/>It would seem that, with its assertors, honor, covenants, oaths, affections, enlightened <pb id="p.134" n="134"/> self-interest, are only a rope of sand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1423"/>The truth is, that the physical power of even the most iron despotisms reposes on moral forces, and if these are withdrawn from beneath, the most rigid tyranny becomes but a <hi rend="italics">simulacrum</hi>, which dissolves at the touch of resistance.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1426"/>It has been urged, that if the right be denied to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to coerce a seceding State, it is equivalent to the absurd proposition, that the <rs>Union</rs> never had any other title to the allegiance of any State than its own caprice chose to yield it; that unless the right forcibly to resist secession is granted to the former, the right to withdraw for any cause, or for no cause, is asserted for the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1430"/>Their inherent right to withdraw for just cause, and to judge for themselves <pb id="p.135" n="135"/> when that cause exists, does not imply a right to withdraw for no cause, or for a trivial cause, any more than the fact that the <rs>Christian</rs> must be left free in giving alms to the distressed, implies that he has a right to withhold alms from every person, however distressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1431"/>It is asked what guarantee the <rs>Union</rs> would then have against the secession of its members for trivial causes, or mere caprice?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1432"/>The answer is: It would have as guarantee the force of public opinion, habits, and affections; and above all, the fact that in every capricious secession the larger share of the inconveniences would fall upon the seceding member.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1433"/>If the <rs>Federal Government</rs> were equitable and beneficent, this safeguard would be always omnipotent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1434"/>Akin to this is the objection, that if the <rs>Union</rs> may not forcibly prevent the secession of a State, then it has no rightful mode of self-protection against any wrongful acts which the departing member may commit in her exit, such as appropriating the common property, or against any detrimental or even destructive use which she may make of her independence afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1435"/>But is not this State, the moment she resumes her separate independence, bound by the comity of nations to her former partners, as any other nation is?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1436"/>Just as any other independent neighbor may be required so to exercise its sovereignty as not to infringe the sovereignty of others, in the same way may she be, even by force of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1437"/>But then the coercion must be applied only to compel her to act as a just equal and neighbor; not to enforce by violence a union which, in its very nature, can only be voluntary. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1438"/>The clamor concerning the inconvenience and loss which the remaining <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> experience by the just secession of a part, in the diminution of territory, departure from natural boundaries, severance of rivers and mountain chains, and interruptions of advantageous commerce, admits of an easy <pb id="p.136" n="136"/> answer to any honest mind.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1442"/>An excellent proof of the justice of all these reasonings may be seen in the fact, that the most of those politicians at the <rs>North</rs> who now deny them, were the violent assertors of them, when they considered themselves aggrieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1452"/>Secession, then, was no dishonest after-thought, suggested by a growing sectional ambition, but the ancient, righteous remedy, to which the <rs>Southern States</rs> were reluctantly driven, by a long course of treachery and oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1453"/>Ever since <dateStruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></dateStruct>, they had seen with grief that the true balance of the <rs>Constitution</rs> was overthrown, the <rs>Government</rs> centralized, and the rights of the <name>States</name> engrossed by the <orgName n="Federal Congress" type="congress">Federal Congress</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1454"/>It was equally clear that the practical advantages of these usurpations were all inuring to the <rs>North</rs> against the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1455"/>A bounty on fisheries was granted from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, which was as plainly for the partial advantage of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, as though the tax-gatherer had, with his own hand, plucked the money out of the pockets of the rest of the citizens, to place it in theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1457"/>The Northern were maritime States; the <rs>Southern</rs> were, by population, climate, habits, and geographical position, inclined to agricultural pursuits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1458"/>A code of navigation laws was immediately passed, which operated as a perpetual tax on Southern industry, for the bribing of Northern adventure upon the seas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1459"/>Under the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <rs type="role2">President</rs>, the <rs>Constitution</rs> was violated by the assumption of a power in Congress to create an overshadowing Banking corporation,--with special privileges, within the territory of a State; and this bank being, moreover, immediately employed as the agent for funding and paying the <rs>Federal</rs> debt contracted for <pb id="p.138" n="138"/> the <rs>War</rs> of Independence, at once, and irrevocably, removed the financial centre from the <rs>Southern States</rs>, the richer portion, and paying the larger share of the taxes, to the poorer <rs>North</rs>, which paid less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1460"/>A system of partial taxation by tariffs was also commenced, for a motive glaringly unconstitutional, namely, to foster local enterprises for home manufactures, seated almost exclusively in the <rs>Northern</rs> and Middle States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1461"/>These tariffs were constantly pressed to a more exorbitant height, throwing <num value="1000000">millions</num> of unequal burden annually upon the <rs>South</rs>; and never for <num value="1">one</num> moment were they removed, although sometimes they received a momentary and deceitful relaxation, when the <rs>South</rs> seemed about to awake to a stern demand for justice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1462"/>But the chief sectional outrage was that aimed against the property of the <rs>Southern States</rs> in the labor of the <name>African</name> race, held to servitude within them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1463"/>As soon as the <name>Confederation</name> began to acquire new territory, the <rs>Northern States</rs> disclosed a fixed purpose of sectional aggrandizement therein, by means of the general and ignorant prejudice against the <name>African</name> race, and the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1464"/>Finding <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> labor unsuited to their climate, they had extinguished slavery among themselves from motives purely pecuniary, not generally by the emancipation of their slaves, but by selling them to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1466"/>The plan of the <rs>North</rs> was to engross the whole of the new territories for their population, by the exclusion of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> labor; and the contest, which began from the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, was never relaxed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1470"/>So flagrant a wrong, coupled with the perpetual agitation of abolition in the <name>States</name>, and the perpetual, unrestrained theft of slaves by Northern interlopers, naturally inflamed the resistance of the <rs>South</rs> to an alarming height.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1471"/>After many discussions, a delusive pacification was made, chiefly through the influence of the veteran politician, <persName n="Clay,,Henry,,," id="n0013.0006.00139.00384" reg="default:Clay,Henry,,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Douglas,Senator,,,," id="n0013.0006.00139.00385" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1472"/>The sum of the measures adopted, under their advocacy at different times, was, that, on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, the <rs>South</rs> should acquiesce in engrossments of territory already committed, and that, on the other, laws should be passed, in accordance with the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, to prevent negro-stealing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1473"/>As to the territory yet lying unappropriated, the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs> (of <dateStruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></dateStruct>) was declared to be, as it was indeed, unconstitutional and null; and the apparently fair principle was adopted, of leaving the common territory open to immigration from all sections alike, and allowing the people settled there to decide for themselves, whether the <rs>State</rs> which grew up should exclude <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> labor or not.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1474"/>But no sooner was this law passed, than the <rs>South</rs> found that, <pb id="p.140" n="140"/> while it <quote>kept the word of promise to the ear,</quote> it was designed <quote>to break it to the sense.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1475"/>The whole free-soil party, a majority of the whole <rs>North</rs>, openly proclaimed that they disdained to obey it; just as the whole <orgName n="Abolition party" type="party">Abolition party</orgName>, now nearly a majority, defied the law against negro-stealing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1476"/>(Here was an instance of insubordination, sufficient of itself to justify the secession of the <rs>South</rs>.) But more: under the <rs>Kansas</rs>-<placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> law, the practical question immediately emerged: How, and when, the people settling upon a common territory should exercise the discretion of determining whether <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> labor should have place in the <rs>State</rs> there growing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1477"/>The <num value="1">one</num> party, aptly called that of squatter-sovereignty, said that they should wield this power as soon as they began to assemble there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1478"/>This assured the victory in every case to the <rs>North</rs>, because landless free labor will, of course, ever anticipate capital and slave labor in mobility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1479"/>The other party, including all the <rs>South</rs>, said, with obvious truth, that the people of the new State could only exercise the power of deciding for or against the <name>African</name> labor, when they became a State, a true <hi rend="italics">populus</hi>, a full formed political society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1480"/>To claim the opposite, was to make the rights of American citizens-rights recognized by both State and Federal Constitutions &mdash; dependent on the caprice of any rabble of paupers, foreigners, and free negroes, the majority of whom would probably not be citizens at all, assembled by sufferance upon the common domain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1481"/>These territories, they argued, were the joint property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; and, therefore, while held as such, should be administered (as usual in the case of territories) by Congress, for the impartial benefit of all the owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1482"/>No man becomes a citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, save as he is the citizen of some State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1483"/>To the citizens of all the <name>States</name>, therefore, those territories should belong; and whenever any of these chose to exercise his right of emigrating to a new <pb id="p.141" n="141"/> part of the common domain, it was the duty of Congress to follow his person and all his lawful possessions, with the impartial shield of legal protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1484"/>The same equal measure should be meted out to the clock-factory of the <rs>Connecticut</rs> man, and the <name>African</name> labor of the <name>Carolinian</name>, when transported to the common domain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1485"/>And this would not be intrusion into the sovereignty of a new State, as to its admitting or excluding <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> labor; because the moment it becomes a <orgName n="State Congress" type="congress">State, Congress</orgName> withdraws, and leaves it, if it sees fit, to expel every <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> from its borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1486"/>The South saw clearly enough, that if this just view prevailed, they would still win no practical gain but merely preserving their honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1487"/>The emigration of white labor is mobile, quick, adventurous; that of the slave-owner is cautious, sensitive, and slow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1488"/>The <rs>North</rs>, by virtue of its actual numerical superiority, and its <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> immigration, stood ready to pour in <num value="1000">thousands</num>, where the <rs>South</rs> could only furnish hundreds, for the new lands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1489"/>The South had disinterestedly cut off its corresponding means of increase, by assenting to, and even demanding the extinction of the <name>African</name> slave-trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1490"/>Hence, it well knew, that, in claiming the constitutional construction of the <rs>Kansas</rs>-<placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> law, it was making a demand which could save it nothing but its rights; and that, practically, every territory, fertile enough to be worth seeking, would henceforward be occupied by exclusive white labor, and belong to the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1491"/>They could justly inquire of the latter, <quote>Why enforce a useless aggression, to win what is already virtually yours, where the only actual result is to fix a stigma of subjection upon us, your constitutional equals?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1492"/>Is it to teach us significantly that henceforth we are to be your slaves?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1493"/>But the odious construction was generally adopted by the <rs>North</rs>; and at length, even the author of the law, <persName n="Douglas,Senator,,,," id="n0013.0006.00141.00387" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, deserted his own ground, and accepted it, becoming thus the leader of the larger number of Northern Democrats.

<p>The long course of usurpation and aggression has now been traced near to its culminating point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1495"/>The lawless events in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> helped to illustrate these differences, and to embitter the passions; but their description need not detain us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1496"/>There have been at the <rs>South</rs> many corrupt, and some factious persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1497"/>Individuals have often asserted Southern rights in an intemperate, and sometimes in a wicked mode.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1498"/>But it will ever remain the glory of the <rs>South</rs>, that in no instance did any Southern State, or prevalent <orgName n="Political Party" type="party">political party</orgName> of the <rs>South</rs>, ever commit itself to any usurpation of power, through the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, to any sectional ends, or to any unconstitutional breach of the compact with the other sections, save perhaps in the instance of nullification &mdash; a defensive <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1503"/>Secession has been so often charged upon us as a grave crime, that the defence of his memory demands these explanations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1504"/>The chief lesson of his life would be neglected, were not the solution of the fact given,--that the purest and holiest of men became the hero of the war for <pb id="p.143" n="143"/> Southern independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1505"/>The statement has been insinuated that <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0006.00143.00389" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Cummins,,,:9"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was seduced by factitious influences into the advocacy of a cause condemned by his own conscience; but the assertion that he was capable of this is a slander equally against his head and his heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1506"/>His political opinions were maturely formed, and were exceedingly fixed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1507"/>Few who witnessed the deferential silence with which he listened to the talk of more dogmatical acquaintances, were aware how distinct and firm his conclusions were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1508"/>He was pre-eminently given to forming his own resolves, especially upon every question of duty; and, even where he listened to advice, it was weighed with a sturdy independence equal to his politeness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1509"/>In <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>, the question of free-soil had assumed somewhat of its angry importance, and the defection of the professed supporters of the rights of the <name>States</name> at the <rs>North</rs> had begun, under the pretext of squattersovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1557"/></p> 
<p>During the canvass, many patriotic voices were raised at the <rs>South</rs>, and a few at the <rs>North</rs>, in solemn remonstrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1558"/>Our enemies were reminded that <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0013.0006.00149.00415" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:1"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0013.0006.00149.00416" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, and the other fathers of the <rs>Government</rs>, had predicted, that the triumph of a sectional party in the <name>Confederation</name> would be the knell of its existence; and that their own best statesmen had declared the <rs>South</rs> neither would nor could remain in the <rs>Union</rs>, under a domination so utterly subversive of the objects of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1559"/>But such was the temper of the <rs>Northern</rs> people, that warnings only inflamed their arrogance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1560"/>And when they ascertained that they had elected their candidate, they burst forth, in belief of their irresistible power, into declarations of purposes of usurpation and tyranny so monstrous, that many just men at the <rs>North</rs> wrote eagerly to their Southern friends, to hasten and seek their only safety in a separate independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1561"/>In the <rs>South</rs>, at a distance from these scenes, few indeed comprehended their full danger, but all were painfully aroused, and many prepared for immediate defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1562"/>At the head of the latter was the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1563"/>Immediately after <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0013.0006.00149.00417" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s election was known, her Legislature called a <orgName n="Sovereign Convention" type="convention">sovereign convention</orgName> of the people, which, on the <dateStruct value="1860-12-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year>1860</year>,</dateStruct> formally retracted the connexion of the <rs>State</rs> with the <rs>Union</rs>, and resumed its independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1564"/>This action was had without discussion, and with perfect unanimity; the people of that State were convinced that the season for discussion had passed, and the season for action had arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1565"/>But, in all the other Southern States, while there was no respectable party anywhere which wavered in the purpose of vigorous resistance, there was a division of opinion concerning the time and mode of commencing it, denoted by the terms, Separate <pb id="p.150" n="150"/> Secession, and Co-<persName n="Secession,Operative,,,," id="n0013.0006.00150.00418" reg="mostcommon:Secession,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Operative">operative</roleName> <surname>Secession</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1568"/>Although this class of patriots embraced many shades of opinion, their distinctive views were these:--That while the sectional action, and especially the temper of the <rs>Northern</rs> people, would justify before <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and man an immediate separation, yet it was not politic to make it upon this provocation, because the <rs>South</rs> was so unprepared for that tremendous war which would probably follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1569"/>It was further contended that it would give her enemies the pretext &mdash; unfair, indeed, yet plausible &mdash; to rob her of a part of her moral strength, by charging her with a factious appeal from the polls to violence, prompted only by the loss of the powers and emoluments of office: That, inasmuch as this iniquitous election was yet made under the forms of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, it would be better to await the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> aggression which plainly violated it, in form as well as in fact, and make that the signal of resistance: That the power of our enemies dictated the necessity of acting only in concert, so that the <rs>Southern</rs> cause might possess the full strength arising from the union of all these States: And that, since the collision of <num value="1">one</num> with the <rs>Federal Government</rs> would inevitably decide the question of peace or war for all, and no State would stand idly, and see her Southern sisters crushed in detail by the common enemy, however erring by a generous precipitation, both courtesy and justice required that they should only act in concert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1570"/>The advocates of immediate separate secession replied, that this act was, in its nature, that of a State acting sovereignly, and therefore singly: That, although the <rs>South</rs> was unprepared, yet it was best to act at once, because the time consumed in consulting and preparing, would be so improved by our enemies in the <pb id="p.151" n="151"/> work of corrupting, intimidating, and encroaching, with all the potent enginery of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> in their hands, that the <rs>South</rs> would soon be disabled for any resistance: That, if action were postponed until full concert were secured, it would be postponed indefinitely; the partial apathy of the people under so many wrongs, having shown that nothing would effectually rouse them except the precipitating of the issue: And that the <rs>South</rs> had nothing to fear, because the unwarlike character of the <rs>North</rs> would deter them from attacking a chivalrous and determined people, and the preciousness of the <rs>Southern</rs> commerce would speedily procure from abroad potent mediation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1571"/>It is plain, also, that some of the <name>Carolinians</name> were not unwilling to seize that accidental power, of committing their neighbors to a forcible resistance without asking their assent, which has been explained above; and therein they gave serious offence to many of their friends in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 32" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1572"/>It is not important that the historian should decide whether the advocates of immediate or of co-operative secession were right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1573"/>The purpose to coerce <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> illegally was, at once, indicated by the retention of the strongest work commanding her chief city and harbor, <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>; and the manner in which this threatening act was accompanied, aggravated the indignation of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/>Nor would the demand of the <rs>South</rs>, that the <name>African</name> race should be allowed to labor in the new domain, if granted, have made <num value="1">one</num> slave more in all <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, unless it had done it by ameliorating their condition, so as to save some alive who otherwise would have perished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1676"/>Clearly, then, the policy of free-soil was not friendship to the black man, but only enmity to his white protector, and desire to rule over him. <pb id="p.164" n="164"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1677"/>But further, Black Republicanism is a system of intense hostility to the <name>African</name> race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1678"/>Its inconsistency can only be equalled by its inhumanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1679"/>It persists in saying, contrary to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, that the <name>African</name> is a citizen of the <rs>Union</rs>; but it forbids these black fellow-citizens to enjoy the common territory in any form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1680"/>It says they must not come as slaves, in the mode best adapted to their present welfare (as the most of the <rs>Black Republicans</rs> admitted). It says also, that they must not come as free negroes; for every Black Republican State, formed out of the national territory, with perhaps a single exception, has legislated sternly and absolutely against the immigration of this unfortunate class; and, of course, new States to be formed under the same creed, may be expected to do the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1681"/>In a word, Black Republicanism always means, that the <name>African</name> shall not exist at all on American soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1682"/>The uniform <hi rend="italics">shibboleth</hi> of the party was the assertion, that this continent must belong exclusively to the white race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1683"/>The proposal universally made by its demagogues to the agrarian hordes whom they deceived, was not: <quote>Let us overthrow the institutions of the <rs>South</rs>, in order that you may share its industry with free negro competitors;</quote> but, <quote>Let us overthrow the institutions of the <rs>South</rs>, in order that you may exclude the negro from its industry, and take his place.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1684"/>If they were pointed to the wretched and waning caste of free blacks in the <rs>North</rs>, as proof that this race cannot thrive in competition with the whites, without the protection of domestic slavery, and asked what was to be the destiny of the <num value="1000000">millions</num> of Africans, when their policy of freesoil was everywhere established; the usual answer was a sardonic shrug, and the sneering declaration, that this was no concern of theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1685"/>Others, more candid, pointed for answer, to the fate of the <rs>Indian</rs> tribes, who have wasted to nothing before the greater energies and crimes of the white race; and coolly <pb id="p.165" n="165"/> said, that the <name>Africans</name>, deprived of the fostering shield of that southern slavery, under which they were now thriving so happily, must tend to extinction, under the pressure of their own miseries and degradation; and then the whole Union would be free, prosperous, and glorious, (?) belonging to the white man alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1686"/>Such was the hideous meaning of Black Republicanism, to oppress and enslave the humane master, in order to exterminate the contented and comfortable servant! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1687"/>Any honest man, who has been so unlucky as to imbibe the false dogma, that the relation of master and slave is essentially unrighteous, will therefore admit, if he knows the truth, that the citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> is not contending, in this quarrel, to perpetuate an unjust oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1688"/>He will say: <quote>Be the relation wrong as it may, it was not instituted by the <rs>Confederates</rs>, nor at their option, but by the greed of the <rs>Federal</rs> and <rs>British</rs> slave-traders, and the tyranny of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, thrusting the <name>Africans</name> upon the unwilling colonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1689"/>These citizens found it existing, recognized by the laws, guaranteed by the <rs>Constitution</rs> which the people of the <rs>North</rs> were pledged to observe, and which alone gave them any right to legislate for the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1690"/>It was, therefore, natural, yea right, that they should resist these usurpations; and the more, as they saw that the motive was, not to exalt the slave, but to oppress the master; to trample upon the liberties of the latter, in order to visit upon the former, a fate a thousandfold worse than slavery &mdash; lingering extermination.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1691"/></p> 
<p>But every citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, in the second place, like <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0006.00165.00433" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Cummins,,,:9"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, would disdain to argue this cause from the premiss, that the relation of the master to his slave is unrighteous in itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1692"/>They assume the high position that this relation is, for their circumstances, as innocent and lawful in itself as any other relation of government, and recognized as <pb id="p.166" n="166"/> such by <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and sound ethics, as well as by all the laws of their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1693"/>When pointed to the almost universal condemnation of this proposition by the rest of Christendom, they boldly declare, that this results from an exclusion of the <rs>Southern</rs> people from a hearing in their own defence, and a perverse and indolent reception from their enemies, of the most monstrous tissue of slanders and falsehoods, which ever confounded a human mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1694"/>The world has been told a myriad times until the world believes it, that Virginian slavery makes a human being a chattel, a piece of property, thus violating the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intuitions of justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1695"/>Yet, all this is absolutely false; every slave-law of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 32" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> treats the slave as a person, a responsible, reasonable being, and not a thing; the only property which the laws recognize in him, is the property in his involuntary labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1696"/>And if the involuntary labor of a human being cannot be property, then every parent, husband, and master of an apprentice, in the civilized world, is made a transgressor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1697"/>It is uniformly asserted that slavery proceeds upon the assumption that it is the master's privilege to expend and exhaust the labor, welfare, and very being of his fellow-man, for his own selfish behoof, without equivalent; and that hence, it is a flagrant violation of that great law of love and equity, the golden rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1698"/>All this is alsolutely false: this form of servitude is defended only on the ground, demonstrated so fully by experience, that it secures for the servant the greatest practicable amount of well-being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1699"/>The laws all make the duties and benefits of the relation reciprocal, and oblige the master to render to his servant a liberal return for his labor, in the form of a life-long maintenance of himself and his family, secured against every contingency of decrepitude and sickness; just as much as they oblige the servant to render his labor to his master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1700"/>That this is, in the general, a better recompense than the <pb id="p.167" n="167"/> <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> could win as a free negro, is the justification always pleaded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1701"/>It has been charged that Virginian slavery makes the master the irresponsible possessor of the chastity of the female slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1702"/>This is again an absolute falsehood; the law fences around the chastity of the servant, even against the violence of her own master, by the same sanctions which protect that of the white lady.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1703"/>It has been charged that the laws of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 32" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> forbid the slave to lift his hand for the defence of life or limb, in obedience to the instincts of self-preservation, against any white man. This is absolutely false; while the laws require the servant to accept the chastisement of his master, they recognize in him the same discretion of self-defence, even against his owner, when assailed in life and limb, which is granted to the white freeman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1704"/>It has been said that we prohibit the slave all access to letters, and do not permit him to learn to read even the book of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1705"/>This, again, is unmingled falsehood; there is no law in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 32" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, forbidding a master to teach his slaves literature; and as many of them can read, and do read <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> Word, as of the agricultural peasantry of boasted <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1706"/>It has been said that Virginian slavery forbids the marital and parental relations among slaves, consigning them to a brutal concubinage, like that of animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1707"/>In the sense charged, this is absolutely false; conjugal and parental bliss is as much recognized, and as little interrupted among them, as among any people of the same civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1708"/>It has been said that their discipline and treatment are inhuman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1709"/>This is transcendently false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1710"/>No peasantry on earth is treated with as much humanity, and bears tasks so light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1711"/>There are instances of barbarity, even of murder; but they are punished by the laws and public opinion, at least as regularly as any crimes against free persons in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1712"/>Are there no cases of wifemurder, and child-murder, in New and Old England?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1713"/>It is <pb id="p.168" n="168"/> asserted, in <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> forms, that slavery has degraded the <name>African</name>; but this is also false: it has civilized and elevated him, more rapidly than any other philanthropy has raised any pagan race in the world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1714"/>This introduces the affirmative truth, that the relation of servitude is a righteous, because a beneficent <num value="1">one</num>, for the <name>African</name> among white men. Let the tree be known by its fruits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1715"/>It has conferred a higher physical well-being than is enjoyed by any other laboring population, as is proved by their increase of numbers, cheerfulness, and immunity from bodily infirmities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1716"/>The Virginian servant is lifted in the scale of manhood so high above his fellows of the <name>African</name> wilds, that, when by rare chance he meets them, he is ashamed and indignant at the assertion of a community of race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1717"/>American servitude has made nearly half a <num value="1000000">million</num> out of <num value="4000000">four millions</num> (<num value="1">one</num> in <num value="8">eight</num>) members of <name>Christian</name> churches, from being, <num value="3">three</num> generations ago, besotted Pagans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1718"/>All the <rs>Christian</rs> philanthropy of the rest of the world has not done as much for heathendom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1719"/>Our system has created an affectionate union between the <num value="2">two</num> races, elsewhere so hostile, which has astounded our enemies and the world, with their quietude in these times of convulsion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1720"/>And when we look into the ethics of the relation, we find that it was never suspected of immorality by any of the great masters of moral science, classic or scholastic, nor by any of the luminaries of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>, patristic or reformed, until the dogma of modern abolition was born of atheistic parentage, amidst the radical disorganizers of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, in the <name>Reign</name> of Terror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1724"/>His apostles admit slaveholders to the church, exacting no repentance nor renunciation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1725"/>They leave, by inspiration, general precepts for the manner in which the duties of the relation are to be maintained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1726"/>They command <name>Christian</name> slaves to obey and honor <name>Christian</name> masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1727"/>They remand the runaway to his injured owner, and recognize his property in his labor as a right which they had no power to infringe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1728"/>If slavery is in itself a sinful thing, then the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> is a sinful book. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1729"/>Strong in the truth of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and history, the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> therefore calmly breast the adverse opinion of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1730"/>They fortify their position by the fact that their right to the labor of their slaves is not only protected by the laws they inherited from their fathers, but by the laws of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and by eternal rectitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1731"/>Had they been unable to assert the latter truth, their resistance to anti-slavery aggressions would have been proper; because the <rs>Constitution</rs>, which alone united the <name>States</name>, recognized and protected it. But now their attitude is in every respect impregnable; for <name n="God" type="God">God</name> protects it as well as the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1732"/>To infringe the rights of slaveholders under the laws, was therefore a usurpation, and a violation of the primary compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1733"/>But a covenant broken by <num value="1">one</num> party is broken for the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1734"/>The Southern States therefore had the clearest right to select their own redress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1735"/>And especially is their secession justified, when the malignant intentions of the aggressors, and the ruinous nature of the wrongs they sought to inflict, are considered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1736"/>Their purposes were evidently ruthless; they intended nothing less than our destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1737"/>He who has observed the silent, yet potent influence of opinion on the conduct of political bodies, well knows how absurd would be the expectation, that the <rs>Southern</rs> people could consent to lie under <pb id="p.170" n="170"/> the stigma of a social crime, and of a standing moral delinquency and yet expect to receive of their supercilious accusers, equal and fair treatment in a political partnership.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1738"/>The sentiment of contempt and superiority will inevitably express itself in attempted domination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1739"/>Had the dogma, which asserted the immorality of our institutions, professed itself the most unpractical abstraction, the <rs>South</rs> would have been wise and righteous in saying to the <rs>North</rs>: <quote>It is time to part; we cannot live peaceably together.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1740"/></p> 
<p>But that sentiment was intensely practical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1741"/>It proposed no less than to uproot our whole society, to plunder our citizens, at <num value="1">one</num> stroke, of more than a <num value="1000">thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of their property, and thus to impoverish the whole land; to hurl back the prosperous and happy <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> race to barbarism, crime, and misery; to turn our plantations into <num value="1">one</num> vast jungle, and our cities into deserted ruins; and to people this blighted region with a dispirited and disorderly medley of bankrupt whites, and degraded black savages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1742"/>The people of the <rs>South</rs> know the <name>African</name> character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1743"/>They have seen the bitter fruits of a general emancipation; and they well know that this picture of the results of <name>Yankee</name> usurpation would be verified in every lineament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1744"/>If, then, self-preservation can ever justify resistance, in this instance it was a righteous, a sacred duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1745"/>Now the form of resistance adopted by the <rs>Southern</rs> people was the most moderate and equitable that could be conceived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1746"/>A covenant repudiated by <num value="1">one</num> party is annulled for the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1747"/>It was the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> alone, which constituted the <rs>Union</rs>, and gave any right to the <rs>Northern States</rs> to legislate for the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1748"/>When the former declared, as the <rs>North</rs> in substance did, that their conscience forbade their fulfilling the obligations of that covenant for the protection of slavery, the only conclusion to which honesty could have led them was this: Let the parties <pb id="p.171" n="171"/> then separate, and restore to each other their mutual independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1749"/>And this was the very least which the most <name>Christian</name> forbearance on the part of the <rs>South</rs> could ask. But this was precisely what the <rs>South</rs> demanded, in claiming the right of peaceable withdrawal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1750"/>Technical justice would have authorized her to say to the <rs>North</rs>: <quote>You have bargained; you have appropriated the advantages of the bargain, and you shall be compelled to stand to its terms, whether you like them or not.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/>It would have sustained her in demanding reparation for the heavy wrongs already sustained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1752"/>It would have sanctioned her claim to the properties of the <rs>Union</rs>, which the <rs>North</rs> had really deserted, and not the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1753"/>But she asked none of these things; she made only the modest request to have her pledges restored, since they were so irksome to her partner, and to be let alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1754"/>But this the <rs>North</rs> refused; their claim was that they should be free to violate the mutual compact whenever its conditions were irksome to their interests, or passions or caprice, and absolutely vital to the rights of the <rs>South</rs>, while we, their equals, should yet be held to it at the point of the sword, and under the threat of the most atrocious outrages ever visited by barbarians on their victims!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1757"/></p> 
<p>But, it is objected, the sectional party which had seized the general government, disclaimed the purpose of forcible emancipation in the <name>States</name>; and the <rs>South</rs>, in resisting, took counsel of their own angry suspicions alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/>The crushing refutation of this plea is given by the developments of the <rs>Black</rs> <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>Thus <pb id="p.172" n="172"/> have they themselves justified the resistance of the <rs>South</rs> to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and man, and made it clearer than the sun, that it was not <num value="1">one</num> whit too early or too strenuous. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>The great charge made against the <rs>South</rs> by the <rs>Northern Democrats</rs> was, that she had sought defence by leaving the <rs>Union</rs>, instead of remaining in it, and trusting to their great <orgName n="Conservative party" type="party">conservative party</orgName> for the protection of their rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/>Said they: <quote>We guarantee you, in the <rs>Union</rs>, every privilege which the <rs>Constitution</rs> gives you; but if you attempt to leave it, we become your enemies.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/>On this pretext that party have, with a baseness beyond that of the <rs>Black Republicans</rs>, betrayed every principle of their own creed, to join them in their persecution of us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1821"/>But even then, the enormity of the purposed crime of subduing free and equal States by violence, was so palpably felt, that the public mind, passionate as it was, acknowledged the necessity for a pretext.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/>This was found in the false assertion that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> had inaugurated war, and thus justified a resort to force,--a misrepresentation which has already been refuted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>It was claimed for the <rs>North</rs>, that its temper was just and pacific; and the contrast between the seeming calmness of her people before, and their tumultuous excitement after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> conflict, was pointed to as proof that they meditated no violence, and were only driven to a forcible defence of the <rs>Government</rs>, by the wickedness of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/>The difficulty of believing this arose in part from the many concessions of right <pb id="p.178" n="178"/> which the long-suffering South had made, from her long-continued, but futile expostulations, together with the ill-judged and passionate threats which her wrongs had often provoked from some of her politicians, and, in part, from the unspeakable vanity of the <rs>North</rs>, and its overweening conceit of its own power.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1976"/>From the beginning, he manifested that reticence and secrecy as to all military affairs, for which he was afterwards so remarkable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1977"/>It was his maxim, that, in war, mystery was the key to success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1978"/>He argued, that no human shrewdness could foretell what item of information might not give some advantage to an astute adversary, and that, therefore, it was the part of wisdom to conceal everything, even those things of which it did not appear how the enemy could make use. And since the channels by which intelligence may pass, are so numerous and unforeseen, those things which he did not wish divulged to the enemy he divulged to no <num value="1">one</num>, except where necessity compelled him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1979"/>It was deemed important to receive them with all courtesy, for the co-operation of their State was earnestly desired, and every <num value="1">one</num> was watching to see how <persName n="Jackson,Colonel,,,," id="n0013.0007.00192.00493" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Cummins,,,:9"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> would reconcile his secrecy, and his extreme dislike to be questioned upon military affairs, with the demands of politeness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1980"/>Among other questions, they asked him the number of his troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1981"/>He replied promptly, <quote>I should be glad if <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0013.0007.00192.00494" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> thought I had <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1982"/></p> 
<p>The character of his thinking was illustrated by the declaration which he made upon assuming this command, that it was the true policy of the <rs>South</rs> to take no prisoners in this war. He affirmed that this would be in the end truest humanity, because it would shorten the contest, and prove economical of the blood of both parties; and that it was a measure urgently dictated <pb id="p.193" n="193"/> by the interests of our cause, and clearly sustained by justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/>This startling opinion he calmly sustained in conversation, many months after, by the following considerations, which he prefaced with the remark, that, inasmuch as the authorities of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> had seen fit to pursue the other policy, he had cheerfully acquiesced, and was as careful as other commanders to enjoin on his soldiers the giving of quarter and humane treatment to disarmed enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1984"/>But he affirmed this war was, in its intent and inception, different from all civilized wars, and therefore should not be brought under their rules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1985"/>It was not, like them, a strife for a point of honor, a diplomatic quarrel, a commercial advantage, a boundary, or a province; but an attempt on the part of the <rs>North</rs> against the very existence of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1986"/>It was founded in a denial to their people of the right of self-government, in virtue of which, solely, the <rs>Northern States</rs> themselves existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1987"/>Its intention was a wholesale murder and piracy, the extermination of a whole people's national life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1988"/>It was, in fact, but the <quote>John Brown Raid</quote> resumed and extended, with new accessories of horror, and, as the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 32" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> had righteously put to death every <num value="1">one</num> of those cut-throats upon the gallows, why were their comrades in the same crime to claim now a more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1989"/>honorable treatment?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1990"/>Such a war was an offence against humanity so monstrous, that it outlawed those who shared its guilt beyond the pale of forbearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1991"/>But as justice authorized their destruction, so wisdom and prudence demanded it, for it is always.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1992"/>wisest to act upon principle, in preference to expediency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1993"/>He argued further, that this enormous intent of the war, together with the infuriated temper of the <rs>Northern</rs> people, and the circumstances of the contest, would inevitably lead them, before its close, even if they observed some measure at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, to barbarities and violations of belligerent rights, which would <pb id="p.194" n="194"/> compel our authorities, by every, consideration of righteous retribution and duty to their own injured citizens, to a bloody retaliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1994"/>But this would probably be then retorted, and the internecine policy would only assume a wider extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1995"/>The arrogance of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> would be sure to add political persecution of our citizens to the other rigors of war, under the pretext of punishing rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1996"/>The Administration at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 11" reg="district of columbia">Washington</placeName> was indebted to Abolitionism for its rpel strength, and would find itself impelled, whether it willed it or not, to conduct the war in accordance with the demands of that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1997"/>fell fanaticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1998"/>It would be seen, before this contest was over, inciting slave insurrections in the <rs>South</rs>, arming the servile class against their masters, and setting them on to perpetrate all the horrors of savage warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1999"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> ought not to submit to these enormities, and could not; but the measures of retribution which the protection of their outraged citizens would require, should be directed rather against the instigators than the ignorant tools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2000"/>By the time, however, this stern necessity had manifested itself, the <rs>Federal Government</rs> might have many of our soldiers, and much of our territory, in their clutches, so that retaliation would be encumbered with additional difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2001"/>It would be better, therefore, to begin upon a plan of warfare which would place none of our citizens in their power alive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2002"/>And lastly, if quarter was neither given nor asked, our soldiers would be only the more determined, vigilant, and unconquerable, for they were fighting under an inevitable necessity for liberties, homes, and existence; while the soldiers of our enemies would be intimidated, and enlistments would be prevented, because they contend only for pique, revenge, and lust of gain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2003"/>Indeed, it was in every way for the advantage of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, that the war should be made to unmask its murderous nature, most practically, to the <pb id="p.195" n="195"/> apprehensions of our citizens, for then they would be more likely to rise to the exercise of those radical and primary instincts of the human soul, which are commensurate in intensity with the magnitude of the stake at issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2004"/>This war was, in its true nature, internecine; It were better that it should be understood as such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2005"/>Its real meaning was destruction to the <rs>South</rs>; better have each citizen and soldier understand this for himself, in the most personal sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2006"/>Then, instead of seeing a people waging so dire a contest for. the primary objects of existence, with divided zeal, and with only the secondary motives of their nature, the most powerful moral forces of the soul would be evoked to sustain the struggle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2007"/>Such, in substance, were the reasons which he rendered for his conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2008"/>They were given with an unpretending simplicity, which no other can reproduce; for it was a characteristic of his mind, that the most profound considerations were seen by him so clearly and simply, that they were expressed without logical parade or pomp, as though they had been easy, and obvious to every understanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2009"/>Those who have watched the subsequent course of the war can decide, how accurately all his predictions have been verified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2010"/>And every thoughtful man now anticipates nothing else, than to see mutual acts of retaliation precipitate the parties into an unsparing slaughter; a result which has only been postponed thus far, by the unexampled forbearance of the people and government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2359"/>It was accounted for, in part, by the paucity of the cavalry; but this excuse was no justification, because the cavalry in hand, of which only <num value="2">two</num> companies had been engaged in the actual combat, was not pertinaciously pressed after the fugitives, but paused even before it met with any solid resistance from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2360"/>Another cause of the interrupted pursuit was a rumor brought at sunset to the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding generals</rs>, by some alarmed scout, who had seen a bewildered picquet of the enemy wandering through the country,--that a powerful Federal force was about to attack the lines of <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> near the <rs>Union Mills</rs>, where they were now denuded of defenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2410"/>The reply to <pb id="p.236" n="236"/> these pleas is, that the military intuitions of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0008.00236.00679" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Henry,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> told him, before the battle was ended, what the rout and disorganization of the enemy would be.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2411"/>Rations were not created by sitting still, and the appropriate supply for the victorious army was that which was in the magazines of their enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2412"/>The country was then teeming with supplies; herds of bullocks were feeding in the pastures around <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, and the barns of the farmers were loaded with grain, which was denied its usual outlet to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 11" reg="district of columbia">Washington</placeName> and <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2421"/>The true solution of the enigma, how men, capable of winning such a victory, could prove so incompetent to improve it, is probably to be found in their mistrust of their own irregular soldiery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2422"/>They were officers of the regular <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2423"/>This was an army of volunteers, who had been drilled, at most, for <num value="8">eight</num> or <measure n="12weeks" type="date">twelve weeks</measure>, and were led by company-officers who had never seen a battle, nor heard the whistling of a bullet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2424"/>Subordination was slight, and the feeble bond of order which they had acquired, although it sufficed to give them on the parade-ground the semblance of a gallant army, was not as yet habitual enough to endure the strain of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2425"/>Under the pressure of either success or repulse, it was dissolved, and regiments reverted almost into mobs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2426"/>This body was pervaded by a large infusion of personal heroism, and, even after its exact order was lost, the major part of its men continued to fight with admirable gallantry; but their impulse was personal, and not common.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2427"/>In their tactics,--intelligence, patriotism, and chivalry supplied the place of methodical concert and mutual dependence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2428"/>In the <foreign lang="fr">melee</foreign>, each man found opportunity to do what was right in his own eyes, and, while the larger number, the brave men, fought on in their irregular fashion, and won the day, the remainder of poltroons straggled shamefully to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2429"/><pb id="p.238" n="238"/> Hence, doubtless, these great professional soldiers were horrified when they saw their army so disorganized by its own success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2430"/>They shuddered when they asked themselves what would have been its condition in defeat?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2431"/>They felt as though a victory with such an army was only a lucky accident; and that their wisdom would be to <quote>let well enough alone,</quote> and tempt the <name>Fates</name> no more with so uncertain an instrument. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2432"/>But <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0008.00238.00685" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Henry,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was more than the professional soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2433"/>Leaving the army, he had become the citizen, the philosophic scholar, the statesman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2434"/>He knew both the vices and virtues of this citizen-soldiery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2435"/>He knew that, penetrated by such a moral sentiment as animated the larger number, it would be even less disorganized by defeat than by victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2436"/>While he reprobated the base stream of stragglers, and was as anxious as any to superinduce upon the good men all the advantages of a thorough discipline, in addition to a generous <hi rend="italics">morale</hi>, he knew how to take those thin, irregular lines, decimated by the laggards, and so to launch them against the enemy as to pluck a brilliant triumph from the midst of numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2437"/>His hardy and sober judgment reminded him that, if battle had loosened the bonds of order in our ranks, it had destroyed them in those of our enemies; for their army also was a militia, composed, not of gallant gentlemen and their reputable dependants, but of unwarlike mechanics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2438"/>He foresaw that, while the thorough drill would benefit our gallant soldiery, relatively it would advance the mercenary hordes of the enemy yet more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2439"/>The more nearly both were brought to the mechanical perfections of a regular army, the more would the difference between them be narrowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2478"/><num value="1">One</num> was, the sending of a commander into the northwest, to rally as many of the population as possible to the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause, and thus find a large part of the men and materials for sustaining the contest, in the country itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2479"/>The leader, therefore, must be <num value="1">one</num> who was known to the people, and possessed their confidence, and who knew how to conciliate their peculiar temper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2480"/>He believed that nearly all the more respectable people of that region were loyal to their State and duty; and, in this, events sustained his opinion; for, after a year's experiment, the most which the usurping Government could assert was, that among the <num value="40">forty</num> counties which they claimed for their pretended State, they had dared to collect revenues in <num value="11">eleven</num> only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2481"/>And it has been shown that, with a few exceptions, the county majorities, polled in their favor at elections, were composed of the intrusive votes of the soldiers encamped there, to intimidate the people; while the true voters, not being permitted to speak their real wishes, almost unanimously stayed at home. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2482"/>The other part of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0008.00242.00695" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Henry,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>'s plan was, to retain, by force of arms, that section of the great <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</orgName>, which lies on the <placeName key="possibilities=23" n="1.000 10" reg=",">territory of Virginia</placeName>, from <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> westward, and to employ it as the line of operations for the major force employed in the northwest: For, he argued, this road being the great military and commercial thoroughfare <pb id="p.243" n="243"/> connecting the enemy's capital with the <rs>West</rs>, whence he drew so many of his men and supplies, it was at all times a vital matter to us to deprive him of it. Next, its use as a line of operations would cover, from the ravages of the enemy, a most important part of <rs type="direction">central</rs> and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">northern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, the counties of the lower Valley, and of the south branch of the Potomac-a magnificent region teeming with precious resources, and inhabited, in the main, by a gallant and loyal people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2483"/>But the chief reason for maintaining this line was, that it was the only <num value="1">one</num> by which it was practicable for us to move men and materials in sufficient masses, and with speed enough, to cope with the <name>Federalists</name>, entering the contested district by <num value="2">two</num> navigable rivers and <num value="2">two</num> railroads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2484"/>A strong force, he said, should be pushed along the railroad, so far west as to place itself in the rear of the <rs>Federal</rs> army, operating against the little detachment which we so painfully sustained at the western side of the mountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2485"/>This would compel the retreat of our enemies, and make their capture probable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2486"/>The country, being thus cleared of their presence, and reassured against their return by the occupation of the <orgName n="Great Railroad" type="railroad">great railroad</orgName>, would, in consequence, revert to its proper allegiance, and by its resources make this part of the war nearly selfsustaining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2487"/>A reference to the map will show that this scheme was in appearance liable to a capital objection: The <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</orgName>, thus made the line of operations for the <orgName n="Confederate Forces" type="org">Confederate forces</orgName>, would be parallel to the frontier of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, which the enemy might at once make the base of their operations against us. But such an arrangement is likely to be fatal to the party pursuing the aggressive (in this case the <rs>Confederates</rs>), because their communications are ever within the reach of their enemy's blows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2488"/>Here, however, the objection was more seeming than real.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2489"/>The true base from which the <name>Federalists</name> must have operated against this line of advance, <pb id="p.244" n="244"/> was not the <name>Pennsylvanian</name> frontier, but the <orgName n="Central Pennsylvania Railroad" type="railroad">Central Pennsylvania Railroad</orgName>, parallel thereto, and a <measure n="100miles" type="distance">hundred miles distant</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2490"/>Thus the superior mobility of our forces along their line of operations would have compensated, in great measure, for their exposure to the enemy's advance across it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2492"/>It was the land of his birth and his kindred.

He was also charged by his critics with being partial to his old brigade, <placeName reg="Jackson, Madison, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099733">Jackson</placeName>'s pet lambs, as they were sneeringly called; it was said that he kept them in the rear, while other troops were constantly thrust into danger; and that now, while the command of <persName n="Loring,General,,,," id="n0013.0009.00275.00820" reg="mostcommon:Loring,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Loring</surname></persName> was left in mid-winter in an alpine region, almost within the jaws of a powerful enemy, these favored regiments were brought back to the comforts and hospitalities of the town, whereas, in truth, while the forces in <placeName key="tgn,2119828" n="1.000 34" reg="romney, hampshire, west virginia">Romney</placeName> were ordered into huts, this brigade was <placeName><distance reg="3miles">three miles</distance> below <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName></placeName>, in tents, and under the most rigid discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2797"/>And what would have been the outcry of the objectors had <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0009.00275.00821" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Henry,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> left the old brigade with <persName n="Loring,General,,,," id="n0013.0009.00275.00822" reg="mostcommon:Loring,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Loring</surname></persName>, and brought away a part of his troops, which had been assured to him by special pledge of the <rs>Government</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2798"/>His secrecy, which was absolute as that of the grave, piqued the <pb id="p.276" n="276"/> curiosity and self-importance of these cavillers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2799"/>But had he condescended to explain, they would not have been able to comprehend his policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2800"/>Necessities which were plain in the future to his prophetic eye, they could not see. His far-reaching combinations were beyond their grasp; hence, to their imperfect view, the movements, which are now recognized as the promptings of a profound and original genius, appeared to be the erratic spasms of rashness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2801"/>And truth requires the statement, that not a few of his subordinates so far forgot the proprieties of their honorable profession, as to echo these criticisms and lend them all their credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2802"/>Especially were such persons found among those who had lately come under his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2803"/>They were unaccustomed to a military regimen so energetic as his. For while he was, personally, the most modest of men, officially, he was the most exacting of commanders; and his purpose to enforce a thorough performance of duty, and his stern disapprobation of remissness and self-indulgence, were veiled by no affectations of politeness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2804"/>Hence, those who came to serve near his person, if they were not wholly likeminded with himself, usually underwent, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, a sort of breaking in, accompanied with no little chafing to restive spirits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2805"/>The expedition to <placeName key="tgn,2119828" n="1.000 34" reg="romney, hampshire, west virginia">Romney</placeName> was, to these officers, just such an apprenticeship to <placeName reg="Jackson, Madison, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099733">Jackson</placeName>'s method of making war. All this was fully known to him; but while he keenly felt its injustice, he disdained to resent it, or to condescend to any explanation of his policy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2806"/>On the <dateStruct value="-01-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, he was astounded by the receipt of the following order, by telegraph, from the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>: --<quote>Our news indicates that a movement is making to cut off <orgName n="command"><persName n="Loring,General,,,," id="n0013.0009.00276.00823" reg="mostcommon:Loring,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Loring</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>; order him back to <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> immediately.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2807"/>The explanation was, that a number of officers <pb id="p.277" n="277"/> from that command, as soon as it was ordered into winter quarters, had obtained furloughs and repaired to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, where they busily filled the ears of the public and the <rs>Government</rs> with complaints of the exposed and hazardous position assigned them, and the rashness and severity of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0009.00277.00824" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Henry,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>'s rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2808"/>A petition for the recall of the troops was actually signed among them, and the <rs>General</rs> complained, with justice, that it was not more positively discountenanced by their commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2809"/>It filled him with indignation, to see men bearing their country's commission, assigning the presence of danger as the ground of their complaints, as though it were not a soldier's profession to brave danger; and when the withering rejoinder was at hand, that, if indeed the men intrusted to their care were in such peril, then it was no time for a gallant officer to be wasting his days on a furlough, amidst the luxuries and cabals of a far-distant capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2810"/>The demand for the recall of the troops, without reference to the commander of the district, directly impugned his vigilance and good judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2811"/>Yet the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, misguided by the urgency of the discontented officers, gave the peremptory order, without consultation either with <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0009.00277.00825" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Henry,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, or <persName n="Johnston,General,Joseph,E.,," id="n0013.0009.00277.00826" reg="default:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Joseph</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> of the whole department The injury thus done to the authority and self-respect of both these officers is too obvious to need illustration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2812"/>Of the personal element of wrong, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0009.00277.00827" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Henry,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> seemed to feel little, and he said nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2813"/>But, considering his usefulness in his District at an end under such a mode of administration, he instantly determined to leave it. The reply which he sent to the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War department</orgName> is so good an example of military subordination, and, at the same time, of manly independence, that it should be repeated.

<p>This conditional resignation he forwarded through the appointed channel, the <name>Headquarters</name> of his <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2820"/>At the same time, to make <num value="1">one</num> more effort for preventing the injury, he wrote requesting that <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0013.0009.00278.00830" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> would countermand the order for the retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2821"/>To his adjutant he said, <quote>The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> stated, in the order requiring <orgName n="command"><persName n="Loring,General,,,," id="n0013.0009.00278.00831" reg="mostcommon:Loring,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Loring</surname></persName>'s command</orgName> to fall back to this place immediately, that he had been informed the command was in danger of being cut off.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2822"/>But the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs>, although concurring in his opinions of the campaign, did not think it best to assume the responsibility of giving the order; and all the troops returned to the vicinity of <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2823"/><persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0013.0009.00278.00833" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> detained the resignation for a time, and <pb id="p.279" n="279"/> immediately wrote to <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0009.00279.00834" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Henry,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, in terms alike honorable to his own magnanimity, and to the reputation of the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2824"/>Descending from the position of his commander to that of a friend and brother-in-arms, he declared his full approval of his disposition of the forces, and his belief that the order of which he complained was injurious to the country, and to his official rights; yet, expressing an exalted appreciation of his value to the cause, he besought him to waive every personal interest, to hold even his just rights in abeyance, and to sacrifice everything for his native land. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2825"/>The news of his resignation aroused a vivid excitement in the army, the capital, and the <rs>State</rs> at large, which showed that, notwithstanding the criicisms of his enemies, he had gained a firm hold upon the affections of his countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2826"/>Their sympathies were warmly with him against the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2827"/>They were outraged, that the only army which had marched, and which had won anything from the enemy, should be thus arrested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2828"/>Indeed the decision and dignity of his attitude silenced at once the voices of the fault-finders; and they seemed to concur in the general feeling of the people of his district, which regarded him as their bulwark and deliverer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2829"/>He was besieged with solicitations from soldiers, citizens, and clergymen, far and near, appealing to his patriotism, to subordinate his sense of injustice to the public good, and assuring him that, with his resignation, the hopes of the people would sink.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2830"/>The Governor of the <rs>State</rs>, besides writing to urge his continuance in the service, sent a friend of the greatest weight in the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> to expostulate in person against his intended retirement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2831"/>To all these <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0009.00279.00835" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Henry,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> made the same reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2832"/>To the <rs>Governor</rs>, he had tersely stated the grounds of his decision in the following words:--<quote>The order was given without consulting me; it is abandoning to the enemy what has cost much preparation, <pb id="p.280" n="280"/> expense, and exposure to secure; it is in direct conflict with my military plans; it implies a want of confidence in my capacity to judge when <persName n="Loring,General,,,," id="n0013.0009.00280.00836" reg="mostcommon:Loring,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Loring</surname></persName>'s troops should fall back; and it is an attempt to control military operations in detail, from the <rs>Secretary</rs>'s desk at a distance.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2833"/>To his ambassador, he now added, that he had no personal pique to satisfy; for, however he might feel at another time, that he himself was wronged, the hour of his country's extremity was no occasion to weigh private grievances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2834"/>Neither had he any complaint to lodge against his superior, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>; but, presuming that he was a considerate and firm man, he must infer that the order given in this case was an example of his intended system of management.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2835"/>And, then, he was satisfied that he could not hope to serve his country usefully or successfully under such a system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2836"/>But it was the rule of his life never to hold a position where he could not be useful; his conscience forbade it. He had not sought command because it was sweet to him; he had no ambition to gratify; the soldier's stormy career had no allurements for him; and nothing on earth, save the hope of being useful to his injured country, had ever persuaded him to forego the happiness of a beloved home, and a congenial occupation, for the daily martyrdom of his present cares.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2837"/>Now that this hope was extinguished, he felt that the voice of duty, which alone had driven him out from his happy privacy, not only permitted, but commanded his return to it. It was answered that he should be willing to make sacrifices to serve his country, in her hour of need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2838"/><quote>Sacrifices</quote> he exclaimed; <quote>have I not made them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2839"/>What is my life here but a daily sacrifice?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2840"/>Nor shall I ever withhold sacrifices for my country, where they will avail anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2841"/>I intend to serve her, anywhere, in any way in which I am permitted to do it with effect, even if it be as a private soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2842"/>But if this method of making war is to prevail, which <pb id="p.281" n="281"/> they seek to establish in my case, the country is ruined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2843"/>My duty to her requires that I shall utter my protest against it in the most energetic form in my power; and that is, to resign.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2844"/>And then, traversing the floor of his chamber with rapid strides, he burst into an impetuous torrent of speech, in which he detailed his comprehensive projects with a Napoleonic fire and breadth of view; his obstacles, created by the reluctance and incompetency of some, with whom he had been required to co-operate; his hardships, and the heroic spirit of his troops; the brilliant success with which <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> had crowned his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> steps, and the cruel disappointment which dashed the fruit of all his labors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2845"/>For a long time he was inexorable; but at last, When he was told that the <rs>Governor</rs> had, in the name of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 32" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, withdrawn his resignation from the files of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, and requested that action should be suspended upon it until an attempt was made to remove his grounds of difficulty, he consented to acquiesce in this arrangement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2846"/>In a few days he received the assurance, that it had never been the purpose of the <rs>Government</rs> to introduce the obnoxious system against which he protested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2847"/>Accepting this as a sufficient guarantee that his command would not hereafter bQ subjected to such a system of interference, he quietly left his resignation in the hands of the <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">chief magistrate</rs> of the <rs>State</rs>, and resumed his tasks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2848"/>In this transaction, <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0009.00281.00837" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Henry,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> gained <num value="1">one</num> of his most important victories for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2849"/>Had the system of encouragement to the insubordination of inferiors, and of interference with the responsibilities of commanders in the field, which was initiated in his case, become established, military success could only have been won by accident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2850"/>By his firmness, the evil usage was arrested, and a lesson impressed both upon the government and the public opinion of the country, which <pb id="p.282" n="282"/> warrants that it will not soon be revived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2851"/>Whether he had any expectation of this result, when he demanded a release from the service, it is useless to surmise: if he had, his sound judgment taught him that the way to secure this issue was to seem not to expect it, but to offer an explicit resignation, and to act as though he anticipated nothing else than its certain acceptance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2852"/>The <num value="1">one</num> instance in which he betrayed the emotions which were aroused by the affair, has been related.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2853"/>In no other case did he show a shade of feeling, and the grandest impression which the people about him ever received of the greatness of his moral nature, was that made by his demeanor under this trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2854"/>He uttered no complaint against his detractors or his superiors, and calmly refused to listen to those who endeavored, in that form, to express their sympathy with his wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2855"/>While he thanked them for their partial estimate of his value to the country, he exhorted them, for his sake, not to relax anything of their own zeal; and he showed the same care and diligence in preparing everything for the advantage of his unknown successor, as though he had expected to continue in permanent command of the district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2856"/>Concerning the operations of his army he had always been obstinately silent, and repelled inquiry with sternness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2857"/>It appeared that this reserve was dictated, not by pride or love of power, but by a sense of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2858"/>Now that the concern respected his own interests, he had no secrecy, and invited the most candid expressions of opinion; save that he would not permit any denunciations of those who, as his friends supposed, had sought to injure him. As soon as the affair was terminated, it was banished from his conversation, and he was never again heard to allude to the actors in it, except where he could honestly applaud them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2859"/>He appeared to be elevated wholly above all the infirmities of passion; and the <pb id="p.283" n="283"/> only human emotion which was apparent, even to his wife, who was then on a visit to him, was the revival of his genial gaiety, at the prospect of their speedy return to their home. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2860"/>His domestic tastes led him, whenever his duties confined him to the town, to take his meals with the family of a congenial <name>Christian</name> friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2861"/>To them there appeared, during these trials, the most beautiful display of <name>Christian</name> temper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2862"/>His dearest relaxation from the harassing cares of his command, were the caresses of the children, and the prayers of the domestic altar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2863"/>When he led in the latter, as he was often invited to do, it was with increasing humility and tenderness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2864"/>A prevalent petition was that they <quote>might grow in gentleness;</quote> and he never spoke of his difficulties, except as a kind discipline, intended for his good, by his <name n="God" type="God">Heavenly Father</name>. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2914"/>The reader has now reached the commencement of that wondrous campaign in the <rs type="place">Valley of Virginia</rs>, which created his fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2915"/>Before the narrative is begun, it will not be unprofitable to pass in review the general theatre of the war, and the posture and advantages of the <num value="2">two</num> parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2916"/>This survey, as well as the subsequent history, will involve the use of a few technical terms, whose definition may be helpful to the unprofessional reader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2917"/>In accordance with the best usage the word <hi rend="italics">Strategy</hi> will be employed to denote the art of giving the proper direction to the movements of an army upon the theatre of war. A <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Strategic Point">Strategic Point</placeName></hi> is a place, which, from geographical or other reasons, secures for its occupant some advantage in strategic movements, and thence, some control over a part of the theatre of war. Thus, <placeName reg="Manassa's Junction">Manassa's Junction</placeName> was an important strategic point for the <rs>Confederates</rs> in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, because the <num value="2">two</num> railroads meeting there gave them the decisive advantage in all movements over <pb id="p.289" n="289"/> the territory through which they pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2918"/>So, an important fortress, a <hi rend="italics">focus</hi> where many highways meet, a mountain defile constituting the main entrance to a region, may be such a point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2919"/>The phrase <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Tactics,General,,,," id="n0013.0010.00289.00868" reg="mostcommon:Tactics,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Tactics</surname></persName></hi> expresses the art of arraying and using an army successfully upon a field of battle; while special tactics is the drill which is taught to the single soldier, the company, or the battalion, in the several branches of infantry, cavalry, or artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2920"/>A <hi rend="italics">Base of Operations</hi> is that line, or series of neighboring points, in secure possession of an army, whence it sets out to assail its enemy, whence it continually draws its supplies and reinforcements, and to which it may retreat for safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2921"/>Its <hi rend="italics">Line of Operations</hi> is the zone along which an army advances from its base toward the object of its attack; and its <hi rend="italics">Line of Communications</hi> is but the same tract, usually, viewed in the inverted direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2922"/>It might appear from this definition, that an army's line of operations would be projected always at right angles to its base, or in a direction approximating this; but while this is often true, it is not necessarily so, and instances arise in which the most successful line of operations may be oblique, or even almost parallel to the base.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2923"/>Other terms which occur will now easily explain themselves to the attentive reader, without the formality of definitions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2924"/>The <num value="1">one</num> decisive advantage, to which the <rs>North</rs> owes all its successes over the <rs>South</rs>, has been, not its larger territories, or population, or armies, or geographical position, but its superiority upon the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2925"/>And this is true, as will be made clear, notwithstanding that it has been chiefly a war upon land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2926"/>At the division of the <rs>Union</rs>) the <rs>Government</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 11" reg="district of columbia">Washington</placeName> retained all the <rs>Federal Navy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2927"/>Many of its States were maritime and manufacturing communities; while those of the <rs>South</rs> were chiefly agricultural; hence the multiplication of ships and sailors, from the river transport up to the man-of-war, was far more <pb id="p.290" n="290"/> rapid among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2928"/>This inequality was made more ruinous to the naval force of the <rs>South</rs>, by the further fact, that the initial superiority of the <rs>North</rs> excluded her rival from all foreign sources of supply, for equipping and manning ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2929"/>The result has been, that the <rs>Confederates</rs> have had no opportunity to cope with their invaders upon the water; and whereever an entrance was open to Federal ships, either upon sea or river, the former have been expelled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2930"/>It has also been the misfortune of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, to have the hitherto unsettled question, whether shore-batteries can prevent the passage of ships of war, decided, in novel instances, of the most serious importance to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2931"/>When ships were only propelled by the winds, a motive power never so forcible as steam, save in tempests, variable, uncertain, liable to desert the mariner at the critical moment, and leaving him no option save that of moving in a direction somewhat conformed to its own, or else, of casting anchor, artillerists might well boast, that the stationary battery would usually destroy the vessel which challenged its fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2932"/>But our generation has witnessed the introduction of steam-ships of war, having a regular and unfailing motive power within themselves, propelling them irrespective of winds and tides, in any direction desired, and capable of a speed as safe and steady, at once, as that of the gentle breeze, and as rapid as the hurricane.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2933"/>When to these advantages is added the iron plating, which, if not impenetrable, at least delays the ruin of the ship's frame-work until after a series of blows, it becomes probable, that such a vessel of war might brave the bullets of shore-batteries, and pass them with impunity without silencing them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2934"/>But the old authorities of the land service, confident in the former precedents, still declared that such batteries must ever be a secure protection against the entrance of ships of war into rivers and harbors; and it required the disastrous events of <pb id="p.291" n="291"/> <placeName reg="Island Number Ten, New Madrid, Missouri" key="tgn,2552260">Island No.10</placeName>, of New Orleans, and at last, of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, in each of which the batteries were passed, and thus rendered useless, without being silenced, to teach the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> this new fact in warfare. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2935"/>Let it be remembered, then, that the oceans which bound <num value="2">two</num> sides of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, belong to their enemy, affording them a way of approach, cheap, speedy, and secure from assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2936"/>This fact renders the whole sea-shore, wherever harbor or inlets gave access to Federal ships,, a base of operations to their armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2937"/>It has made it all an exposed frontier, and brought the enemy upon it all, as though he had embraced its whole circumference with coterminous territories of his own. Popular readers may form to themselves some conception of the disastrous influence of this fact, by representing to themselves the inland kingdom of <placeName key="tgn,7003669" n="1.000 15" reg="bayern">Bavaria</placeName>, assailed at once on <num value="4">four</num> sides, by <placeName reg="Austria" key="tgn,1000062">Austria</placeName>, <placeName reg="Switzerland" key="tgn,7011731">Switzerland</placeName>, and the <rs>German States</rs>, all united under a single hostile will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3151"/>The obvious mode for effecting this would have appeared to be to ascend the ridge at its southwestern end, and thus proceed along its crest; but such a movement was forbidden by an extensive pond, formed on the <rs>Opequon</rs> for feeding a mill, whose waters embraced that extremity of the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3491"/>He ascertained that his orders for obstructing the turnpike below <placeName reg="Franklin, Williamson, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017751">Franklin</placeName> had been disregarded by the citizens; and their supineness and timidity filled him with disgust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3492"/>It was now obvious that his cunning adversary, with an unobstructed road for retreat, and all the advantages of a mountainous country for defence, would not be brought to a battle, until he had received the support of <persName n="Fremont,General,,,," id="n0013.0012.00352.01193" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Fremont</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4695"/>There were no topographical surveys of the country, and all the <rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">general officers</rs> were strangers to it. It was a country of numerous intricate roads, of marshy streams, and of forests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4696"/>Hence every march and every position of the enemy was enveloped in mystery, until it was disclosed in some way at the cost of the <rs>Confederates</rs>; and every movement made by them in pursuit was in some degree tentative. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4697"/>Among the unavoidable difficulties may, perhaps, be also ranked that which was, directly or indirectly, the fruitful parent of every miscarriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4698"/>The army was not sufficiently instructed, either in its officers or its men, for its great work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4699"/>The capacity to command, the practical skill and tact, the professional knowledge, the devotion to duty, which make the efficient officer, do not come in a day; and few are the natures which are capable of learning them to a high degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4700"/>When the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> attempted to produce <hi rend="italics">extempore</hi> officers of all grades for armies so great, out of a people who had been reared in the pursuits of peace, it could only be partially successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4701"/>The company and field officers competent to instruct and govern their men thoroughly, and to keep them to their colors amidst the confusion of battle and the fatigues of forced marches, were far too few for the regiments to be commanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4702"/>There were not enough Brigadiers, who knew how to manoeuvre a brigade quickly or vigorously; nor enough <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-Generals</rs> able to handle a great mass of troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4703"/>Hence that deficiency in the functions of the <rs>Staff</rs> which has been already explained, by reason of which the commander was ever in imperfect communication with his forces, and was never certain that his wishes <pb id="p.480" n="480"/> were properly conveyed to all of them, or that he was possessed of their whole situation when out of his sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4704"/>Through so imperfect a medium perfect unison in action could never be gained, upon a theatre like that of <placeName key="tgn,2489907" n="1.000 203" reg="malvern hill, charles city, virginia">Malvern Hill</placeName>, extended over miles of wooded country, and including the convergent movements of several separate armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4705"/>It was from these causes the bungling combinations proceeded, upon every important field of this brief campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4706"/>Enough officers always manoeuvred their commands so slowly as to compel the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> to let slip critical hours, and to wear away the day which should have been employed in attacking and pursuing.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4708"/>The event also taught, what no forecast, perhaps, would have foreseen, that a more efficient employment of the cavalry upon the enemy's flanks would have put the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> in earlier possession of essential information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4709"/>It has been seen that <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0013.0015.00480.02047" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, after his return from the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>, was directed to remain upon the north side of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, guarding the <rs type="place">Long Bridge</rs>, and the other crossings below; and that he only rejoined the army the night of <dateStruct value="-07-1"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="1">1st</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4710"/>He should rather have been required to cross the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> immediately, and press as closely upon the line of the enemy's actual operations, let it be where it might, as was possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4711"/>He would thus have equally fulfilled the purpose of his stay upon the north side, to ascertain that they did not retire toward <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> by the lower roads; and he would probably have discovered at once, their <pb id="p.481" n="481"/> real movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4715"/>Was it his purpose to convert this spot into a permanent entrenched camp, to defend it from all such assaults as he had just experienced on the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, by his engineering skill; to provision it from his ships, and thus to establish himself again within <placeName><distance reg="15miles">fifteen miles</distance> of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></placeName>, upon a base which <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0013.0015.00481.02051" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:7"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s wisdom taught him to be a better <num value="1">one</num> than that which he had lost?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4716"/>If this was his design, then it was imperative that he should be dislodged; and the more speedily it was attempted, the less patriot blood would it cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4717"/>For if he were permitted to fix himself here, all the toil and loss of the glorious week would be vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4718"/>But now, add the fact that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0013.0015.00481.02052" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,B.,,:1"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> had sent all his trains to another spot, and that he stood upon <placeName key="tgn,2489907" n="1.000 203" reg="malvern hill, charles city, virginia">Malvern Hill</placeName> with nothing but his ammunition, and the supplies of a day; and it became probable that he would retreat from this place, whether he were attacked or not; that he would retreat whither his trains had preceded him, and that he was only standing at bay for a short time, to secure the privilege of that retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4719"/>The question thus assumed a new aspect, whether it were better to assail him on his chosen ground, at such a cost of blood, or to wait for a fairer opportunity as he withdrew. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4721"/>The attack was made in detail, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> at <num value="1">one</num> point, and then at another, instead of being simultaneous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4723"/>But it is worthy of question whether <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0013.0015.00482.02056" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,B.,,:1"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s advantage of position could not have been neutralized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4726"/>These facts seemed to point to the policy of extending the <rs>Confederate</rs> left, until his egress by the river road was so violently threatened as to compel him to weaken his impregnable front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4727"/>The great body of forest, which confronted his centre, might have been safely left to the guardianship of a skirmish line; for their weakness would have been concealed by the woods, and the enemy was, on that day, in no aggressive mood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4728"/>A powerful mass of artillery and infantry displayed beyond their extreme right, would probably have produced the happiest effects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4729"/>Last, the tardy and indirect pursuit which followed the battle, was the least excusable blunder of all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5589"/>The answer is to be found chiefly in the traits of his people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5590"/>Their general vanity and falsehood prompted his officers and men, when beaten by the <rs>Confederates</rs>, to cover their own cowardice under wondrous tales of the overpowering numbers before which they gave way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5594"/>Another cause of imperfect success to the <rs>Confederate</rs> arms, was the too great dispersion of their forces before the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5870"/>It therefore offered to the occupants the advantages of a double line of low, but very substantial field-works; for the embankments, consolidated by time, and interlaced with the roots of trees, offered a perfect defence against rifle balls, and no mean protection against heavier projectiles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5873"/>It is just where the heights finally sink into the wide valley of that creek, that the railroad crosses an old country thoroughfare, known as the mine road; and here was seated a little way-side station, called <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Hamilton's Crossing</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6095"/>When some of the citizens, who had remained shut up in their houses during the whole struggle, came with candles to their doors, to learn the cause of the strange, dull buzz which filled the air, they were startled to find the streets packed with dense columns of men, whose faces were all turned toward the river, and who instantly greeted their appearance with the stern whisper, <quote>Put out that light!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6097"/>Some of the officers also sprung from the ranks, snatched the lights from their hands, extinguished them, and thrust the bearers back within doors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6309"/>Whilst I feel that this is the proper course for me to pursue, and the <num value="1">one</num> which is congenial to my feelings, yet if you and <persName n="Preston,Colonel,,,," id="n0013.0019.00646.03207" reg="mostcommon:Preston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Preston</surname></persName>, after prayerful consultation, are of opinion that my name, in connexion with my wishes, will be the means of doing <pb id="p.647" n="647"/> good, I do not desire any sensibility that I may have to be a draw-back in the way of doing good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6312"/>I take the liberty of writing to you and him my views: both of you have had large experience in the church,--you have both been known to the church for years, and after maturely considering what I write, <hi rend="italics">you</hi> can with propriety publish, should you think best, any thing that I may have said <hi rend="italics">without saying that such was my view</hi>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6313"/>My views are summed up in a few words, which are these: Each <name>Christian</name> branch of the church should send into the army some of its most prominent ministers, who are distinguished for their piety, talents, and zeal; and such ministers should labor to produce concert of action among chaplains and Christians in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6314"/>These ministers should give special attention to preaching to regiments which are without chaplains, and induce them to take steps to get chaplains, to let the regiments name the denomination from which they desire chaplains selected; and then to see that suitable chaplains are secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6315"/>A bad selection of a chaplain may prove a curse instead of a blessing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6316"/>If the few prominent ministers thus connected with each army would cordially co-operate, I believe that glorious fruits would be the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6317"/>Denominational distinctions should be kept out of view, and not touched upon; and as a general rule, I do not think that a chaplain who would preach denominational sermons, should be in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6318"/>His congregation is his regiment, and it is composed of persons of various denominations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6319"/>I would like to see no question asked in the army, as to what denomination a chaplain <pb id="p.648" n="648"/> belongs; but let the question be, does he preach the <name>Gospel</name>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6320"/>The neglect of spiritual interests in the army may be partially seen in the fact that not half of my regiments have chaplains.</p></body></text> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6322"/>The Government, after a time, commissioned him as an army chaplain, without assigning him to a particular regiment; an exceptional act of courtesy accorded to <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0019.00648.03211" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Cummings,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>'s high character and express request.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6323"/>In his letter to his other friends, he had modestly expressed his inexperience of ecclesiastical affairs, and his intention to commit the details of the plan of evangelical labors in the army to the advice of the clergyman, after <persName n="Lacy,Mister,,,," id="n0013.0019.00648.03212" reg="nearbymention:Lacy,B.,T.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lacy</surname></persName> had examined his ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6324"/>But the scheme adopted was that which the <rs>General</rs> had entertained in his own mind in the beginning of the campaign of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, and which, indeed, he had then attempted to effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6325"/>The exacting nature of the campaign, and the failure to enjoy at that time the assistance upon which he relied for its execution, had caused its postponement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6326"/>But it was his design, which was now in substance resumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6327"/>His objects were <num value="3">three</num>: to supply regiments destitute of chaplains with a partial substitute in the shape of the itinerant labors of efficient ministers; to supply a channel of intercourse between the army and the bodies of clergy of different denominations, through which the latter might learn the wants of the former, and to give to the labors of the chaplains and other ministers in the army, the unity and impulse of an ecclesiastical organization within their own peculiar field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6328"/>His chaplain was intended by him to be an exemplar, who, he hoped, would be followed by many others from among the most efficient preachers of all churches, until they should be brought into vital sympathy with the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6329"/><pb id="p.649" n="649"/> </p> 
<p><num value="1">One</num> of the measures adopted was the preaching of the gospel at the <name>Headquarters</name> of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0019.00649.03213" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Cummings,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, and under his immediate countenance, every Sabbath, while the troops were in their camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6330"/>For this end, a place in the open field was prepared, near <placeName reg="Hamilton, Butler, Ohio" key="tgn,7015730">Hamilton</placeName>'s crossing, (to which <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0019.00649.03214" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Cummings,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> removed his quarters soon after,) with rude seats and a temporary pulpit, where public worship was held in the open air. The example of so famous a warrior, always potent among soldiers when sustained by official rank, the curiosity to see him and the galaxy of celebrities who came to worship with him, the eloquence of the preachers, and the purer motives which the great religious awakening now began to propagate far and wide, soon drew a vast congregation to this spot on the <name>Sabbath</name> days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6331"/>From hundreds it grew to <num value="1000">thousands</num>, until the assemblage surrounded the preacher in a compact mass, as far as his voice could be distinctly heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6332"/>Here, on a brights Sabbath in the spring, might be seen the stately head of the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs>, with a crowd of <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, whose names had been borne by fame across the ocean, and of legislators and statesmen, bowed along with the multitude of private soldiers, in divine worship; while the solemn and tender wave of sacred emotion subdued the great and the unknown alike before it. At these scenes, which were so directly produced by his instrumentality, <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0019.00649.03215" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Cummings,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was the most unobtrusive assistant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6333"/>Seated in some retired spot amidst the private soldiers, he listened to the worship and the preaching with an edifying attention, and watched the power of the truth upon the great congregation, with a glow of elevated and tender delight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6334"/>Never, since the days when <persName n="Whitefield,,,,," id="n0013.0019.00649.03216" reg="mostcommon:Whitefield,nomatch:0"><surname>Whitefield</surname></persName> preached to the mingled crowd of peers and beggars in Moorfields, has the sky looked down upon a more imposing worship. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6335"/>Another enterprise which marked the evangelical labors of <pb id="p.650" n="650"/> this winter, was the building of temporary chapels by the men for their own worship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6336"/><num value="2">Two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> contiguous regiments usually concurred in the work. .Tall trees were cut down, and brought to the spot by the teams of the <name>Quartermasters</name>, and built into walls of logs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6337"/>Chimneys were built of the same rude material, and plastered with clay, whence the huge fires, and the torches of resinous pine, diffused a ruddy glow of warmth and light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6338"/>The structure was roofed with clapboards, and seated with rude benches formed from the split bodies of trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6339"/>The <orgName n="Stonewall Brigade" type="brigade">Stonewall Brigade</orgName> was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to begin this work, to <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0019.00650.03217" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Cummings,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>'s great delight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6340"/>No sooner had they completed their own huts, than they set to work, and by a multitude of willing hands, completed their church in a few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6341"/>The next Sabbath it was formally dedicated to the worship of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; and during the winter, was constantly occupied in turn by the chaplains of the several regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6342"/>During the week, frequent meetings for prayer, and bible classes, were held here by torchlight, and the men were encouraged to expend their leisure in the study of the scriptures, and in sacred music, instead of the degrading amusements of the card-table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6343"/>As this chapel was near the quarters of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0019.00650.03218" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Cummings,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, he often came to worship in it with his favorite brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6344"/>Instead of affecting the chief seat in the synagogue, he delighted to sit among the rough, weather-beaten privates, and lay aside all official dignity to accompany them to the throne of grace on the common footing of worshippers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6345"/>Their reverence for his person sometimes led them to leave a respectful distance between themselves and the seat he occupied; but he would never consent that any space should be thus lost, where so many were crowding to hear the word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6346"/>As he saw them seeking seats elsewhere, he was accustomed to rise, and invite them by gesture to the vacancies near him; and was never so well satisfied as when he had an <pb id="p.651" n="651"/> unkempt soldier touching his elbow on either hand, and all the room about him compactly filled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6347"/>Then he was ready to address himself with his usual fixed attention to the services. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6348"/>The most important measure which he introduced was the weekly chaplains' meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6349"/>This was a temporary association of all the chaplains and evangelists of his <hi rend="italics">corps</hi>, who, on meeting, appointed <num value="1">one</num> of their own number to preside as a chairman or moderator, and another as their secretary, and after joining in public worship, proceeded to consult upon the spiritual interests of their charges, to arrange and concert their labors, and to devise means for supplying the destitutions of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6350"/>These counsels were a true evangelical union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6351"/>By a common and silent consent, which bears high testimony to the cultivation and honor of these laborious men, all subjects of sectarian debate, were effectually excluded, and their deliberations were confined to the interests of our common Christianity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6352"/>But it was also a high evidence of the general soundness of religious opinion in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, that there was not a single regiment in the army, which showed a disposition to introduce a minister who did not belong to an evangelical and orthodox communion, as their chaplain, except <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> priests of the <rs type="place">Romish Church</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6353"/>On the other hand, the office in the <rs>Federal</rs> army was as frequently filled by <placeName reg="Universalists">Universalists</placeName>, and other erratic heretics, or by laymen who never preached, as by regular ministers of the gospel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6354"/><persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0019.00651.03219" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Cummings,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> displayed his delicate sense of propriety by not attending these weekly synods of his chaplains statedly himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6355"/>But he watched them with lively interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6356"/>As soon as his own chaplain returned from them, he was accustomed to call him, and say: <quote>Now come and report.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6357"/>He inquired into all that was said and done, and all the measures proposed, for evangelizing his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6358"/>When he was told of the fraternal <pb id="p.652" n="652"/> love which reigned among the chaplains, of the devout spirit manifested in their worship, and of the news of the ingathering of souls which they brought from their several charges, his eyes were often filled with happy tears, and he blessed <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for the grace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6359"/>The stated meetings of the chaplains were the means of awakening them to a greatly increased zeal and fidelity, as well as for adding system and concert to their labors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6360"/>So that this service, which, while adorned by the fidelity of a number of truly apostolic men, had yet fallen, in general, into no little disfavor, was now thoroughly renovated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6361"/>Thus the energy of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0019.00652.03220" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Cummings,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>'s will, though so modestly exerted, made itself felt among his-chaplains, just as among his staff and field officers, in communicating efficiency and vigor to all their performance of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6362"/>It was remarked of him, that while no <rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">General officer</rs> had so unpretending a Staff, none other was so efficient as his. This was due not so much to the character of the men who constituted it, as to the force of his own example and energy, in inspiring the spirit of endeavor, among all who were subject to his authority. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6363"/>The weekly meetings of the chaplains effected more good than he had hoped from them; for he had warned others not to anticipate too much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6364"/>Hence, when he found that his plans were bearing so much fruit, he was filled with delight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6365"/><num value="1">One</num> of the benefits of the movement was the bringing of the ministers in the army into closer connexion with his person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6366"/>His own chaplain was a bond of union also between himself and the others, through which they were encouraged to visit his quarters more unreservedly, and to know and love him, not as a commander only, but also as a Christian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6367"/>To every worthy preacher of the gospel his manner was full of warmth and tenderness, showing that he esteemed them very highly in love for their work's sake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6368"/>Everything was done with a thoughtful affection, to facilitate their labors, and <pb id="p.653" n="653"/> provide for their comforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6369"/>His contributions from his private purse were also large, to provide them with means for supplying their charges with Bibles and religious reading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6370"/>The Government had never made any provision for the support of the chaplains in their work, other than a very inadequate salary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6371"/>The General now applied to the <orgName n="Military Committee" type="committee">Military Committee</orgName> of Congress, to bring in a law enabling Quartermasters to provide chaplains, like other officers, with tents, fuel, and forage for horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6372"/>This just measure was indeed neglected amidst the hurry of the closing session, but was finally adopted by a subsequent Congress. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6374"/>He said that a chaplain should not think of resigning his post for any less cause than would justify a field-officcr in laying down his commission; and that they should no more think than he, of leaving his regiment without a regular furlough, founded upon just cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6375"/>To do so, he argued, taught the men by a practical lesson, that the soul was less important than the body, and that secular duties were more urgent than the business of redemption. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6376"/>When with chaplains whom he esteemed like-minded, <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0019.00653.03223" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Cummings,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was very sure to turn all conversation speedily into a spiritual channel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6377"/>With intimate <name>Christian</name> friends, the things of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> were almost his exclusive topics in private.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6378"/>His favorite subjects now were, the importance of an unshaken faith; of casting all our care upon <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in the diligent performance of duty; and of the evidences of the <name>Divine</name> faithfulness in the course of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> and redemption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6379"/>He spoke emphatically of the duty of <pb id="p.654" n="654"/> conforming our wills to <name n="God" type="God">God's</name>, and of a thoroughly cheerful acquiescence whenever His will was manifested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6380"/>He was often delighted to speculate upon the modes in which the <name>Divine</name> will might be safely ascertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6381"/>His favorite maxim was: <quote>Duty is ours: consequences are <name n="God" type="God">God's</name>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6382"/>He spoke much also of the blessedness of a full and hearty obedience, in its effects upon the <rs>Christian</rs>'s own happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6383"/>He often declared that it was his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> desire to command a <quote>converted army.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6384"/>This, he believed, enjoying the spiritual favor of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> upon their individual souls, engaged in a just cause, and undertaking every enterprise with prayer, must meet with success; and prove, in the end, invincible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6385"/>He spoke frequently also of the connexion between national obedience and public prosperity; declaring that it is holiness which exalteth a people; and showing the supreme importance of the <rs>Government</rs>'s at least refraining from placing itself, in any way, in opposition to <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> laws and institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6386"/>Hence his zeal for the outward and spiritual observance of the <name>Sabbath</name>, which has been noted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6387"/><num value="1">One</num> more favorite project remains to be mentioned, in which about this time, he sought to interest those who met him. This was the establishment of a Christian Daily Newspaper, which should honor <name n="God" type="God">God</name> by refraining from all Sabbath work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6388"/>He argued that their issue of Monday should contain nothing printed after <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>; and that Christians should be willing to receive their news later by <num value="1">one</num> day, once during the week, in order to honor <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> law. If this delay should diminish the circulation of such a journal, and make it less remunerative than others; he declared that he was willing to repay a part of this loss out of his own means. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6389"/>As soon as his quarters were established at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Hamilton's Crossing</placeName>, he began the custom of regular domestic worship in his mess, each morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6390"/>These services were willingly attended by <pb id="p.655" n="655"/> all his staff, out of respect for his <name>Christian</name> character, or from their own interest in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6391"/>He, who was of all men least obtrusive in his religion, carefully forbore from commanding their attendance, although his beaming face indicated plainly enough the pleasure he felt in seeing them present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6392"/>Whenever his chaplain was not there, he always conducted these services himself, with his customary unction and humility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6393"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> nights, there was also a prayer meeting observed at his quarters, where he was always a worshipper, and led the devotions of his brethren, when desired to do so by a minister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6394"/>A few of the young men upon his Staff had cultivated the delightful art of sacred music.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6395"/>On the afternoon of the <name>Sabbaths</name>, when the necessary business, which he always reduced within the narrowest limits, was despatched, it was his favorite occupation to have singing; and frequently, as the little choir was concluding, he said; <quote>Now let us have the hymn;</quote> <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6608"/>It was here that he committed his fatal blunder,--a blunder inexcusable even when judged, in the absence of the light cast upon his situation by subsequent events, by his own professed conclusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6609"/>If he believed that the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> was indeed retreating into the interior of <placeName key="tgn,2114316" n="1.000 8" reg="spotsylvania, spotsylvania, virginia">Spottsylvania</placeName>, and thence toward <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, it is strange that the bold front still maintained against him on the east by <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0013.0020.00678.03403" reg="nearbymention:Lee,FitzHugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> did not suggest an anxious doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6611"/>Did it not point, too strongly for a moment's hesitation, to the propriety of his at once attacking them in such force as to learn what they truly meant?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6612"/>And if he found them obstinate and immovable upon his east front, would not that result dictate still more clearly that he should move upon their south or left flank, if necessary, with his whole force, until they were forced back, and the mystery of <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s disappearance on that side, and of the unaccountable gap which he was placing between himself and his friends, was cleared up?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6613"/>The history of war contains no stronger instance of the danger of the policy of <quote>the stationary defensive,</quote> when adhered to in disregard of new circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6615"/>But the prudence of this plan depended wholly upon their making that attack in that mode in which he had prepared himself to receive it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6618"/>The narrative returns now to his march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6619"/>The troops, comprehending instantly that he was engaged in <num value="1">one</num> of his famous assaults upon his enemy's flanks, responded to his eager spirit zealously, and pressed forward along the narrow country road at a rapid gait.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6995"/>He now began to look forward to his restoration to his command, and inquired of <persName n="McGuire,Doctor,,,," id="n0013.0021.00713.03690" reg="nearbymention:McGuire,Hunter,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>McGuire</surname></persName>, how many weeks would probably elapse before he would be fit for the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6996"/>He also requested his chaplain to visit him at <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> each morning, for reading the <name>Scriptures</name> and prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6997"/>These seasons were the occasions of much religious conversation, in which he unbosomed himself with unusual freedom and candor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6998"/>He declared that his faith and hope in his Redeemer were clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6999"/>He said he was perfectly willing to die at that time; but believed that his time was not yet come, that his <name n="God" type="God">Heavenly Father</name> still had a work for him to do in defence of his beloved country, and that until that was completed, he should be spared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7000"/>During these morning <pb id="p.714" n="714"/> hours, he delighted to enlarge on his favorite topics of practical religion; which were such as these: The <rs>Christian</rs> should carry his religion into everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7001"/>Christianity makes man better in any lawful calling; it equally makes the general a better commander, and the shoemaker a better mechanic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7002"/>In the case of the cobbler, or the tailor, for instance, religion will produce more care in promising work, more punctuality, and more fidelity in executing it, from conscientious motives; and these homely examples were fair illustrations of its value in more exalted functions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7003"/>So, prayer aids any man, in any lawful business, not only by bringing down the divine blessing, which is its direct and prime object, but by harmonizing his own mind and heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7004"/>In the commander of an army at the critical hour, it calmed his perplexities, moderated his anxieties, steadied the scales of judgment, and thus preserved him from exaggerated and rash conclusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7005"/>Again he urged, that every act of man's life should be a religious act.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7243"/>And this war should show that Confederate soldiers could do as much. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7245"/>It has been truly remarked of him, that he was never routed in battle; that he was never successfully surprised by his enemies; that he never had a train, or any organized portion of his army, captured by them; and that he never made entrenchments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7246"/>His success did not come by chance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7247"/>While no commander recognized so devoutly and habitually the direction of <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name>, none was ever more unwearied in providing the conditions of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7248"/>It was his rule that his chief Quartermaster and chief Commissary should see him every day at <time value="10am">10 o'clock, A. M.</time>, unless sent for at other hours, and report fully the condition of their departments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7249"/><measure n="24hours" type="date">Twenty-four hours</measure> never passed without interviews with both of them; and he knew the exact state of all his supplies and trains, at all times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7250"/>He was exceedingly jealous for the comfort of his men, so far as this <pb id="p.735" n="735"/> was compatible with celerity of movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7251"/>Many instances might be cited of his care about their rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7252"/>When preparing for his march to <placeName key="tgn,2119828" n="1.000 34" reg="romney, hampshire, west virginia">Romney</placeName> in the winter of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, he directed the <rs type="role" reg="chief-Commissary">chief Commissary</rs> to carry along rations of rice for the army, in addition to the other supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7253"/>That officer remarked that rice was not much favored by the men as an article of food, and that they seldom drew it when in quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7254"/>The General replied that nevertheless, they might desire it when on the march, and he did not wish them to be deprived of any part of their appointed supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7255"/>Several hogsheads of rice were accordingly carried along, and brought back untouched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7256"/>So, his care of his wounded was great, and no commander kept his <orgName n="Medical Department" type="department">medical department</orgName> more efficiently organized than he. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7257"/>Gem <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s personal demeanor toward his soldiers was reserved, but courteous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7258"/>It was impossible for any to assume an improper familiarity towards him; and no <num value="1">one</num> could be farther than he from all the arts of the demagogue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7259"/>He never did anything for dramatic effect or for popularity, and never practised any of those means for inspiring enthusiasm, in which <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0013.0021.00735.03771" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> was such an adept.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7260"/>The only manifestation which he ever made of himself to his command was in the simple, single-minded performance of his duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7261"/>He never was known to show himself, of set purpose, to his troops, never made them speeches, and whenever they cheered him, escaped as quickly as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7262"/>But his politeness to the men was unfailing, and carried its own evidence of sincerity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7263"/>For instance, he was <num value="1">one</num> day riding where scores of soldiers off duty were passing, and whenever <num value="1">one</num> of these touched his hat to him he did not fail to return the same salutation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7264"/>After thus noticing perhaps a <num value="100">hundred</num> of them, <num value="1">one</num> more deferential than the rest, lifted his hat from his head, when the <rs>General</rs> also, instead of touching his hat again, removed his wholly, and returned the soldier's bow. <pb id="p.736" n="736"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7265"/>His ideas of discipline and subordination were strict, and he was exacting of his subordinates, in proportion as their rank approximated his own. It was his maxim that he who would govern others, must himself set the example of punctilious obedience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7266"/>Hence, to his <rs type="role2">Colonels</rs> he was a stricter master than to his private soldiers; and to his <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, more exacting than to his <rs type="role2">Colonels</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7267"/>If he found in an officer a hearty and zealous purpose to do all his duty, with a willing and self-sacrificing courage and devotion, he was, to him, the most tolerant and gracious of superiors, overlooking blunders and mistakes with unbounded patience, and repairing them by his own exertions, without even a sign of vexation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7268"/>But, if he believed that his subordinates were self-indulgent or contumacious, he became a stern and exacting master, seeming even to watch for an opportunity to visit their shortcomings upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7269"/>It must, in candor, be added, that by this temper he was sometimes misled into prejudice; and during his career, a causeless friction was produced in the working of his government over several gallant and meritorious officers who served under him. This was almost the sole fault of his military character; that by this jealousy of intentional inefficiency, he diminished the sympathy between himself and the <rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">general officers</rs> next his person, by whom his orders were to be executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7270"/>Had he been able to exercise the same energetic authority, through the medium of a zealous personal affection, he would have been a more perfect leader of armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7271"/>But where he had committed unconscious injustice, he was ever ready to amend it, and to correct his estimate of his officers' merits: and nothing was so sure to melt away the last particle of his prejudice, as an act of courage and vigor upon the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7272"/>The utter absence of the <name>Puritanical</name> turn of mind in him, was strongly displayed in the liberal spirit with which he disregarded his own personal tastes, and even his own <pb id="p.737" n="737"/> moral and religious appetencies, in promoting every man who displayed the elements of efficiency, notwithstanding his private repugnance to his personal character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7273"/>The man's manners, tastes, religious condition, might all be utterly repulsive to <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0013.0021.00737.03772" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,T.,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>'s private preferences, but if he saw in him ability to serve the cause, he employed him. Yet all appearance of indifference to error or vice, or of a Sadducean temper, was removed effectually by the care with which he rebuked and suppressed every impropriety in his own presence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7274"/>That devotion to duty which he exacted of others, he practised with most exemplary fidelity himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7275"/>Never was there a man who lived more <quote>as ever in his great Taskmaster's eye,</quote> consecrating every hour and every energy to his country, with an utter disdain of ease and self.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7276"/>From the day he left his home, in <dateStruct value="1861-04-"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, to that when he was brought back to it amidst the tears and benedictions of his people, he never had a furlough; was never off duty for a day, whether sick or well; never visited his family; and never even slept <num value="1">one</num> night outside the lines of his own command. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7277"/>His personal courage was of the truest temper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7278"/>When the history of his early infirmities is recalled, it will appear very unlikely that he was by nature endowed with that hardihood of animal nerve, which makes the courage of the pugilist and gladiator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7279"/>This surmise will appear more probable, when the strange confession is related, which he made to his medical director, <persName n="McGuire,Doctor,,,," id="n0013.0021.00737.03773" reg="mostcommon:McGuire,Hunter,,,:2"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>McGuire</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7280"/>His care for his wounded and sick has been stated; yet he rarely visited the hospital in person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7281"/>He excused himself by saying that he would often do so, but that when he was in cold blood, the sight of wounds and all their disgusting accessaries was insupportable to his nerves!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7282"/>It was not unusual to see him pale and tremulous with excitement at the firing of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun of an opening battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7283"/>But the only true courage is <pb id="p.738" n="738"/> moral courage; and this was so perfect in him, that it had absolutely changed his corporeal nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7284"/>No man could exhibit a more calm indifference to personal danger, and more perfect selfpossession and equanimity in the greatest perils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7285"/>The determination of his spirit so controlled his body, that his very flesh became impassive; the nearest hissing of bullets seemed to produce no quiver of the nerves; and when cannon balls hurtled across his path, there was no involuntary shrinking of the bridle hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7286"/>The power of concentration was of unrivalled force in his mind, and when occupied in profound thought, or inspired with some great purpose, he seemed to become almost unconscious of external things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7287"/>This was the true explanation of that seeming recklessness, with which he sometimes exposed himself on the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7288"/>The populace, who love exaggerations, called him fatalist, and imagined that, like a Mohammedan, he thought natural precautions inconsistent with his firm belief in an overruling <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7289"/>But nothing could be more untrue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7290"/>He always recognized the obligations of prudence and declared that it was not his purpose to expose himself without necessity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7291"/>But this perfect courage does not wholly explain the position which he held in the hearts of his people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7292"/>In this land of heroic memories and brave men, others besides <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0021.00738.03774" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,T.,J.,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> have displayed true courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7293"/>He was not endowed with several of those native gifts which are supposed to allure the idolatry of mankind towards their heroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7294"/>He affected no kingly mien, nor martial pomp:; but always bore himself with the modest propriety of the <rs>Christian</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7295"/>His port on the battle-field was usually rather suggestive of the zeal and industry of the faithful servant, than of the contagious exaltation of the master-spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7296"/>His was a masterspirit; but it was too simply grand to study dramatic sensations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7297"/>It impressed its might upon the souls of his countrymen, not through deportment, but through deeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7298"/>Its discourses were <pb id="p.739" n="739"/> toilsome marches and stubborn battles; its perorations were the thunder-claps of defeat hurled upon the enemies of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7299"/>It revealed itself only through the purity and force of his action; and thence, in part, the intensity of the impression. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7300"/>This aids to explain the enigma of his reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7301"/>How is it that this man, of all others least accustomed to exercise his own fancy, or address that of others, has stimulated the imagination, not only of his own countrymen, but of the civilized world, above all the sons of genius among us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7302"/>How has he, the most unromantic of great men, become the hero of a living romance, the ideal of an inflamed fancy, even before his life has been invested with the mystery of distance?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7303"/>How did that calm eye kindle the fire of so passionate a love and admiration in the heart of his people?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7304"/>He was brave; but not the only brave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7305"/>He revealed transcendent military talent.; but the diadem of his country glowed with a galaxy of such talent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7306"/>He was successful; but it had more than <num value="1">one</num> captain, whose banner never stooped before an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7307"/>The solution is chiefly to be found in the singleness, purity, and elevation of his aims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7308"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> who observed him was as thoroughly convinced of his unselfish devotion to duty, as of his courage, it was no more evident that his was a soul of perfect courage, than that no thought of personal advancement, of ambition or applause, ever for <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="1">one instant</day></dateStruct> divided the homage of his heart with his great cause, and that <quote>all the ends he aimed at were his country's, his <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> and truth's.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7309"/>The corrupt men, whose own patriotism was merely the mask of ambition or greedy avarice, and who had been accustomed to mock at disinterested virtue in their secret hearts, as an empty dream, when they saw the life of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0021.00739.03775" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,T.,J.,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, had as heartfelt a conviction of his ingenuous devotion, as the noblest spirits who delighted to form their souls by the mirror of his example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7310"/>In the presence of his sincerity, the basest were as thoroughly <pb id="p.740" n="740"/> silenced and convinced as the good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7311"/>The confidence of his countrymen was, therefore, the testimony of the common conscience to the beauty of holiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7312"/>It recognized the truth, that the strength of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0013.0021.00740.03776" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,T.,J.,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was in his exalted integrity of soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7313"/>It was the confession of our natures, that the virtue of the <rs>Sacred Scriptures</rs>, is true greatness; grander than knowledge, talent courage, philosophy or success. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7314"/>May it not be concluded then, that this was <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> chief lesson in this life and death!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7315"/>He would teach the beauty and power of true Christianity as an element of national life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7316"/>Therefore He took an exemplar of <name>Christian</name> sincerity, as near perfection as the infirmities of nature would permit, and formed and trained it in an honorable retirement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7317"/>He set it in the furnace of trial at an hour when great events and dangers had awakened the popular heart to most intense action; He illustrated it with that species of distinction which, above all others, fires the popular enthusiasm, military glory; and held it up to the admiring inspection of a country grateful for the deliverances it had wrought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7318"/>Thus <name n="God" type="God">God</name> teaches how good, how strong a thing, His fear is. He makes all men see and acknowledge, that in this man Christianity was the source of those virtues which they so rapturously applauded; that it was the fear of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> which made him so fearless of all else; that it was the love of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> which animated his energies; that it was the singleness of his aims which caused his whole body to be full of light, so that the unerring decisions of his judgment suggested to the unthinking the belief of his actual inspiration; that the lofty chivalry of his nature was but the reflex of the spirit of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0013.0021.00740.03777" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:5"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7319"/>Even the profane admit, in their hearts, this explanation of his power, and are prompt to declare that it was <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s religion which made him what he was. His life is <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> lesson, teaching that <quote>it is righteousness that exalteth a nation.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7320"/></p> 
<p>His fall in the, midst of the great struggle for the existence of <pb id="p.741" n="741"/> his country, and in the morning of his usefulness and fame, has appeared to his people a fearful mystery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7321"/>But if his own interests be regarded, it will appear a time well chosen for <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to call him to his rest; when his powers were in their undimmed prime, and his glory at its zenith; when his greatest victory had just been won; and the last sounds which reached him from the outer world were the thanksgivings and blessings of a nation in raptures with his achievements, in tears for his fall. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7322"/>This tribute to his memory will now be closed with a record of the names of the zealous and faithful men, who at the time of his death, composed his Staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7323"/>In their selection, he had displayed a certain independence, or what many deemed a singularity of judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7324"/>Not many of them were men of military education; for he was of all men least restricted by professional trammels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7325"/>But their efficiency was the best justification of his judgment.
