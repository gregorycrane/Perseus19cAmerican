<head>Preface.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>the work now offered to the public was suggested by the <rs>Committee</rs> of the <rs>British</rs> and Foreign Unitarian Association, and is brought forward under their sanction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>It appeared to them very desirable to place before the public in general, and more especially before the <name>Unitarians</name> of our own time, a series of memoirs of the most distinguished worthies who have adorned our churches, and whose learning and zealous labours have mainly contributed to promote the cause of rational Christianity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>It was also conceived that the practical efficacy of <persName n="Unitarian,,,,," id="n0300.0001.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Unitarian,nomatch:0"><surname>Unitarian</surname></persName> principles might be well illustrated, when displayed in its influence on the lives and character <pb n="vi"/> of its most eminent professors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>It seems important that we should know, not merely what our opinions are, but who and what our fathers were, in whose writings we find them most successfully maintained, and by whom were most ably asserted the genuine Protestant principles of free inquiry and private judgment, which, when followed out fearlessly and consistently, have led to these conclusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>That the <rs>Committee</rs> were right in thinking such an undertaking desirable will be readily admitted; how far they have adopted the best mode of carrying it into effect, is for the public to decide.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The Compiler of the following <rs>Memoirs</rs> has to crave from his readers the usual allowance to the biographer of literary men, whose retired habits and uniform mode of life commonly afford but few of the incidents best fitted to impart the kind of interest chiefly sought for in works of this class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The biography of a man, the greater part of whose life was spent in his study, must consist <pb n="vii"/> in a great measure of an account of what he did in his study;&mdash;of those writings, namely, by which he has often exercised a powerful influence not only over his contemporaries but over successive generations, and earned for himself a name which deserves, and is likely, to be remembered by distant ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>It is hoped that those, for example, who take an interest in the researches which occupied the days and nights of such a man as <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Lardner,,,,," id="n0300.0001.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Lardner,Nathniel,,,:1"><surname>Lardner</surname></persName></hi>, and who can duly estimate the value of the services rendered by him to the <orgName n="Christian world" type="newspaper">Christian world</orgName>, will not think the narrative of his labours flat and insipid, because it exhibits no extraordinary events or varieties of situation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>In some instances it is unfortunately no longer possible to procure the necessary information of various particulars relative to the personal condition and history of eminent persons deservedly honoured for their valuable writings and other results of their labours; and hence the accounts which can now be given of several individuals of <pb n="viii"/> distinguished merit are but meagre and imperfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>This deficiency will be particularly observable with respect to some of those who are remembered chiefly for their services in the conduct of Academical Institutions, but whose important labours in other ways prevented their appearing much before the public through the medium of the press.&mdash;To the other honoured names commemorated under this title, it was the writer's intention to add that of <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Merivale,,,,," id="n0300.0001.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Merivale,nomatch:0"><surname>Merivale</surname></persName>;</hi> but on learning that there was, at length, a prospect of the speedy appearance of an auto-biography of that excellent person, he abandoned the attempt to put together the few slight notices which are to be found scattered here and there in various publications.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>In preparing the <name>Memoirs</name> of Academical Tutors, it will be perceived that very free use has been made of a valuable series of biographical papers inserted many years ago in the <rs>Monthly Repository</rs>, under the then well-known and familiar signature of V. F. Those who are aware to whom <pb n="ix"/> they were indebted for the papers referred to, will join in the regret of the present writer, that their venerable author could not be prevailed on to contribute to this work in a more substantial form than by his occasional opinion and advice. </p></div1>

<head>Introductory Sketch of the early history of Unitarianism in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>although it was not till a much later period that separate religious societies were formed in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, avowedly on <persName n="Unitarian,,,,," id="n0300.0002.00001.00009" reg="mostcommon:Unitarian,nomatch:0"><surname>Unitarian</surname></persName> principles, yet the profession of these principles under <num value="1">one</num> or other of their various forms and denominations is coeval with the <name>Reformation</name>; and this faith can boast of its full share of confessors and martyrs in those spirit-stirring but troubled and persecuting times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>There is good reason to believe, that even the long night of darkness which had settled on the <orgName n="Christian world" type="newspaper">Christian world</orgName> for so many centuries, accompanied and preceded as it was by gross corruptions of the pure simplicity of the <name>Gospel</name>, in no instance more generally prevalent than in the errors which almost totally obscured the doctrine of the absolute personal unity of the divine nature, was at no period altogether devoid of a few feeble glimmerings of that light which in more favourable times was destined afterwards to shine out with renewed lustre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>At all events, the spirit of inquiry which gave rise to the reformation, and <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> was for a considerable time promoted and encouraged by its extensive spread, could not be limited to those questions which were chiefly under discussion between the great religious parties of the day. Accordingly, not a few assertors of Antitrinitarian opinions made their appearance in the very dawn of the <name>Reformation</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The principal leaders, indeed, of the reforming party professed to retain, unchanged, the views of the <rs>Athanasian Trinity</rs> maintained by the <orgName n="Rome Church" type="church">Church of Rome</orgName>; and it would even seem as if the very extent to which they had deviated from the standard of Popery in other directions only increased their solicitude to preserve themselves free from the imputation of heresy on this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>They were thus induced to display, in their treatment of those who had only followed out the genuine principles of Protestantism to a greater extent and with more consistency than themselves, a more than ordinary portion of that persecuting intolerant spirit which, in the language of a distinguished historian, is <q direct="unspecified">the deadly original sin of the reformed churches; that which cools every honest man's zeal for their cause, in proportion as his reading becomes more extensive.</q><note anchored="yes">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The unhappy fate of Servetus is the foulest blot in the history of <persName><foreName>Calvin</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>But before his time there was no small number who openly professed the <rs>Unitarian</rs> doctrine, and among them some of high reputation for talents and learning.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Of the <rs>Italian</rs> confessors whose names impart a peculiar lustre to the early history of the reformation, not a few are well known to have rejected <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> the <rs>Trinity</rs>, along with the other corruptions of the <rs type="place">Romish church</rs>; some of whom afterwards became the most distinguished lights of <persName n="Unitarian,,,,," id="n0300.0002.00003.00011" reg="mostcommon:Unitarian,nomatch:0"><surname>Unitarian</surname></persName> communities in distant lands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Many also of those who received the denomination of Anabaptists openly or covertly denied the deity of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0002.00003.00012" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Of these some adopted the <name>Arian</name> sentiment, others that of the proper humanity of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0002.00003.00013" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, afterwards maintained by <persName n="Socinus,,,,," id="n0300.0002.00003.00014" reg="mostcommon:Socinus,F.,,,:1"><surname>Socinus</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>A few of the <name>Baptists</name> appear to have made their way into <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> even before the half-reformation of <persName><foreName>Henry</foreName> <genName n="8">VIII</genName></persName>., and did not escape the fiery trial allotted to such as incurred the charge of heresy in those fierce and stormy times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>In <dateStruct value="1550--"><year reg="1550">1550</year></dateStruct>, however, the <rs>Unitarian</rs> doctrine is represented as spreading with alarming rapidity, so that it was deemed necessary to resort to harsher measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>She appears to have been a zealous reformer, and particularly active in promoting the diffusion of the <name>Scriptures</name>; which, having access to the court, she was at pains to disperse in secret among the ladies of distinction who resorted there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>For Arianism (as it is called), and some not very intelligible nicety about the incarnation, this excellent person was persecuted to death by <persName n="Cranmer,,,,," id="n0300.0002.00003.00019" reg="mostcommon:Cranmer,nomatch:0"><surname>Cranmer</surname></persName> <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> and <persName n="Latimer,,,,," id="n0300.0002.00004.00020" reg="mostcommon:Latimer,nomatch:0"><surname>Latimer</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>When the tender-hearted young king for some time refused to sign the warrant for her execution, <persName n="Cranmer,,,,," id="n0300.0002.00004.00021" reg="mostcommon:Cranmer,nomatch:0"><surname>Cranmer</surname></persName> undertook to argue the matter with him; and when, at last, he yielded, the king told him, with tears in his eyes, that if he did wrong, since it was in submission to his authority, he must answer to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>This noble-minded martyr to the truth, who, whether right or wrong in her opinions, displayed a spirit of which the world was not worthy, in times of unexampled and formidable difficulty, such as we in these comparatively peaceful days happily cannot easily appreciate, is unfairly described by <persName n="Burnet,,,,," id="n0300.0002.00004.00022" reg="mostcommon:Burnet,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnet</surname></persName> as a poor wrong-headed woman, that was burnt for some extravagant notions concerning <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0002.00004.00023" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, but was looked on as a person fitter for Bedlam than the stake.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Soon afterwards <persName n="Pare,,George,,,Van" id="n0300.0002.00004.00024" reg="expanded:Pare,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Pare</surname></persName>, a Dutchman, being convited of saying that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> the <rs>Father</rs> was the only <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and that <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0002.00004.00025" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> was not very <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, was committed to the flames in <placeName reg="Smithfield, Johnston, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076672">Smithfield</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>He was a man of strict and virtuous life, and very devout: he suffered with great constancy of mind, kissing the stake and faggots that were to burn him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/><q direct="unspecified">These things,</q> as is candidly acknowledged by <persName n="Burnet,Bishop,,,," id="n0300.0002.00004.00026" reg="mostcommon:Burnet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Burnet</surname></persName>, <q direct="unspecified">cast a great blemish on the <name>Reformation</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>It was said they only condemned cruelty when it was exercised on themselves, but were ready to practise it when they had the power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The Papists made great use of this afterwards in <persName><roleName n="Queen">Queen</roleName> <foreName>Mary</foreName></persName>'s time; and what <persName n="Cranmer,,,,," id="n0300.0002.00004.00027" reg="mostcommon:Cranmer,nomatch:0"><surname>Cranmer</surname></persName> and <persName n="Ridley,,,,," id="n0300.0002.00004.00028" reg="mostcommon:Ridley,nomatch:0"><surname>Ridley</surname></persName> then suffered was thought a just retaliation on them from a wise Providence, that dispenses all things justly to all.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>These unhappy excesses <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> of intolerant bigotry, so inconsistent and peculiarly unreasonable in men who had freely exercised that liberty which they denied to others, testified fatally against <persName n="Cranmer,,,,," id="n0300.0002.00005.00029" reg="mostcommon:Cranmer,nomatch:0"><surname>Cranmer</surname></persName>, when, after so short an interval, he himself fell into the same trouble; for they left him without excuse or reply, when it was alleged that, by the confession and practice of the reformers themselves, it appeared that men, even of harmless and exemplary lives, might be put to death for their opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>But such was the delusion of the times, and the influence of a heated religious zeal, aggravated by controversy and virulent contention, operating upon ruder manners and a fiercer and harsher state of society than that which happily prevails at present.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It is not easy to assign to any of the contending parties of this distracted age a deeper stain of the persecuting spirit than the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>If the <name>Catholics</name> displayed it in a greater number and variety of instances, it must be remembered that they had greater power and more frequent opportunities, and that it had not in them the same obvious and glaring inconsistency with professed principles, and with the right of individual judgment which they asserted and exercised, which marked its exhibition by the leading reformers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Even the flames of persecution directed against themselves did not check the vehemence of their animosity against those who had gone further in the same road, and pursued their own avowed principles to their natural, and, as we think, necessary consequences.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Of this a very remarkable and curious instance is recorded in the case of <persName n="Philpot,,Archdeacon,,," id="n0300.0002.00005.00030" reg="default:Philpot,Archdeacon,,,"><foreName>Archdeacon</foreName> <surname>Philpot</surname></persName>, <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> who signalized himself by indecent and insulting behaviour towards some of his fellow-prisoners under the <name>Marian</name> persecution, who denied the doctrine of the <rs>Trinity</rs> and the <name>Deity</name> of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0002.00006.00031" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The rudeness and violence of this conduct in such circumstances displeased many, even in those times, and he accordingly attempted to vindicate himself in a little tract, entitled <q direct="unspecified">An Apology of <persName n="Philpot,,John,,," id="n0300.0002.00006.00032" reg="default:Philpot,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Philpot</surname></persName>, written for spitting upon an Arian; with an Invective against Arians, the very natural Children of Antichrist, with an Admonition to all that be faithful in <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0002.00006.00033" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> to beware of them, and of other late-sprung Heresies, as of the worst Enemies of the <name>Gospel</name>.</q><note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> 
<p>For the whole of this very singular piec , with a running commentary, containing many very judicious remarks on the general question, see <persName n="Lindsey,,,,," id="n0300.0002.00006.00034" reg="mostcommon:Lindsey,nomatch:0"><surname>Lindsey</surname></persName>'s Historical View, <ref n="pages 96-151">pp. 96-151</ref>.</p></note> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>A very remarkable contrast to the bitter violence of this railing controversialist is seen in the just and rational sentiments of a distinguished <persName n="Unitarian,,,,," id="n0300.0002.00006.00035" reg="mostcommon:Unitarian,nomatch:0"><surname>Unitarian</surname></persName>, <persName n="Acontius,,,,," id="n0300.0002.00006.00036" reg="mostcommon:Acontius,nomatch:0"><surname>Acontius</surname></persName>, who passed several years in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> under the protection of <persName><roleName n="Queen">Queen</roleName> <foreName>Elizabeth</foreName></persName>. <q direct="unspecified">That <num value="1">one</num> thing,</q> says he, <q direct="unspecified">I never could look upon but as the most unreasonable of all, that a man who is supposed to have taught any thing false or impious should be compelled, on a promise of impunity, to make recantation of it. To what end this, I pray?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>What advantage can be proposed by it, if the heretic, for the sake of avoiding the punishment, retract his opinion against his conscience?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>It may, perhaps, be pretended that those who are in the like error, and lie concealed, may thus be wrought upon sincerely to renounce it, and all be brought by degrees to follow the example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>But they must have taken up <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> their sentiments on very slight grounds who can so easily relinquish them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Is there not much more reason to suspect, that such renunciation of their sentiments may be made merely to avoid suffering?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>And will not this have the appearance of something very shocking and oppressive, as if the magistrate aimed not only to kill the body, but to lay a snare for the destruction of the soul too?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Are we, then, so destitute of armour wherewith to encounter erroneous opinions, that we must have recourse to lies and feigned abjuration for our defence against them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>It may be said that this is by no means what is intended, to procure a retractation any how of such opinions, but that the heretic may not only in words, but from the heart, abandon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>This is, indeed, finely spoken, if it can be accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>But what mean those fierce threatenings on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, and flattering promises on the other?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>These may, indeed, contribute to overcome and influence the will and inclinations; but the great business is with the understanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>This cannot be affected by menaces or the most engaging allurements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>They cannot make that which before appeared to be true to appear false, how much soever a man may desire it. But if this cannot be done, and a heretic, however earnestly he may wish it, cannot quit his heresy but by conviction of stronger argument against it, why should you importune and solicit the miserable man to lie, and thereby more offend both <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and man.</q><note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Nevertheless, there can be little doubt that these cruel excesses of persecuting bigotry, endured, as by the testimony of unfriendly historians they seem to have been, with a constancy and fortitude worthy of martyrs, who not only were convinced of the truth, but experienced the value and excellence of their principles, were not without the effect which scenes like these commonly produce on the public mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Compassion for unmerited suffering passes into admiration when it is met with the spirit of a martyr, and naturally leads to the suspicion that the principles which excited and maintained such a spirit were not unworthy of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Of these, some were visited with various forms and degrees of punishment, while others gave way before the storm, and read a recantation, the sincerity of which may well be doubted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>There are other indications that the denial of the deity of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0002.00012.00058" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> was a growing opinion, though it might not as yet be openly expressed and avowed, there not being at this time a single society of worshiping Christians in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, assembling professedly on <persName n="Unitarian,,,,," id="n0300.0002.00012.00059" reg="mostcommon:Unitarian,nomatch:0"><surname>Unitarian</surname></persName> principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Of these indications, perhaps, the most unequivocal is seen in the alarm manifested on the subject by the patrons of the prevailing opinions, and particularly in the iniquitous ordinance against heresy <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> and blasphemy passed by the parliament, then consisting chiefly of Presbyterians, in <dateStruct value="1647--"><year reg="1647">1647</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>When it is considered that Unitarians have <num value="1">one</num> and all adopted the liberal course on this subject, while the doctrine of the <rs>Trinity</rs>, not being expressible in language derived from scripture, is of necessity stated in propositions of human devising, so that its adherents are naturally also the framers and advocates of articles and creeds, we cannot much wonder that this circumstance alone should be thought to afford a strong <hi rend="italics">prima facie</hi> evidence of the tendency of these great men to the profession of tenets which have been so intimately associated with their leading and distinctive principle.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Though there were many, both obscure and distinguished, who notoriously came within its danger, it does not appear to have been put in force against those whose only crime was speaking or writing against the doctrine of the <rs>Trinity</rs>, and it remained nearly a dead letter, till long after it had been actually swept from the statute book, when it occurred to the promoters of a recent attack on Presbyterian endowments to make it the basis of an argument not less inconclusive than it was illiberal and unjust.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>He received his classical education at the grammar school of his native place, where he seems to have distinguished himself by early proficiency, and to have attracted notice as a youth of high promise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>It is pleasing to learn that there was also observable in him, at this early period, that singular piety of mind and disregard of mere worldly and temporal considerations which characterized him through life; for he now not only devoted himself to liberal pursuits and studies, but engaged with great diligence and assiduity in the assistance of his recently widowed mother.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>After occupying with high reputation for a few years the post of college tutor, he was offered the mastership of the grammar school in which he had received the rudiments of his education, but declined in favour of a competent person, who at his recommendation was appointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>But though, doubtless, well aware of the troubles which awaited him in that violent and intolerant age, his high sense of duty did not permit him to chain himself down to an implicit adoption of authorized creeds, nor to bury in the silence of his own breast what he conceived to be important, though unpopular and obnoxious, truth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>In addressing his mind to this inquiry, he did not (as is the practice with too many) <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> examine what the rulers and pharisees believe,&mdash; what the fathers, the councils, or the church, have determined,&mdash;and then seek to adjust the scripture <pb id="p.26" n="26"/> to a conformity with the comments and traditions of fallible men,&mdash;but applied in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance to the fountain head, seeking for his religious faith nowhere but in the oracles of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>There are few who have the impartiality or independence of mind to adhere rigidly to this rule; and yet there can be no question that, if the object be to ascertain not what this or that sect or church believes, but to learn as nearly as possible the true meaning of the sacred scriptures, the most likely way is <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to acquire a competent knowledge of the languages in which they are written, and then read and judge for ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>If commentaries or any other extraneous sources of information are sought for, they should be such as are chiefly critical; or make it their business to collect the various facts relating to the history of ancient nations, the habits, manners, and general condition of the people, and other circumstances which may serve to illustrate obscure allusions and difficult passages which a mere acquaintance with the language will not alone enable us to explain.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>As he was well persuaded that it could not be otherwise than important, that what <name n="God" type="God">God</name> had condescended to reveal should be rightly understood by those to whom it was addressed, his newly-acquired views were communicated without reserve, not only to those who might be engaged in similar researches, and might therefore be of service either to confirm or to correct them, but to some whose narrow-minded notions were disturbed or offended by these <hi rend="italics">novelties</hi>, as they considered them, and whose intolerant bigotry could not endure that others should seek the way to salvation on a different track from themselves.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>In the statements of his opinions which he offered at this period, there appears a degree of indistinctness and apparent vacillation, ascribable, perhaps, to an unwillingness to encounter the hostility of persecuting bigots, of which, in that intolerant age&mdash;when what are now the most obvious, and, indeed, generally acknowledged principles of religious liberty, were very imperfectly understood and even expressly disclaimed by all the contending parties who were then striving for the mastery&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> of the lightest consequences would probably be the forfeiture of a lucrative, honourable, and important office, on which not merely his station in life but his subsistence appeared to depend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>If it were so, there are few who would be entitled, and of these very few would be inclined, to visit with <pb id="p.28" n="28"/> strong censure the infirmity of human nature, which had not, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the fortitude to look consequences like these steadily in the face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>On this, his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> appearance before the <rs type="role" reg="civil-Magistrate">civil magistrate</rs> to answer for his religious faith, he appears to have availed himself, as many of those who are called his followers afterwards did with less excuse, of the acknowledged ambiguity of the scholastic term <hi rend="italics">person</hi>, to screen himself from the penalties of avowed nonconformity by expressing heterodox opinions in orthodox language.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>On the other hand, when it is considered that he was at this time extricating himself by his own unassisted researches from the prejudices of his early education, and gradually acquiring fresh light by his own examination of scripture, it is by no means improbable that his views may as yet have partaken of the indistinctness of his language, and that he had not yet arrived at that clear perception of the truth which he afterwards attained, and boldly professed in the midst of still more formidable hazards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>Certain it is, that he persevered for more than a year after this time in that course of free and diligent inquiry, the result of which had already brought him into so much peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Nor did his experience of former dangers inspire him now with so much worldly prudence as to lead him to withhold his more matured and decided opinions from his friends, to whom he now freely opened his mind on the doctrine of the <rs>Trinity</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>This measure, the professed object of which was merely to secure his person, a purpose which might have been accomplished by much less rigorous means, had this additional hardship, that he was labouring at <pb id="p.30" n="30"/> the time under a dangerous fever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>Indeed, he was not very likely to succeed, if it be true that the argument he chiefly dwelt on was, that, if <persName n="Biddle,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0003.00030.00104" reg="nearbymention:Biddle,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Biddle</surname></persName> was right, the church for so many centuries had been wrong, and guilty of idolatry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>His opponent would, doubtless, reply, <q direct="unspecified">Let the church bear its own burden: it is my business to inquire what says the scripture.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/></p> 
<p>Shortly afterwards he was summoned to appear at <placeName reg="Westminster, Carroll, Maryland" key="tgn,2049138">Westminster</placeName>, and examined before a Committee of the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName>, appointed for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>He now freely confessed that he did not acknowledge the commonly received notion of the <name>Deity</name> of the <rs>Holy Spirit</rs>, as he was accused; but was ready to hear what could be opposed to him, and, if he could not make out his opinion to be true, honestly to own his error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>This, however, was not the style in which any of the religious parties of those times, at least when they felt themselves the strongest, were disposed to deal with those who differed from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>For <measure n="16months" type="date">sixteen months</measure> from the time of his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> commitment he was detained in a chargeable attendance, without any sentence of condemnation having been passed upon him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>He then proceeds to deliver his opinion concerning the <rs>Holy Spirit</rs>, whom he considers to have been <q direct="unspecified">the chief of all ministering spirits peculiarly sent out from heaven to minister in their behalf that shall inherit salvation.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>This opinion he endeavours to confirm by various arguments and references to scripture, most of which appear to us in these days somewhat fanciful, though not ill-adapted to the taste of the times and the party to whom they were addressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>He concludes his appeal in the following impressive and pathetic strain: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/></p> 
<p>For my own particular, after a long, impartial inquiry of the truth in this controversy, and after much and earnest calling upon <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to give me the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him, I find myself obliged, both by the principles of reason and scripture, to embrace the opinion I now hold forth, and, as much as in me lyeth, to endeavour that the honour of Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name> may not be transferred to another, not only to the offence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> himself, but also of his Holy Spirit, who cannot but be grieved to have that ignorantly ascribed to himself which is proper to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> that sends him, and which he nowhere I challenges to himself in scripture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>What shall befall me in the pursuance of this work, I refer to the disposal of Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, whose glory is dearer to me, not only than liberty, but than my life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>It will be your part, honoured Sir, into whose hands <name n="God" type="God">God</name> hath put such an opportunity, to examine the business impartially, and to be a helper <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> of the truth, considering that his controversy is of the greatest importance in the world, and that the divine truth suffers not herself to be despised scot-free.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Neither let the meanness of my outward appearance deter you from stirring, since it is the part of a wise man, as in all things so especially in matters of religion, not to regard so much who it is that speaketh, as what it is that is spoken; remembering how our Saviour in the <name>Gospel</name> saith, that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is wont to hide his secrets from the wise and prudent, and reveal them unto children; in which <num value="1">number I</num> willingly reckon myself, being conscious of my own personal weakness, but well assured of the evidence and strength of the scripture to bear me out in this cause.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>This appeal was so far effectual, that <persName n="Vane,Sir,H.,,," id="n0300.0003.00032.00106" reg="default:Vane,H.,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Vane</surname></persName> endeavoured to befriend him by bringing his case before the <rs type="place">House</rs>; but the only consequence was, that he was forthwith committed to the custody of <num value="1">one</num> of the officers of the <rs type="place">House</rs>, under which restraint, exercised with more or less rigour, he continued for <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure>. The question in debate was referred to the assembly of divines then sitting at <placeName reg="Westminster, Carroll, Maryland" key="tgn,2049138">Westminster</placeName>, before a committee of whom he was frequently summoned, and submitted to them his <q direct="unspecified"><num value="12">Twelve</num> Arguments.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>As might be expected, however, from a discussion conducted under such circumstances, no satisfactory result was obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Indeed, it appears that he was met by appeals to the passions rather than to the judgment,&mdash;by bitter railing, and threats of a further appeal to the strong arm of the civil power; a species of weapon as he justly observes, which might enable the weakest disputant <pb id="p.33" n="33"/> easily to subvert the strongest controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Hence he was at length induced to publish this piece, with a preface bespeaking the reader's serious attention to the arguments laid before him, as to a matter which affected the <name>Divine</name> glory and his own salvation; and requesting him, <q direct="unspecified">at any hand, to forbear condemning his opinion as erroneous, till he was able to bring pertinent and solid answers to all his arguments.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/></p> 
<p>The appearance of this tract produced, as may be supposed, a great sensation, and excited a vehement outcry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>By order of the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName>, it was speedily called in, and ordered to be burnt by the common hangman; a mode of dealing with religious, or indeed with any, controversy, which, while it is suggested by bad and violent passions and still further exasperates them, has an obvious tendency to defeat its own purpose; since it draws the attention of the bystanders and of the public to the subject, and the work itself which is treated with such contumely,&mdash;still further excites the general curiosity, and creates a natural suspicion in every candid and thoughtful mind, that those who resort to such violent proceedings seek only to stigmatize and suppress that which they feel themselves unable to refute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>Thanks to the operation of the <rs n="printing press" type="product">printing-press</rs>, it is in vain now to expect that a production which has once made its way before the public can ever be finally put down by such means as these.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>In the preface to his <q direct="unspecified">Confession of Faith,</q> the author enlarges with much force of argument on the doctrinal absurdities and practical mischiefs which arise from the belief of <num value="3">three</num> persons in <num value="1">one</num> <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; shewing that it introduceth, in fact, <num value="3">three</num> Gods, and thus subverteth the unity of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> so frequently inculcated in Scripture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>Moreover, it hinders us from praying to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> through his son <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n0300.0003.00034.00117" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName>, as the <name>Gospel</name> directeth us to do; it prohibiteth us to love and honour <name n="God" type="God">God</name> as we ought, for the highest love and honour is due to him who is the most high <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; but the highest can be given to <num value="1">one</num> person only; and the <name>Son</name> and Spirit being obviously derivative and dependent beings, can be only secondary objects of honour and love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>The Confession itself is comprised in <num value="6">six</num> articles, in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of which he declares his belief in <num value="1">one</num> most high <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, the creator <pb id="p.35" n="35"/> of heaven and earth, the father of our <persName n="Christ,Lord,Jesus,,," id="n0300.0003.00035.00118" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>The last article relates to the <rs>Holy Spirit</rs>, and is as follows:&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">I believe that there is <num value="1">one</num> principal minister of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0003.00035.00119" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, peculiarly sent from heaven to sanctify the church, who by eminence and intimacy with <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is singled out of the number of the other heavenly ministers or angels, and comprised in the <rs>Holy Trinity</rs>, being the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> person thereof; and that this minister of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0003.00035.00120" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> is the <rs>Holy Spirit</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>No <num value="1">one</num> acquainted with the temper of those times will imagine that such publications as these could come abroad without exciting the most vehement indignation againt their author, and calling <pb id="p.36" n="36"/> down upon his head a still heavier storm than any which he had hitherto experienced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>It was manifested, as usual, by most arbitrary exertions of that power which our <rs type="role2">Lord</rs> utterly disclaimed as a supporter for his church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>On this occasion it was that the <name>Assembly</name> of Divines, chiefly Presbyterians, solicited from the <name>Parliament</name> the infamous ordinance against heresy and blasphemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>By this, among other flagrant outrages, it was enacted that any <num value="1">one</num> who should, by preaching, printing, or writing, controvert the <name>Deity</name> of the <name>Son</name> or of the <rs>Holy Spirit</rs>, or the equality of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0003.00036.00123" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> with the <rs>Father</rs>, or the distinction of <num value="2">two</num> natures, or the sinless perfection of his humanity, should be declared a <hi rend="italics">felon</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>It then enacted, that in case the indictment should be found, and the party on trial should not abjure the said error, and maintenance and defence of the same, he or they should suffer the pains of death, as in case of felony, without benefit of clergy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>When such an instrument as this was placed in the hands of his enemies, it might seem that <persName n="Biddle,,,,," id="n0300.0003.00036.00124" reg="nearbymention:Biddle,John,,,"><surname>Biddle</surname></persName>'s fate was sealed; and it would most probably have been so, if he and such as he had been the only parties endangered by it. But it happily contained other clauses, denouncing severe penalties, though not proceeding to the same extremity, against many who, in these days of civil strife, were too powerful and formidable to be <pb id="p.37" n="37"/> thus dealt with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>Among others, not a few in the army, both officers and soldiers, held opinions which were branded as heretical by this iniquitous statute; and hence, when the violently intolerant party whose councils had hitherto been predominant were shortly afterwards displaced by military force, their persecuting law was not enforced, and for several years lay nearly unregarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>After the death of the king, chiefly through the representations of <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0300.0003.00037.00125" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>, a milder policy was adopted in respect of religious dissentients, by which <persName n="Biddle,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0003.00037.00126" reg="nearbymention:Biddle,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Biddle</surname></persName> in some measure benefited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>He was still in custody under his original commitment by the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName>; but at this time he had somewhat more liberty allowed him by his keeper, and was even permitted, on security being given for his appearance, to go into <placeName key="tgn,7008174" n="1.000 9" reg="staffordshire,england,united kingdom,europe">Staffordshire</placeName>, where he lived for some time in the house of a gentleman, who not only entertained him with kindness, but made him his chaplain, and procured him an appointment to preach at a neighbouring church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>At his death he left him a legacy, which proved a seasonable supply to him, as he had by this time exhausted whatever funds he had accumulated at <placeName reg="Gloucester, Gloucestershire, England" key="tgn,7011128">Gloucester</placeName> in the expenses which his long confinement and other persecutions had occasioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>The name of this generous friend has not been preserved, nor does it appear for what length of time <persName n="Biddle,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0003.00037.00127" reg="nearbymention:Biddle,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Biddle</surname></persName>'s respite continued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>But it was probably not long; for we find that notice of his situation having been given to <persName n="Bradshaw,,,,," id="n0300.0003.00037.00128" reg="mostcommon:Bradshaw,nomatch:0"><surname>Bradshaw</surname></persName>, the <rs>President</rs> of the <orgName n="State Council" type="council">Council of State</orgName>, he was, by his direction, recalled, and placed in more strict and rigorous confinement.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>At length, in <dateStruct value="1651--"><year reg="1651">1651</year></dateStruct>, the <name>Parliament</name> having passed a general act of oblivion, this virtuous sufferer <pb id="p.38" n="38"/> for conscience' sake was restored to full liberty, which he improved without delay, with a few friends whom his writings and the harsh usage he had received had procured for him in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>These he formed into a small religious society, who met in private every <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>'s day for worship and the study of the scriptures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Their association was formed on the principle of the strict and absolute unity of the <name>Divine</name> nature, acknowledging the <rs>Father</rs> only as the proper object of <name>Christian</name> worship; the <rs>Saviour Christ</rs> as a man approved of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and sent by him to save mankind from their sins, and recognised to be the <name>Son</name> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> with power by his resurrection from the dead; and the <rs>Holy Ghost</rs>, conformably to the views maintained in <persName n="Biddle,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0003.00038.00129" reg="nearbymention:Biddle,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Biddle</surname></persName>'s <q direct="unspecified"><num value="12">Twelve</num> Arguments,</q> to be a distinct intelligent spirit, of high dignity and excellence, but not <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, nor in any sense the object of worship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>It is singular that, though we have good reason to believe that in this small community good seed was sown which did not altogether perish, and in particular that among its members were some of the authors of that remarkable collection of tracts already mentioned, which appeared in this country towards the close of the <num value="17" type="ordinal">seventeenth</num> century, and strongly attracted the attention of the religious world at that period to the <rs>Unitarian</rs> controversy, very few of the names of <persName n="Biddle,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0003.00038.00130" reg="nearbymention:Biddle,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Biddle</surname></persName>'s immediate followers and disciples have been recorded.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>During this period his little congregation received a visit from <persName n="Gunning,Doctor,,,," id="n0300.0003.00038.00132" reg="mostcommon:Gunning,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Gunning</surname></persName>, afterwards <persName n="Professor,,Regius,,," id="n0300.0003.00038.00133" reg="default:Professor,Regius,,,"><foreName>Regius</foreName> <surname>Professor</surname></persName> of Divinity at <pb id="p.39" n="39"/> <placeName reg="Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England" key="tgn,7010874">Cambridge</placeName>, and <rs type="role">Bishop</rs> of <persName n="Ely,,,,," id="n0300.0003.00039.00134" reg="mostcommon:Ely,nomatch:0"><surname>Ely</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>On this occasion he immediately commenced a formal disputation, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, on the <name>Deity</name> of the <rs>Holy Spirit</rs>; and afterwards on the supreme Deity of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0003.00039.00137" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>The discussion was conducted, as was customary in those days, according to the technical forms of the scholastic method of disputation, in which it is probable that the habits of our author's former life, as a student and tutor at the <rs type="place">University</rs>, had rendered him sufficiently well skilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>At all events, he acquitted himself with such ability in this unlooked &mdash; for contest, as to defeat the design of his antagonist, and even to call forth a complimentary acknowledgment of his talent and skill as a disputant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Thus it happened that this attack, which was intended to destroy his credit with and influence over his adherents, had the contrary effect, <pb id="p.40" n="40"/> and served only to shew more clearly how deeply he had studied the question, and made himself master of the argument before he ventured on the bold and decisive step of avowing an unpopular doctrine, which rendered him obnoxious at once to the multitude and the civil power, and placed him in collision with the most learned men and the subtlest disputants of his time.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>It may, however, be made a question how far such public contests, whether conducted in the formal method of syllogistic warfare, or in the more popular style of personal conference occasionally practised in our own times, are well fitted to promote either the cause of truth or the love of it. The point determined by the dispute, if any, is not which party is in the right, but which is the ablest disputant, the acutest reasoner, or most eloquent speaker; and the object will commonly be, not to search candidly for the truth, and to embrace it wherever it is to be found, but to prove the opponent to be in the wrong, to lay hold of and magnify those flaws and oversights in argument of which he who has the better cause may often be guilty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>A habit of disputing, not for truth but for victory, is in this manner too apt to be generated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>It may be added, that success in contests of this kind commonly depends not so much on general talent, or even on a correct knowledge of the points in question, as on other qualifications of a merely personal nature;&mdash;on a facility in public speaking, or on a peculiar readiness and self-possession, with an acuteness in discerning and exposing the weak parts of an opponent's case, which may or may not be connected with the profession of the truth, or with a disposition <pb id="p.41" n="41"/> to seek after and embrace it. We have no further record of the particulars of this public contest, or of its result; but there is no reason to think that it was any exception to the general rule in such cases, where the opposite parties commonly leave the scene of contention with their views unchanged, except that the line of separation is made more distinct, more broad and impassable than before, and each disputant more thoroughly fixed and settled in his original opinion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>About this time <persName n="Biddle,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0003.00041.00139" reg="nearbymention:Biddle,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Biddle</surname></persName> published several small pieces, chiefly translations from the writings of the <rs>Polish Unitarians</rs>; among the rest, <q direct="unspecified">A brief Inquiry, touching a better Way than is commonly made use of to refute Papists, and to reduce Protestants to a certainty and unity in Religion,</q> The immediate object of the writer (<persName n="Stegman,,Joachim,,," id="n0300.0003.00041.00140" reg="default:Stegman,Joachim,,,"><foreName>Joachim</foreName> <surname>Stegman</surname></persName>) is to point out the advantage which the advocates of Popery derive from certain opinions maintained by some Protestants, particularly on the condition of the soul in a supposed intermediate state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>His remarks on this subject are judicious and forcible; but the work derives its principal interest from the sound views it exhibits of the proper method of seeking for religious truth, namely, to discard all human authority, and to stick to the scripture only, as explained and understood by right reason, without having any regard to tradition, or the authority of fathers, councils, &amp;c. On this subject the following remarks of the translator are well deserving of attention.</p>

<p>My desire therefore is, that <pb id="p.42" n="42"/> such persons would but consider what the holy scripture itself saith on this behalf;&mdash;how <persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n0300.0003.00042.00141" reg="mostcommon:Paul,nomatch:0"><surname>Paul</surname></persName> (Rom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Which passage clearly intimateth, that as there is no incongruity for others to require a reason of our hope in <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0003.00042.00142" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, so we Christians are, above all other professors whatsoever, obliged to be very <hi rend="italics">rational;</hi> &mdash;for to make an apology or defence in the behalf of so abstruse and sublime a doctrine as ours is, requireth a more than ordinary improvement of reason.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>This being so, it may seem strange why so great a number even of Protestant ministers should make reason a common theme to disclaim against, giving to it (without warrant of scripture) the name of <hi rend="italics">corrupt</hi> reason and <hi rend="italics">carnal</hi> reason, and other the like eulogies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>But the truth is, they themselves hold many absurd, <hi rend="italics">unreasonable</hi> opinions; and so know right well, that if men once begin to make use of their <hi rend="italics">reason</hi>, and bring the doctrines that are commonly taught to the touchstone of the scripture, explained and managed in a rational way, their tenets and reputation with the people will soon be laid in the dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Let such ministers henceforward either leave off clamouring against reason, or no more open their mouths against Papists, and their opinion about transubstantiation; for whosoever shall sift the controversy between Papists and Protestants concerning it, shall find, that the principal, if not <pb id="p.43" n="43"/> only, ground why we reject it, is because it is repugnant to <hi rend="italics">reason</hi>.

<p>At this period our author also published <num value="2">two</num> remarkable tracts in the catechetical form, explanatory of his peculiar views of <name>Christian</name> doctrine; <num value="1">one</num> entitled <q direct="unspecified">A Scripture Catechism,</q> the other <q direct="unspecified">A Brief Scripture Catechism for Children;</q> in which the apparently unexceptionable plan is pursued, of leaving the scripture to speak for itself, by constructing the questions in such a form that the answers may be given in the unaltered words of holy writ.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>He describes his Scripture Catechism as <q direct="unspecified">composed for their sakes that would fain be mere Christians, and not of this or that sect; inasmuch as all the sects of Christians, by what name soever distinguished, have more or less departed from the simplicity and truth of the scripture.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>I have called this an <hi rend="italics">apparently</hi> unexceptionable method; but it may, <pb id="p.44" n="44"/> perhaps, be doubted, whether it is really entitled to all the praise of impartiality and fairness which seems at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sight to belong to it. It is granted that we have good reason to consider it as no small recommendation of our religious opinions, that they admit of being expressed in the genuine words of scripture, without requiring the introduction of new and strange terms and phrases unknown to the sacred writers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>But it may be alleged, that the difficulty which is sometimes felt in dispensing with such phrases, is to a certain degree incidental, arising from the change of language, and from the circumstance that the books of the New Testament were, for the most part, written with an immediate view to local and temporary purposes; so that it is hardly to be expected that they should contain a regular statement of doctrines which admits of being construed with minute verbal accuracy, like the clauses of an act of parliament, or the formal propositions of a systematic treatise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>It must be remembered, too, that all Protestant sects profess at least to found their peculiar doctrines upon scripture; and there can be little doubt that, by a dexterous adaptation of the questions to the phraseology of detached passages selected from different places and separated from their connexion, catechisms might be constructed upon this plan which should appear to give the sanction of holy writ to the most discordant opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>The method, if it be adopted at all, requires to be pursued with caution, from its tendency to withdraw the attention from the <hi rend="italics">general scope</hi> and <hi rend="italics">tenor</hi> of the sacred writings, and direct it upon particular words and phrases; in not a few instances, upon the words, <pb id="p.45" n="45"/> not of the author himself, but of his uninspired translator, who may not always have fairly represented the meaning of the original; being, perhaps, unconsciously biassed so as to give a turn to the passage favourable to his own previously formed opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>It may be added, that this mode of citing texts, unless carefully guarded, is in danger of encouraging the baneful practice of adducing passages of scripture as though they were a collection of detached aphorisms, and not portions of a continued discourse, to be interpreted by reference to the context and the obvious intention and purpose of the writer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>The remark of some <num value="1">one</num>, that at this rate we might prove from scripture the proposition, <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">there is no <name n="God" type="God">God</name></hi>,</q> is scarcely an exaggeration of the extent to which this abuse has sometimes been carried, or of the mischievous absurdities which have in this manner sought to derive the shadow of support from the highest authority.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>The appearance of these tracts was enough to alarm the bigoted advocates of prevailing doctrines, who presently proceeded to adopt the usual arbitrary and oppressive mode of dealing with an opponent stigmatized with the odious and unpopular name of heretic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>He is said also to have been particularly excellent and attentive in discharging the more private duties of a Christian minister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>He abstained from touching upon controverted topics in the pulpit, where his discourses were for the most part practical; though their morality was invariably founded upon the precepts, and carefully enforced by the peculiar motives and sanctions suggested by the <rs>Christian</rs> scriptures.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/><q direct="unspecified">I own</q> (he tells us in his very interesting narrative of the proceedings against him) <q direct="unspecified">I had been unsettled in my notions from the time I read <persName n="Sherlock,Doctor,,,," id="n0300.0004.00061.00208" reg="mostcommon:Sherlock,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Sherlock</surname></persName>'s book of the <rs>Trinity</rs>, which sufficiently discovered how far many were gone back towards polytheism; I long tried what I could do with some Sabellianturns, making out a Trinity of <hi rend="italics">somewhats</hi> in <num value="1">one</num> single mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>I found out that, by the tritheistical scheme of <persName n="Sherlock,Doctor,,,," id="n0300.0004.00061.00209" reg="mostcommon:Sherlock,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Sherlock</surname></persName> and <persName n="Howe,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0004.00061.00210" reg="mostcommon:Howe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Howe</surname></persName>, I best preserved a trinity, but I lost the unity; by the <name>Sabellian</name> scheme of modes and subsistences, and properties, &amp;c., I best kept up the divine unity; but then I had lost a trinity, such as the <name>Scripture</name> discovers, so that I could never keep both in view at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>Till I had upon much serious thought and study of the holy scriptures, with many concerned addresses to the <rs>Father</rs> of lights, found great reason <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to doubt, and after by degrees to alter my judgment, in <pb id="p.62" n="62"/> relation to the formerly received opinions of the trinity and the <hi rend="italics">Supreme Deity</hi> of our <persName n="Christ,Lord,Jesus,,," id="n0300.0004.00062.00211" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>I desired only to know <hi rend="italics">what</hi> I must believe, and <hi rend="italics">why</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>Accordingly I was ever careful not to speak against my own judgment, or what should appear so to a judicious hearer, that I might not act against <name>Christian</name> sincerity; and yet I never confronted the opinions of others by express or unhandsome opposition; I doubted whether this was my duty, or proper in the pulpit, where I could not have freedom to say all that was requisite in such a controversy, and whether I ought at once to cast myself out of a station of service without a more particular and direct occasion given me to profess my mind, which I did apprehend might offer, and which I was determined to accept when it did.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>He makes no distinct allusion or express mention of the lamented subject of his discourse, but towards the close, delicately but indirectly portrays her character in the following passage.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>When we have known them by divine grace powerfully biassed towards <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, holiness, and heaven, as the great centre of all their desires and aims; when we have seen them shine with the <rs>Redeemer</rs>'s image in great meekness and humility, great inoffensiveness and tender goodness towards all,&mdash;when we have found them possessed and governed by a conscientious dread of offending <name n="God" type="God">God</name> or man, (perhaps in some instances too scrupulous,) diligent also in the daily <pb id="p.64" n="64"/> duties of secret piety and devotion, with reverence and great seriousness; when we have seen them faithful in all their relative capacities, as therein serving the <rs>Lord</rs>, as well as man; when they have been eminently mortified to this vain world, to all the gaiety and bravery, the interests, divertisements and pleasures of this life, and that in years and circumstances very capable of such temptations, and this because they rather chose the <hi rend="italics">better part</hi> which shall never be taken away; when we have beheld their submissive patience and christian resignation to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, under misery; and after all great humility in an abasing sense of their unworthiness and need of mercy; but yet supporting their faith with honourable thoughts of the divine goodness, and a sense of their own sincerity, so as with hope and strong desires to breathe out their departing souls into their Redeemer's hands, welcoming his approaches with <quote>Come, <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>, come quickly;</quote> &mdash;when we can thus describe our friends, (and I know well whom I could thus imperfectly describe,) why should we not conclude <hi rend="italics">they are gone to the <rs>Father</rs></hi>? And why should we not rejoice in all the comforts of that consideration?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>How unreasonable is our immoderate sorrow, when all the rest of their friends rejoice!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>For, as themselves rejoice to go to the <rs>Father</rs>, so the blessed <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, their Father, has welcomed them with joy to their everlasting home; <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n0300.0004.00064.00215" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName> has presented them as his crown and joy, without spot or blemish; holy angels and spirits congratulate their arrival to their society, and cannot be supposed to rejoice less at the consummation of their victorious warfare that at its beginning in their conversion; <pb id="p.65" n="65"/> and shall we alone be swallowed up in sorrow?

<p>that I had probably done it sooner, had I not been diverted by many troubles; the issue of which has been such as has not only given me more leisure to review this sermon, but also more occasion often to retire to a serious contemplation of the matters therein contained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>What my sufferings (for a principle of conscience) have been, or for what cause I suffered as <hi rend="italics">an evil-doer even unto bonds</hi>, I intend not here to complain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>For, considering what was in the womb of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, and so near to its birth, I cannot but reckon it an apparent design of mercy to her who is deceased, that she should be carried into <pb id="p.66" n="66"/> the quiet harbour before so furious a tempest did arise, which might have made too cruel impressions on a disposition so very gentle and tender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>But she was gathered to her grave in peace, that she might not behold it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>When thus called upon, he did not hesitate to acknowledge, or rather openly to declare, what his faith was; and avowed himself convinced that the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and Father of our <persName n="Christ,Lord,Jesus,,," id="n0300.0004.00066.00220" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName> is alone the <rs>Supreme Being</rs>, superior in excellence and authority to his Son, who derives all from him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>The ministers gave their sanction to the arrangement, but withal charged him not to preach during his absence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>To this imperious mandate he returned a spirited reply, asserting his undoubted right and full determination to use his discretion in this matter without asking for their permission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>He accordingly departed for <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, though with great personal inconvenience, the very next day.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>But this was never spoken to at all. <q direct="unspecified">I intended,</q> says <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> E., <q direct="unspecified">after the matter of fact was over, to have spoken on this head; and to have shewn how unreasonable it was to account that blasphemy which, for the <hi rend="italics">manner</hi> of it, had not been uttered with any token of a designed contempt; <pb id="p.71" n="71"/> and, for the <hi rend="italics">matter</hi> of it, was not very different from what divers learned men and dignitaries of the church had published.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>I could have shewn that men of great probity and character differ very much about these matters; and that, if a mere error must be judged blasphemy by a party of the contrary opinion, then may any thing be judged such, let but the adverse party have the drawing of the consequences.

<p>The <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</rs> seems to have acted the part of an accuser rather than of a judge; and the jury, intimidated by his representation, and probably overawed by the unwonted presence of so many dignitaries of the church, brought in, but with apparent reluctance, a verdict of guilty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>When the verdict was pronounced, the Attorney-general moved that the prisoner might have the honour of the <hi rend="italics">pillory;</hi> but sentence was deferred till the last day of the term, and in the mean time he was committed to the common gaol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>This, however, was, after a few years, dissolved by the death of the principal members, and he had not afterwards any ministerial engagement, but retired into a silent obscurity, but not into idleness, as he appeared occasionally before the public as the author of various able tracts, both in support of the principles for which he had suffered so much, and on other theological questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> publication was a short letter to <persName n="Willis,Doctor,,,," id="n0300.0004.00077.00244" reg="mostcommon:Willis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Willis</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Dean</rs> of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0300.0004.00077.00245" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, remonstrating against <pb id="p.78" n="78"/> his attempt, in a sermon preached before the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName>, to vindicate the penal laws against the <name>Catholics</name> on religious grounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>If these laws were to be justified at all, which ill this tract he does not call in question, it must be from political considerations, and those only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>How far it was reasonable at any time to take for granted, as he seems to do, that all <persName n="Catholics,,,,," id="n0300.0004.00078.00246" reg="mostcommon:Catholics,nomatch:0"><surname>Catholics</surname></persName> as such were necessarily hostile to the existing political constitution, and that they ought on that account to be visited with coercive laws, we shall not here inquire; but, in protesting against visiting them with persecution or civil disabilities on the ground of their religious opinions merely, he shews himself to have fully probed a question, which, even at that late period, was by no means so clearly and generally understood as it is at present.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>Shortly afterwards (in <dateStruct value="1706--"><year reg="1706">1706</year></dateStruct>) appeared <q direct="unspecified">A Vindication of the <name>Worship</name> of the <rs>Lord Jesus Christ</rs> on Unitarian Principles;</q> in answer to <persName n="Boyse,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0004.00078.00247" reg="nearbymention:Boyse,Joseph,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Boyse</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>This is an elaborate performance, displaying very considerable acuteness and ability; and many of the texts on which Trinitarians are accustomed chiefly to rely, are very satisfactorily explained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>He proposes to establish <num value="2">two</num> points; <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num></hi>, that the <rs>Holy Scriptures</rs> do never require us to pay <hi rend="italics">divine worship</hi> to our blessed Saviour <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n0300.0004.00078.00248" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName>, as he is distinct from the <rs>Father</rs> who dwells in him and is worshiped by us; <hi rend="italics">secondly</hi>, that they do allow and require us to pay him our inferior religious worship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>Under the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these heads, his argument is distinct and conclusive: he contends that there is no instance in the New Testament of prayer to <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n0300.0004.00078.00249" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName> <pb id="p.79" n="79"/> when absent and invisible; and that all the cases (very few in number) which are thought to encourage the contrary idea, both admit and require a different interpretation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>Again, with respect to what may be called the internal acts of worship, as faith, love, and reverence, it is obvious, that all these sentiments may be entertained towards <num value="1">one</num> whom we honour as the most distinguished messenger of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>We may have faith in his message, because we believe it to come from <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; we may love him in sincerity, with fervent gratitude to so great a benefactor, believing him, nevertheless, to be the instrument or agent of a still greater benefactor; our esteem and rational love must ascend higher, and not rest till it centre in his <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>Under the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> proposition there is a perceptible confusion in his own argument, arising out of the ambiguity still attaching (and in his time still more than at present) to the term <hi rend="italics">worship</hi>: and his proof does not, in fact, establish his point, but merely goes to prove what all Unitarians, of whatever grade or denomination, will be equally ready to admit, that the homage we pay to our Redeemer and Mediator is of a subordinate nature, implying an acknowledgment of his character as the instrument or servant of his Father, under whose direction he acted, and whose words he spake, in the whole work of our salvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>If by <hi rend="italics">religious</hi> worship in this argument be meant the cultivation of the highest degree of love, attachment, and reverence, which can be cherished towards a creature, higher than we can or ought to feel towards any <hi rend="italics">other</hi> creature, it is admitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>But if it imply any direct devotional address to <pb id="p.80" n="80"/> him, or any petition offered to him, either for benefits which he is expected to confer, or for his mediation and intercession with the <rs>Father</rs>, then there is no authority for any thing of this kind, either from reason or scripture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>Not from reason, because <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0004.00080.00250" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>'s being the hearer and answerer of prayer, would imply an omnipresence which is the exclusive attribute of deity; not from scripture, because it appears, and <persName n="Emlyn,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0004.00080.00251" reg="nearbymention:Emlyn,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Emlyn</surname></persName> has himself distinctly shewn, that there exists no instance in the New Testament of any direct address to <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>, except where he was, or was believed to be, personally and sensibly <hi rend="italics">present</hi>. Moreover, it seems to us to be clearly inconsistent with our Saviour's express command, <q direct="unspecified">In that day, ye shall ask me nothing; but whatever ye shall ask the <rs>Father</rs> in my name, he will give it you.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>The personal controversy involved in these pieces has long since lost its interest, and references to it interfere occasionally with the cause of the reasoning; otherwise there are few works which contain in a smaller compass a more distinct and satisfactory statement of the views commonly maintained by Unitarians on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>The only objection which presents itself, and which is equally applicable to the very acute and judicious review of this argument in the <name>Racovian</name> catechism, arises from the use which is made of the term <hi rend="italics">sacrifice</hi>, and even <hi rend="italics">expiatory</hi> sacrifice, in speaking <pb id="p.84" n="84"/> of the death of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0004.00084.00261" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>It is true these terms are so explained as to do away with the inference founded upon their employment in scripture by the patrons of the common doctrine of satisfaction, that <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0004.00084.00262" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> is to be considered as our <hi rend="italics">substitute</hi>, bearing the punishment due to our sins from vindictive justice; but still there is a degree of confusion arising from the unnecessary introduction of this phraseology, and <num value="1">one</num> is almost inclined to suspect a sort of lurking wish by the use of familiar terms commonly understood in an orthodox sense, to beguile some into an acceptance of the doctrine recommended, who would have been startled by the exhibition of it in an undisguised form.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>Before entering upon the controversy between the advocates of infant and adult baptism, it appears necessary <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to settle the question, <quote> What reason we have for supposing that baptism under any form was prescribed as an ordinance of perpetual obligation, to be practised not on converts merely, but on the offspring of <name>Christian</name> parents?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>If there were any cases of the baptism of infants, (which is only a somewhat doubtful inference from Acts <num value="16">XVI</num>., <num value="15">15</num> and <num value="33">33</num>,) these were baptized <pb id="p.85" n="85"/> at the time of the conversion of the parents; and such baptism was a part of the ceremonial by which the <hi rend="italics">parents</hi>, not the children, were admitted as disciples.

<p>There can be no doubt that the series of tracts of which we have now given a short account, had a considerable effect in keeping up the public attention to the <name>Trinitarian</name> controversy, and in promoting a more extensive diffusion, under <num value="1">one</num> modification or another, of <persName n="Unitarian,,,,," id="n0300.0004.00086.00269" reg="mostcommon:Unitarian,nomatch:0"><surname>Unitarian</surname></persName> sentiments, especially among those who then began to be called (or to call <hi rend="italics">themselves</hi>) by way of distinction, the <hi rend="italics">liberal</hi> dissenters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>But his most remarkable and valuable work, in connexion with this controversy, was occasioned by the appearance of a Latin treatise by <persName n="Nichols,Doctor,,,," id="n0300.0005.00092.00294" reg="nearbymention:Nichols,W.,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Nichols</surname></persName>, Foreign <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs> to the <name>Society</name> for the <name>Propagation</name> of the <name>Gospel</name>, and more particularly submitted to the judgment of divines in the foreign Protestant churches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>As this work, from the quarter in which it originated, and the authority it appeared to assert, was likely to have an injurious effect in diffusing erroneous impressions of the character, doctrines, and discipline of the <rs>English</rs> dissenters among their foreign brethren, it was thought most desirable that a complete and full reply should be given by some <num value="1">one</num> who was competent to appear to advantage in the same field.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>It is possible enough that this proceeding arose not so much from any wilful unfairness as from pure ignorance; for the <q direct="unspecified">Vindiciae</q> having been chiefly intended for foreign readers, may probably have had only a limited circulation at home; and persons of all parties are too apt, in most cases, to content themselves with the writers on their own side of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>Independently of other more unworthy motives, self-love and indolence often lead to this <num value="1">one</num>-sided study of an important subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>It is much easier to confine ourselves to those arguments which we are already disposed to think conclusive, and to go along with the stream, than to undertake the labour of examination and patient inquiry; not to add, that it is much more agreeable to find or believe ourselves in the right, than to be forced to acknowledge that we had been in the wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>It is not much to be wondered at, therefore, that so few, comparatively speaking, run the risk of becoming exposed to this painful necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>It is not at all unlikely that this clergyman was <num value="1">one</num> of those who <q direct="unspecified">never read dissenting divinity,</q> and therefore had no suspicion that the book which he held forth as conclusive had already been fully answered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>The work is dedicated to the ministers of the <orgName n="Scotland Church" type="church">Church of Scotland</orgName>, which he seems to hold up as a model of purity, both in doctrine and discipline; and, in fact, he takes little notice of the main point, which would now be considered as lying at the root of the question between the opponents and the advocates of an establishment <hi rend="italics">as such;</hi> namely, the claim of the church to decree rites and ceremonies, and to exercise authority in matters of faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>This is the more remarkable, when we observe the effect of the treatment he afterwards received, to open his eyes to the injustice of all attempts to impose creeds of human composition; a leading principle of religious liberty, with which the name of <persName n="Peirce,,,,," id="n0300.0005.00094.00303" reg="nearbymention:Peirce,James,,,"><surname>Peirce</surname></persName> has since become intimately connected in the history of Protestant dissent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>He had been brought up, he tells us, in a scheme which he was unable afterwards to distinguish from Sabellianism, and a set of unscriptural expressions had <pb id="p.95" n="95"/> been inculcated on him from his youth, which he had long a great veneration for, and which continued to influence him so much as to inspire him with a strong disinclination to examine more particularly into this subject, even when he began to suspect a deficiency of argument in its favour from Scripture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>In his preaching, however, he tells us, that he was at all times careful to confine himself as much as possible to scriptural forms of expression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>The doctrine itself he was accustomed to consider as a mystery, which it was to little purpose to search into.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>Still he was surprised to observe, that the early fathers, previous to the council of Nice, never came up to the notions which have since become prevalent; and, on the other hand, that the expressions used by those who have had the highest reputation for orthodoxy appeared to him downright tritheism.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>The effect of these things on his mind for some time, was to produce a repugnance to the subject altogether; and he never voluntarily turned his thoughts to it. He was in this state of mind when the outcry began to be raised about his former friend <persName n="Whiston,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0005.00095.00305" reg="mostcommon:Whiston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Whiston</surname></persName>, on account of his having embraced Arian sentiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>But it must be remembered, that in the <num value="1">one</num> case he was naturally desirous to make the <hi rend="italics">most</hi>, in the other the <hi rend="italics">least</hi>, of such orthodoxy as he then possessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>Nor let it be supposed that this apparent discrepancy implies any wilful insincerity in either case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>It is by no means an easy matter for a man to give a precise and accurate account, after the lapse of years, of the opinions he formerly entertained on any controverted question; especially when his views with respect to it have been undergoing a gradual, and sometimes, perhaps even to himself, an imperceptible, change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>Still more is this likely to be the case when the question is <num value="1">one</num> which is disputed with heat and vehemence, and excites the passions of contending parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>Those who are conscious of a tendency towards unpopular opinions, if they are timid and irresolute, will be apt to avoid as much as possible all reference to it; when obliged to advert to it, they will labour to be <quote>as orthodox as they can,</quote> and will shelter themselves in obscure and ambiguous forms of expression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>Thus they are often prevented from perceiving how far they have deviated from received standards, till some accidental circumstance suddenly reveals to them the important but hitherto unsuspected transition which they have undergone.</p></note> on the subject, in <pb id="p.96" n="96"/> answer to which <persName n="Whiston,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0005.00096.00307" reg="mostcommon:Whiston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Whiston</surname></persName> referred him to Novatian, whose opinions certainly savour strongly of Arianism, as most nearly agreeing with his views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>It was not, however, till some time after the publication of <persName n="Clarke,Doctor,,,," id="n0300.0005.00096.00308" reg="nearbymention:Clarke,Samuel,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Clarke</surname></persName>'s celebrated treatise on the <rs>Scripture Doctrine</rs> of the <rs>Trinity</rs>, that <persName n="Peirce,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0005.00096.00309" reg="nearbymention:Peirce,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Peirce</surname></persName> applied himself in earnest to the further study of this subject.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>The reader will easily imagine that this must <pb id="p.97" n="97"/> have been a terrible shock to me, and that I must have had a great concern upon my mind, when I found myself at a loss about a doctrine of which I had been all along fond, to a great degree of uncharitableness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>However, this caused me to read the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> with more care, and make it more my prayer to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> that I might be led into the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>I was soon convinced the common opinion could not reasonably be esteemed a fundamental article of the <rs>Christian</rs> faith, as I had been too apt before to take it to be; and on serious consideration, the subject appeared to me so abstruse and difficult, that I could not imagine <name n="God" type="God">God</name> had made men's salvation to depend on their maintaining exactly the same notion concerning it; especially seeing the scripture never insists on the absolute necessity of <num value="1">one</num> uniform belief about it; and I was much confirmed in this apprehension, by considering how widely good men had differed from <num value="1">one</num> another on the subject.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/><q direct="unspecified">While I continued in suspense, being still upon the search, I considered how I ought to order my practice: and here I thought it most safe for me to keep close to the scripture, which is much clearer in delivering rules and examples for our practice than in furnishing us with nice and intricate speculations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>As to the <rs>Christian</rs> virtues, I thought them not much concerned in the controversy; and in conversation I had always avoided such intricate points, and might easily do so still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>But my chief concern was about my preaching and praying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>Concerning the former, I resolved to keep more close to the scripture expression than ever, and venture to say very little in my own words of a matter about which I was in so much doubt <pb id="p.98" n="98"/> myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>As to the latter, I could not find there was any occasion for my making much alteration, whichever notion should appear to be the truth; having always accustomed myself, as all Christians for the most part do, to pray to the <rs>Father</rs>, through the <name>Son</name>, by the <rs>Holy Spirit</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>In this, therefore, I resolved to go on. The only doubt I had, was about the expediency and agreeableness of the doxology, I often used at the end of my prayers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>I could not say it was unlawful; but I thought the safest way was to consider what sort of doxologies the scriptures set before us, and so recommend to our use. These, I was sure, must be safe, and the other might be doubtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>And it seemed to me very reasonable, that he that prays with others should make the worship as unexceptionable as possible to all Christians, by avoiding to bring into it disputable, doubtful, or unnecessary things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>The doctrine of this sermon, from which he has given a long extract in his pamphlet, entitled, <q direct="unspecified">The Western Inquisition,</q> seems to bear a considerable resemblance to what is sometimes called <hi rend="italics">moderate</hi> Calvinism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>The efficacy of the death and sacrifice of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0005.00104.00336" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> is owing to the appointment of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, to the dignity of his person, and the holiness and purity of his oblation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>We could have no certainty of this efficacy, if we did not know assuredly that it was the appointment of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; but, on the other hand, this alone, though we had been made acquainted with nothing more on the subject, would have been sufficient to satisfy us that all was right, and that a way had been made to reconcile the remission of sin with the divine justice, though we could not see it. Still he repels the notion, which he ascribes to the <name>Socinians</name>, that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> might have been reconciled to us without a satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>Justice to the sinner may <pb id="p.105" n="105"/> have admitted it; but there was also a justice due to himself&mdash;a regard to his own honour and glory, and the reputation of his government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>On the other hand, he rejects the notion that an infinite satisfaction was necessary, because sin is an infinite evil as committed against an infinite Being;&mdash;he justly observes, that by the same rule any act of obedience would be an infinite good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>In the sufferings endured by <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0005.00105.00337" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> on account of our sins, <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is shewn to be righteous and sin <hi rend="italics">revenging;</hi> and having thus secured his own <hi rend="italics">honour</hi>, and been just to himself, he may, without the least impeachment of his wisdom, holiness, or sovereignty, be the justifier of him that believes in <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>This being the case, we should be on our guard not to depreciate him in our thoughts or our expressions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>He then finds great fault with the forced and awkward interpretations, as he calls them, of the <name>Socinians</name>; and adds, that we need not be shy in giving to <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0005.00105.00341" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> the title which we find the scripture gives him <hi rend="italics">over and over;</hi> (citing to this purpose, <persName><foreName>John</foreName> <genName>i</genName></persName>. <num value="1">1</num>, <num value="2">2</num>; Heb. i. <num value="8">8</num>; <persName><foreName>Isaiah</foreName> <genName n="9">IX</genName></persName>. <num value="6">6</num>.)

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>At all events, it would appear that for a time this sermon produced apparently the desired effect of allaying the jealousy which had arisen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>There can, however, be no doubt, that whatever the ministers may have done who disclaimed any discussion of this sort in private, and professed their uniform endeavour to discourage all topics of controversy and dissension, the subject was much agitated by various members of the society, displaying probably on both sides more zeal and warmth than sound judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>In this way much bickering and dispute doubtless arose, and many idle tales were circulated, which, instead of being suppressed, were encouraged and promoted by the orthodox minister, <persName n="Lavington,,,,," id="n0300.0005.00106.00345" reg="mostcommon:Lavington,nomatch:0"><surname>Lavington</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>Soon afterwards, he avowed his resolution to bring the whole affair before the <name>Assembly</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>On this occasion, after dwelling for some time on what appears to us a somewhat fanciful argument, derived from Hebrews <num value="9">IX</num>. <num value="14">14</num>, where he must needs have it that the <q direct="unspecified">eternal Spirit</q> means the divine nature of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0005.00107.00347" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, he introduces the following just and impressive view of the great principles of religious liberty with reference to the existing disputes; and which were certainly not less infringed by committees of <num value="13">thirteen</num>, and by assemblies of ministers imposing their own creeds as a test upon others, binding men's consciences and lording it over their brethren, than by synods and councils backed with the authority of the civil power.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>On this, the managers, hesitating <pb id="p.111" n="111"/> to proceed to this extremity on their own authority, made application for advice to certain ministers in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>It is not much to the credit of these ministers, that, without making any further inquiries, or consulting the parties against whom the complaint was made, they proceeded immediately to give an opinion upon an <hi rend="italics">ex-parte</hi> statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>Their advice was to call in some of the neighbouring ministers who might best judge of these matters on the spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>Accordingly, <num value="7">seven</num> ministers were applied to, who may have been selected, as residing at no great distance, but who happen, nevertheless, to have been among those who took the most prominent part in the late violent proceedings in the <name>Assembly</name>, and who were, therefore, least of all likely to exercise an impartial judgment on the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>In fact, it does not appear to have been for the purpose of judging between the parties, or of reconciling differences, that they were assembled; but to assist <num value="1">one</num> of the parties in the most effectual mode of accomplishing the object they were already determined on.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>This dispute created a breach between the contending parties which was never entirely healed; and there can be little doubt that it tended materially to weaken the political weight and influence of the <name>Nonconformists</name> of that day, taken as a body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>But, on the other hand, it is not less evident that, in the midst of the din of contending factions, the voice of truth was heard by many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>The general attention was forcibly directed to important principles, some of them hitherto unsuspected, and others, though tacitly acknowledged, yet never before pursued to their practical consequences; so that what the friends <pb id="p.116" n="116"/> of peace deeply deplored at the time, became, in the hands of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, the instrument of important and extensive good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>And we trust that all will treat the subjects of their common <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, as they who expect the final decision at his appearing.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>The promoters of these <q direct="unspecified">Advices,</q> though deprecating any reference to human creeds, disclaim the imputation that they are themselves favourable to any other than the commonly-received notions on the subject of the <rs>Trinity</rs>; and this was probably true to a certain extent; though we perceive, in the list of signatures attached to them, the names of some who then were, and of others who afterwards became, <pb id="p.117" n="117"/> distinguished supporters of different forms of Unitarianism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>On the other hand, a powerful body was favourable to the orthodox party at <placeName reg="Exeter, Devon, England" key="tgn,7011953">Exeter</placeName>, and could not be contented without an express declaration of their faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>They insisted accordingly on a confession in terms of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>&mdash;article of the <orgName n="England Church" type="church">Church of England</orgName>, and drew up a counter string of advices, with which in their apparent spirit and general tenor there is no material fault to be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>The course which they recommend in case of a disagreement, real or supposed, between a minister and either the whole or any considerable part of his congregation, is rational and proper enough; but it is obviously spoiled in its application to this particular instance, by the prescribed declaration of conformity to a creed of human composition by which it is introduced.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>The eager struggle and bitter debates which it occasioned, gave rise to much irritation, animosity, and ill-will, which, it must be confessed, was far from being limited to <num value="1">one</num> party in the dispute; but the very agitation which it gave to men's minds served to shake the foundations and weaken the dominion of prejudice; to stimulate to more free and active inquiry; and, in more instances than <num value="1">one</num>, to carry the inquirers forward to conclusions which in the outset they little anticipated, and even formally disclaimed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>The main object of this extensive and most valuable work is, to collect into <num value="1">one</num> view the train of historical evidence by which we are authorized to receive the books of the New Testament as genuine, and, consequently, authentic and credible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>If it be asked, why we receive any ancient work as in reality the production of its reputed author, our answer is, that it has been handed down to us from those times by an uninterrupted tradition; that though, perhaps, no copy of the work is actually extant which can with any probability be referred to that remote period, yet it has been described, quoted, and commented on, by a succession of intervening writers, in such a manner as to prove that the work we have in our hands, presenting the same passages which they profess to have quoted from it, is the same in all essential respects with that which existed in their time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>The genuineness of the writings ascribed to these intervening witnesses, and in which their testimony is contained, is of course determined chiefly in the same manner, but partly also from the constant consent of all succeeding times, and from the correspondence of their contents with the known character of the supposed authors, and the events, opinions, and controversies, of the age <pb id="p.137" n="137"/> in which they lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>Now, when this principle of evidence is applied to the books of the <rs>New</rs> testament, it is not enough to say that they possses the same marks and proofs of genuineness with the books ascribed to <persName n="Cicero,,,,," id="n0300.0007.00137.00460" reg="mostcommon:Cicero,nomatch:0"><surname>Cicero</surname></persName>, Livy, <persName><foreName>Virgil</foreName></persName>, &amp;c we find upon examination that the argument, though of the same kind, is beyond all comparison more extensive, complete, and satisfactory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>But to collect and place in <num value="1">one</num> view, another, (for this is impossible,) to reduce into <num value="1">one</num> consecutive series the various testimonies derived from a multitude of writers in a succession of centuries, of which that evidence consists, aspires, as will readily be imagined, a prodigious extent of reading and laborious research.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>This important labour <persName n="Lardner,Doctor,,,," id="n0300.0007.00137.00461" reg="nearbymention:Lardner,Richard,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Lardner</surname></persName> has performed; and the result is placed, not merely within the reach of the scholar, (though he is of course more competent to judge of its value,) but also of the <rs>English</rs> reader, who assuming (as he may with confidence on the combined authority of all persons of every party who are qualified to express an opinion at the translations are correct and the historical statements to be relied upon, may satisfy himself the main fact, that the books we now possess can be traced up to a period approaching inantiquity that of the supposed authors to whom they have been uniformly ascribed, and that they have been transmitted to us without any material change.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>He exhibit this argument in its entire state, and to enable the reader to judge of its full value, it is obviously necessary to present each passage in which any book of the New Testament is either expressly cited or evidently alluded to; <pb id="p.138" n="138"/> and to shew, by a comparison of the quotation with the corresponding portion of our modern editions, that the ancient writer had in his hands a book substantially the same with that which now exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>It is also necessary to give such an account of the witnesses themselves as may furnish a fair estimate of their credibility; that is to say, the reasons derived from the history of the times, from the general state of the <orgName n="Christian world" type="newspaper">Christian world</orgName>, from the character and reputation of the writers in question, determined by the concurring information both of contemporary and succeeding authors who recorded their lives, and enumerated and described their works,&mdash;which authorize us to rely upon what we read, and to believe that in the books which bear their names we have what is equivalent to the testimony of living witnesses, to the fact, that the writings now ascribed to the apostles and evangelists existed in their times, were ascribed to the same persons, and possessed the same authority which is yielded to them at the present day. In this manner, proceeding step by step, either tracing the proof upward from our own time, or, as <persName n="Lardner,,,,," id="n0300.0007.00138.00462" reg="nearbymention:Lardner,Richard,,,"><surname>Lardner</surname></persName> has preferred, pursuing the stream from its source, till he brings it down to the commencement of what may be termed modern literature, we find a close and uninterrupted tradition; a chain of evidence; every link of which is intimately connected with that which follows, so that what now exists and is manifest to our senses is shewn to be in, such a manner necessarily dependent upon that whish has been, that we are bound to receive it with the same confidence and certainty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>It is obvious that to execute a plan like this, <pb id="p.139" n="139"/> upon such a scale, was a work of no ordinary magnitude; it was, in fact, an undertaking which might be thought adequate to occupy the entire life of a laborious scholar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>In this discourse the author has executed, with great skill and <pb id="p.143" n="143"/> success, the somewhat delicate task of steering the middle path between too large an allowance to the customs and usages of the world, and the puritanical strictness which at that period still prevailed to a considerable extent among thee descendants of those worthies who in a former age had been obliged, in a great measure, to go out of the world that they might preserve an unviolated conscience.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>Though, indeed, to say nothing of his excellent practical writings, they must be careless students of the <q direct="unspecified">Credibility,</q> who fail to perceive in the biographical notices of the principal writers whose testimony he has occasion to record, and in a multitude of incidental traits, scattered here and there, abundant indications that the author was a man not only of extensive learning, but of deep and influential piety.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>In <dateStruct value="1743--"><year reg="1743">1743</year></dateStruct>, our author published <num value="3">three</num> Sermons on the argument in favour of Christianity derived from the present circumstances of the <name>Jewish</name> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>He shews, in a very distinct and satisfactory manner, the correspondence between the predictions of our <rs type="role2">Lord</rs> and the condition of that people since his time, especially since the destruction of their city and temple, and their consequent dispersion among all the nations of the earth; that it is agreeable also to many prophecies in the Old Testament; that it affords a strong proof that the <name>Messiah</name> expected by the <name>Jews</name> is already come, since he was to appear during the continuance of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> temple, of which it is now so many ages since there was no longer <num value="1">one</num> stone left standing on another, and thus furnishes a decisive argument for the divine authority of the <name>Gospel</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>He illustrates his argument on these different points with his usual judgment, candour, and fairness, and deduces the practical inferences and admonitions arising out of so signal an example of the retributive justice and moral government of <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name> with, perhaps, more than his ordinary force and impressiveness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>Though he looks forward to a time, still, however, to all human appearance, as remote as ever, when the <pb id="p.146" n="146"/> branches that had been broken off should be grafted in again, he does not agree in the expectation which many have expressed, and which is perhaps the most general opinion, that the <name>Jewish</name> people will be again established in their own land, where the temple is to be rebuilt and the ceremonial law restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>He thinks it more probable, that, when the <name>Jews</name> shall have professed themselves believers in the <name>Messiahship</name> of <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>, the result will be that the middle wall of partition will indeed be for ever broken down, and that all peculiarities of character and institutions, as well as of privileges, will be utterly done away; as there will then be no longer any occasion for the continuance of that standing evidence of the truth of the <rs>Christian</rs> system which we now derive from the permanent existence of the <name>Jews</name> as a distinct and peculiar people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>This may be so; but perhaps, amidst the opposite speculations and conjectures of those who, on the strength of their own interpretations of prophecy, attempt to lift up the dread veil of futurity, the conclusion of the cool unprejudiced thinker will be, that it is better to leave questions of this sort where we found them; and if there be in scripture predictions yet unaccomplished of events still to take place in the history of this world, to wait till time shall at length have disclosed the mystery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>The prophecies were not intended to make us prophets.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>For a series of years, at this period of <persName n="Lardner,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0007.00146.00479" reg="nearbymention:Lardner,Richard,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lardner</surname></persName>'s life, very few events are recorded by his biographer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>His disposition did not incline him to take any active part in public life, and his infirmity of deafness, though it might not altogether <pb id="p.147" n="147"/> disqualify him for public business, naturally prevented his friends from seeking to place him in any of those situations which might tend to bring him personally much before the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>His days and years seem to have passed in a uniform course of laborious study, engaged for the most part in collecting the materials for his great work, the successive volumes of which appeared from time to time, bringing down the regular and unbroken chain to the commencement of the modern aera, and at the same time accumulating a large mass of highly curious and valuable information for the student of ecclesiastical history and theological literature.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>These sermons, it may be presumed, are a fair specimen of the usual style of his preaching, and probably afford us, at the same time, a tolerably exact criterion of the preacher's own mind and character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>They are judicious and instructive; and the perusal of them cannot fail to be profitable to those who can be persuaded to bestow upon them the attention which they deserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>The style is correct and perspicuous, but altogether unadorned; the divisions are formal and inartificial, and the whole composition indicates as little as can be conceived of the rhetorician's art. The practical applications, though rational and sensible, scarcely ever rise to eloquence; displaying little of that <hi rend="italics">unction</hi> which is perhaps indispensable in <num value="1">one</num> who seeks to rouse the attention and interest the feelings of a popular audience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>When we further consider the preacher's physical infirmity of extreme deafness, rendering it next to impossible that he should possess that power of modulating his voice which is almost essential to a public speaker, it is not perhaps to be much wondered at that his hearers were not numerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>After referring to tile various modes which have been proposed of interpreting this difficult narrative, he proceeds to comment upon it as a true history to be understood in its literal sense, but apparently without pledging himself to any positive conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>On the argument for the <rs>Trinity</rs>, derived from the expression <q direct="unspecified">Let <hi rend="italics">us</hi> make man,</q> he gives no decided opinion of his own, but contents himself with stating that of <q direct="unspecified">many learned Christians,</q> who suppose that the style common to princes and great men, who often speak in the plural number, is here ascribed to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>It is rather remarkable that he does not advert to the singular circumstance of there being <num value="2">two</num> distinct accounts of the creation of man, differing materially from each other, and evidently, from the difference of style and other circumstances, not written by the same person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>He then proceeds to the account of the <hi rend="italics">fall</hi>, as he styles it, in conformity with the received usage; a usage, however, unauthorized by scripture, which nowhere employs the expression, and, in fact, contains no statement in any part of it from which we can fairly infer any degradation, either physical or moral, of <persName n="Adam,,,,," id="n0300.0007.00149.00488" reg="mostcommon:Adam,nomatch:0"><surname>Adam</surname></persName>'s posterity in consequence of his transgression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>In speaking of the introduction of the serpent as an agent and speaker in the transaction, he says, <q direct="unspecified">it is generally understood that here was the contrivance and agency of Satan.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>But he does not say that he himself either allows or questions this, and goes on, in commenting on the rest of the story, to speak of the serpent only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>In his <q direct="unspecified">general inferences,</q> he expresses himself somewhat more decidedly in <pb id="p.150" n="150"/> opposition to the common notion of original sin, which he justly stigmatizes as, in reality, making <name n="God" type="God">God</name> the author of sin. <q direct="unspecified">What reason is there,</q> he justly asks, <q direct="unspecified">to apprehend so great an alteration made in the nature and powers of man by <persName n="Adam,,,,," id="n0300.0007.00150.00489" reg="mostcommon:Adam,nomatch:0"><surname>Adam</surname></persName>'s transgression?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>Let us, then, not be unwilling to consider, whether the consequences of the fall of our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> parents be not aggravated by some; and let us be careful not to admit any schemes which are derogatory to <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> honour, and which countenance or justify men in their allowed weaknesses or wilful transgressions.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>On the whole, however, this tract is a remarkable instance of the caution and reserve which our author still thought it prudent to use when he had occasion to touch in public on this and other controverted questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>With the exception of the passage just cited, he does not pledge himself to any positive conclusion, though an attentive reader may not find it difficult to trace the opinions to which he was chiefly inclined; and even to this he did not think it advisable to affix his name.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>This is the more remarkable, as there is good reason to think that he was less reserved in the expression of his opinions from the pulpit on subjects on which it might be expected that a deviation from popular notions would render him obnoxious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>But the fact may have been, that a preacher like <persName n="Lardner,,,,," id="n0300.0007.00150.00490" reg="nearbymention:Lardner,Richard,,,"><surname>Lardner</surname></persName>, who had little or nothing of what is vulgarly called popularity to lose, might feel under less restraint than <num value="1">one</num> who was more followed by the crowd, and who might therefore suffer more by offending its prejudices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>It was his lot to address a small, but a select, attached, <pb id="p.151" n="151"/> intelligent, and reflecting audience; and though the ordinary strain of his preaching was, as we have stated, chiefly practical, yet it was founded on what he regarded as at once rational and evangelical principles, and consequently had habituated his congregation to such trains of thought as would dispose and enable them to enter into his views on many points for which he might consider the public at large as not prepared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>It is needless to say that such a work, by such a writer, contains a treasure of most valuable <pb id="p.153" n="153"/> and interesting information for all classes of readers, and, more especially, for all theological students.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>Indeed, it can scarcely be said that any <num value="1">one</num> deserves this latter name who has not made it the subject of his most diligent and careful examination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>We may not always agree with the author in his conclusions on some points relating to the history and authorship of several books of the New Testament, which have been the subjects of dispute; but he never gives his opinion without stating, at the same time, his reasons very fully and candidly, so that he commonly furnishes the reader with the means of forming his own judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>This remark may apply particularly to the <name>Epistle</name> to the <name>Hebrews</name>; which he ascribes to <placeName key="tgn,7013947" n="1.000 10" reg="saint paul, ramsey, minnesota">St. Paul</placeName> with a confidence which the evidence, as collected and stated by himself, will scarcely, we think, appear to authorize in the estimation of an unprejudiced and attentive reader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>The same may, perhaps, be said of the authority ascribed to the <name>Epistle</name> of <persName n="Jude,,,,," id="n0300.0007.00153.00497" reg="mostcommon:Jude,nomatch:0"><surname>Jude</surname></persName>, and the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> Epistle of <persName><foreName>Peter</foreName></persName>; (at least, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> chapter;) with respect to which, however, the author allows that it would not be safe to receive any doctrinal interpretation on the strength of any passage cited from them, unless confirmed by other undisputed scriptures.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>In the year <dateStruct value="1758--"><year reg="1758">1758</year></dateStruct>, appeared a letter to the well-known philanthropist, <persName n="Hanway,Mister,Jonas,,," id="n0300.0007.00153.00498" reg="default:Hanway,Jonas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Jonas</foreName> <surname>Hanway</surname></persName>, remonstrating against the name of Magdalen Houses, which it was proposed to give to establishments for the reception of penitent females of loose character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>He shews very clearly that the prevailing notion that Mary Magdalen was the woman mentioned in the <num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num> chapter of <persName n="Luke,,,,," id="n0300.0007.00153.00499" reg="mostcommon:Luke,nomatch:0"><surname>Luke</surname></persName>, who washed <pb id="p.154" n="154"/> our Saviour's feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and who is there called by the <name>Pharisee</name> a sinner, is unfounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>From the manner in which her name is introduced along with that of the wife of <persName n="Herod,,,,," id="n0300.0007.00154.00500" reg="mostcommon:Herod,nomatch:0"><surname>Herod</surname></persName>'s steward and other women, who ministered to him of their substance, there is every reason to believe that she was a woman of rank and property, against whom there is no ground for supposing that any imputation had ever existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>She had been the subject of <num value="1">one</num> of our <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>'s benevolent miracles; but of what nature the disorder was from which she was relieved, the expression of the <name>Evangelist</name>, that <num value="7">seven</num> devils or demons had gone out of her, does not enable us to conjecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>However, she ever after manifested the most affectionate gratitude to her benefactor, and was distinguished by him with marked tokens of his esteem and regard, particularly as being the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to whom he made himself known after his resurrection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>To call such an institution, therefore, a Magdalen-house, appears to be taking a very unwarrantable liberty with the name of an honourable, and, for any thing we know, truly excellent woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>The letter was sent too late; or, at all events, it did not prevent the name being given, though no <num value="1">one</num> who attends to these considerations can fail to perceive its impropriety.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>It is by this remarkable publication that our author is chiefly known in the department of dogmatic theology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>The question professedly discussed is, Whether the <name>Logos</name>, understanding by that term, according to the <name>Arian</name> hypothesis, a great pre-existent <hi rend="italics">created</hi> Spirit, who was employed by the <rs>Supreme</rs> as a subordinate agent in the creation of the world, occupied the place of a human soul in the person of <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n0300.0007.00155.00503" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>Our author, after confessing that he was at <num value="1">one</num> time inclined to this singular notion, now gives it up altogether; for the scriptures represent our <rs type="role2">Lord</rs> as exalted to power and great glory as a reward of his sufferings here on earth; whereas, it is difficult to conceive how such a being as <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0007.00155.00504" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> is here supposed to have been, could receive any exaltation, merely by being set over those creatures to whom, as their Creator, he was immeasurably superior before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>Moreover, he is uniformly called in the New Testament, a <hi rend="italics">man;</hi> a title which could not be properly ascribed to such an anomalous being as this hypothesis represents him to have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>Further, this supposition is inconsistent with any rational account of the temptation; for how could he who made the heavens and the earth be tempted by the offer of all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>By removing him in reality so far from any participation in what can properly be termed human nature, it enervates the force of his example, and, in fact, as far as we are concerned, destroys it altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>Finally, what is there extraordinary <pb id="p.156" n="156"/> or wonderful, upon this hypothesis, in <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0007.00156.00505" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>'s resurrection?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>Or, rather, is it not much more difficult and amazing to conceive how such a being should ever, for any the slightest interval, be subject to death at all?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>The resurrection of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0007.00156.00506" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> could then be no pattern or pledge of that of mankind at large, which is the plain doctrine of the New Testament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>The author then proceeds to comment on several texts which are commonly supposed to favour this scheme, and particularly the introduction to <placeName key="tgn,7013172" n="1.000 13" reg="saint john,new brunswick,canada,north and central america">St. John</placeName>'s Gospel, in which he conceives the term <foreign lang="greek">logos,</foreign>to denote the divine wisdom personified,&mdash;an attribute of the divine nature, but not any being or person distinct from <name n="God" type="God">God</name> the <rs>Father</rs> himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>When it is said the <name>Word</name> was made or became flesh, the term flesh denotes human nature in general; and the expression is equivalent to what we are elsewhere told, <q direct="unspecified">that in him (<persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0007.00156.00507" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>) dwelt all the fulness of the <name>Godhead</name>;</q> &mdash;<q direct="unspecified">that in him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/></p> 
<p>This is, perhaps, the principle of interpretation which is better adapted than any other to meet all the difficulties of this remarkable passage, and, under <num value="1">one</num> modification or another, has united in its favour, perhaps, an increasing majority of <persName n="Unitarian,,,,," id="n0300.0007.00156.00508" reg="mostcommon:Unitarian,nomatch:0"><surname>Unitarian</surname></persName> critics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>It contains a general view of all the various illustrations which he had collected in the course of his extensive and laborious researches into the history and literature of those times which could in any way throw light on the main facts of the <name>Gospel</name> history, or on the history of the <orgName n="Primitive Church" type="church">primitive church</orgName>, and thus either strengthen the direct evidence, or serve to remove obscurities, difficulties, and objections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>It would be scarcely possible, in any moderate compass, to give any distinct account of a work so multifarious and diversified in its character, though simple and uniform in its object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>The materials of this work were doubtless the gradual accumulations of the author's researches throughout the whole of the long period during which his attention had been chiefly directed to these subjects; but the preparation of a work of such magnitude after he had passed his <num value="80" type="ordinal">eightieth</num> year, and its completion, at that advanced age, within the short compass of <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, sufficiently proves that his powers of mind were preserved unimpaired to the last in a very extraordinary degree, and moreover continued in unintermitted exertion with a diligence and energy rarely observed in the period of health and strength, at a time when most men would think themselves entitled to rest from their labours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>The <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> volume of the <name>Jewish</name> and Heathen Testimonies, the last of our author's productions which appeared in his lifetime, was published in <dateStruct value="1767--"><year reg="1767">1767</year></dateStruct>, when he had completed his <num value="83" type="ordinal">eighty-third</num> year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>Even then, however, it was not in his nature to rest from his labours, or to decline further exertions; never thinking he had done enough so long as the ability still remained to him of working in his <rs type="role2">Master</rs>'s vineyard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>No sooner was the collection of Heathen Testimonies out of his hands, than he sat down to prepare the history of the <rs>Early Heretics</rs> <pb id="p.162" n="162"/> of the <orgName n="Christian Church" type="church">Christian Church</orgName>, in which he soon made considerable progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>Some allowance must, of course, be made for the circumstances in which this work was prepared, and, perhaps, for the inferior interest of the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>Under these circumstances it is clearly impossible, in the nature of things, that we should have a history of ancient heretics that can be thoroughly depended on; but <persName n="Lardner,,,,," id="n0300.0007.00163.00528" reg="nearbymention:Lardner,Richard,,,"><surname>Lardner</surname></persName>'s, probably, approaches as near to it as is practicable with our present imperfect and partial sources of information.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>And we cannot doubt that, independently of the personal influence of his instructor, who was so deeply involved in this memorable struggle, the naturally enlarged and liberal mind of <persName n="Foster,,,,," id="n0300.0008.00165.00535" reg="nearbymention:Foster,James,,,"><surname>Foster</surname></persName> would lead him to take a warm interest in the controversy, and to resent, in terms perhaps stronger and less measured than his more cautious and discreet seniors would permit themselves to use, the extravagant and inconsistent proceedings of those who, when only beginning to enjoy a toleration themselves, attempted to impose articles of faith upon others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>He already began to display those qualifications as a preacher which afterwards raised him to so much distinction; and there can be no doubt that, if he had belonged to the popular party, he would presently have been called upon to take a leading place as the minister of some numerous and considerable congregation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>But he had from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> espoused the liberal principles which characterized him through life; and at this period of strong religious excitement, clamours rose high against him; for his notions of integrity and sincerity could <pb id="p.166" n="166"/> not be satisfied, like those of many in similar circumstances, with a systematic concealment of what he believed to be divine truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>He had formed his judgment, and he felt himself bound to declare it, and to appear publicly in defence of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/>Here he wrote his celebrated Essay on Fundamentals in Religion, which was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> published in <dateStruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>This tract, considering the circumstances in which it was written, the condition of the writer, and the temper of the times, is certainly a very remarkable production.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>It contains not only a just and clear statement of the principles by which we are to determine what is and what is not fundamental in religion, (that is, essential to the character of a true <name>Christian</name> whom <name n="God" type="God">God</name> approves and will accept), but an honest and manly declaration of his own sentiments, and his determination to cast in his lot with the calumniated confessors who had recently suffered loss and gone through evil report for avowing the conclusions to which they had been led by their unbiassed inquiries into scripture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>He lays down these <num value="2">two</num> principles,&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">that no doctrine is a fundamental and necessary article of a <name>Christian</name>'s faith, but what is so plainly and distinctly revealed that an ordinary <name>Christian</name>, sincere and honest in his inquiries, cannot miss of the knowledge of it; and, secondly, that it is not sufficient that a proposition be clearly revealed to make it fundamental, but a belief of it must also be made an express term or condition of happiness in the sacred writings.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>It is impossible to suppose that an infinitely wise and good Being should <pb id="p.169" n="169"/> have made the blessing of his dependent in conditions&mdash;which his moral creatures might not be competent to fulfil; or on just views of obscure and doubtful points on which honest and inquiring men, in the conscientious use of the faculties which he had given them, and the sources of information which he had placed within their reach, might differ.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>To suppose this, espcially when consequences of such overwhelming importance in both directions, are represented as being dependent on a right or a wrong faith on these points, would be to make Christianity a curse rather than a blessing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>Again, if there be any tenets properly fundamental, in the sense in which this term is frequently used, (such, namely, that except a man believe in them he cannot be saved,) we should at least expect to find them distinctly expressed, not merely in catechisms and creeds, but by that authority which can alone establish the terms and conditions of salvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>Hence it follows, <q direct="unspecified">that no <name>Christian</name> who has the <rs>Liberty</rs> of looking into his Bible, and who uses that liberty, can err in fundamentals; so that none of the points which are at present debated by great numbers on all sides, and on which opposite opinions are undeniably maintained, in all honesty, by perfectly sincere and conscientious men, can be essential to salvation.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>The author then proceeds to enter somewhat more into particulars, aid to apply these general principles to the scriptural evidence adduced in support of the <name>Trinitarian</name> scheme, to shew that it is nowhere even expressly maintained or asserted in the new Testament; but is only deduced by its supporters as a consequence or inference from <pb id="p.170" n="170"/> what is revealed, and is still further from being prescribed as a positive term or condition of salvation, and therefore utterly fails in both the criterion by which we are to estimate the claims of any tenet to be included in the catalogue of supposed fundamentals.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>Here and elsewhere the author espouses the <name>Arian</name> principles of <persName n="Peirce,,,,," id="n0300.0008.00170.00544" reg="mostcommon:Peirce,James,,,:5"><surname>Peirce</surname></persName> and <persName n="Emlyn,,,,," id="n0300.0008.00170.00545" reg="nearbymention:Emlyn,Thomas,,,"><surname>Emlyn</surname></persName>, which the talents and well-earned reputation of these distinguished men rendered almost universally prevalent among the <rs>English</rs> Anti-trinitarians of that period; but the exposure of the leading tenets of Calvinism, and particularly of the entire absence of any adequate scriptural evidence for them, though concise, is very distinct and complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>While he admits (or rather takes for granted, without assigning any direct evidence for his conclusion) that a species of worship is due from his disciples to <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0008.00170.00546" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> in his character of Mediator, he labours to distinguish between this subordinate homage and the supreme worship paid to the <rs>Father</rs> only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1036"/>But on what principle this sort of subordinate worship is to be reconciled with that solemn injunction of him to whom it is proposed to be addressed, <q direct="unspecified">In that day ye shall ask me <hi rend="italics">nothing</hi>, but whatever ye shall ask, the <rs>Father</rs> in my name, he will give it you,</q> he nowhere attempts to explain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/>On the strength, we presume, of this modified homage, which, Unitarians, according to him, are justified in offering to their Saviour, he seems to think that the <num value="2">two</num> parties might conscientiously unite in the same religious services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/>Here, however, lies the prinpal weakness of his argument, which proves only that most of the points on which the contending <pb id="p.171" n="171"/> parties differ are not essential to salvation, or necessary to furnish a basis for the practical principles, the hopes, and promises of the <name>Gospel</name>; &mdash;that this is to be found, and to be found <hi rend="italics">only</hi>, in that treasure of undisputed truth which is held alike by all sects, every where, and at all times; <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">quod ubique, quod semper, quod ab omnibus</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1039"/>This he proves triumphantly; but it does not therefore follow, that he who believes that <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0008.00171.00547" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> is the proper object of supreme worship, though he should allow that his <persName n="Unitarian,,,,," id="n0300.0008.00171.00548" reg="mostcommon:Unitarian,nomatch:0"><surname>Unitarian</surname></persName> brother possesses the essentials of the <name>Gospel</name>, could reconcile it to his conscience to confine himself to that form of worship in which alone the latter could unite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/>Here it seems unavoidable that the <num value="2">two</num> parties should travel in separate paths, and charitably agree to differ.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>The publication attracted considerable attention, and raised a great additional clamour against the author, from those who had recently been excited by so much bigoted animosity against what they were pleased to style the <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">new notions;</hi></q> and who were incessant in their endeavours not to refute his arguments, but to blacken his character, and render him obnoxious to the illiberal and narrow-minded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/>Their conduct, however, in this respect, did not provoke him to a retaliation unworthy of his enlightened and candid mind, or lead him to forget what was due from a consistent follower of a meek and suffering Saviour; so that he might say with the <name>Apostle</name>, <q direct="unspecified">being reviled we bless, being persecuted we suffer it, being defamed we entreat.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/>Here, in consequence of reading <persName n="Gale,Doctor,,,," id="n0300.0008.00172.00551" reg="mostcommon:Gale,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Gale</surname></persName>'s Treatise on Infant Baptism, he was induced to give up that practice, and to acknowledge his belief that the baptism of adults by immersion is the true scriptural rite;&mdash;in conformity with which conviction he was soon afterwards baptized cacording to that mode in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/>Whatever may be our opinion as to the correctness of his conclusion on this controverted point, it cannot be doubted that by thus avowing and publicly acting on his conviction, he gave a strong proof of that integrity and disinterested attachment to what he conceived to be the truth, which he had already evinced, and which continued throughout life to be a leading feature of his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>For his public adoption of this opinion and practice must, of necessity, have materially narrowed the field in which he might reasonably hope for an invitation to labour as a Christian minister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>Most of the congregations which at that period adopted more liberal principles, and, consequently, deviated from Calvinism, were of the <rs>Presbyterian</rs> denomination, among whom it was reasonable to presume that his rejecting the practice of infant baptism would be a material, if not an insuperable obstacle; while the number of Baptist congregations, with whom his heretical opinions would not be a decisive objection, was at that time exceedingly small.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1049"/>At this time, however, he met with a kind and valuable friend in <persName n="Houlston,,Robert,,," id="n0300.0008.00173.00552" reg="default:Houlston,Robert,,,"><foreName>Robert</foreName> <surname>Houlston</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, who took him into his house in the capacity of domestic chaplain, and treated him with much kindness and generosity; for which he did not fail to come in for his share of the obloquy and abuse heaped upon his protege by those who, in the superabundance of their zeal for what they held to be <name>Christian</name> truth, were but too apt to forget <name>Christian</name> charity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1064"/>In the year <dateStruct value="1731--"><year reg="1731">1731</year></dateStruct>, our author appeared in the field as an advocate for revelation, in the controversy which was at that time actively agitated with <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n0300.0008.00175.00563" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName>, <persName n="Tindal,,,,," id="n0300.0008.00175.00564" reg="mostcommon:Tindal,nomatch:0"><surname>Tindal</surname></persName>, <persName n="Woolston,,,,," id="n0300.0008.00175.00565" reg="mostcommon:Woolston,nomatch:0"><surname>Woolston</surname></persName>, and other well-known deistical writers, and which produced or suggested some of the most valuable contributions to our collection of works on the evidences of religion, both natural and revealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1065"/>In this respect it certainly afforded a remarkable practical illustration of the great principle openly maintained and defended by several of the most distinguished champions of revelation, especially among the dissenters; and not only maintained, but perhaps more fully acted upon in practice than it had ever been on any former occasion;&mdash; the advantage which truth must ever gain from a <pb id="p.176" n="176"/> perfect freedom of discussion on both sides, unbiassed by the interference of the <rs type="role" reg="civil-Magistrate">civil magistrate</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1066"/><persName n="Foster,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0008.00176.00566" reg="nearbymention:Foster,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Foster</surname></persName>'s treatise is entitled <q direct="unspecified">The Usefulness, Truth, and <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> of the <rs>Christian Revelation</rs> defended against the <name>Objections</name> contained in a late Book, intitled <title>Christianity as old as the creation</title>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1067"/>It is introduced by the following just and liberal statement of the principles on which such discussions ought always to be conducted: <q direct="unspecified">As religion is of the highest importance to mankind, free debates about it ought, above all things, to be encouraged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>This is the only way to settle the true nature of it, and fix it upon a solid foundation, that truth and falsehood, superstition and rational piety, may not equally prevail under that venerable name; and to support it by methods of restraint and violence is not only an infringement of the most sacred natural rights of mankind, but a dishonour to religion itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1069"/>It makes a good cause suspected, and gives every little insinuation of its adversaries, without proof, the air of probability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1070"/>And as all honest men have no concern but for truth, and never suffer their passions, prejudices, or worldly interests to influence their religious inquiries, they can desire nothing more than that the argument should be clearly stated, and urged in its utmost strength on both sides; and must be as ready to give up any particular scheme of religion on sufficient evidence of its falsehood, as they were to defend and propagate it while they believed it to be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/>Let those who do not believe the <rs>Christian</rs> religion be allowed to throw off all disguises, and attack it with all the skill and strength of argument they are capable of <pb id="p.177" n="177"/> Let not such as write in defence of it claim any privilege above their opponents, merely because they write on the popular and orthodox side of the question, since the natural rights of both parties are equal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/>We need not be afraid of the consequences; for truth can never suffer by being brought to the most critical test of impartial reason; and it is the interest of mankind that falsehood should be detected and exposed.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1073"/></p> 
<p>The author then enlarges, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, on the advantage of a revelation, and particularly of the <rs>Christian</rs>, and on the use and evidence of miracles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1074"/>The main argument of his opponent's treatise, as its title implies, was intended to shew that the doctrines and principles of Christianity, in as far as they are just and rational, are such as men might have discovered for themselves; and, in fact, had in many instances ascertained and acknowledged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1075"/>To this it is justly replied, that even if all this were granted, it would not prove a revelation superfluous, if it appears that mankind had placed themselves in such circumstances, that prevailing ignorance, the force of unconquerable prejudices, idolatry, superstition, and wickedness, had depraved their minds and perverted their understandings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1076"/>Whatever might be the natural powers of the human understanding, or whatever might be the cause of the delusion and ignorance under which men almost universally laboured, it must, at least, be admitted that these lamentable effects did exist; that as long as they existed, they were inconsistent with the true improvement and happiness of man, and therefore it is consistent with our views of divine <pb id="p.178" n="178"/> wisdom and goodness to conclude that especial means would be adopted to dispel this delusion, and diffuse the influence of light and truth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/>In this sense it might even be granted, that the gospel was nothing more than a <q direct="unspecified">republication of the religion of nature;</q> even though it could be shewn that a time had actually existed in some primeval golden age, when the most honourable notions of the <name>Divine</name> perfections and character, and the purest principles of religion and morality were generally professed and acknowledged, and that these principles, so influencing the practice of men, had, in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance, been investigated and ascertained, and recommended to the general acceptance by the arguments and persuasions of philosophers, guided to the truth by the solitary torch of unaided human reason,&mdash;though all this could be made out, still if this religion of nature had become obsolete, and if mankind, by whatever means, had relapsed into such a state that it was no longer probable that the torch should be again illuminated, still less that its guidance should be generally followed, we can hardly allow it to be any imputation on the wisdom of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, that in the fulness of time he saw fit to substitute in its place the daylight of Gospel truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1078"/>Yet, after all, it appears that, with respect to many of the distinguishing principles of Christianity, all that can be alleged is, that when they are made known by an authority competent to discover and establish them, they approve themselves to our reason as consistent, right and good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1079"/>But it does not follow, that what human reason is ready to acknowledge under <pb id="p.179" n="179"/> these characters, when made known by external instruction, it would have been able to search out and ascertain by its own unassisted exertions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/>In the view which our author has given of the evidence derived from miracles, he makes some concessions which the truth does not appear to require, and which might affect materially the validity of the argument founded upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/>He allows, indeed, that we can easily pronounce concerning any appearance alleged to be miraculous, that it exceeds the limits of human power or knowledge, and consequently implies the introduction of a superior agency; but he does not see any good reason why such miracles (by which term, in this connexion, he intends merely such works as no human being could perform) should not be ascribed to superior created beings, who, for any thing we know to the contrary, may be permitted to interfere in the direction of events in this world, in a manner imperceptible to us, and so as to produce effects which vastly exceed the natural agency of the immediate and visible instruments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1082"/>Hence, as we know not what degree of power such agents may possess, and have no <hi rend="italics">positive proof</hi> that they may not be at the same time depraved and wicked, it would seem that we have no criterion in the nature of the things themselves to enable us to say that any works are properly miraculous, that is, that they afford a direct evidence of a divine commission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/>In order to determine this point, we have no other resource, according to him, but to compare the alleged revelation with the dictates of our own reason; if that pronounces it to be worthy of the source from which it professes to emanate, <pb id="p.180" n="180"/> we receive it; if otherwise, no miracles could give it authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/><q direct="unspecified">For instance, (<ref n="page 53">p. 53</ref>,) if a person pretends to bring a revelation from heaven that directly recommends and encourages intemperance, injustice, and cruelty, and such like notorious and hurtful immoralities, I cannot see how any common man, who makes the least use of that understanding which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> hath given him, can be imposed upon to embrace a scheme so destructive of the plainest obligations of virtue, and of the peace and happiness of the world, by <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> miracles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/>He has it in his power easily to detect the falsehood of all such doctrines, how pompously so ever they are supported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/>From what has been said, it appears that miracles alone do not prove the truth of any religion, because we cannot pretend to say of any miraculous effects, at least not of most of the miracles which are recorded in the <rs>Old</rs> and New Testaments, that they are performed by <name n="God" type="God">God</name> only.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/></p> 
<p>To all this it seems enough to reply, that if absurd suppositions are made, it cannot be wondered at, that absurd conclusions should follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>We deny, not only that the case here supposed ever did happen, but that it ever could happen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>It is a supposition inconsistent with the views we cannot but form of the infinite wisdom which directs the moral government of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>In fact, we have no ground, either from reason or revelation, to suppose that superior created beings are empowered, at their own discretion, to take any part in the affairs of this earth, or in any manner to influence the condition or conduct of mankind, still less to alter or controul the ordinary course of events, so as to produce effects <pb id="p.181" n="181"/> apparently miraculous, for the purpose of deluding us by a false show of divine revelation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>It may be said, that none but an evil and wicked spirit would avail himself of such a power to give a delusive sanction to erroneous and pernicious principles; and therefore the internal evidence, the intrinsic excellence of the system itself, as estimated by our own understandings, is conclusive proof of the reality of the miracle, and, consequently, of the divine authority of the message.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>But may it not be supposed that good spirits, like some well-meaning but mistaken men, may seek to deceive us with a <q direct="unspecified">pious fraud,</q> in support of a system which, though without foundation, the wise and good might wish to be true?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>The concession, therefore, is a most dangerous <num value="1">one</num>; but, happily, neither the history of the world, nor the appearance of things around us, affords the smallest countenance to such a supposition, which is, besides, contradicted by the views that both nature and reason encourage us to form of the agency of the <num value="1">One</num> Supreme, as bringing about, by its direct and immediate operation, the various phenomena which we behold.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>In the succeeding chapter, the author vindicates the conduct of <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name>, in not making the <rs>Christian</rs> revelation universally known; shewing that this is conformable to what we see around us in the various distribution of the other gifts of his bounty; and, consequently, that any objection to revelation, proceeding upon this ground, would prove too much, since it applies equally to those advantages and benefits which the votary of natural religion, if he believes in a providence at all, cannot but ascribe to its agency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>In the <pb id="p.182" n="182"/> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> chapter he examines more particularly the external evidence of revelation, <q direct="unspecified">shewing that we have a sufficient probability, even at this distance, of the authenticness, credibility, and purity of the books of the New Testament; and that the common people are able to judge of the truth and uncorruptedness of a traditional religion; with an answer to the arguments drawn from the change of languages, the different use of words, the style and phrase of scripture, &amp;c., to prove it to be an obscure, perplexed, and uncertain rule.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/>The work concludes with a vindication of positive institutions; particularly of the few and simple positive ordinances of the <name>Gospel</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>In various parts of the work we have an able exposure of the manner in which sceptical writers are apt to confound the corruptions of Christianity with Christianity itself,&mdash;an artifice for which the unhappy differences among Christians, and the multitudes of unauthorized additions, commandments of men, often foreign to the spirit and inconsistent with the tendency and design of the <name>Gospel</name>, have at all times afforded but too much scope.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>On the whole, this treatise is written with great clearness of thought and expression, and reflects much credit on the abilities and ingenuity of the author.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/>It met with such general approbation from the judicious and candid of all parties, that repeated impressions were soon demanded by the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>Even <persName n="Tindal,Doctor,,,," id="n0300.0008.00182.00567" reg="mostcommon:Tindal,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Tindal</surname></persName>, against whose work it was written, is said always to have spoken of of it with great respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>In <num value="1">one</num> particular it certainly well deserves to be held up as a model for controversial treatises; that its attack is <pb id="p.183" n="183"/> confined altogether to the doctrine and arguments of his opponent, and these are examined with fairness and candour, without any attempt to prejudice the reader, or to resort to any of those artifices by which the disputants, not for truth but for victory, or for something more sordid and unworthy still, too commonly seek to divert the attention from the main question, and make the worse appear the better cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/>As, on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, he utterly disclaims and repudiates the dubious alliance of the <rs type="role" reg="civil-Magistrate">civil magistrate</rs>, as rather weakening than promoting the cause it aims to support, in the estimation of the candid and reflecting, so, on the other, he makes no attempt to depreciate the character, or diminish the influence of his antagonist by injurious imputations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>We cannot but be persuaded, that if the votaries of the truth had always shewn the same well-grounded confidence in the intrinsic strength of their cause, so as to disclaim the use of such unhallowed weapons, the interests of religion and virtue would have been greatly promoted, and many apparent and temporary triumphs to infidelity,&mdash;triumphs due not to its own evidence or the ability of its advocates, but to the skill with which they have taken advantage of the short-sighted policy of the friends of revelation,&mdash;would have been altogether prevented.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/>In <dateStruct value="1734--"><year reg="1734">1734</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Foster,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0008.00183.00568" reg="nearbymention:Foster,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Foster</surname></persName> published a volume of sermons, which speedily attracted a degree of attention proportioned to that which they had received when delivered from the pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1105"/><num value="3">Three</num> additional volumes made their appearance successively,&mdash;the last in <dateStruct value="1744--"><year reg="1744">1744</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>These sermons certainly possess very considerable merit; but it <pb id="p.184" n="184"/> is not exactly the kind of merit which the traditionary accounts of the extraordinary popularity of their author, as a preacher, and the crowds of all ranks and classes who are said to have flocked to hear him, and that not for a short time, or on a few occasions only, but through a period of more than <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>, would have led us to anticipate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/>For it would be difficult to select from the whole range of <name>English</name> pulpit eloquence any compositions which indicated less solicitude in the author to please the ear of the multitude, or to aim at the showy but inferior character of the mere <q direct="unspecified">popular preacher.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>They are mostly plain and practical,&mdash;serious and augmentative&mdash;evangelical in the best and only proper sense of the word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/>They are well fitted to illustrate the remark which has frequently been made, that the real vital faith of Christians is, in a great measure, <num value="1">one</num> and the same; depending not on sectarian peculiarities,&mdash;not on those points which have been chiefly the subjects of controversy and debate, but on the broad and comprehensive truths relating to the perfections and providence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, the heavenly message of the gospel of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0008.00184.00569" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, and the duties and expectations of men as founded upon it, which are at once of primary importance, and so simple in their character and clear in their evidence, that they are held alike by all sects, and have never been the subjects of dispute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/>But the consequence is, as we might naturally conclude from our author's rational good sense and sincerity, that there is throughout a complete absence of what prevailing parties have been accustomed to call the <hi rend="italics">peculiar doctrines</hi> of the <name>Gospel</name>; and wherever there is a passing reference to <pb id="p.185" n="185"/> such distinctions, it is of a kind which might be expected immediately to alarm the prejudices of the self-styled orthodox.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1111"/>Again, the style of composition, though uniformly correct, and often what we might call elegant, presents surprisingly little of what would commonly be called oratory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1112"/>It is for the most part, perfectly plain and simple, with no rhetorical ornaments or flights of declamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>It is calm reasoning, addressed almost exclusively to the understanding, in no instance seeking to rouse the passions, and with comparatively few attempts even to appeal to the imagination or interest the feelings.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>These sermons are favourable specimens of what has sometimes been called the <hi rend="italics">middle style</hi> is compositions of this sort; they rarely, if ever, aim at the higher flights of genius; and would, probably, be pronounced, for the most part, better fitted for the press than for the pulpit;&mdash;more likely to prove acceptable in the calm sobriety of the closet, than when addressed to the public congregation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1115"/>It is true, that with the outward graces of an orator, <persName n="Foster,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0008.00185.00570" reg="nearbymention:Foster,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Foster</surname></persName> appears, by the reports of his contemporaries, to have been endowed in a high degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1116"/><q direct="unspecified">His voice,</q> says <num value="1">one</num>, <q direct="unspecified">was naturally sweet, strong, distinct, harmonious; always adapted to his matter, always varied as his method changed, as expressive of the sense as the most judicious recitative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1117"/>Monotony was a fault he was never guilty of. His action, the soul of eloquence, was grave, expressive, free from distortion, animated without being theatrical;&mdash;in short, such as became the pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1118"/>He reminded us of <placeName key="tgn,7013947" n="1.000 10" reg="saint paul, ramsey, minnesota">St. Paul</placeName>, at <placeName reg="Athinai, Perifereia Protevousis, Ellas" key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>, arresting the attention of his auditors.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1119"/>But to say nothing of the unpopularity <pb id="p.186" n="186"/> of his theology, it may be doubted whether a preacher who had so little either of matter or of style to please the fancy, to excite the passions, or influence any of the warmer emotions of the soul, let his external accomplishments of action and manner be what they might, would <hi rend="italics">now</hi> succeed, year after year, in drawing together a crowded auditory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1120"/>In short, whether the changes in the habits and tastes of the present age, as compared with those of our ancestors a century ago, be in all respects an improvement, we will not undertake to determine; but we cannot help thinking, that a congregation, even among Unitsrians, who are generally supposed to be accustomed to a more subdued and merely argumentative style of preaching than most other denominations, if statedly addressed in the style of <persName n="Foster,,,,," id="n0300.0008.00186.00571" reg="nearbymention:Foster,James,,,"><surname>Foster</surname></persName>'s sermons, would be sensible of a deficiency in what is commonly called <hi rend="italics">unction</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1121"/>Though <persName n="Foster,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0008.00186.00572" reg="nearbymention:Foster,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Foster</surname></persName> did not frequently deal in what is styled doctrinal, still less in controversial, preaching, which would probably have been little suited to so miscellaneous an audience as he usually addressed, yet he betrays no desire to keep unpopular notions in the shade; there is no unworthy attempt, by the use of ambiguous phrase to pass off on the unthinking crowd the shadow of pretended orthodoxy, as if it were the substance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1122"/>And, in several instances, he does not hesitate to take very decided ground on important controverted points of doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1123"/>Of this we have remarkable examples in his celebrated sermons on Mysteries, and on Heresy and Schism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1124"/>A mystery, in the scripture sense, he explains to be a fact or doctrine which was revolting to human <pb id="p.187" n="187"/> prejudices, or not easy to be discovered by human reason, but which, now that it is made known, is perfectly distinct and intelligible; while the belief of propositions which are <hi rend="italics">still</hi> mysterious, that is, to the terms of which we attach no ideas, is in its own nature, impossible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1125"/>In this sermon is introduced the often-quoted maxim, <q direct="unspecified">Where mystery begins religion ends;</q><note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1127"/>The extract itself is remarkable, as exemplifying the vacillating, inconsistent state of mind which many unbelievers betray,&mdash;often from the influence of early habits of thought and feeling, the results of a religious education, but sometimes, perhaps, from a lingering regard to, and value for, the discoveries and benefits of the <name>Gospel</name>, of which, at times, they cannot divest themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1130"/>The aphorism pleased me much; and I was glad to hear such a truth from any pulpit, since it shews an inclination at least to purify Christianity from the leaves of artificial theology, which consists principally in making things that are plain mysterious, and in pretending to make things that are impenetrably mysterious very plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1138"/>The sermon on Heresy involved our author in a lengthened controversy with <num value="1">one</num> of the most noted polemics of the day, <persName n="Stebbing,Doctor,,,," id="n0300.0008.00188.00581" reg="mostcommon:Stebbing,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Stebbing</surname></persName>, <rs type="role2">Chaplain</rs> to <name n="his Majesty" type="role">his Majesty</name>, and Preacher at <placeName reg="Gray's Inn">Gray's Inn</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1139"/>The text is <persName><foreName>Titus</foreName> <genName n="3">III</genName></persName>. <num value="10">10</num>, <num value="11">11</num>, <q direct="unspecified">A man that is a heretic, after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> admonition, reject; knowing that he that is such is subverted and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1140"/>The term heretic, which occurs here only in the New Testament, denotes, according to our author, <num value="1">one</num> that sets up to be head, or <hi rend="italics">chooses</hi> to join himself to a particular religious party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1141"/>When used, therefore, in a bad sense, a heretic must be <num value="1">one</num> who <hi rend="italics">knowingly</hi> espouses a false doctrine,&mdash;is insincere in his profession, and asserts and defends what he is convinced is contrary to Christianity, and, consequently, <num value="1">one</num> who maintains and supports the interest of a faction to serve some base designs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1142"/>Hence it follows that no mere error of judgment can be heresy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1143"/>Secondly, That no honest man can be a heretic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1144"/>Thirdly, That in most cases it is an unwarrantable presumption in those who are not endowed with the gift of discerning spirits to pronounce upon those who differ from them, that they are, in the obnoxious sense of the word, hether <pb id="p.189" n="189"/> point not brought prominently forward by either party, in which consists the real root of bitterness in the whole dispute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1145"/><persName n="Stebbing,Doctor,,,," id="n0300.0008.00189.00582" reg="mostcommon:Stebbing,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Stebbing</surname></persName>'s argument does not go to vindicate excommunication for heresy, as practised by the <rs>English</rs> and other established churches, still less the civil disabilities, and other evils of a secular nature, which have been, and still are, to a certain extent, attached to it; all which, though somewhat inconsistently, he distinctly disclaims, He only contends, that every church, (meaning, we presume, according to the definition in the article, <q direct="unspecified">a congregation of faithful men, assembled for the worship of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and professing faith in our <persName n="Christ,Lord,Jesus,,," id="n0300.0008.00189.00583" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName>,</q>) in order to act up to the spirit of the apostle's injunction, <hi rend="italics">must</hi> exclude from its communion those whom <hi rend="italics">it believes</hi> to be in pernicious error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1146"/>As he does not assert for himself or his church the attribute of infallibility, it necessarily follows from hence, and, in fact, he concedes as much of his own accord, that the character of a heretic, as thus determined, is not absolute, but merely relative; <q direct="unspecified">a man may be a heretic to <num value="1">one</num> church who is not so to another, and a heretic to both, who is not so to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1147"/>After this concession, it is difficult to see what there is left between the parties which is worth a debate, unless it arise from considerations purely extraneous, namely, from the political and other worldly inconveniences now attached to the imputation of heresy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1148"/>If a (so called) <orgName n="Christian Church" type="church">Christian church</orgName> were <hi rend="italics">in reality</hi> nothing more than what we have just defined it to be,&mdash;if no communities of any kind existed in the <orgName n="Christian world" type="newspaper">Christian world</orgName> but <q direct="unspecified">congregations of faithful men,</q> united in such <pb id="p.190" n="190"/> retics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1149"/>And, lastly, that the persons who come nearest to the character of heretics, as described by the apostle, are the violent party men who confine Christianity to their own faction, and excommunicate all who differ from them; the rigid imposers of human schemes of doctrine and modes of worship, as essential branches of religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1150"/>If it be said that such heretics as are to be rejected may be known by their fruits in the vicious lives they commonly lead, or in their attempts to sow division and excite jealousy and strife, it may be answered, that in that case it were better that they should be rejected for their immorality, which is open and clear, than for their heresy, of which we cannot so readily judge.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1151"/><persName n="Stebbing,Doctor,,,," id="n0300.0008.00190.00584" reg="mostcommon:Stebbing,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Stebbing</surname></persName>'s tracts in this controversy, especially his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> letter, have quite a sufficient seasoning of supercilious dogmatism, and are replied to by <persName n="Foster,,,,," id="n0300.0008.00190.00585" reg="nearbymention:Foster,James,,,"><surname>Foster</surname></persName> with spirit and acuteness, and, on the whole, with success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1152"/>But it may be doubted whether a preliminary question has not been overlooked by both parties; how far the apostle's precept was meant to have any general reference whatever beyond the case to which it was immediately applied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1153"/>The heretic, or fomenter of divisions, whom <persName n="Titus,,,,," id="n0300.0008.00190.00586" reg="mostcommon:Titus,nomatch:0"><surname>Titus</surname></persName> was to reject, was evidently the <name>Judaizing</name> teacher, who, in opposition to the authority of the apostle, insisted on imposing the ritual law on the <name>Gentile</name> converts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1154"/>Here was a case which, from its nature, admitted of no difficulty or dispute; but when, without being authorized to do so, we attempt to extend the precept into a general rule for the conduct of the church in all ages, we are immediately at a loss in the practical application of it. There is anonumbers <pb id="p.191" n="191"/> as were convenient for the purpose of public worship,&mdash;there seems no reason why they might not be left to settle their internal constitution in any way they pleased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1155"/>But when a multitude of such churches are banded together into <num value="1">one</num> great body or sect, either as <hi rend="italics">established</hi> under the auspices of the state, invested by its authority with rich endowments, political privileges, and a power of interfering with the social rights of their fellow Christians, or as combined on some plan of association, more or less voluntary, into a regularly organized community, whose members seek to exercise lordship over each other, or to engage with other similar bodies in the struggles for sectarian preponderance, the case is wholly altered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1156"/>The act of exclusion now assumes a new character, because it affects the political rights, the secular interests, or the social position of the excluded party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1157"/>In such a case it is idle to talk of heresy as being determined by the act of a body so constituted, or of rendering the individual affected by it a heretic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1158"/>The heresy is <hi rend="italics">within them</hi>;&mdash;it forms an essential part of their own constitution;&mdash;it is <hi rend="italics">they</hi> who are the true heretics, in exact proportion to the degree in which they suffer themselves to be influenced by that evil spirit of sectarianism, which is the bane of the present plan of religious association, and utterly adverse to <name>Christian</name> charity and brotherhood.</p>

<p>In the following year was published the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volume, in 4to, of <q direct="unspecified">Discourses on all the <rs type="place">Principal Branches</rs> of Natural Religion and Social Virtue.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1183"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> volume appeared in <dateStruct value="1752--"><year reg="1752">1752</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1184"/>This is a work of unequal merit, but, on the whole, of great interest and value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1185"/>The parts which are, perhaps, most liable to exception, are those chapters of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volume, in which he treats of what are commonly called, by way of distinction, the <hi rend="italics">natural</hi> attributes of the <rs>Divine Nature</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1186"/>Abstract reasoning was, probably, not the writer's <hi rend="italics">forte;</hi> and in this difficult and abstruse part of his subject, he has involved himself in various metaphysical difficulties, which have led him to adopt startling and untenable conclusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1187"/>Among these must be ranked his representation of the actions of rational and voluntary agents, as things <hi rend="italics">absolutely</hi> contingent; whence he is led to deny the prescience, and, consequently, the omniscience of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in its application <pb id="p.196" n="196"/> to the most important objects of the <rs>Divine Government</rs>, for whose sake alone it is of any importance to us to acknowledge a Providence at all,&mdash;namely, the actions, and future condition as dependent upon them, of intelligent and moral creatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1188"/>The view of the <hi rend="italics">moral</hi> attributes is much superior;&mdash;the chapter on the mercy or placability of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, in particular, contains as distinct and satisfactory a view of the argument on this most interesting question as is any where to be met with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1189"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> volume is chiefly occupied with a view of the various departments of human duty, as arising out of the different relations of the social state, and, without containing much that is new or original, which, perhaps, was hardly to be expected from the nature of the subject, is most remarkable for sound good sense, plainly and perspicuously stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1190"/>The offices of devotion, at the end of the volume, afford an interesting and pleasing indication of the devotional character of the writer's mind, and of the extent to which he was accustomed to carry that most desirable habit of converting every train of thought or study in which he was engaged into a subject and occasion of devout meditation and communion with his Maker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1191"/>Considered in the character for which they appear to have been intended, as forms for social worship, they are, perhaps, sometimes too long, and dwell with too great diffuseness and prolixity on particular topics; but as serious and solemn meditations on some of the most important subjects on which the human faculties can be engaged, thrown into the impressive form of a direct address to Him who gave us these faculties to be <pb id="p.197" n="197"/> so exercised on thoughts and inquiries most truly worthy of them, they well deserve to be not only read, but carefully studied.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1192"/><num value="1">One</num> blot which deforms this part of the work we would gladly efface,&mdash;an invocation of the <name>Divine</name> displeasure against the <orgName n="Rome Church" type="church">Church of Rome</orgName>, conceived in terms hardly consistent with the spirit of the <name>Gospel</name> of peace, especially against those whom he was bound, in conformity with his own most just and liberal principles, to receive as fellow-disciples and fellow-Christians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1193"/>In passing judgment, however, on this, and some other passages of a like character which are found in his writings, we must remember that <persName n="Foster,,,,," id="n0300.0008.00197.00605" reg="nearbymention:Foster,Jacobum,,,"><surname>Foster</surname></persName> lived a <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure> nearer than ourselves to the time when Popery was, not without reason, the grand object of alarm and dread to all lovers of civil and religious liberty, and make allowance for the prevailing spirit of the age, of which, though such spirits as his might be expected to take the lead, they could not always escape the influence.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1221"/>The question of predestination, in particular, appeared to require a careful settlement in the first place, not only in order that he might govern his own conduct accordingly, but because it appeared to him scarcely reasonable to address the motives of religion, and the language of exhortation and instruction, to those who were chained down to <num value="1">one</num> course of action by an irreversible decree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1241"/>Wherever any form of Christianity has been established by the interference and patronage of the civil power, we have commonly seen too clear indications of the disposition to assume unholy dominion, and to lord it over the consciences of men, which is here characterized under the figurative expression of <q direct="unspecified">the man of sin.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1242"/>The spirit of intolerance and persecution was little less conspicuous in the ranks of the reformers than among the adherents of the <rs type="place">Romish church</rs>, and led to the same dreadfull excesses and flagrant violations of the law of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0009.00206.00628" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, in a narrower sphere and to a less extent, only because their power and their opportunities of exercising it were more limited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1251"/>Our author's account of the inspiration of the scriptures, (at least of the <rs>Christian</rs> scriptures,) coincides nearly with that afterwards advanced by <persName n="Michaelis,,,,," id="n0300.0009.00208.00634" reg="nearbymention:Michaelis,J.,D.,,"><surname>Michaelis</surname></persName> in his Introduction to the New Testament; assuming that the apostles, and they alone, were so far furnished with a full and complete scheme of what they were to teach concerning the <rs>Christian</rs> doctrine, as to be empowered to authenticate any writing, or give it a title to rank as canonical <name>Christian</name> scripture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1252"/>If this be the proper criterion of an inspired writing, it becomes necessary, in order to establish the authority of <num value="2">two</num> of the <name>Gospels</name>, to assume that Mark gives, in fact, the testimony of <placeName key="tgn,2055458" n="1.000 3" reg="saint peter, nicollet, minnesota">St. Peter</placeName>, with whom he is understood to have been chiefly connected, and that <persName n="Luke,,,,," id="n0300.0009.00208.00635" reg="mostcommon:Luke,nomatch:0"><surname>Luke</surname></persName>'s narrative is confirmed by the apostolic authority of <placeName key="tgn,7013947" n="1.000 10" reg="saint paul, ramsey, minnesota">St. Paul</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1253"/>These assumptions may by some be thought somewhat arbitrary and gratuitous; and it may not appear very obvious why it should be considered necessary to seek for any other authority, in the <name>Gospel</name> of <persName n="Luke,,,,," id="n0300.0009.00208.00636" reg="mostcommon:Luke,nomatch:0"><surname>Luke</surname></persName> for example, than that to which he himself lays claim, when he tells us, that <q direct="unspecified">it seemed good to him also, having traced every thing from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> exactly, to set forth in order a narrative, that his friend might know the truth of those things wherein he had been instructed.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1254"/>Our author's good sense, at the same time, shews him the folly of ascribing divine inspiration to every passing remark or illustration which occurs <pb id="p.209" n="209"/> in the epistles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1255"/>It is enough if we receive the great truths and facts on which the <rs>Christian</rs> system is raised in reliance on their testimony, and the doctrines or conclusions which they professedly teach on apostolic authority, without attempting to ascribe to inspiration that which any man might as well say or do without it. With respect to the abolition of the ceremonial law, his opinion is, that while the <rs>Jewish Christians</rs>, like all others, remained universally and every where bound by the <hi rend="italics">moral</hi> law, those resident in <placeName key="tgn,7001407" n="1.000 10" reg="Judaea,Yisra'el,Asia">Judaea</placeName>, and they <hi rend="italics">only</hi>, were bound by the political or judicial part of the <name>Mosaic</name> law, which was, in fact, a part of the civil constitution of the state to which they belonged; but that from the <hi rend="italics">ritual</hi> part, whether at home or abroad, they were <hi rend="italics">de jure</hi> absolved, immediately upon their embracing Christianity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1256"/>If, nevertheless, they continued to observe it, this was partly owing to the influence of their own prejudices, <q direct="unspecified">zealous for the law,</q> and strongly attached to the religious peculiarities of their nation, and partly to a desire not unnecessarily to offend the prejudices of others, which might occasionally lead them with <placeName key="tgn,7013947" n="1.000 10" reg="saint paul, ramsey, minnesota">St. Paul</placeName>, in things not sinful, to become all things to all men, that by any means they might gain some.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1272"/></p> 
<p>If I had believed Christianity to be false, no worldly considerations whatever could have induced me to have wrote so much to make the world believe that it is true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1273"/>And if it be true, it is not an indifferent matter whether men receive or reject it. As for my own part, I have studied the books of Scripture, and more especially the New Testament, for above <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>. From thence I have taken my notions of Christianity, and of the evidence of it. I have read the objections of the infidels, and have found that their acquaintance with the <name>Scriptures</name> is but very superficial; that they have no steady principles of their own; and that their design is to pull down Christianity, without giving the world any other scheme of religion or morals instead of it. I am, indeed, convinced <pb id="p.212" n="212"/> that the anti-revelationists are, in general, unfair writers, and have no good views; yet I am very thankful that this controversy has broke out and been carried on to such a length in my time; because I should otherwise never have seen the objections placed in so strong a light, nor cleared up so fully, and to such rational satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1274"/>I should never have understood my Bible so well; never have seen the arguments for the divine original of it placed in such a variety of views; nor have apprehended the evidences to have been so very strong, extensive, and numerous.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1275"/>I have with great pleasure observed, that many things against which the enemies of Revelation have objected, have, upon a more narrow inspection, turned out beauties instead of blemishes, and arguments in favour of Christianity instead of objections against it. And I am not without hope, that the writers who have of late so openly and in such great numbers appeared against revelation, are paving the way for a more general and extensive spread of it. For if Christians of different denominations would but give up what they cannot rationally defend, and return to the <name>Scriptures</name> as the sole standard of revealed religion, then would Christianity, pure uncorrupted Christianity, appear in its genuine simplicity and native excellence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1276"/>Jews, Heathens, and Mahometans, would be struck with the amiable nature and abundant evidence of it, and well-minded Deists be induced to admire and embrace it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1277"/>After repeated examination, I am persuaded that the <rs>Christian</rs> religion, as it lies uncorrupted in the <name>Scriptures</name>, is of divine original.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1278"/>And the <pb id="p.213" n="213"/> more I have examined into the nature and evidence of it, the more I am convinced of the divine mission of <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> and of the truth of the <name>Gospel</name>.</p></quote> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1516"/>In the discharge of this duty he preached some sermons on the confirmation which miracles give to the divine mission of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0011.00252.00807" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> and the truth of his religion; and vindicated the argument against the objections advanced by <persName n="Collins,,,,," id="n0300.0011.00252.00808" reg="mostcommon:Collins,Anthony,,,:1"><surname>Collins</surname></persName> in his <q direct="unspecified">Discourse on the <rs type="place">Grounds</rs> and Reasons of the <rs>Christian Religion</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1518"/>This is a work of very considerable merit and value, and deserves to be studied by those who wish to obtain a full understanding of the controversy between the <orgName n="Christian Advocate" type="newspaper">Christian advocate</orgName> and the unbeliever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1519"/><persName n="Chandler,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0011.00253.00809" reg="nearbymention:Chandler,H.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chandler</surname></persName>'s view of the nature and use of miracles, as stated in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> part of this treatise, is on the whole good and judicious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1520"/>After defining a miracle to be <q direct="unspecified">a work visibly performed by any being, that is really and truly above his natural power and capacity, without the assistance of some superior agent,</q> he argues that the performance of such works in support of the authority of a teacher, sent to make known to mankind a dispensation consistent with the views which our reason acknowledges of the perfections of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the character of the divine moral administration, is probable in itself, and a fit subject of belief, when accredited by the same testimony on which we receive other historical facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1521"/>The folly of the demand to <hi rend="italics">see</hi> a miracle, in order to be convinced, or the notion that miracles as such are not capable of being attested like other appearances and events, is well and ably exposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1522"/>Still he contends that they derive a great part of their own credibility, and consequently of the authority which they can communicate to any message professing to be divine, from the excellence and reasonableness of this message, in itself considered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1523"/>The assurances of divine grace and mercy as made known in the <name>Gospel</name>, the terms on which they are granted, and the expectations held out in a future life, <hi rend="italics">when published</hi>, are such as approve themselves to our understandings as right and good; but it does not, therefore, follow <pb id="p.254" n="254"/> that these expectations are well-founded, unless some proof can be afforded that they were published by a messenger sent from <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and duly authorized for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1524"/>On the other hand, no miracles whatever, either seen or attested, could authorize our assent to a doctrine or message inconsistent with just and rational views of the divine attributes, or with other equally express declarations of the divine will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1525"/><q direct="unspecified">The proper design of every revelation that is really from <name n="God" type="God">God</name> must be this,&mdash;to lead men into just and becoming sentiments of the <name>Divine</name> being and perfections; to direct and appoint that method of worship which will be acceptable to himself; to recover men from their ignorance, to reform them from their vices, and to lead them into the practice of virtue and true goodness by proper motives and arguments; for the general welfare of societies, for every man's particular happiness in this life, and preparation for a better world hereafter.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1526"/>Such a design as this seems to be worthy of the allwise and merciful Governor of the world, and what we may expect from him who knows our infirmities and wishes our happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1527"/>And therefore, whenever the circumstances of mankind become such as to need a particular interposition of his providence for this end, there is nothing ill reason that forbids us to expect it, nor any thing in the nature of the case itself which should hinder him from granting it. But unless miracles are calculated to serve this end, they ought never to be acknowledged as any proof of a divine mission; because we may certainly conclude that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> never will interpose in any case where there is no need, or to bring about a design unworthy <pb id="p.255" n="255"/> of himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1528"/><q direct="unspecified">It may here possibly be asked, Is this good reasoning, to prove the miracles to be wrought by <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, by appealing to the doctrines or end for which they are wrought; and then to prove the doctrines or justify the end by an appeal to the miracles?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/>I answer, that the very doing of the miracle argues the interposition or assistance of some superior agent; and that the end for which such a miracle is done evidently discovers the nature of that being by whose influence it is performed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1530"/>The doctrines prove, not the existence of a superior power, but whether the assistance be given by a good or a bad power;&mdash; the miracles prove, not the goodness of the doctrines, but that he who preaches the doctrines so confirmed acts by an authority superior to his own. They neither of them separately prove the divine mission; but where they both concur, they certainly prove this proposition,&mdash;that such a person acts by the authority of some superior, good, and powerful being; or, in other words, that his mission is agreeable to the will of the <rs>Supreme</rs>; and therefore, in order to such proof, they ought both to concur.</q>&mdash;<ref n="page 95">P. 95</ref>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1531"/>This argument is just in itself, and well and forcibly stated; but it may be doubted whether the author has not considerably weakened its effect by the concession that works properly miraculous, as far as human agents are concerned, may be performed by the intervention of other subordinate spirits, either good or bad. It is a concession apparently inconsistent with many express declarations of Scripture; it renders the <hi rend="italics">criterion</hi> of a genuine divine miracle, such as may be received for a sufficient test of the authority of a <pb id="p.256" n="256"/> teacher or prophet professing to come from <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, more complicated, difficult, and uncertain, and checks the confidence with which we are disposed to yield our assent to his declarations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1532"/>In the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> part of this work, in reply to <persName n="Collins,,,,," id="n0300.0011.00256.00810" reg="mostcommon:Collins,Anthony,,,:1"><surname>Collins</surname></persName>'s argument, founded on the difficulty or impossibility of applying to the <name>Messiah</name> many of the Old Testament prophecies, when literally interpreted, he shews that, even if this were admitted, the other proofs of the divine authority of the <name>Gospel</name> scheme would remain unaffected; that these prophecies were not urged by <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0011.00256.00811" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> and his apostles as the sole proof of Christianity; that the difficulty, admitting it to exist, of applying to <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0011.00256.00812" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> many of the passages supposed to be cited as prophecies, does not by any means attach to all the passages so cited, many of which are referrible to the <name>Messiah</name> and to him only; and that others, which undoubtedly refer in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance to the return from the captivity or other shortly impending event in the <name>Jewish</name> history, may also have a general or mystical reference to that great event in which the whole scheme of the <name>Jewish</name> dispensation was consummated and brought to a close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1533"/>These grounds of argument are ably urged and illustrated; though there is good reason to think that the author has built on them a heavier superstructure than they will bear, and has extended his conclusion beyond what the facts of the case will fairly warrant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/>But the work in general shews great acuteness and learning, and is written with a degree of candour and moderation highly creditable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/>Indeed, there is good reason to think that he and the other able writers among the rational dissenters, who at this <pb id="p.257" n="257"/> period came forward in defence of revelation, by the frankness with which, in the midst of their zealous defence of their own principles, they with equal zeal vindicated the right of others to take the opposite side, and to bring forward whatever arguments appeared to them to be fitted to promote their cause, were mainly instrumental in diffusing more liberal notions of the true grounds on which all such questions should be discussed, by leaving them to be debated on their own merits, without seeking for the unauthorized interference of the <rs type="role" reg="civil-Magistrate">civil magistrate</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/>Soon after the publication of this work in the year <dateStruct value="1726--"><year reg="1726">1726</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Chandler,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0011.00257.00813" reg="nearbymention:Chandler,H.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chandler</surname></persName> received an invitation to settle, as minister, with the <rs>Presbyterian</rs> congregation in the Old Jewry, <num value="1">one</num> of the most respectable societies among the <name>Dissenters</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/>Here he continued, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> as assistant, and afterwards as pastor, for the space of <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure>; and discharged the duties of the ministerial office with great assiduity and ability, being much esteemed and regarded by his own congregation, and acquiring a distinguished reputation both as a preacher and a writer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>That he was a powerful and popular preacher, much followed and highly estimated in that as in every other capacity connected with his station as a Christian minister, is evident from the frequency of the calls upon him to preach for public institutions, before public bodies and societies, and on other remarkable or extraordinary occasions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>His published sermons, however, are distinguished for a strength and clearness of argument addressed to the thinking part of his audience, rather than for any peculiarly <pb id="p.258" n="258"/> ornamental style or flowers of eloquence to captivate the multitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>They shew him, in common indeed with his other publications, to have been, in theological sentiment, an Arian of nearly the same school with <persName n="Peirce,,,,," id="n0300.0011.00258.00814" reg="mostcommon:Peirce,James,,,:5"><surname>Peirce</surname></persName>, <persName n="Benson,,,,," id="n0300.0011.00258.00815" reg="mostcommon:Benson,George,,,:3"><surname>Benson</surname></persName>, and other distinguished ministers of that day in the <rs>Presbyterian</rs> denomination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1541"/>But he does not appear to have taken any public part in the <name>Trinitarian</name> controversy, which, in fact, was not brought very prominently forward during the greater part of his active life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1542"/>The most remarkable of <persName n="Chandler,,,,," id="n0300.0011.00258.00816" reg="nearbymention:Chandler,H.,,,"><surname>Chandler</surname></persName>'s controversial writings are his replies to some of the leading Freethinkers of his day, particularly <persName n="Collins,,,,," id="n0300.0011.00258.00817" reg="mostcommon:Collins,Anthony,,,:1"><surname>Collins</surname></persName> and <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n0300.0011.00258.00818" reg="nearbymention:Morgan,Thomas,,,"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/>His publications in this controversy are numerous and important; shewing not merely a thorough acquaintance with the subject, but a power of reasoning, and a clearness and force of statement, which rendered him a very formidable opponent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1544"/>Though not in general displaying in any offensive form the asperity from which so few writers on controversial theology are free, nor disgraced by the unworthy personalities too often substituted in the place of argument, they are frequently remarkable for a keenness of sarcasm, and an authoritative uncompromising dogmatism, proceeding from a consciousness of his own superiority, which he is at no pains to conceal.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1549"/>Under the influence of this feeling he published, in <dateStruct value="1731--"><year reg="1731">1731</year></dateStruct>, in <num value="2">two</num> volumes, 4to, a translation of <q direct="unspecified">The History of the <name>Inquisition</name>, by <persName><foreName>Philip</foreName></persName> a Limborch;</q> to which he prefixed a large Introduction, <q direct="unspecified">concerning the rise and progress of persecution, and the real and pretended causes of it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1560"/>This is a treatise of considerable merit and authority, <pb id="p.261" n="261"/> and was favourably received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1562"/>Our author was so struck by the importance of this suggestion, that he laid aside his unfinished design until he should have the opportunity of renewing the study of the <name>Hebrew</name> language on this plan; an undertaking which he was unfortunately prevented by other engagements from carrying into effect.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1582"/>In this reply, though it was in vain to attempt to palliate or conceal some of the more flagrant and well-known blots in the character and conduct of <persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName>, yet he shewed that many of the charges brought against him were grossly exaggerated, others altogether unfounded, or brought forward in ignorance or disregard of the manners and condition of the people, and the state of society <pb id="p.265" n="265"/> in which he lived; all which should be taken into the account in forming an estimate of the character of a person who lived in a remote age and nation, and under circumstances widely different from any which at present exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1686"/>The frank and open declaration of these sentiments in the terms which have just been quoted well illustrate the character of the man; and it is also a valuable record, as indicating the views on this subject entertained and acted on at this period by several of the most influential men of the denomination to which by this act he attached himself, and who by taking a part in his formal reception into their body not only gave him the right hand of fellowship, but virtually, if not openly, disclaimed all pretensions to sift his creed, or to demand pledges and confessions from future candidates for ordination.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1687"/>It may, however, be doubted, whether the freedom thus exercised was in all respects acceptable to some of those who had invited him to be their minister, and in whom the old leaven of Presbyterianism, as it had existed a century before in all its rigour, may not yet have been altogether worked out. They may, perhaps, have been startled at the entire overthrow of the barriers against the intrusion of unsound teachers, established by ancient institutions, of which only the shadow or the name was now retained, and also at the liberty asserted by their new minister, <pb id="p.284" n="284"/> not only of preaching whatever doctrines he then thought right, but of changing those doctrines from time to time, as further inquiries opened to him new views of scripture truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1688"/>It is certain that the freedom of his sentiments, and the unreserved manner in which he was accustomed to express them, soon alarmed some of the more timid, and offended the bigoted; and the consequence seems to have been, that, though he possessed talents which, under other circumstances, would have made him a popular preacher, his congregation was diminished, and the income he derived from it became scarcely adequate to the maintenance of his family.

<p>These and similar expressions, though to some they may appear to savour of a visionary enthusiasm, are yet surely based on the principles of a genuine <name>Christian</name> philosophy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1701"/>The belief in a general <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, governing the world by uniform laws, is not inconsistent with the notion of a particular <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, which regards not only general results, but the condition, present and future, of each individual, and the adaptation of every event that occurs to promote the interests of each and of all as being subject to the express direction and controul of the <num value="1">one</num> Supreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1702"/>The inconsistency arises only when we suffer ourselves to be so far misled by views derived from the unavoidable imperfections of human power and knowledge, and hastily transferred to our conceptions of the <name>Divine</name> government, as to suppose that He who sees the end from the beginning, <pb id="p.286" n="286"/> and with whom the great and the little of created things are equally insignificant, cannot or will not condescend to take immediate cognizance of every thing that happens in his vast universe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1703"/>We are apt to suppose that the general principles which we call the laws of nature are so many agents, or, at least, so many moving powers impressed on the great machine of creation, by which the various changes and phenomena we behold have been brought to pass without the further superintendence of Him who made it;&mdash; whereas they are more justly viewed as being merely the modes of the divine operations; an expression of the order in which it has pleased Him that the successive events which constitute the course of nature should follow each other in the relation of physical cause and effect; and in conformity to which the energy of divine power is incessantly exerted for the government of the world in bringing about the various changes which it exhibits.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1705"/>It forms <num value="1">one</num> of a series of publications by our author connected with the controversy so actively carried on at this period with the principal deistical writers of the day, and in which, as we have already seen, several other dissenting divines of the same school greatly distinguished themselves.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1709"/>It is to be regretted that these publications, being for the most part called forth by circumstances and controversies of a temporary and personal character, have failed to attract the degree of permanent attention to which their intrinsic merit would entitle them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1710"/>At this distance of time it is not easy to judge how far it was worth while to take so much notice of the productions of a man like <persName n="Chubb,,,,," id="n0300.0012.00287.00920" reg="nearbymention:Chubb,Thomas,,,"><surname>Chubb</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1713"/>About the year <dateStruct value="1742--"><year reg="1742">1742</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Fleming,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0012.00287.00923" reg="nearbymention:Fleming,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Fleming</surname></persName> published a tract on Baptism, entitled, <q direct="unspecified">Plunging a subject <pb id="p.288" n="288"/> of Bigotry when made essential to Baptism;</q> which was soon followed by <q direct="unspecified">A Plea for Infants, or the <rs>Scripture Doctrine</rs> of Water-Baptism stated.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1714"/>These tracts presently excited a controversy, in which our author returned several times to the charge in reply to sundry opponents, particularly <persName n="Burroughs,Reverend,J.,,," id="n0300.0012.00288.00924" reg="default:Burroughs,J.,,,"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev.</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Burroughs</surname></persName> and <persName n="Dobell,Mister,D.,,," id="n0300.0012.00288.00925" reg="default:Dobell,D.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Dobell</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1715"/>In these publications he defends the cause of infant baptism with great zeal and perseverance, and urges all the arguments which are usually brought forward to vindicate or recommend this practice, not only from the expediency and propriety of the thing, considered in its moral influence on the minds of the parents, but on the alleged footing of authority derived from the supposed uninterrupted tradition of the church, from the presumed practice, or at least connivance of the apostles, and from the real or supposed analogy between this rite and that of circumcision, as practised under the law of <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n0300.0012.00288.00926" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1716"/>Some of these arguments appear to us plausible, while others will scarcely bear examination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1717"/>The main strength of the paedo-baptists' cause (provided that the <q direct="unspecified">previous question</q> is assumed, that water-baptism is to be received as an ordinance of permanent obligation in the church at all) is derived from the consideration, that it must be practised as a rite of <hi rend="italics">initiation;</hi> whereas adult baptism seems to invert the natural order, when administered to persons who have <hi rend="italics">already</hi> gone through a course of religious instruction and education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1718"/>It seems preposterous, <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num></hi> to instruct, and <hi rend="italics">then</hi> to admit into the school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1719"/>When the question is not of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> introduction of a convert, but of the offspring of <name>Christian</name> parents, <pb id="p.289" n="289"/> it seems as if there was no period at which this formal initiation could take place too early; because a child's moral education commences from his birth, and ought from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to be conducted on <name>Christian</name> principles, and with an express reference to his character of an heir of the promises, entitled to all the privileges of a Christian disciple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1720"/>To wait till a child is able to think and answer for himself would be to sacrifice the period of life when the most essential and valuable parts of a religious education ought to be carried on. But in the absence of any direct evidence of the apostolic authority of this practice at all corresponding to that which we have in the <name>Mosaic</name> law for the rite of circumcision, it seems that this ground of argument will only prove the expediency and beneficial tendency of the practice in its moral influence on the parties concerned, and not its binding obligation as an ordinance or sacrament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1721"/>It is here that the argument for infant baptism may appear imperfect;&mdash;especially if its <hi rend="italics">validity</hi> is at the same time insisted on, as an instrument for working, we know not what regeneration in the subject of it;&mdash;for mending <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> work at the will of a priest, and washing out by some cabalistical process the stains of original sin. For an ordinance which is supposed to shew such proofs as these of its efficacy we are surely justified in requiring a more precise and indubitable authority than any to be found in the New Testament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1722"/>On the other hand, the opposite party are not without reason called on to produce a single scriptural example of the adult offspring of <name>Christian</name> parents being introduced into the church by the <pb id="p.290" n="290"/> outward ceremony which they recommend and practise.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1724"/>But this faith, in the case of converts, the only adults of whose baptism we read any thing in the New Testament, is merely that which leads to an acknowledgment of the authority of the teacher, and a consequent admission into the list of his disciples,&mdash;not that which <quote> cometh by hearing,</quote> and implies a more complete knowledge of the principles of his doctrines, such as can be acquired only by a continued and assiduous attendance on his instructions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1725"/>I have concluded, that the scripture history of facts will support the right of infant children to baptism, on the faith of their parents, since several households were baptized on the faith of their heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1726"/>I have father observed, that the pre-requisite, faith, did not necessarily imply virtuous character, but a persuasion only that <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> was the <name>Christ</name>, which being professed, did entitle men to baptism&mdash;and hence I have concluded that baptism was no more than a rite which initiated men into a kingdom, polity, or state of privileges; to which the infants of all professing Christians are entitled by their birth and situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1727"/>On the contrary, adult-baptizers suppose virtuous moral character, and a very competent knowledge of the <rs>Christian</rs> doctrines, as pre-requisites to baptism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1728"/>This demand of theirs appears to me to rise far above the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the pure gospel-state of things; for <pb id="p.291" n="291"/> when the gospel was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> published, those who embraced it were frequently told by the apostles, of its being the effect of the free grace of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> that they had been called and admitted into that kingdom, and not to any furniture of knowledge, or any works of righteousness which they had done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/>In particular he well exposes the groundless pretensions of priests and churches to sit in judgment on their fellow-christians, to place barriers in the way of access to the <rs>Lord</rs>'s table, and demand from candidates for admission confessions of faith, or <q direct="unspecified">experiences</q> drawn up by or for <pb id="p.294" n="294"/> them; a fertile source of fanaticism on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, or of hypocrisy on the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/>On the frequent discussions which took place lately on the subject of the marriage law, it was much questioned whether the <name>Dissenters</name> did, in practice, however entitled in law, solemnize matrimony in their congregations before the passing of the <rs>Marriage Act</rs> which confined the right to the <rs type="place">Established Church</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/>In fact, <persName n="Taylor,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0013.00307.00979" reg="nearbymention:Taylor,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>'s leading distinction from the greater portion of his brethren of that day consisted not so much in the freedom of his opinions, in which many went considerably beyond him, as in his plan of more explicit and open dealing with some of the important topics of religious investigation, instead of following the very prevalent example of abstaining altogether from their discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>We find, therefore, that, on his joining the <rs>Norwich</rs> congregation, he considered it proper that a perfect understanding should be established; and that, in particular, they should together examine into the received opinions, with <pb id="p.308" n="308"/> reference to the doctrine of the <rs>Trinity</rs>, in order to form some distinct and understood conclusions on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>With this view his congregation, at his suggestion, entered upon a careful reading and examination of <persName n="Clarke,Doctor,,,," id="n0300.0013.00308.00980" reg="mostcommon:Clarke,Samuel,,,:1"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Clarke</surname></persName>'s <q direct="unspecified">Scripture Doctrine of the <rs>Trinity</rs>;</q> having previously engaged in <num value="2">two</num> solemn meetings for prayer for the divine assistance in their work.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1849"/>Doubtless the spirit in which <q direct="unspecified">prayer meetings</q> have been frequently conducted, is only calculated, as indeed it is intended, to confirm the parties in their present notions, whatever these may be; but there surely can be no reason why we may not, and many why we should, pray to be preserved from prejudice and error; and for grace so to exercise the best powers which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has given us in the study of his word, that we may be protected from mischievous delusion, and led into all important and necessary truth; and there can be no occasion when pious and truly candid minds will be more disposed to do this, than when they are invited to enter on a course of inquiry which <hi rend="italics">may</hi> end in proving that the most cherished opinions which they have hitherto identified with the basis of their hopes and prospects as Christians are a corruption of the pure simplicity of the <name>Gospel</name>, and in leading them to embrace, as divine truth, what they had formerly shunned as dangerous error.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1850"/>From that time forward, at any rate, the opinions <pb id="p.309" n="309"/> of the congregation were avowed and known to be in unison with those of their pastor; and a few, whose convictions had always been, and continued to be, Calvinistic, withdrew, on its appearing that the decided course taken by the main body rendered undesirable a continuance of a union which could only be nominal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/>It gives a brief sketch of the rise and progress of those corruptions which led to the growth and establishment of Popery, which he well describes as consisting not merely in the political and ecclesiastical authority of the <rs>Bishop</rs> of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, but in the assertion and exercise of the pretension, wherever vested, of lording it over the consciences of others; of making inquisition into the faith of our fellow-disciples, and imposing on them an outward conformity to creeds <pb id="p.310" n="310"/> and confessions of our own or of any human devising.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>This unwarrantable and unchristian domination, by whomsoever assumed, in his opinion comprehends the essence and most pernicious character of Popery: with whatever earnestness such parties may disclaim the relationship, they are children of antichrist, and display the characteristic features of the man of sin.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/>He <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> traces the advance and decline of Romish Popery; which being partially overthrown by the early reformers in separating from the <orgName n="Rome Church" type="church">church of Rome</orgName>, they set up a similar system of arbitrary domination and imposition on the consciences of man, which he justly stigmatizes by the epithet of Protestant Popery, <q direct="unspecified">which, though in some respects better than the <name>Romish</name>, is yet more inconsistent, because it renounceth infallibility, yet imposeth and persecuteth as if infallible; rejecteth human authority, and yet in many cases pleadeth and resteth upon it; and, lastly, permitteth the <name>Scriptures</name> to be read but not understood, or, which is all <num value="1">one</num>, to be understood only in the sense of schemes formed and established by men.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1858"/>Thus did these men build again the things which they had destroyed, and make themselves transgressors against the glorious liberty of the sons of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/>Against this Protestant popery the dissenters manfully declared themselves; but no sooner were they confirmed in their own liberties by the <name>Act</name> of Toleration, than some, in the exercise of their newly acquired freedom, saw reason to abandon or deviate from the tenets of their fathers; while others, tenacious of received opinions, stiffly opposed the free inquiry which introduced the <q direct="unspecified">new notions.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>This <pb id="p.311" n="311"/> is dissenting Popery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1861"/>Of the spirit and tendency of this dissenting popery the narrative thus introduced to the public afforded a very apt and illustrative specimen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1862"/>It is not necessary to enter into the particulars of this affair; suffice it to say, that it is an example of what may be expected frequently to occur when men are not only persuaded that an exact conformity to their own little peculiarities is essential to salvation, but are invested by the constitution of their church with the power to demand from individuals a confession of their faith as the condition of <name>Christian</name> communion, and to inflict ecclesiastical censures upon those who do not come exactly up to their standard.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1866"/>It is admitted, by common consent, to be a treatise of great learning and ability, and is referred to by both parties as a standard work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1867"/>It is divided into <num value="3">three</num> parts; in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of which all those places of Scripture which do expressly speak of the consequences of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> transgression <pb id="p.312" n="312"/> are distinctly considered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/>In the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, the principal passages of Scripture which have by divines been applied in support of the common scheme of original sin are particularly and impartially examined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>The author here takes for his guide the <q direct="unspecified">Assembly's Larger Catechism,</q> and examines in order the texts which are cited by it as proofs of the several propositions advanced; reasonably assuming that such a select body of learned and judicious men may well be supposed to have given us the precise sense of the article, and the main evidence that can be adduced from Scripture in support of it. In the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> part, he answers some objections and queries; and considers the supposed connexion of the doctrine of original sin with other parts of religion, particularly redemption and regeneration.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1870"/>The work contains much excellent criticism and powerful argument; and we are inclined to think, that the impression left by the whole upon a candid, unprejudiced reader will be, that it would have justified the author in carrying out his conclusion to a greater length than he has chosen to pursue it. At all events, the doctrine opposed, as we find it laid down in the received formularies of orthodoxy, seems to be rendered utterly untenable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>Whether it was necessary to adopt the literal interpretation of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> chapter of Genesis as an historical narrative, or to concede the introduction of death as passing not only upon <persName n="Adam,,,,," id="n0300.0013.00312.00987" reg="mostcommon:Adam,nomatch:0"><surname>Adam</surname></persName>, but upon all his descendants, as a consequence of his transgression, merely because this hypothesis affords the easiest exposition of an obscure passage in the <name>Epistle</name> to the <name>Romans</name>, are questions on which different opinions <pb id="p.313" n="313"/> will be entertained by those who admit the accuracy of the writer's views in general.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1874"/>Just as if a father for some irregularity in his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> child should determine to lay a restraint upon him in diet, dress, or diversions, and at the same time should judge it expedient to make it a rule with all the other children he might afterwards have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1875"/>In this instance, it is easy to see how the <hi rend="italics">judgment to condemnation</hi> pronounced upon the offence of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-born cometh upon the other children, even before they are brought into the world; without any injustice, nay, perhaps, with a great deal of goodness, on the father's part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1876"/>Upon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> it is a proper punishment; on the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> it cometh as a wholesome discipline; and yet, through the offence of <num value="1">one</num>, they are debarred some pleasures or enjoyments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1884"/>In this admirable work, the author lays down a principle and mode of interpretation which is better adapted than any other to the right understanding of these (to us) confessedly difficult and obscure compositions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1885"/>In its main outlines, it seems to have been suggested by <persName n="Locke,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0013.00315.00998" reg="mostcommon:Locke,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Locke</surname></persName>; and is detailed at some length in his note on <persName><foreName>Romans</foreName> <genName>v</genName></persName>. <num value="6">6</num>-<num value="8">8</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1886"/>In the first place, it is important always to remember that the apostolic writings are chiefly letters, suggested&mdash;most of them evidently, and the others in all probability&mdash;by the circumstances, and referring to the peculiar wants, conditions, and characters of their correspondents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1887"/>We are therefore to infer, that, although they doubtless contain indirectly and incidentally an illustration of many important general principles of universal and permanent application, and therefore will deserve and are likely to reward the diligent study of Christians in all ages, yet they must be considered as having a more immediate reference to the circumstances of the churches to whom they were addressed, and of the <orgName n="Christian world" type="newspaper">Christian world</orgName> in general of those times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1888"/>Now these differed in many most important particulars from any thing which has since existed; and a want of attention to this difference, and a determination to seek in the condition of individual Christians at this remote period for something appropriate to what was addressed, not merely to the primitive disciples, but to the whole church, or to the sections into which the church was at that time divided of Jews and Gentiles taken collectively, has led to by far the greater part of the errors and misconceptions which have arisen in the study of the <name>Epistles</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1889"/><pb id="p.316" n="316"/></p> 
<p>It is necessary also to bear in mind continually that the writers were Jews, and that they were addressing themselves, for the most part, to communities made up partly of Jews and partly of Gentiles, who, by the profession of their new faith as Christians, were necessarily thrown into close connexion and frequent intercourse with their <persName n="Jewish,,,,," id="n0300.0013.00316.00999" reg="mostcommon:Jewish,nomatch:0"><surname>Jewish</surname></persName> brethren.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1890"/>It was to be expected, therefore, that the language adopted by writers so circumstanced would be founded upon that with which their own minds were already familiar in the <name>Hebrew</name> scriptures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1891"/>The previous habits of thought and expression in <persName n="Jewish,,,,," id="n0300.0013.00316.01000" reg="mostcommon:Jewish,nomatch:0"><surname>Jewish</surname></persName> writers could not fail to lead them to convey their views of the salvation which is by <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0013.00316.01001" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> in language borrowed from their own laws, customs, and even prejudices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/>Such language was likely to be familiar and easily intelligible to the persons whom they addressed, but is apt to be misunderstood by modern readers, to whom the subjects and practices alluded to are but imperfectly known, and who, moreover, are accustomed to read under the impression that they are to seek in their own condition, and in the circumstances of these times, for the objects to which all these obscure reasonings and illustrations&mdash;originally clear enough, but by which <hi rend="italics">they</hi> are only confounded and perplexed&mdash;were intended to be applied.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>It follows, therefore, that the difficulties we encounter in the study of <placeName key="tgn,7013947" n="1.000 10" reg="saint paul, ramsey, minnesota">St. Paul</placeName>'s writings (except such as arise from the character of his own very remarkable and peculiar style) will most commonly find their solution in an examination of the sense in which similar modes of expression are used in the Old Testament, considered with <pb id="p.317" n="317"/> reference to the condition and circumstances of the churches in those times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/>Accordingly, we find that many of the terms applied to the members of the primitive <orgName n="Christian Church" type="church">Christian church</orgName> in the New Testament are derived from the language employed under the Old Covenant in speaking of the children of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName>; and there is, in fact, a sufficiently obvious and striking analogy in many particulars to favour this transference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1895"/>The <rs>Israelites</rs> were selected from the idolatrous nations by the gratuitous favour of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, without regard to any previous merit on their part, to become his peculiar people, the subjects of a special covenant; hence they are said to be <hi rend="italics">chosen</hi> or <hi rend="italics">elected</hi>. The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> consequence of this election was their deliverance from the state of bondage in which they were held in <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>; hence they are said to be <hi rend="italics">delivered, saved, bought</hi> or <hi rend="italics">purchased, redeemed</hi>. Having been brought out of this abject state into a new and happy condition, <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is said <hi rend="italics">to create, make</hi> or <hi rend="italics">form</hi> them anew; to have given them life, to have begotten them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1896"/>Hence they are his children, to whom he sustains, in a peculiar sense, the character of a Father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1897"/>He is their king, and they are his people; he is their shepherd, and they are his flock or sheep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1898"/>Being set apart for his service, they are said to be holy, saints, washed; they are a people near to him, his congregation, his church, his inheritance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1899"/>In this capacity he receives them into a covenant with himself, requiring from them homage, love, obedience, exclusive worship: on which conditions he promises protection and continued possession of all the privileges and blessings they enjoyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1900"/><pb id="p.318" n="318"/></p> 
<p>But all this language applied, not so much to the moral conduct and personal character of the <name>Israelites</name> taken individually, as to their external state as a community taken collectively; separated from the rest of the world by a peculiar ritual; consecrated to the service of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, for the purpose of maintaining a standing memorial and testimony against idolatry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1901"/>Now in all these respects there was a remarkable analogy in the condition and circumstances of the primitive <orgName n="Christian Church" type="church">Christian church</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1902"/>They were a little flock, which had been separated from their unbelieving neighbours, both among Jews and Gentiles, to be the subjects of a new and better covenant; and that without any previous merit on their part entitling them thereto, but through the special favour of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1903"/>Hence they, too, were <hi rend="italics">called</hi>, <hi rend="italics">elected;</hi> they were a chosen nation, a royal priesthood, a peculiar people; <hi rend="italics">called to be saints</hi>, <hi rend="italics">saved, redeemed, purchased</hi>, &amp;c. All these terms, and a multitude of others, which frequently occur in the apostolic writings, will be found, on comparison, to have been derived from the language employed by the writers of the Old Testament in speaking of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> ancient people; and it was natural that the apostles, being themselves Jews, should be led by the analogous circumstances of the old and the new covenant, and by their previous familiar acquaintance with the style of their own sacred writings, to adopt similar expressions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1904"/>Another consideration which still further favoured this transference of forms of expression, was the <hi rend="italics">actual</hi> transference of the covenanted relation to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, from the <name>Jews</name> <hi rend="italics">as such</hi>, to the church gathered unto <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0013.00318.01002" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> from among all nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1905"/>The <pb id="p.319" n="319"/> Jews are no longer the peculiar people: as Jews, they are cast out and rejected; as far as relates to covenanted privileges, they are henceforth on a level with the rest of mankind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1906"/>The <orgName n="Christian Church" type="church">Christian church</orgName>, therefore, having succeeded, in a great measure, to the same relative position, is naturally spoken of in the same terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1907"/><persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0013.00319.01003" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> has <hi rend="italics">redeemed</hi> us unto himself as a <hi rend="italics">peculiar people</hi> zealous of good works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1909"/>And these titles are applied to them as they were to the <name>Jews</name>, not in their individual capacity, but collectively; they consequently express, not moral character or inward disposition, but an external state;&mdash; certain advantages and privileges procured for them through the intervention of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0013.00319.01005" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, and especially by his death and resurrection&mdash;a knowledge of the will and intentions of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> concerning them, and of their own duties and expectations both here and hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1910"/>They are saved by grace, through faith, and that not of works, so that no man can boast: it is the gift of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1911"/>But saved from what?&mdash;from the consequences of sin in a future state?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1915"/>This <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> justification or acceptance was a privilege already put into their hands, by the right use of which they were to work out their final salvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1917"/>This was the sacrifice of sweet-smelling savour which he offered to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1918"/>The above is a brief and imperfect outline of the principles laid down and illustrated with great ability and learning in this remarkable treatise; which, perhaps, did more than any other to place the interpretation of these important but difficult and obscure parts of Scripture on its right ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2012"/>He afterwards gave them a course of lectures on the idiomatic phraseology of the <rs>Hebrew Scriptures</rs>, at the same time pointing out the influence which these idioms frequently have upon the <name>Greek</name> of the New Testament, and the necessity of being acquainted with and constantly attending to them, in order to attain a just idea <pb id="p.335" n="335"/> of the exact sense of many passages in the New Testament writers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2013"/>The rules and observations contained in those lectures were illustrated by a vast number of quotations from both parts of the sacred volume, as well as by many from <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> and Latin classics, They professed to be chiefly an abridgment, or rather a reduction to order, of the substance of Glassius's <hi rend="italics">Philologia Sacra</hi>, but were enriched with many additions from other sources as well as from the <rs>Doctor</rs>'s own stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2014"/>When he had thus thoroughly grounded his pupils in the languages of both Testaments, and, probably, read with them a considerable portion of each, he led them through a regular course of theological lectures; for which purpose he drew up, as a text book, his scheme of scripture divinity, which was printed for the use of the students at the expense of the trustees of the academy, and, after his death, was published to the world at large by his son, <persName n="Taylor,Mister,Richard,,," id="n0300.0013.00335.01046" reg="default:Taylor,Richard,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Richard</foreName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Norwich, New London, Connecticut" key="tgn,7014246">Norwich</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2085"/>If ever he expressed an uncommon warmth and honest indignation against any thing, it was against Athanasianism, which he thought <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest corruptions of pure and genuine Christianity, as this doctrine entirely subverts the unity of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, the great and primary foundation of all religion, natural and revealed</p>

<head>Dissenting Academics.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2098"/><num value="1">one</num> of the most remarkable features in the history both of theological and general literature in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> is found in the great number of academical institutions which have been established in connexion with almost every denomination if Dissenters, for the supply of their churches with learned and qualified ministers, and also for the liberal education of the youth of their more opulent families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2099"/>The universities of <placeName reg="Oxford, Oxfordshire, England" key="tgn,7011931">Oxford</placeName> and <placeName reg="Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England" key="tgn,7010874">Cambridge</placeName>, which only <hi rend="italics">ought</hi> to be, what they are called, <hi rend="italics">national</hi> seats of education, have been placed under the exclusive guardianship of the established Church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2100"/>Its clergy have at all times possessed the entire and uncontrolled direction of these seminaries; and their whole constitution and the course of study pursued in them, has consequently been regulated with a reference to its interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2101"/>Dissent is not acknowledged or tolerated at either of them; and no youth can partake of the advantages professedly provided by the liberality of our ancestors for the benefit of the nation at large without at least an external and temporary conformity to the discipline and worship of the church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2102"/>In <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi>, a formal subscription to her articles of faith is exacted, on their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> entrance, from boys, who cannot be supposed to have given even the most cursory and superficial attention to the variety of disputed points which <pb id="p.348" n="348"/> these articles involve; and in <hi rend="italics">both</hi> this compliance is a necessary preliminary to all academical honours or distinctions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2103"/>In this respect the universities of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> differ from those of every other country of Protestant <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, which are open to persons of every class and religious profession, without distinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2104"/>The peculiarity is not <num value="1">one</num> which we have any reason to be proud of; and, in fact, it has greatly tended to aggravate the bitter sectarian spirit in which it originated, and which interferes in this country, to such a lamentable extent, with the comfort of social intercourse, and with the just practical influence of religious principles and feelings among all parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2105"/>But <num value="1">one</num> important consequence has been, that the <name>Dissenters</name>, finding themselves unjustly debarred from those opportunities of liberal education which were intended for all, and being, for the most part, unwilling to forego the services of a learned ministry, have made great exertions to supply the deficiency, as far as was practicable, in private institutions; and though these institutions have, doubtless, been of various and unequal merit, yet upon the whole, and when the disadvantages with which they have had to struggle in the unfair competition are taken into the account, there is no reason to think that in really valuable learning, or in any of the accomplishments which are desirable in a minister of religion, their <hi rend="italics">alumni</hi> have been materially inferior to those of more favoured establishments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2106"/>The unbiassed and unprejudiced historian of letters (if such a person should ever be found) will be ready to admit that a very fair proportion of the most distinguished scholars and divines of <pb id="p.349" n="349"/> whom our country can boast are the produce of dissenting academies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2107"/>A comprehensive and impartial history of these institutions, independently of its value in other points of view, would possess a great general interest, from the light which it would throw on the state and progress in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, not only of <hi rend="italics">theology</hi>, but of literature and intellectual cultivation in every department, during the period which has elapsed since the rise of the leading denominations of Protestant Dissenters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2108"/>This class of institutions originated at a very early period in the history of Nonconformity; even anterior to the <name>Act</name> of Toleration, when they were, of course, carried on under the pressure of difficulties and disadvantages much greater than they have now to encounter, and, in many cases, under circumstances of no slight personal danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2109"/>But the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> race of Nonconformist Divines, who had been ejected from their benefices in the <rs type="place">Church</rs> by the <name>Act</name> of Uniformity, sustained a high character for talent and learning; and they were earnestly desirous that their successors, though unjustly precluded from the opportunities which they had enjoyed, should, as far as possible, maintain the reputation of the dissenting body in these respects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2110"/>In this connexion, the names of <persName n="Frankland,,,,," id="n0300.0014.00349.01091" reg="mostcommon:Frankland,nomatch:0"><surname>Frankland</surname></persName>, <persName n="Woodhouse,,,,," id="n0300.0014.00349.01092" reg="mostcommon:Woodhouse,nomatch:0"><surname>Woodhouse</surname></persName>, <persName n="Warren,,,,," id="n0300.0014.00349.01093" reg="mostcommon:Warren,nomatch:0"><surname>Warren</surname></persName>, and many others, are deserving of honourable remembrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2111"/>But even after the period when they, at length, received the partial protection of the civil power, they were still exposed to annoyance and vexation, and harassing processes were occasionally commenced in the ecclesiastical courts against those who presided over theological seminaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2112"/>The last attempt of this kind occurred in <dateStruct value="1732--"><year reg="1732">1732</year></dateStruct>, in the <pb id="p.350" n="350"/> case of <persName n="Doddridge,Doctor,,,," id="n0300.0014.00350.01094" reg="mostcommon:Doddridge,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Doddridge</surname></persName>, which was happily checked by the prompt and effectual personal interference of <persName><foreName>George</foreName> <genName n="2">II</genName></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2113"/>It were greatly to be wished, that the promoters of academical education among the <name>Dissenters</name> had been at all times solicitous to guard against the influence of that narrow-minded, exclusive spirit which <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> created the necessity for their exertions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2114"/>But unhappily, in the great majority of cases, the same sectarian views have prevailed in them, on a smaller scale, which we observe with so much regret in our national establishments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2115"/>The object, in almost all of them, seems to have been, not to diffuse sound learning, or to place in the hands of the pupils the torch by which they might explore the truth for themselves, in the exercise of free, enlightened, and, as far as possible, unbiassed inquiry, but to train up partizans of a particular sect; and they have generally adopted the same unfair means of securing this object which, when put into operation against themselves, had occasioned their own exclusion from <placeName reg="Oxford, Oxfordshire, England" key="tgn,7011931">Oxford</placeName> and <placeName reg="Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England" key="tgn,7010874">Cambridge</placeName>; demanding both from tutors and students a declaration of their adherence to a certain system of doctrines, or subscription to a certain specified formula of human composition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2116"/>In some instances they have even gone beyond the universities in the rigour of their restrictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2117"/>Thus <persName n="Priestley,Doctor,,,," id="n0300.0014.00350.01095" reg="mostcommon:Priestley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Priestley</surname></persName> tells us, that at the academy at Mile End, to which his friends were, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, desirous to send him, every student was not only required to subscribe his assent to <num value="10">ten</num> printed articles of the strictest <rs>Calvinism</rs>, but to repeat his subscription every <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2118"/>We may fairly claim it as a distinction (an <pb id="p.351" n="351"/> honourable distinction we deem it) on the part of Unitarian Dissenters, that <hi rend="italics">their</hi> academies, at the same time that they have commonly aimed at as high a literary character as circumstances enabled them to obtain, have uniformly rejected these unworthy fetters, and have not sought to throw any additional artificial temptations in the way of the honest, enlightened inquirer after truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2119"/>Such is the unavoidable influence of personal connexions, of early prepossessions, of the example of those by whose advice and instruction we are necessarily guided before we are able to form a conclusion or opinion which can be called really our own, that it is rarely possible for any <num value="1">one</num> to come to the examination of the most important of all questions <hi rend="italics">perfectly</hi> free from all bias or prejudice; and therefore it is not to be wondered at, that the majority of the young men who resort to these institutions are found to espouse the prevailing sentiments of the place; but it has commonly been our object, so to frame their constitution, and so to regulate the plan of study and instruction pursued in them, as to counteract, and not to give increased and unnecessary strength to these misleading influences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2120"/>And there is good reason to believe, that in these endeavours the excellent persons to whom the education of our young divines has been committed, have not been altogether unsuccessful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2121"/>They have not only refrained from attempting to exercise any undue influence over their pupils, but have endeavoured, while communicating instruction, to preserve their own minds in the desirable attitude of seekers after truth; not bound by the trammels of any sect or system, but ready to follow her <pb id="p.352" n="352"/> footsteps in whatever direction they appeared to lead.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2122"/>This refusal to submit to shackles on inquiry, or to impose them on others, is so obviously suggested by a rational and well-founded confidence in the grounds and evidence of our opinions, that we are at a loss to understand how a different procedure can be ascribed to any thing else than a secret misgiving that all is not right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2123"/>Truth, when fairly and impartially examined, must always have the advantage over error; and those who cannot trust their pupils to think and inquire for themselves, without <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> demanding pledges, calling for a confession of faith, and subjecting the youthful mind to all the trammels of human authority, can hardly wonder that, notwithstanding the stress they lay on their favourite doctrines, as fundamental principles of religion, and even essential to salvation, we should suspect them of not being so fully assured as they profess to be of the foundation on which they stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2124"/>Their conduct seems to indicate a doubt in their own minds as to the conclusion which an enlightened inquirer will be likely to adopt, who has no other motive or principle to guide him but an attachment to the truth, wherever it may be found.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2125"/>The academical institutions connected with Dissenters of the <rs>Presbyterian</rs> and <persName n="Baptist,General,,,," id="n0300.0014.00352.01096" reg="mostcommon:Baptist,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Baptist</surname></persName> denominations being chiefly supported by those individuals who are known to be zealously attached to <persName n="Unitarian,,,,," id="n0300.0014.00352.01097" reg="mostcommon:Unitarian,nomatch:0"><surname>Unitarian</surname></persName> sentiments, naturally receive this name from the public, though they have rarely assumed it themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2126"/>Their most judicious friends do not wish to see them avowedly identified with any sect or party; and would <pb id="p.353" n="353"/> rather not give them a title which might seem to imply a disposition in their conductors to promote the interests of <hi rend="italics">unitarianism</hi> in preference to those of <hi rend="italics">truth</hi>. We value and pursue the former, only because we believe it to be an important portion of the latter, which we seek for and embrace, whatever form it may appear to assume; satisfied that those who inquire after it with diligence, candour, and impartiality, have the best prospect of being protected from pernicious error, and that nothing which is really erroneous can be permanently beneficial to the best interests of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2127"/>The <rs>Unitarians</rs> claim the merit of being the only party who have acted uniformly and consistently on this just and enlightened principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2128"/>Some few of the academies established, partially at least, under the auspices of other sects, have, it is true, for awhile, and to a certain extent, followed the same plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2129"/>Among these honourable exceptions was that of <persName n="Doddridge,,,,," id="n0300.0014.00353.01098" reg="mostcommon:Doddridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Doddridge</surname></persName>, at <placeName reg="Northampton, Northamptonshire, England" key="tgn,7010911">Northampton</placeName>, and its successor at <placeName key="tgn,1029023" n="1.000 10" reg="Daventry,Northamptonshire,England,United Kingdom,Europe">Daventry</placeName>, under the conduct of <persName n="Ashworth,,,,," id="n0300.0014.00353.01099" reg="mostcommon:Ashworth,nomatch:0"><surname>Ashworth</surname></persName>, <persName n="Robins,,,,," id="n0300.0014.00353.01100" reg="mostcommon:Robins,nomatch:0"><surname>Robins</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Belsham,,,,," id="n0300.0014.00353.01101" reg="mostcommon:Belsham,nomatch:0"><surname>Belsham</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2130"/>But it is certainly not a little remarkable, that there is scarcely an instance of this kind which has not occasioned a considerable falling away from the rigour of genuine Calvinism, even among those who have remained nominally in the ranks of orthodoxy; while no small portion of the ingenuous youth, encouraged, or at least permitted, to examine both sides, and judge for themselves, have embraced some form of unitarianism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2131"/>This being the case, we cannot much wonder that the present patrons of such institutions should have deserted the liberal plan of their predecessors, by drawing much closer and <pb id="p.354" n="354"/> tighter than formerly the bonds of sectarian distinction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2132"/>It is partly in consequence of this candid and liberal method, that we find among those who have, from time to time, undertaken the conduct of theological education in our academies, a large proportion of the most eminent and distinguished men, to whose names we point as the brightest ornaments of the body to which they belonged, Being equally free with their pupils from all obligation to maintain, at any rate, the peculiar tenets of a sect, except when recommended by evidence which approved itself to their own minds, they have never given way to the persuasion that their opinions were made up and incapable of further change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2133"/>While teaching others, they have not abandoned the character of learners; keeping their minds at all times open to conviction, prepared, and at perfect liberty, to alter and modify their views on every subject as <name n="God" type="God">God</name> should give light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2134"/>Some of these worthies are well known to the public by their valuable writings; while others, who are less distinguished in this way, are still deserving of honourable mention, not merely from the credit they have reflected on the opinions they espoused, but from the influence, by no means inconsiderable, which they exercised on the progress of knowledge, as well as on the development and general diffusion of those more just and rational modes of investigation which are most likely to conduct the professed inquirer after truth to what ought to be the only object of his search.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2135"/>The name of <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Hallet,,,,," id="n0300.0014.00354.01102" reg="mostcommon:Hallet,Joseph,,,:3"><surname>Hallet</surname></persName></hi> has already been mentioned, as mainly instrumental to the progress of free inquiry and of liberal opinions, <pb id="p.355" n="355"/> by the just and impartial plan which he adopted in an academical institution at <placeName reg="Exeter, Devon, England" key="tgn,7011953">Exeter</placeName>; and we now propose to introduce under the present title a few particulars of several other excellent men who have laboured, and not altogether without success, in the same good cause.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2136"/>Of several of the theological tutors in our earlier academies it is not, indeed, easy at this distance of time to ascertain the precise opinions on controverted points, especially when (as is the case in many instances) they did not receive a permanent form, through the intervention of the press, but were confined, for the most part, to the lecture-room or the pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2137"/>This uncertainty is to be regretted for various reasons; but it is, perhaps, a natural consequence of that liberality in their conduct as teachers which has already been noticed with commendation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2138"/>Even where their own opinions were most decided, they were naturally averse to assume before their pupils the character of a partizan; and hence they may sometimes have been led even into the opposite extreme, by studiously concealing their own private opinions, while endeavouring to present fairly and impartially the arguments on both sides as advanced by others When, however, it appears that a large portion of the students educated in any institution, and those the most distinguished for talents and character, agreed in adopting religious opinions of a certain class, it seems reasonable to conclude that this was the prevailing tendency of the instructions they received, influenced, perhaps unconsciously, by the private opinions of the instructor.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2248"/><q direct="unspecified">In my time, the academy was in a state peculiarly favourable to the serious pursuit of truth, as the students were about equally divided on every question of much importance, such as liberty and necessity, the sleep of the soul, and all the articles of theological orthodoxy and heresy; in consequence of which, all these topics were the subject of continual discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2249"/>Our tutors also were of different opinions; <persName n="Ashworth,Doctor,,,," id="n0300.0015.00371.01179" reg="mostcommon:Ashworth,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Ashworth</surname></persName> taking the orthodox side of every question, and <persName n="Clark,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0015.00371.01180" reg="nearbymention:Clark,Samuel,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clark</surname></persName>, the sub-tutor, that of heresy, though always with the greatest modesty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2250"/>Both of our tutors being young, at least as tutors, and some of the senior students excelling more than they could pretend to do in several branches of study, they indulged <pb id="p.372" n="372"/> us in the greatest freedoms, so that our lectures often had the air of friendly conversations on the subjects to which they related.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2251"/>We were permitted to ask whatever questions and to make whatever remarks we pleased; and we did it with the greatest, but without any offensive, freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2252"/>The general plan of our studies, which may be seen in <persName n="Doddridge,Doctor,,,," id="n0300.0015.00372.01181" reg="mostcommon:Doddridge,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Doddridge</surname></persName>'s published lectures, was exceedingly favourable to free inquiry, as we were referred to authors on both sides of every question, and were even required to give an account of them.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2254"/>But the abundance and impartiality of the references afford great facilities to a teacher who is sincerely disposed to give his pupils an opportunity of studying the <hi rend="italics">whole</hi> of a subject; and as there is never any attempt to keep back part of the evidence, or to conceal the fact of the widely different opinions which have been maintained and defended, the student soon learns to estimate at its just value the unconditional form in which certain dogmas are propounded in the text.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2255"/>On the other hand, while anxious not to mislead and pervert by an unfair <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num>-sided</hi> statement, there is certainly an extreme to be avoided <pb id="p.373" n="373"/> in the opposite direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2256"/>Students of any important but controverted subject, who <hi rend="italics">begin</hi> their inquiry by raking together all the various and conflicting opinions which have ever been advanced by contending parties, without any clue to guide them through the labyrinth, may, perhaps, be in danger of abandoning in despair the search after that truth which is offered to them from such various and opposite quarters, and sinking into a hopeless scepticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2257"/>But, surely, it is possible for a teacher, without compromising his pretensions to impartiality, to steer his course successfully between these opposing dangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2258"/>In every inquiry there are certain leading principles of primary importance, which are capable of being clearly marked out and ascertained by sufficient and satisfactory evidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2259"/>These it will be his business to bring prominently forward, that they may furnish some fixed points of reference amidst the fluctuation of controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2312"/>The new tutor immediately entered on the classical department, besides which, he had <num value="2">two</num> classes in the <rs>French</rs> language, gave lectures on grammar, oratory, and criticism, and also took those on logic and history from <persName n="Holt,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0015.00380.01232" reg="mostcommon:Holt,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Holt</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2313"/>His mode of lecturing on the <name>Greek</name> and Latin classics was highly interesting, and had a great effect in promoting among his pupils a taste for the critical study of those venerable remains of antiquity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2314"/>A perfect master of the languages in which they were written, and familiarly acquainted with their contents, he contrived to put his young friends in possession of the necessary previous requisites to the thorough understanding of the several works which he thus introduced to their attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2315"/><num value="1">One</num> or <num value="2">two</num> lectures were usually devoted to some general account of the author, the period in which he lived, the occasion of his writing, and the manner in which <pb id="p.381" n="381"/> he treated his subject; which were naturally followed by remarks on the species of composition, whether historical, oratorical, or philosophical, if prose, or, if poetry, epic, dramatic, lyric, satirical, &amp;c. These preliminaries dispatched, he made the students read successively, paragraph by paragraph, under his correction, the author under consideration, and pointed out the beauties, cleared up the difficulties, and illustrated the scope and tendency of the argument, with uncommon clearness and precision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2316"/>His choice of books, also, was generally very judicious: avoiding those authors that are usually read at schools, he rather chose to lead them to an acquaintance with such as might not otherwise be likely to fall in their way; and of these he preferred those which bore some relation to the leading objects of their other studies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2317"/>In history, for instance, he chose such portions of <persName n="Herodotus,,,,," id="n0300.0015.00381.01233" reg="mostcommon:Herodotus,nomatch:0"><surname>Herodotus</surname></persName> as might illustrate those parts of the Old Testament which were connected with Assyria and <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>; the fine funeral orations of <persName n="Thucydides,,,,," id="n0300.0015.00381.01234" reg="mostcommon:Thucydides,nomatch:0"><surname>Thucydides</surname></persName>, <persName n="Plato,,,,," id="n0300.0015.00381.01235" reg="mostcommon:Plato,nomatch:0"><surname>Plato</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Lysias,,,,," id="n0300.0015.00381.01236" reg="mostcommon:Lysias,nomatch:0"><surname>Lysias</surname></persName>; the philosophical and ethical treatises of <persName n="Plato,,,,," id="n0300.0015.00381.01237" reg="mostcommon:Plato,nomatch:0"><surname>Plato</surname></persName>, <persName><foreName>Aristotle</foreName></persName>, <persName n="Epictetus,,,,," id="n0300.0015.00381.01238" reg="mostcommon:Epictetus,nomatch:0"><surname>Epictetus</surname></persName>, <persName n="Antoninus,,Marcus,,," id="n0300.0015.00381.01239" reg="default:Antoninus,Marcus,,,"><foreName>Marcus</foreName> <surname>Antoninus</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Tyrius,,Maximus,,," id="n0300.0015.00381.01240" reg="default:Tyrius,Maximus,,,"><foreName>Maximus</foreName> <surname>Tyrius</surname></persName>, with <persName><foreName>Aristotle</foreName></persName>'s Poetics and Rhetoric, and <persName n="Longinus,,,,," id="n0300.0015.00381.01241" reg="mostcommon:Longinus,nomatch:0"><surname>Longinus</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2318"/>When there were several young men designed for the law, he more than once read with them Justinian's Institutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2319"/>In reading the ancient poets, his extensive acquaintance with modern poetry enabled him to enliven his lectures with parallel passages; and his fine taste led him to dwell with peculiar delight on those passages of either ancient or modern poets which appeared most striking for noble sentiments or just reflections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2320"/>In reading the philosophical <pb id="p.382" n="382"/> treatises of the ancients, he enlarged so much as to render his lectures almost a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> course, in a varied form, of natural religion and ethics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2321"/>And he all along made it a principal object incidentally to illustrate scripture passages by the heathen writers, and to point out the superiority of Christian to Heathen philosophy.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2325"/>On all these points, however, there is reason to believe that his views, like those of his distinguished coadjutor and friend, in the course of that renewed and careful inquiry to which his office almost necessarily led him, were considerably modified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2326"/>But whatever they were, or afterwards became, they in no degree interfered with the strict impartiality with which he endeavoured to lay before his pupils the whole of the evidence on these as well as other controverted questions, and not only to encourage but to exhort and charge them to examine without bias or prejudice, and judge for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2327"/>To this course it is not unreasonable to presume that he <pb id="p.383" n="383"/> might more successfully and uniformly adhere, from the very circumstance that he had not appeared before the public as a writer on dogmatic or controversial theology; and therefore not being in any degree pledged, for the sake of an imagined consistency, to maintain any particular doctrine or system, had the less temptation to deviate from the strict line in recommending it to his pupils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2328"/>It is not intended to insinuate that <persName n="Taylor,Doctor,,,," id="n0300.0015.00383.01249" reg="mostcommon:Taylor,John,,,:5"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName> did not endeavour to the utmost of his power to act up to the full spirit of the admirable and impressive exhortation already quoted, which he was accustomed to address to his class at the commencement of their course; but in doing so he must have had difficulties and temptations to contend with, to which it may be presumed that his successor was less exposed.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2330"/>To an accurate and profound knowledge of sacred literature he added an extensive acquaintance with theological writers of all parties; and, what is of still greater importance, a mind deeply imbued with a spirit of true and rational devotion, and earnestly zealous to make his pupils not merely good scholars and critics, but well-instructed servants of the church and of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0015.00383.01251" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:38"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, thoroughly furnished for the work in which they were to be engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2331"/>As a lecturer, he greatly excelled; and if he had enjoyed the opportunity of displaying his talents in a more extensive and conspicuous theatre, would doubtless have risen to high eminence and fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2332"/>But these were not the rewards which he sought for; and he was well contented to preserve a due regard for truth and con-<pb id="p.384" n="384"/> &lt;*&gt;ncy, and the right of expressing the genuine convictions of his mind, while he exercised for benefit of a few, and in a limited sphere, those &lt;*&gt;did accomplishments which, in other circumstances, might have procured him no ordinary re of popular applause and distinction.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2340"/>In any disputed point of metaphysics, morals, or theology, he avoided any dictatorial declaration of his own opinion, and freely encouraged his pupils to form their own.

A difference of opinion in the pupil produced no diminution of regard in the tutor, or of attention to his instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2346"/>These were read by the students, and carefully criticised by the tutor; the defects of composition and method pointed out; and often references made to preachers of reputation, <name>French</name> or <name>English</name>, who had treated the same text or subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2347"/>Sometimes, when the subject interested him, he would lay out a method of his own, and in a happy strain of dignified eloquence, pursue the subject, <hi rend="italics">extempore</hi>, to a considerable extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2348"/>After the exercises were examined, he would generally turn to some of the finest passages of the <rs>English</rs> poets, <persName n="Milton,,,,," id="n0300.0015.00385.01254" reg="mostcommon:Milton,nomatch:0"><surname>Milton</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Pope">Pope</rs>, <persName n="Thomson,,,,," id="n0300.0015.00385.01255" reg="mostcommon:Thomson,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomson</surname></persName>, Young, and Akenside; and, having <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> himself read a considerable portion, with singular propriety of tone and emphasis, he heard each of the students read in order, and freely, but goodhumouredly, commented on their manner of reading, pointed out their defects, and the proper mode of remedying them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2351"/>Then was the time when difficulties were most freely communicated, and with the most unwearied patience listened to and obviated; his opinion of books, or of courses of reading on particular subjects, was asked and frankly given; sometimes (but this was generally when younger students were of the party) he took the lead in conversation, and himself pointed out books which might be read with advantage; and frequently he enlivened the social hour with anecdotes of his own youthful studies, and how he had surmounted or suffered by them; of the varieties of character among his fellow-students, and (by way, sometimes of encouragement, sometimes of warning) the manner in which they had turned out in the subsequent periods of life.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2354"/>Being, of course, constantly spoken of in the language of warm attachment <pb id="p.387" n="387"/> and reverence by the students who were his immediate pupils, he became the object of a veneration bordering upon awe among those who were not; and though his delicate state of health prevented his frequent personal intercourse with the students at large, and absolutely precluded his taking part in the ordinary routine of academical discipline, yet this very circumstance gave additional weight to his authority when occasions arose that called for his interference; which was always exercised after a previous cool, clearsighted investigation, which put him in possession of the whole case; after which his decision was made with promptitude and firmness; and the measures dictated by it were declared and executed with a dignity and propriety peculiar to himself, and always perfectly efficient,</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2397"/>At this period, the controversy of which we have already given some account in the memoir of <persName n="Peirce,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0016.00393.01282" reg="mostcommon:Peirce,James,,,:5"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Peirce</surname></persName> was but just brought to a close; and its unhappy effects in diffusing animosity and personal jealousy among many, who till then had not thought their differences on speculative points inconsistent with the maintenance of <name>Christian</name> brotherhood, were but too manifest; while the advantages which undoubtedly arose from it indirectly, in promoting a spirit of inquiry, and more just and rational views of religious liberty, were not as yet so fully developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2398"/>The liberal principles, however, which appear to have guided his excellent instructors, and which may be fairly inferred not only from their writings and general reputation, but from the subsequent character and conduct of many of their most distinguished pupils, led <persName n="Towgood,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0016.00393.01283" reg="nearbymention:Towgood,Matthew,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Towgood</surname></persName>, from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, to avoid the patrons of intolerant impositions; and though educated in what is called the orthodox faith, he held himself at liberty to examine and judge for himself, fully persuaded, at the same time, that a doctrine which was the subject of so much controversy, involving so much intricate and perplexed discussion, and on which so many wise and excellent men were arranged on both sides, was, at all events, not essential to salvation.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2401"/></p> 
<p>In this year <persName n="Towgood,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0016.00394.01284" reg="nearbymention:Towgood,Matthew,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Towgood</surname></persName> made his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> appearance as an author in support of that cause of religious liberty of which he became afterwards so able and effective an advocate, by the publication of a small pamphlet entitled <q direct="unspecified">High-flown Episcopal and Priestly Pretensions examined, in a Dialogue between a Country Gentleman and a Country <persName n="Vicar,,,,," id="n0300.0016.00394.01285" reg="mostcommon:Vicar,nomatch:0"><surname>Vicar</surname></persName>;</q> containing a judicious defence of the common rights of Christians and the sufficiency and excellence of the <name>Scriptures</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2402"/>In <num value="174">174</num>] he appeared before the public in a cause which to us, at this distance of time, and removed from the influence of party and temporary excitement, appears much more dubious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2403"/>The occasions are but rare when the <rs>Christian</rs> minister can descend with grace and propriety into the arena of political contention; and still more so when the preacher of the gospel of peace can with consistency come forward as the advocate of war, labouring to blow up the coals of national animosity and vengeance, when his countrymen would otherwise be inclined to withdraw from the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2404"/>Yet such appears to be the character and intention of a pamphlet which our author published at this time, under the title <q direct="unspecified">Spanish Cruelty and Injustice a justifiable Plea for a vigorous War with <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, and a rational ground for hope of success.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2405"/>We believe it is now well understood that the tales of cruel outrages said to be <pb id="p.395" n="395"/> perpetrated by the <name>Spaniards</name> on our traders in the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West Indies</placeName>, which were widely circulated at that period, and which wrought the nation up to such a pitch of frenzy as to drive the pacific administration of <persName n="Walpole,Sir,Robert,,," id="n0300.0016.00395.01286" reg="default:Walpole,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName> <surname>Walpole</surname></persName> most reluctantly into a war, were grossly and wilfully exaggerated for party purposes; and also that the trade which it was sought to protect at such an expense was not only altogether contraband, but utterly insignificant in its value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2406"/>But if the case had been different, it seems to us that the minister of religion had better leave to others the business of preaching up war, remembering who it was that said, <q direct="unspecified">All they that take the sword shall perish by the sword.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2407"/></p> 
<p>Shortly after this we find him coming forward, with great activity and success, on an occasion much more congenial with his character and office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2408"/>In the year <dateStruct value="1743--"><year reg="1743">1743</year></dateStruct> a dreadful fire at Crediton deprived no fewer than <num value="450">four hundred and fifty</num> families of their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2409"/>This awful event awakened all the benevolent sympathies of <persName n="Towgood,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0016.00395.01287" reg="nearbymention:Towgood,Matthew,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Towgood</surname></persName>, who exerted himself to the utmost to lessen the affliction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2410"/>His house and his purse were alike open for the relief of the sufferers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2411"/>It was <num value="1">one</num> of those occasions on which mankind were made to agree; and he accordingly co-operated zealously with <persName n="Stacey,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0016.00395.01288" reg="mostcommon:Stacey,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stacey</surname></persName>, the clergyman of the parish, in the various measures which they undertook for soliciting subscriptions, and procuring other relief from a distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2412"/>A sermon, which he preached on the <name>Sunday</name> after this terrible visitation, was published, and was of great service in attracting the attention and sympathy of the public in general <pb id="p.396" n="396"/> to the deplorable state of his suffering neighbours.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2413"/>About this time he published a valuable tract on the sentiments suitable to a season of recovery from sickness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2414"/>It was designed as a present to such of his congregation as had lately been raised from dangerous disorders, and contained serious reflections, resolutions, and devout meditations, suitable to persons in these circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2415"/>It passed through <num value="3">three</num> editions in this country, besides a large impression in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, under the direction of the author's friend and correspondent, <persName n="Mayhew,Doctor,,,," id="n0300.0016.00396.01289" reg="mostcommon:Mayhew,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Mayhew</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, in New England.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2416"/>In <dateStruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></dateStruct>, the year of the rebellion, our author again came forward in the character of a political divine; more excusably than before, because at that period it was scarcely possible not to connect the threatened restoration of the <name>Stuart</name> dynasty with the prevalence and, perhaps, even the reestablishment of Popery; notwithstanding the remarkable fact, that the great bulk of the <name>Catholics</name> of these kingdoms stood aloof from the conflict, while the most determined adherents (in theory at least) of the exiled family were a still numerous class of the clergy of the <orgName n="England Church" type="church">church of England</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2417"/>Nevertheless there was good-reason to conclude, that whatever tended to impress the people at large with a dislike and jealousy of Popery would lead them to make more vigorous efforts to prevent the return to the throne of a family now devotedly attached to that system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2418"/>With this object, accordingly, <persName n="Towgood,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0016.00396.01290" reg="nearbymention:Towgood,Matthew,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Towgood</surname></persName> preached and published a sermon, containing <q direct="unspecified">a summary of the errors, absurdities, and iniquities of Popery&mdash; <pb id="p.397" n="397"/> shewing its worship to be idolatrous, its doctrine corrupt, and its moral conduct entirely repugnant to the precepts of our Divine Master.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2419"/>About the same time he republished, with a similar view, the statements of Bishops <placeName reg="Burnet shop">Burnet</placeName> and <placeName reg="Lloyd shop">Lloyd</placeName>, tending to prove that <q direct="unspecified">the <name>Pretender</name></q> was not really the son of <persName><foreName>James</foreName> <genName n="2">II</genName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2420"/>There are few, we believe, who are not now perfectly convinced that these statements were utterly groundless; and it is somewhat mortifying to think, that at this or at any period the great interests of civil and religious liberty could not be safely trusted to their own merits, but required to be bolstered up by giving renewed currency to a gross delusion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2421"/>In the same year appeared <persName n="White,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0016.00397.01291" reg="mostcommon:White,N.,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>White</surname></persName>'s<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2423"/>He also published an answer to the <q direct="unspecified">Free and Candid Disquisitions,</q> and a tract entitled <q direct="unspecified">The Protestant Englishman guarded against the <name>Arts</name> and Arguments of Roman Papists and Emissaries.</q></p></note> Letters to a Gentleman dissenting from the <orgName n="England Church" type="church">Church of England</orgName>, which gave rise to <persName n="Towgood,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0016.00397.01293" reg="nearbymention:Towgood,Matthew,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Towgood</surname></persName>'s most important and memorable publication, which has for ever given his name an honourable connexion with the great cause of religious liberty&mdash;of free and unbiassed inquiry after religious truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2424"/>The reply to <persName n="White,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0016.00397.01294" reg="mostcommon:White,N.,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>White</surname></persName>, entitled <q direct="unspecified">The Dissenting Gentleman's Letters,</q> contains as complete and satisfactory a view as is any where to be met with, of the principles on which a separation from the <orgName n="England Church" type="church">Church of England</orgName> may be fully justified on the part of those who conscientiously dissent from its doctrines, object to its constitution and discipline, and, above all, disapprove of its connexion <pb id="p.398" n="398"/> with and dependance on the state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2425"/>The controversial character of this work, which doubtless added materially to its popularity and extensive circulation, and, consequently, to its effect in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance, may perhaps, in some slight degree, diminish its interest at present; when the publication to which it is an answer has long ceased to attract any notice, and would, in fact, have been altogether forgotten, but for the refutation in which its title and some of its most remarkable passages are embodied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2426"/>It is, however, an excellent model of the controversial style, and well deserves to be studied in this point of view by every <num value="1">one</num> who finds it necessary to engage in a personal contest of this kind, and is desirous, at the same time, that he does full justice to his cause and his argument, never to forget that he has also to sustain the characters of a scholar, a gentleman, and a christian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2427"/>The author is very successful in taking advantage of his opponent's mistakes and oversights, and yet does it not in such a manner as to lead to the suspicion that he is contending for victory rather than for truth,&mdash;that he is enabled by superior acuteness and dexterity to make the worse appear the better cause,&mdash;or that he owes his success not to the intrinsic force of his reasoning, but to the weakness and mismanagement of his assailant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2428"/>There is just enough of playful good-natured satire bestowed on the weak points of his adversary's case to give the work a sufficiency of that seasoning, without which a dry discussion of questions of this nature would, perhaps, scarcely be read; and yet in no instance does he condescend to such reflections as appear to be intended merely to give pain to any <num value="1">one</num>, <pb id="p.399" n="399"/> however opposed in sentiment or profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2429"/>Though it must be confessed that his style rises occasionally to the tone of well-merited indignation when he is forced to expose and comment in the only suitable terms on some remarkable examples of gross, and it is difficult not to say wilful, misrepresentation, still he never forgets the obvious and important rule, which so few public disputants have attended to as carefully as could be wished, to confine himself to the argument, and never to indulge in personal reflections, in order to blacken or depreciate the character of his opponent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2430"/>Passing over without notice the invidious remarks with which <persName n="White,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0016.00399.01295" reg="mostcommon:White,N.,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>White</surname></persName> had filled his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> letter on the lives of dissenters as compared with those of churchmen, which he justly regards as having nothing to do with the question, our author at once lays the foundation of his case in the unwarrantable pretension of the <orgName n="England Church" type="church">Church of England</orgName> to decree rites and ceremonies, and to exercise authority in matters of faith; at the same time that she disclaims that infallibility which could alone render such a pretension plausible or consistent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2431"/>He maintains that the whole controversy may properly be considered as turning upon this single point; and shews that the assertion of such a claim involves a complete desertion of the only ground on which a separation from the <orgName n="Rome Church" type="church">Church of Rome</orgName> can be successfully vindicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2432"/>Accordingly, he shews that, whenever the partizan of the <orgName n="English Church" type="church">English church</orgName> is called on to argue this matter with the <name>Romanist</name>, he finds it necessary immediately to desert his favourite ground of authority, and assume the position and <pb id="p.400" n="400"/> weapons of the dissenter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2433"/><hi rend="italics">Then</hi> the talk is of free inquiry and the right of private judgment; then the words of <persName n="Chillingworth,,,,," id="n0300.0016.00400.01296" reg="mostcommon:Chillingworth,nomatch:0"><surname>Chillingworth</surname></persName> are quoted, <q direct="unspecified">The <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, and the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> only, is the religion of Protestants;</q> a principle which, as our author justly observes, if followed out consistently to its practical results, would have driven <persName n="Chillingworth,,,,," id="n0300.0016.00400.01297" reg="mostcommon:Chillingworth,nomatch:0"><surname>Chillingworth</surname></persName> himself, and <persName n="Hales,,,,," id="n0300.0016.00400.01298" reg="mostcommon:Hales,nomatch:0"><surname>Hales</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Middleton,,,,," id="n0300.0016.00400.01299" reg="mostcommon:Middleton,nomatch:0"><surname>Middleton</surname></persName>, and many others who have resorted to it, to take up their lot with the dissenters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2434"/>The consequence is, that, as a controversialist, the churchman is continually placing himself in what may be called a <q direct="unspecified">false position,</q> between <num value="2">two</num> fires: the <name>Papist</name> reminds him of the high and lordly tone with which he asserts church-authority in his argument with the <name>Dissenter</name>, who, in his turn, points out to him the inevitable conclusion from the true Protestant principle which he himself advances in his dispute with the <name>Papist</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2435"/>But the great difficulty in which the assertion of this claim on the part of the <orgName n="England Church" type="church">Church of England</orgName> involves its supporters, is the question, Who constitute the church?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2436"/>in whom is this authority vested?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2437"/>A church is well defined in <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Articles</rs>, <q direct="unspecified">a congregation of faithful men, assembled for the worship of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and professing faith in our <persName n="Christ,Lord,Jesus,,," id="n0300.0016.00400.01300" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName>;</q> but it is evidently not in this sense that the term is here to be understood, for the bulk of the congregation have never been even consulted on the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2438"/>Neither does the clergyman, or even the whole body of clergy throughout the land, with the bishops and archbishops at their head, constitute the church in the sense here inquired after.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2452"/>This volume consists chiefly of a series of arranged extracts from the principal original historians of that period; selecting, frequently in preference, those who, from party bias or personal connexions, might be supposed, or were universally understood, to be prejudiced in favour of the royal <pb id="p.403" n="403"/> Cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2453"/>The evidence seems to be stated on both sides with fairness and impartiality; though certainly it is difficult for any statement of the oppressive tyranny, the despotic spirit, the utter absence of all regard to principle, consistency, of sincerity, which marked the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure> of this unhappy reign, to go beyond that which is here quoted from the most friendly witnesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2454"/>The work is drawn up with ability, and shews, what might be expected in a writer who took so warm an interest in discussions of this nature, an intimate acquaintance with the sources of original information relating to this period of <name>English</name> history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2455"/>It is observable, however, that the author appears to have <num value="2">two</num> objects in view, which are barely consistent with each other;&mdash;the <num value="1">one</num>, to shew that <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName></persName> was in no way entitled to be venerated as a martyr, or worshiped as a saint; the other, to vindicate the <name>Presbyterians</name> from the charge of having had any hand in his <q direct="unspecified">murder.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2456"/>To make out the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> point, he presents a picture, unimpeachable either in its outlines or its darkest shades, of misgovernment in every possible form of tyranny, extortion, oppression, gross partiality, religious persecution, and an utter disregard of all principle and integrity, which seemed from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to lead only, to <num value="1">one</num> conclusion, and to render the final catastrophe all but inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2457"/>Certainly, if the crown implies a trust reposed in him who wears it, if it not merely confers rights, but imposes duties, and if there can be such a thing as treason on the part of a monarch towards the people subjected to his rule, then had <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName> rendered himself liable to its penalties; and unless there is <num value="1">one</num> rule of equity <pb id="p.404" n="404"/> and justice applicable to crowned heads and another to the rest of mankind, the only considerations which could have saved him from his merited fate were simply those of a prudential nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2458"/>It might well have been made a question by those who had no doubt in their own minds of <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName>'s guilt in a moral point of view, whether, in the then state of parties and of popular prejudices in behalf of royalty, the interests of the nation would not be seriously endangered by pushing matters to this extremity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2459"/>On the other hand, it is not easy to see what alternative was left after what had passed, consistently with a proper regard to the general security of the people at large, and still more so of those who had been actively engaged on the popular side; knowing as they did from repeated experience, that no reliance was to be placed on the king's professions, or even on his most solemn engagements; which his whole conduct shewed that he was determined to observe only so long, and in such cases, as it appeared to be necessary or suitable to his own convenience.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2460"/>But, whatever may be the merit or demerit of the proceedings which finally brought <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName> to the block, <persName n="Towgoodshews,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0016.00404.01303" reg="mostcommon:Towgoodshews,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Towgoodshews</surname></persName> plainly enough, that the <name>Presbyterians</name> are not more entitled to claim the <num value="1">one</num> than they are liable to the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2461"/>A large majority of both houses of parliament were in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance friendly to the established church; and, afterwards, the extreme measures which ended in the death of the king were urged forward by the independent party and the army, notwithstanding the most strenuous opposition of the <name>Presbyterians</name> both in and out of parliament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2462"/>In <pb id="p.405" n="405"/> fact, the only public body which had the courage at the last to protest against the trial and execution of the king, was the assembly of Presbyterian ministers in and about <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, whose conduct on this occasion, whatever we may think of its wisdom, certainly did great credit to their manly spirit and intrepidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2463"/>For this and other reasons, their party, far from promoting the new order of things which was now sought to be introduced, did all they could to thwart it; insomuch that to them is in a great measure to be ascribed the final failure of this bold attempt at political renovation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2464"/>If this powerful body, instead of throwing their whole weight into the opposite scale, had given their cordial support to the able and enlightened statesmen who were then placed at the head of affairs, who shall say that they might not have succeeded in placing on a permanent basis the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2465"/>It was to the same party that the nation was afterwards mainly indebted for the unconditional restoration of <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName> <genName n="2">II</genName></persName>.; a step which that unprincipled monarch soon gave them abundant cause to repent of.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2468"/>The variations prove to be even more numerous than had been imagined, and some of them are of considerable importance; tending for the most part to soften the evidence afforded by various passages against the royalists, and to blacken the character of several of the parliamentary leaders.</p></note> <pb id="p.406" n="406"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2471"/>For though he had not come forward as a controversial writer on doctrinal points, yet it was well known that he had long ago abandoned the distinguishing tenets of the <name>Calvinistic</name> and Trinitarian theology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2472"/>His views on these subjects appear to have coincided for the most part with those of <persName n="Peirce,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0016.00406.01314" reg="mostcommon:Peirce,James,,,:5"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Peirce</surname></persName> and the leading <rs>Arians</rs> of the early part of the last century; or, perhaps, in some particulars he deviated further than they did from the standard of what is called orthodoxy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2473"/>There can, however, be no doubt that at this period a large proportion of the congregation <pb id="p.407" n="407"/> with which he was about to be connected retained the religious principles of their forefathers; and therefore, in complying with their invitation, <persName n="Towgood,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0016.00407.01315" reg="nearbymention:Towgood,Micaiah,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Towgood</surname></persName> entered on a station of great delicacy and difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2474"/>It is always a nice line for a minister to draw in such cases between the contending claims of sincerity and benevolence; to study at the same time the things which make for peace, and those which he conscientiously believes to be most conducive to the edification of his hearers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2475"/><q direct="unspecified">He never gave up (says his biographer, <persName n="Manning,Mister,,,," id="n0300.0016.00407.01316" reg="mostcommon:Manning,W.,,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Manning</surname></persName>) what he thought an essential article of faith in order to please men; but by his justly acquired reputation as a writer, by diligent and affectionate assiduity in the various branches of the pastoral office, by the force of <name>Christian</name> meekness, condescension, and a readiness to do them all kinds of good offices, he conciliated their affection and esteem, and constrained them to forego their objections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2476"/>He considered and accommodated himself to the different tempers, prejudices, and infirmities of mankind, as far as a good conscience would allow, and imagined himself fully justified in this conduct by the behaviour of our blessed <rs type="role2">Lord</rs> and his Apostles, and the prudential and pacific maxims of the New Testament.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2517"/>On this occasion, in addition to a substantial testimony of their respect and affection, the united congregations addressed to him a request that he would publish some of his discourses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2518"/>This request he declined; but, to gratify in some measure the wishes of his friends, he published a very interesting and impressive address to them <q direct="unspecified">On the <rs type="place">Grounds of Faith</rs> in <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n0300.0016.00413.01342" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName>.</q>

He then contemplates the glorious superstructure erected on this foundation; under which head he gives his own most matured and final views of the leading points of <name>Christian</name> doctrine, regarding <name n="God" type="God">God</name> as in himself and essentially the compassionate Father of mankind, in whom dwells every conceivable perfection; who sent his only begotten <pb id="p.414" n="414"/> Son, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-born of every creature, to enter into a solemn covenant with all sincere and humble penitents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2526"/>From this extract, and the general strain of this discourse, it will appear that his views of the atonement differed only by a slight shade from those which most Unitarians would readily assent <pb id="p.415" n="415"/> to. As for the doctrine of original sin, it is scarcely necessary to say, that he utterly rejected it, as absurd in itself, degrading to the human nature, and injurious to the divine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2527"/>He believed in the personality of the <rs>Holy Spirit</rs>; but represents him as a subordinate agent acting under the direction of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0300.0016.00415.01344" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, by whom he is sent as the <name>Comforter</name> or Advocate, strengthening, inspiring, and directing his disciples in the great work which was given them to do. After a glowing and animated sketch of the blessings and privileges derived from the <name>Gospel</name> dispensation, he affectionately exhorts to a diligent use of all the means of grace, and especially the commemorative service of the <name>Supper</name>; his views of the nature and design of which he states more at large, and concludes the whole with a short but earnest and impressive appeal, which cannot be read without emotion, and must have gone to the hearts of those who for so many years had profited by his labours and instructions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2528"/>This little work, the parting gift of an aged pastor to his flock, is a production of no ordinary merit and value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2529"/>When we consider his advanced age, and the circumstances under which it was written, it must leave on the reader a most favourable impression of the mind and heart,&mdash;of the talent, the amiable dispositions, and pious sentiments of the author; and its very excellence increases our regret that it should be almost the only specimen which is left to us of the practical and devotional compositions of this highly gifted man. The publications by which he is chiefly known to the world, though many of them highly valuable and excellent in themselves, yet, from <pb id="p.416" n="416"/> their argumentative and even controversial character, do not give a complete or adequate picture of his mind, nor do they present that view of it which is both most interesting in itself and likely to be most edifying and instructive.</p>
