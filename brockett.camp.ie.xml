<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>This book, friendly reader, was not created; like Topsy, <quote>it growed.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>The author or compiler, whichever term you may choose to give him, had for <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> past been a not uninterested observer of the great struggle, which it had been his duty elsewhere to chronicle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>In his researches into the causes and events of the war, its fearful battles, its alternations of light and shadow, its changes of policy, and its final and glorious triumphs, he had had abundant occasion to notice those personal achievements, those noble sacrifices, and that fearless devotion to the national cause which have so greatly distinguished this conflict In the pages of a history of the war, such narratives and incidents could find no place: yet it seemed unjust to the great souls who had laid every thing upon their country's altar, with out a murmur or a sigh, that their glorious sacrifices should not be held in grateful remembrance; and it was from the desire to do some justice to their memory, that at an early day the writer commenced, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> for his own private reading merely, the collection of narratives and incidents of personal adventure and sacrifice in the war. Some of these were found in print, in books, periodicals, and newspapers; others were preserved in the annals or reports of charitable institutions, like the <name>Sanitary</name> and Christian Commissions; a few had found record from a poet's pen, and a considerable number <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> though matters of oral tradition, had never appeared in print but were gleaned from the narrations of the parties themselves or their friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>The garnering of these was a work of great delight to the writer, and as time passed on he felt desirous that others should share the pleasure he had enjoyed, in the perusal o0 the heroic deeds of his countrymen and countrywomen; and so the book grew into such form and symmetry as it now possesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>In the hands of the <rs>American</rs> public he loaves it, with the conviction that they will be lenient to any faults they may observe in it, and will appreciate his honest and pains-taking endeavor to present to them a record of some of the personal adventures and incidents of the war.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>This spy was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to assure us positively that <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00026.00211" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> would fight at <placeName reg="Stones River, Tennessee, United States" key="tgn,2696868">Stone river</placeName>, telling us of that general's boast, that <quote>he would whip <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00026.00212" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> back to <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> if it cost <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> men.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>For the <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> service thus rendered by our spy he was paid <measure n="5000dollars" type="currency">five thousand dollars</measure> by order of our general, and the author saw the money passed to him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>In <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct> there lived in the <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">State of Kentucky</placeName> a Union man, with his wife and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>He was a friend of the <rs>Union</rs>, and an anti-slavery man upon principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>After the rebellion broke out, and when the <quote>Southern heart</quote> had become fired, this man, living in a strong pro-slavery region, and surrounded by opulent slaveholders-his own family connections and those of his wife being also wealthy and bitter secessionists-very prudently held his peace, feeling his utter inability to stem the tide of the rebellion in his section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>This reticence, together with his known Southern birth and relations, enabled him to <pb id="p.27" n="27"/> pass unsuspected, and almost unobserved, at a time when <persName n="Breckinridge,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00027.00213" reg="mostcommon:Breckinridge,Robert,I.,,:1"><surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName>, <persName n="Marshall,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00027.00214" reg="mostcommon:Marshall,nomatch:0"><surname>Marshall</surname></persName>, <persName n="Preston,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00027.00215" reg="mostcommon:Preston,nomatch:0"><surname>Preston</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Buckner,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00027.00216" reg="mostcommon:Buckner,nomatch:0"><surname>Buckner</surname></persName>, and other ardent politicians of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> chose the rebellion as their portion, and endeavored to carry with them the <rs>State</rs> amidst a blaze of excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Thus, without tacit admissions or any direct action upon his part, the gentleman of whom we write was classed by the people of his section as a secessionist.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>Circumstances occurred during that year by which this person was brought into contact with a Federal commander in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, <persName n="Nelson,General,,,," id="n0162.0008.00027.00217" reg="mostcommon:Nelson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Nelson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>Their meeting and acquaintance was accidental.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Mutual Union sentiments begat personal sympathy and friendship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/><persName n="Nelson,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00027.00218" reg="mostcommon:Nelson,nomatch:0"><surname>Nelson</surname></persName> wished a certain service performed in the rebel territory and he persuaded the citizen to undertake it &mdash; which the latter finally did as a matter of duty,--we are assured,--rather than of gain, for he made no charge for the service after its speedy and successful performance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>Soon after, a similar work was necessary; and again was the citizen importuned, and he again consented, but did not consider himself as a professional spy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>During this or a similar trip, and while at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, our man heard of the sudden death of <persName n="Nelson,General,,,," id="n0162.0008.00027.00219" reg="mostcommon:Nelson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Nelson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>He was now at a loss what to do. Finally he determined to return and report his business to <persName n="Rosecrans,Major-General,,,," id="n0162.0008.00027.00220" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>, who had assumed command of the <rs>Federal</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>Thus resolved, he proceeded to finish his mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>After ascertaining the position of military affairs at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, he came to <placeName reg="Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,7014175">Murfreesboro</placeName>, where <orgName n="army"><persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00027.00221" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> was then collecting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>Staying here several days, he was urged by his Southern army friends to act as their spy in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>The better to conceal <pb id="p.28" n="28"/> his own feelings and position, he consented to do so, and he left <placeName><persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n0162.0008.00028.00222" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s headquarters</placeName> to go to that State by way of <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, feigning important business, and from thence to go to his home, passing by and through <orgName n="army"><persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00028.00223" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>' army</orgName> as it lay stretched out between <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> and <placeName reg="Louisville, Jefferson, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013915">Louisville</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>The nameless man now makes his way to the <rs>Federal</rs> headquarters, seeks a private interview with <persName n="Rosecrans,General,,,," id="n0162.0008.00028.00224" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>, and states his case fully as we have just related.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>Here was something remarkable, surely &mdash; a spy in the confidence of the commanders of <num value="2">two</num> great opposing armies!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>Our general took much pains to satisfy himself of the honesty and soundness of the stranger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>He was pleased with the man's candid manner, and his story bore an air of consistency and truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>Yet, he was a Southerner, surrounded by rebellious influences, and enjoyed <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00028.00225" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s confidence; and what guarantee could be given that he was a Union man at heart?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>None; and <persName n="Rosecrans,General,,,," id="n0162.0008.00028.00226" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>, in great perplexity, held council with his <rs type="role" reg="Chief of Police">Chief of Police</rs>, and requested the latter to <quote>dig up</quote> the case to its very root.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>This was done; but in what manner we need not specially state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>Satisfied that it would do to trust the spy, to a certain extent at least, he was now sent on his way to perform his mission for <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00028.00227" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>At all events, that scheming general so supposed when our man's report was made at the rebel headquarters a few days afterward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>His information was very acceptable to <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00028.00228" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>; but we strongly question its value to rebeldom, as the spy reported only what he was told by that old fox <persName n="Truesdail,Colonel,,,," id="n0162.0008.00028.00229" reg="nearbymention:Truesdail,William,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Truesdail</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>Perhaps the reader will inquire, how can we answer for the report thus made to <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00028.00230" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>it may have been <pb id="p.29" n="29"/> more true and valuable than we supposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>Well, there is force in the query.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>We are fallen upon strange times, when honesty, virtue, and patriotism are at heavy discount in rebeldom, and the <rs>Indian</rs>'s idea of the uncertainty of white men is by no means a myth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>However, we were then quite confident of the worthlessness of the report of our spy to <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00029.00231" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>, because <hi rend="italics">he had nothing else</hi> to tell him. For <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure> did our spy keep himself locked in a private room in the police building at <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>His meals were carried to him by a trusty servant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>His door was <quote>shadowed</quote> constantly by our best detectives, and so were his steps if he ventured upon the street for a few moments after dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>It was cold and bleak winter weather, and he toasted himself before his comfortable fire, read books and papers, and conferred often with the <rs type="role" reg="Chief of Police">Chief of Police</rs> and his assistant, affording them, strangers as they were to that region of country, a fund of valuable information respecting the rebels of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>He was a man of fine address and good intellectual attainments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>When our man concluded it was about time for his return to <orgName n="army"><persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00029.00232" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, he was politely escorted by our mounted police to a proper point beyond our lines, and by a route where he would see nothing of our forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>The reader will now appreciate the grounds of our confidence, we doubt not, in the worthlessness of at least <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Bragg,General,Braxton,,," id="n0162.0008.00029.00233" reg="default:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Braxton</foreName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s spy reports.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>In due time this nameless gentleman again enters our lines, and is escorted in by our pickets to the general commanding, to whom he reports in person concerning all that is transpiring in <orgName n="army"><persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00029.00234" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> at <placeName reg="Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,7014175">Murfreesboro</placeName>, and then he resumes his pleasant private quarters at the <pb id="p.30" n="30"/> army police building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>How little could the rebel <persName n="Zollicoffer,General,,,," id="n0162.0008.00030.00235" reg="mostcommon:Zollicoffer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Zollicoffer</surname></persName> have thought, or have imagined as the wildest dream, while building his elegant house in <address><street n="High street">High street</street></address>, <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, that its gorgeous rooms should ever be devoted to such purposes!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>After a brief stay, another trip was made by our man to <placeName><persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00030.00236" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s headquarters</placeName>, we using the same precautions as previously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>In fact, our spy desired and even demanded, such attention at the hands of the <rs type="role" reg="Chief of Police">Chief of Police</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The report he carried to <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00030.00237" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> on his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> trip delighted the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>His officers talked with our man freely, and after staying at <placeName reg="Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,7014175">Murfreesboro</placeName> <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, and riding and walking all about in the most innocent and unconcerned manner, he was again sent back to <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> to <quote>fool that slow Dutchman, <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00030.00238" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>,</quote> as <num value="1">one</num> of the rebel officers remarked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>Of the importance of the report now brought to the <quote>slow Dutchman</quote> we need not state further than that it contributed its due weight to a decision fraught with tremendous consequences to the army and to the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Marching orders were soon after issued for the advance of the <orgName n="Army of the Cumberland" type="army">Army of the Cumberland</orgName> upon <placeName reg="Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,7014175">Murfreesboro</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Now commenced a period of excessive labor and peril for the nameless spy. <persName n="Rosecrans,General,,,," id="n0162.0008.00030.00239" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> and <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00030.00240" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> each wanted instant and constant information as the armies approached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The minutiae of this man's work for <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure> we need not stop to relate it is easily imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>Within that time he entered the rebel <pb id="p.31" n="31"/> lines and returned <num value="3">three</num> times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>He gave the outline of <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00031.00241" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s line of battle, a close estimate of his force, an accurate account of his artillery and his earthworks, the movements of the rebel wagon and railroad trains, etc., etc. He was very earnest in assuring <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00031.00242" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> that <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00031.00243" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> intended to give severe battle with superior numbers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>This information proved true in all essentials, and its value to the country was inestimable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>We had other spies piercing the rebel lines at this time, but they did not enjoy the facilities possessed by the nameless <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Almost with anguish did he exclaim against himself, in the presence of the author, for the severe manner in which he was deceiving the rebel general and involving the lives of his <num value="1000">thousands</num> of brave but deluded followers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>After the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> great battle the work of such a spy is ended, or, rather, it ceases when the shock of arms comes on. Thenceforth the armies are moved upon the instant, as circumstances may require.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>Our man, who, during the <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure>, had been almost incessantly in the saddle, or with his ears and eyes painfully observant while in the camps, took leave of our army upon the battle field, and retired to a place of rest.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/><num value="1">One</num> incident occurred, during his last visit to <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00031.00244" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>, which is worthy of mention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>That general took alarm in consequence of his report, and at once started a special messenger to <persName n="Morgan,General,John,H.,," id="n0162.0008.00031.00245" reg="default:Morgan,John,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Morgan</surname></persName>-who was then absent with his cavalry in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> to destroy <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00031.00246" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>' railroad communications (in which <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00031.00247" reg="nearbymention:Morgan,John,H.,,"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName> succeeded)-to return instantly with his commmand by forced marches to <placeName reg="Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,7014175">Murfreesboro</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>That same night our man reported this fact to the <rs>Federal</rs> commander, <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> described the messenger and what route he would take, etc. The information was telegraphed at once to <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, <placeName reg="Gallatin, Sumner, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099234">Gallatin</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7013447;tgn,2031150;tgn,7013448" n="0.202 000000.8075	placename;tgn,7013447;Bowling Green, Warren, Kentucky,Warren,Kentucky,United States,North and Central America;0.136 000000.5454	placename;tgn,2031150;Bowling Green, Parke, Indiana,Parke,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;0.068 000000.2727	placename;tgn,7013448;Bowling Green, Wood, Ohio,Wood,Ohio,United States,North and Central America" reg="Bowling Green, Warren, Kentucky,Warren,Kentucky,United States,North and Central America;Bowling Green, Parke, Indiana,Parke,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;Bowling Green, Wood, Ohio,Wood,Ohio,United States,North and Central America">Bowling Green</placeName>, and a force was sent from each of those posts to intercept the messenger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>They failed to apprehend him-which, however, proved of no consequence, as the battles of <placeName reg="Stones River, Tennessee, United States" key="tgn,2696868">Stone River</placeName> were fought, and <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0162.0008.00032.00248" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> was on his retreat from <placeName reg="Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,7014175">Murfreesboro</placeName> by the time <rs>Morgan</rs> could have received the orders.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Our spy was a brave man: yet, during the last <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> of his service he was most sensible of its peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>To pass between hostile lines in the lone hours of the night --for he did not wait for daylight &mdash; to be halted by guerrillas and scouts and pickets, with guns aimed at him, and, finally, to meet and satisfy the anxious, keen eyed, heart searching rebel officers as well as our own, was a mental as well as physical demand that could not long be sustained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>While proceeding upon his last expedition, the author met the nameless <num value="1">one</num> upon a byroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>We halted our horses, drew near, and conversed a few seconds in private, while our attendants and companions moved on.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>He had been unable, amid the hurry and excitement, to make some final disposition of his affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>About <placeName><distance reg="5miles">five miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Fayetteville, Lincoln, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099101">Fayetteville</placeName></placeName> is a very noted highland called <placeName reg="Wells Hill, Lincoln, Tennessee" key="tgn,2756725">Wells' Hill</placeName>, and on the top of it there is a fork in the road, the left going directly south to <placeName reg="Huntsville, Madison, Alabama" key="tgn,7013732">Huntsville</placeName>, and the right to <placeName reg="Athens, Limestone, Alabama" key="tgn,2002521">Athens</placeName> and <placeName reg="Decatur, Meigs, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098787">Decatur</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>On reaching this road, I was in the act of turning into it, when I looked across on still another road, called the <placeName reg="Meridian, Lauderdale, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056956">Meridian</placeName> road, and discovered a train of wagons coming slowly up the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>I watched it till I saw there was no guard near, and then riding around till I met the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> wagon, I caused it to be drawn close along against the fence, and there stopped; then the next <num value="2">two</num> to be drawn close alongside, thus making an effectual barricade against any force which was approaching from that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Next I seized the wagon master, who was some distance in the rear of the train, and shoved him and the drivers up into the fence corner, making <num value="1">one</num> of them turn the mules loose from the wagons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>The loads were covered with corn blades and other forage, so <num value="1">one</num> could not see them, but the drivers told me that the wagons were loaded with bacon.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>After arranging things to my satisfaction, I produced a bunch of matches, and fired the fodder on the top of each of the wagers, which were of the old-fashioned <pb id="p.42" n="42"/> curved bodies, <placeName reg="Conestoga, Lancaster, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2087436">Conestoga</placeName> pattern, each of which had on it <measure n="4000l." type="pounds"><num value="4000">four thousand</num> pounds</measure> of bacon.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>The guns of the party all happened to be in the wagons, and none of them had any side arms, except the wagon master, who had something under his coat that looked like a pistol; and as he wore a belt, it is very probable he had <num value="1">one</num>; and some of the citizens, I know had, for I saw <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> of them; but I was ready to shoot before they could recover from their surprise, so that it would have been foolhardy for them to resist, as I would certainly have killed the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> man who made a motion to draw a weapon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>I made no attempt to take their side arms, as I did not want to lose my advantage over them for an instant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>There were <num value="3">three</num> good guns burned up in the wagons, <num value="1">one</num> a double barrelled shot gun, and <num value="2">two</num> old muskets.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>When the flames shot up, several citizens came to the scene of action, but I thrust them into the fence corner, along with the wagon master and teamsters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>As soon as the wagons were so far destroyed that they began to fall down, and I saw that it would be impossible to save any thing of the wreck, I made the drivers mount the mules, and the wagon master his horse, and taking them on the road to <placeName reg="Fayetteville, Lincoln, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099101">Fayetteville</placeName>, I told them that I was going to count <num value="100">one hundred</num>; and that if, by that time, they were not out of sight, I would shoot the last <num value="1">one</num> of them within range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>I then began to count; <quote><num value="1">one</num>,</quote> <quote><num value="2">two</num>,</quote> <quote><num value="3">three</num>,</quote> etc., very deliberately, while they put spurs to their steeds, and in a brief time they were beyond my ken, over the hills, toward <placeName reg="Fayetteville, Lincoln, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099101">Fayetteville</placeName>, to give the inhabitants an account of my <name>Yankee</name> trick.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>As I passed the burning wagons again, I told the citizens standing around, that if they did not leave instanter, I would shoot the last <num value="1">one</num> of them, and they scattered like blackbirds.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/> About <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> farther down the road, I heard the deep, sonorous tones of a preacher, belaboring a sinful congregation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>He was evidently a devout believer in a terrible and endless punishment for the wicked, for he was holding out to his audience the fearful picture of a lost sinner in hell; making a comparison between his condition and that of <persName n="Dives,,,,," id="n0162.0010.00043.00282" reg="mostcommon:Dives,nomatch:0"><surname>Dives</surname></persName>, who, he asserted, was once in a similar state of sinfulness while on earth, and who eventually brought up in hell, and from whence he expressed a strong desire to visit <persName><foreName>Abraham</foreName></persName> in his new abode; adding that the wishes of the unfortunate <rs>Dives</rs> could not be complied with for some geographical cause --something in the topography of the country &mdash; a gulf in the way, I believe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Over this subject he grew eloquent, and had probably got about to his <quote>thirdly,</quote> and the congregation were almost breathless with attention, when it occurred to me that there might be soldiers in the church, and I had better look after them ; otherwise they might give me some trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Riding up to the door, I made my horse enter about half way, so that I could see every man in the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>As his feet struck the floor of the church, with a loud, banging sound, the people were astonished to see a soldier, under arms, riding boldly in among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Turning to the preacher, I inquired if there were any southern soldiers in the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>The clergyman was standing with his hand raised, as he was about to enforce some point he bad made, being the <pb id="p.44" n="44"/> very picture of earnest honesty, looking as if he believed every word that he had said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>When he saw me, his hand dropped, and he seemed as badly frightened as if the identical devil he had so vividly described had appeared before him. He was almost overpowered with fright, and supporting himself by the rough pulpit, he glanced at the back door, and then faltered out: <quote> Not now, I believe, sir.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>I saw that there had been rebel soldiers there, and that they had escaped in the direction of his glance; I instantly pulled my horse back, and spurred to the corner of the log church, just in time to see <num value="4">four</num> men disappear in the brush across a field which lay back of the building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>They were too far off for me to shoot at, and not desiring to disturb the worship further than the strictest military necessity demanded, I rode on, after desiring the clergyman to pray for the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>The rebel papers had an account of the affair, but they lied when they stated that I tried to make the preacher take a drink of whiskey; for I hadn't a drop to bless myself with.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/> Pretty soon I met <num value="2">two</num> soldiers riding leisurely along to church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>I halted them, demanded their names, regiments, and companies, and informed them that they were prisoners of war; that I was a federal soldier, but that there was no way for me to dispose of them so far from our lines except <num value="1">one</num>; I was sorry it was so-but I must shoot them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>They begged I would spare their lives, and pledged their honor that they would go with me in good faith, if I would not kill them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>I pretended to be in a deep study for a few moments, and then told them if they would take the oath of allegiance to the <pb id="p.45" n="45"/> <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> I would let them go; and to this they agreed eagerly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Holding up my right hand, and removing my cap, they imitated my example, uncovered their heads, raised their hands, and with a solemn look, that would well become a court room, waited for me to administer <quote> the oath.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>I had joked them far enough, however, and not wishing to be guilty of blasphemy by administering an obligation I had no authority to require of them, I told them that I would rely upon their honor, but they must do nothing toward pursuing me, or giving information concerning my whereabouts; and I then told them to <quote>go in peace.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/> The next man I met was an old citizen, riding a very spirited horse, and dressed in a suit of butternut-colored homespun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>Tall, thin featured, and gaunt, he was the very picture of a secesh planter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>I stopped him, and inquired the way to <placeName reg="Camargo, Lincoln, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098229">Camargo</placeName>; he pointed to the road he had just left, and told me to follow that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>I now told him I was a <orgName n="Confederate Officer" type="org">confederate officer</orgName>, and that I had orders from <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0162.0010.00045.00283" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> to gather up all the stragglers I could find, and bring them forthwith to <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>; that we were expecting a great battle there with our <quote> detestable foe,</quote> the <rs>Yankees</rs>, and that it was absolutely necessary for every <num value="1">one</num> to be at his post.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/> <quote> You will,</quote> said I, <quote> do me a favor and your country good service by giving me the names of all soldiers who are at home without leave in your neighborhood.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/> <quote>Certainly, sir,</quote> he replied; <quote> I will do so with pleasure; and if I had time,</quote> he added, <quote>I would go with you, and help to find them.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>I then drew out a note-book, and wrote down each <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> name he gave me, with the company and regiment of each man, together with his residence; and then asked him to refer me to some responsible citizens, who would give assistance if necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>He gave me the names of half a dozen, who, he said, would not only assist me, but would give the names of other delinquents.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/> He now prepared to ask me a few questions, and preface them with the statement that he was the <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</rs>, of <placeName reg="," key="possibilities=25">Lincoln county</placeName>, and that he was on his way to <placeName reg="Fayetteville, Lincoln, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099101">Fayetteville</placeName> to open court on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/> <quote> Are there many cases to be disposed of?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>I asked.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/> <quote>Yes, a good many,</quote> he said.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/> <quote>What is their nature generally?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>was my next inquiry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/> <quote>Why, they are mostly political,</quote> said he.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>I was at no loss to know what the phrase meant; the accused were Union men, who, true to their principles, had refused to yield to the demands of the secessionists, but chose persecution rather than dishonor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>I then concluded to have a little fun out of the old fellow, and render the persecuted loyalists what assistance I could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>But as I did not desire to kill him in cold blood, I concluded to frighten him a little by way of punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>Pointing to the dense column of smoke that was rising from the burning bacon, I said, roughly:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/> <quote> Look there, old man.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/> <quote> Why, what in the name of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> does that mean?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>inquired he, raising his eyes in utter astonishment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/> <quote>Why, sir,</quote> I responded, <quote>it means that I am a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> soldier, and I have just burned a rebel train up there, and am now about to dispose of the <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</rs> of <placeName reg="," key="possibilities=25">Lincoln county</placeName></quote> --at the same moment <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> raising the hammer of my gun, and drawing a bead on him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/> <quote> Great <name n="God" type="God">God</name>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>don't kill me, sir,</quote> he piteously pleaded; <quote>don't kill me.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/> <quote> Look here, old man,</quote> said I, savagely, <quote>if I let you live, do you think you will trouble Union men in this county again?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/> <quote><num value="0">0</num>, no, no, I will not.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/> <quote> Won't bring 'em to trial?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>I asked.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/> <quote>No, indeed, I will not,</quote> he solemnly asserted; <quote> I have been compelled to enforce the law,</quote> he then began in extenuation, when I interrupted him with,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/> <quote> Don't talk to me about enforcing the laws, you old reprobate, or I will kill you in your tracks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>Now, see here,</quote> I continued, <quote> I will give you a chance for your life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>This is a level road, and a straight <num value="1">one</num>; now, I will count <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num>, and if you are not out of sight in that time, I shall kill you, just as sure as <name n="God" type="God">God</name> made little apples.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/> I gave the word, and began to count, and he darted off, like an arrow, and was soon lost to my view in a cloud of dust.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>Again taking the <placeName reg="Athens, Limestone, Alabama" key="tgn,2002521">Athens</placeName> road, I pushed on rapidly for some time till I passed several houses, and then, reaching a shallow creek, leading into the woods, I turned down it, so that the place where I left the road could not be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>I traveled up by-ways till next sunset, when I met with an old man, who had just crossed the <placeName reg="Athens, Limestone, Alabama" key="tgn,2002521">Athens</placeName> road, and he told me that he had seen <num value="12">twelve</num> of <orgName n="TN Cavalry"><persName n="Young,,,,," id="n0162.0010.00047.00284" reg="mostcommon:Young,nomatch:0"><surname>Young</surname></persName>'s Tennessee Cavalry</orgName> and <num value="15">fifteen</num> mounted citizens after a man <quote> who had been raising a disturbance up the country.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>He said that I answered <pb id="p.48" n="48"/> the description exactly, and that he believed I was the man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/> <quote> You had better hide somewhere till after dark,</quote> he advised me; <quote>for they are alarming the whole country wherever they go.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/> I saw that he was a Union man, so that I told him that if I kept on riding they could better see and hear me, and perhaps it would give them a chance to bushwhack me. I then told him I wanted to find a sequestered spot, where I could leave my horse, and have him taken care of till I could get him again; and he told me of a very good Union man, who lived down in the woods, away from any public road, and advised me to leave my horse there; and he gave me such directions as would enable me to find the place, which I reached in safety.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/> Leaving my horse, I took to the woods on foot, making direct for <placeName reg="Decatur, Meigs, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098787">Decatur</placeName>, taking the sun for my guide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> night overtook me in the woods very near <placeName reg="Madison depot">Madison depot</placeName>, on the railroad between <placeName reg="Huntsville, Madison, Alabama" key="tgn,7013732">Huntsville</placeName> and <placeName reg="Decatur, Meigs, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098787">Decatur</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>I had tried to travel in the night, but was overtaken by a terrible storm, and the darkness was so great that I could not find my way. Being very tired, I slept soundly, with no other bed than the ground, and no cover but my rubber Talma.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>Soaked with the rain and famished with hunger, he made his way, in the early morning, toward the railroad, and followed it till about <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time>, when near Minerville he found the residence of a Union man, and obtained a meal, his host and himself being mutually suspicious of each other and both acting a part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>Here he met some rebel cavalry soldiers, and passing himself <pb id="p.49" n="49"/> off as a Texan ranger ascertained what were the defences of the railroad bridge he was sent to inspect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>After they were gone, he pursued his journey, seeking the opportunity of reaching and firing the bridge, but falling in with the camp of the (rebel) <orgName type="regiment" key="2TNCav">Second Tennessee Cavalry</orgName>, and though their suspicions were not aroused as to his character, they insisted on fraternizing with him to such an extent that he had great difficulty in shaking them off, and was finally obliged to use threats, which, while they had the effect of driving his pertinacious friends away, rendered his own escape a matter of necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>In attempting this, he got into a swamp, and endeavored to find his way through it to the river, and stealing a boat float down under the bridge and fire it. Failing in this, and knowing that there was no time to be lost, he turned his course and moved northward across the country to find the <rs>Union</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>Travelling all day and until late at night, he was at length startled by the deep-mouthed baying, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, of a single bloodhound, and then soon after of several, and realized at once that the pursuers with their bloodhounds were on his track.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>Turning into a dense body of timber near by, he soon found a stream of water about waist deep, into which he plunged, and having crossed and broken their trail by so doing, he plunged into another swamp, where he kept on for an hour, the water being still nearly to his waist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>Finding at length a pile of new rails rising a little above the water he clambered upon them and was soon asleep, though he could yet hear the distant baying of the hounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>In the morning, benumbed, and almost perishing with cold and hunger he again waded the swamp for half an hour, till he came to <pb id="p.50" n="50"/> the rear of a plantation, and attracting the attention of an aged negro, who, on finding that he was a Yankee soldier, brought him food, procured him a guide, and cheered him on his way. After some farther adventures, in which he confiscated a fine rebel horse and buggy and brought the driver, a stalwart negro, into the <rs>Union</rs> lines, he reached <placeName><persName n="Mitchel,General,,,," id="n0162.0010.00050.00285" reg="nearbymention:Mitchel,O.,M.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Mitchel</surname></persName>'s headquarters</placeName> at <placeName reg="Huntsville, Madison, Alabama" key="tgn,7013732">Huntsville, Alabama</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>Though very weary from his previous adventures, he set out immediately, and riding a powerful, thoroughbred horse at the top of his speed to <placeName><placeName reg="Fayetteville, Lincoln, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099101">Fayetteville</placeName>, <distance reg="36miles">thirty-six miles distant</distance></placeName>, which he made in <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure>, he procured another horse there, and continued his journey at the same rapid rate, but near <placeName reg="Columbia, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098585">Columbia</placeName>, he was so much exhausted that he fell from his horse insensible, and lay an hour, unconscious, on the ground, but recovering his senses, he mounted his horse again and delivered his despatches at <placeName reg="Columbia, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098585">Columbia</placeName>, from whence <persName n="Negley,General,,,," id="n0162.0010.00050.00287" reg="mostcommon:Negley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Negley</surname></persName> telegraphed them to <persName n="Buell,General,,,," id="n0162.0010.00050.00288" reg="mostcommon:Buell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Buell</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>On his return, a negro hailed him and informed him that his master and <num value="8">eight</num> other men were in ambush a little farther on, at a small mill, and intended to kill him. Thanking the negro for the information, he rode rapidly to the mill, and as the miller ran in when he saw him coming, he called him out and charged him with his murderous intention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>He, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> denied it, but being told that it was of no use, and that if he did not own up the whole affair he (Pike) would bring a party of cavalry from <placeName reg="Columbia, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098585">Columbia</placeName> and burn the mill, his house &mdash; and barn, and carry off all his property, he finally confessed who were his confederates and what had been their plans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>Taking down <pb id="p.51" n="51"/> their names, and lecturing the old man severely, <persName n="Pike,Corporal,,,," id="n0162.0010.00051.00289" reg="nearbymention:Pike,James,,,"><roleName n="Corporal">Corporal</roleName> <surname>Pike</surname></persName> rode away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>He soon overtook a comrade from his own regiment, and feeling ill, stopped with his friend and another Union soldier at the house of a citizen, near <placeName reg="Meridian, Lauderdale, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056956">Meridian</placeName>, to pass the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>Here an attempt was made during the night to assassinate him, but being awake and seeing <num value="1">one</num> of the assassins raise and aim his gun at him through the window, he fired his pistol, and wounded the assassin, probably mortally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>Crawling up the bank through the bush, he came close upon the pickets, <num value="7">seven</num> in number, without being observed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>After watching their movements awhile, and finding nothing of particular interest, he returned safely as he went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>Soon afterward, a negro told him of an island in the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee river</placeName>, some <placeName><distance reg="10miles">ten miles</distance> below <placeName key="tgn,2005379" n="1.000 91" reg="stevenson, jackson, alabama">Stevenson</placeName></placeName>, on which a company of guerilla cavalry were in the habit of rendezvousing every night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>This opened a large field of operations for our scout, and he determined to visit the island forthwith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/><num value="1">One</num> afternoon, borrowing a suit of butternut from a negro at <placeName key="tgn,2005379" n="1.000 91" reg="stevenson, jackson, alabama">Stevenson</placeName>, he set forth in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>The butternut clothes were carried under his saddle until he was fairly outside of our lines, when he exchanged his own for them and went on in the character of a genuine native.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>Reaching the river opposite the island after dark, he again constructed a raft of rails, fastening them together this time with grape-vines, and shoved across the narrow channel to the island, landing in a dense canebrake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>Carefully feeling his way through this, he came soon to a corn-crib, around which <num value="25">twenty-five</num> or <num value="30">thirty</num> horses <pb id="p.77" n="77"/> were feeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>Putting his hand down to see how far it was to them, it came in contact with the body of a man. Wishing to know in what direction he was lying, he felt along carefully and came upon a pistol in his belt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>Working at this, he soon drew it out, and, finding it a good <persName n="Colt,,,,," id="n0162.0012.00077.00392" reg="mostcommon:Colt,nomatch:0"><surname>Colt</surname></persName>'s revolver, put it into his pocket and got down again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>Exploring around, he came to a corn patch and a cabin near by, in which there seemed, from the noise within, to be a family or <num value="2">two</num> of negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>Crossing to the south or rebel side of the island, he found that the stream was much narrower there than on the other side, and that close to the shore a number of boats and scows, in which the band crossed and recrossed, were tied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>It was now time to think about getting home, and he circled around the crib and cabin to reach the place where he had left his raft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>When he came in sight of it, there was also to be seen a human form standing by the water's edge and apparently regarding the raft with no little astonishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>In the uncertain light, it was impossible to tell whether it was man or woman, <rs type="color">white</rs> or <rs type="color">black</rs>; and there was nothing to do but wait until it disappeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>Crouching down amid the canes, he soon saw it turn and begin to climb the bank directly toward him; as a precautionary measure he took out the pistol and cocked it, though he could not see or feel whether it was loaded or not.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>These answers proving satisfactory, he was passed through and reached the town early in the forenoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>Most of the day he spent in riding about, looking into quartermasters' and commissary depots, inquiring the names of officers, the number of troops, commanders, etc., until he had ascertained all that he wished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>By this time night was drawing near, and it was high time to think about getting out of town; for should he remain after dark, he was certain to be arrested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>Here was a desperate state of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>Get out of town he must, and to get out he must have a pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>It was easy enough to come in, but very difficult to get out. Nobody knew him; and, in fact, for once in his life, he was at a loss what to do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>Misery loves company, and with a long face he told them his trouble-dressing it up with a considerable amount of fiction to suit the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>By way of adding earnestness to his entreaty and to open a sure path to their sympathies, he bought a bottle of whiskey and invited them all to drink with him. The liquor warmed their hearts as well as stomachs; and while hobnobbing together he asked them if they wouldn't vouch for him to the <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">provost-marshal</rs>, and thus enable him to procure a pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>Being now in a condition to love the world and everybody in it, they promised to do so, and in due season all went for passes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>His <num value="7">seven</num> newly-made friends found no difficulty in their suit, their names being all written on a single pass; but our scout was left unnoticed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>The attention of the <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">provost-marshal</rs> was called to him, when that functionary asked if any of them was personally acquainted with him. Though rebels, they would not lie; possibly they thought it was not necessary; and answered, <quote>No,</quote> but they would vouch for him. But that would not do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>He not only had no pass, but had not the slightest chance of getting <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>The whiskey investment had proved a losing speculation; and he knew not where to turn for relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>The place was getting too hot for safety; and his only hope of escape was to hurry out and lose himself in the crowd.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>Finally, <num value="1">one</num> of the party suggested that he should go with them anyhow &mdash; that the pickets would not be likely to notice that his name was not in the pass, there being so many already on it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>As they were journeying along, he proposed to the <num value="1">one</num> who had the pass that he should be allowed to write his own name on the pass with a pencil, and if any objection should be made to it they might say that he belonged to the party but did not come in until the pass was made out, and that the <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">provost marshal</rs>, to save writing a new <num value="1">one</num>, had inserted the name in pencil-mark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>This was assented to and done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>Riding about the town, he observed that nearly every house in it was a hospital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>Every thing was confusion and excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>Immense crowds of straggling soldiers and citizens were gathered about the court house and depot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>Commissary and quartermaster stores, artillery, ammunition, and camp equipage, were being loaded on the cars, and trains were starting as fast as loaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>An evacuation was evidently on hand, and that right speedily; and he determined to leave as soon, as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>The only trouble was how to get out. After wandering around some time, seeking an opportunity, he came across a train of small wagons, with which the neighboring farmers had come to take home their wounded sons and brothers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>Quick to embrace opportunities, he saw that now was his chance to escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>Dismounting from his horse, he led him by the bridle, and walked demurely behind <num value="1">one</num> of these wagons, as though it was in his <pb id="p.92" n="92"/> charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>Clad in butternut, and in every outward appearance resembling the others accompanying it, the deceit was not discovered, and he safely passed all the pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>It was now nearly <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> in the morning, and he rode rapidly on, in a cold, driving rain, until fairly benumbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>Some <measure n="9miles" type="distance">nine miles</measure> out, he came to a deserted school-house, which he unceremoniously entered, leading his horse in after him. Within, a large fireplace and an abundance of desks suggested the idea of a fire, and a huge blaze roaring and crackling on the hearth soon demonstrated its practicability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>The next step was to wring the water out of his well-soaked garments, and partially dry them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>Both horse and man enjoyed themselves here until near daybreak, when he mounted again and rode on to <persName n="Ratcliffe,,,,," id="n0162.0012.00092.00482" reg="nearbymention:Ratcliffe,J.,W.,,"><surname>Ratcliffe</surname></persName>'s, reaching there about <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>His report was immediately telegraphed to <persName n="Rosecrans,General,,,," id="n0162.0012.00092.00484" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>; but he had been so long in making his way back that the general did not receive it until he had himself entered <placeName reg="Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,7014175">Murfreesboro</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>Some of them were old acquaintances, and very confidential.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>They were, they said, just on their way to burn a lot of Federal wagons at <placeName key="tgn,2100014" n="1.000 12" reg="la vergne, rutherford, tennessee">Lavergne</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2101865" n="1.000 12" reg="triune, williamson, tennessee">Triune</placeName>, and, deeming him a good fellow well met, invited him to go with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>Thinking that there might be some chance to save the wagons, he declined the invitation, urging the pressing nature and importance of his mission as an excuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>It was soon found, however, that every avenue of escape northward was guarded, and the whole country filled with the cavalry, of whom there were, in all, about <num value="3000">three thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>There was nothing to do, then, but to leave the wagons to their fate and push on, which he did, and, arriving at <placeName reg="Caney Spring, Marshall, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098254">Caney Springs</placeName>, remained there over night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>The next morning the cavalry began to loiter back from their marauding expedition, in squads of from <num value="15">fifteen</num> to a <num value="100">hundred</num> or more, and from them he learned the complete success of the enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>Making the acquaintance of a lieutenant, he was told that they were going at once to <placeName key="tgn,2377668" n="1.000 1" reg="harpeth shoals, tennessee, united states">Harpeth Shoals</placeName>, to burn a fleet of boats which was then on its way to <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>This determined him to abandon the idea of going to <placeName reg="Shelbyville, Bedford, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101476">Shelbyville</placeName>, and he accompanied a detachment back as far as <persName n="Hart,,,,," id="n0162.0012.00093.00489" reg="mostcommon:Hart,nomatch:0"><surname>Hart</surname></persName>'s crossroads, where they went on picket-duty at a meetinghouse by the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>Her most dangerous service, however, was scouting in search of guerrillas, to accomplish which, she was frequently compelled to don male attire and to remain in the saddle all night; and many and varied were the strange adventures which she met with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>But her coolness, her energy, and patriotism carried her successfully through these experiences, and <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> special providence seemed always to be with her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>While here, she met with much sympathy from the rebels, to whom she appeared in the character of an abused woman, seeking for her brother, an officer in the army; and she also had to pass the scrutiny of more experienced judges-officers, and others high in official rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>It chanced that she learned that at the same hotel table where she dined there sat a young officer of engineers, who was engaged in drawing important plans for the rebel government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>Luckily, as if to further her plans, about this time, she received the offer of an engagement from the manager of the <rs>Richmond</rs> theatre, which of course tallied exactly with her scheme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>Her next move was to get acquainted with the young engineer officer, which was soon effected by a letter of safeguard given her by <num value="1">one</num> of her <placeName reg="Shelbyville, Bedford, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101476">Shelbyville</placeName> friends, <persName n="Boone,Major,,,," id="n0162.0013.00114.00587" reg="mostcommon:Boone,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Boone</surname></persName>; and soon, with her pretty woman's ways, she had won his entire confidence so completely, that he even offered to give her letters of introduction to <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n0162.0013.00114.00588" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>Calling upon him at his office, she was warmly welcomed, and finally excusing himself whilst he retired to an adjoining room to write the promised letters of introduction, <persName n="Cushman,Miss,,,," id="n0162.0013.00114.00589" reg="nearbymention:Cushman,A.,A.,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Cushman</surname></persName> found herself alone in the room with the much coveted plans and drawings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>In the few moments which elapsed during his absence from the room, she contrived to slip the plans into her bosom, and when he returned, she received from him the letters and left him as unsuspecting and as pleasant as ever-unconscious of his loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>Shortly after she left <placeName reg="Shelbyville, Bedford, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101476">Shelbyville</placeName> on her way to <pb id="p.115" n="115"/> <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>; and, during a short halt, at a place called <placeName key="tgn,2102013" n="1.000 10" reg="wartrace, bedford, tennessee">Wartrace</placeName>, she undertook a scouting enterprise with the view of communicating valuable information to some of the roving bands of Union cavalry, who were almost daily engaged in skirmishing with the rebel cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>In carrying out this plan, her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> requisite was, of course, a man's suit of clothes, and to get these she now set her wits to work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>At the same hotel where she was stopping was a young man of about <measure n="17years" type="date">seventeen years</measure> of age, whose clothes she thought would just fit her, but how to get them was the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>With only the knowledge that he slept in the upper story of the house, but provokingly ignorant of which room he occupied, she resolved to <quote>scout</quote> around in the dark, and, <quote>hit or miss,</quote> make a desperate attempt to secure the clothes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>So after a series of adventures in the dark, which succeeded only in arousing nearly all the inmates of the several rooms on the corridor, our discomfited heroine, beating a hasty retreat from the discovery which now seemed inevitable, desperately tried the handle of a small door near at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>To her great joy it yielded, and slipping hastily in, she found herself in a low, poorly-furnished chamber &mdash; in which lay sleeping the very man whose clothes she had been seeking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>Luckily, the uproar in the hall had not awakened him, and waiting till all was quiet again, she grabbed the clothes and sped silently to her own room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>Hastily dressing herself in the stolen suit, she crept softly down-stairs, past the sleeping negro boy in the hall, out to the stables, and there she speedily saddled <num value="1">one</num> of the best horses which he could find, and pushed her way out of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/><pb id="p.116" n="116"/> Into the woods she rode, and finally, when some <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> out of <placeName key="tgn,2102013" n="1.000 10" reg="wartrace, bedford, tennessee">Wartrace</placeName>, came suddenly upon a guerilla encampment, and was busily engaged in playing the eavesdropper to their camp-fire conversation when she unluckily stepped upon a brittle branch which snapped under her feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>Instantly they took the alarm, and she scarcely had time to mount her horse before they were in full chase after her. Gradually they gained upon her, when suddenly she found herself approaching, at full speed, a precipitous rock, at the foot of which meandered a small stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>It was impossible to check the headlong speed of her horse, and her pursuers were close upon her; so, shutting her eyes, and striking the spurs deep into the animals flanks, she plunged down the mountain side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>Her pursuers did not dare to follow, but standing at the top of the bluff, contented themselves with winging their pistol bullets after her. Suddenly; just as she hoped that she was fairly escaped, <num value="1">one</num> of her pursuers discovered a bridle path, and the chase recommenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>Pushing hastily into the woods which lined the creek, she endeavored to regain the road to <placeName key="tgn,2102013" n="1.000 10" reg="wartrace, bedford, tennessee">Wartrace</placeName>, for she was now threatened with <num value="2">two</num> dilemmas; if daylight overtook her before she could get back to the hotel, her theft of the clothes and horse would be discovered; and if taken by her pursuers she would inevitably be take] to <placeName key="tgn,2102013" n="1.000 10" reg="wartrace, bedford, tennessee">Wartrace</placeName>, it being the nearest town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>On she rode, at full speed, until she found herself gaining upon the rebel riders, and suddenly came upon a wounded Union cavalryman, scarce able to sit upon his horse, from the effects of a wound received while scouting, a few hours before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>She at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> mistook him for a <quote>reb,</quote> but ascertaining the truth, a plan of escape flashed through <pb id="p.117" n="117"/> her brain, and she quickly revealed to him her sex and name, and asked his aid. The brave fellow had heard of the <quote>Woman scout of the <rs>Cumberland</rs>,</quote> and, faint and wounded as he was, gladly and bravely offered to carry out her plan at the risk of his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>Firing her --pistol into the air, she instructed the soldier to say to the pursuing party, who would inevitably be drawn thither by the report, that he had been met and shot by a <quote>reb.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>She told him that he could not expect, from his wounds, to escape capture, and advised him to stir himself around so as to make his wound bleed afresh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>He obeyed, and let himself fall off his horse, while <persName n="Cushman,Miss,,,," id="n0162.0013.00117.00590" reg="nearbymention:Cushman,A.,A.,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Cushman</surname></persName> gave the animal a sharp blow which sent him flying down the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>When the rebel horsemen galloped up to the spot, they found the soldier lying at the foot of a tree, bleeding freely, and in a state of unconsciousness from his sudden fall, while over him bent our heroine, pistol in hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>To their surprised and hurried query who she was, she promptly replied: <quote>am a farmer's son, over near <placeName key="tgn,2102013" n="1.000 10" reg="wartrace, bedford, tennessee">Wartrace</placeName>, and I surrender to you; but I have shot your best fellow, here, and only wish I had shot more of ye.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>To their astonished looks and questions as to what he meant, she.replied in the same bitter vein; <quote>I mean just what I say. I am only sorry that I didn't kill more of you darned <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>, that comes down here and runs all our niggers off!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>Completely misled by her skilful acting, the rebels now saw that the boy had mistaken them for <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>; and on questioning the <rs>Yankee</rs> soldier, who was gradually recovering from his faintness, the brave fellow, true to instructions, designated the <quote>farmer's boy,</quote> as the <num value="1">one</num> who had shot him, <quote>because he was a Yankee.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>It now <pb id="p.118" n="118"/> became evident to the <quote>rebs</quote> that each party had mistaken the other for <quote><persName n="Yanks,,,,," id="n0162.0013.00118.00591" reg="mostcommon:Yanks,nomatch:0"><surname>Yanks</surname></persName> ;</quote> but for further precaution, <persName><foreName>Pauline</foreName></persName> was ordered to accompany them, and the wounded soldier was placed on a horse, and the party took up their march to <placeName key="tgn,2102013" n="1.000 10" reg="wartrace, bedford, tennessee">Wartrace</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>This was a programme not at all agreeable to her, and as they rode along through the darkness of the forest, she conceived the idea of creating a <quote>scare,</quote> hoping to avail herself of the confusion to get off and make her escape to <placeName key="tgn,2102013" n="1.000 10" reg="wartrace, bedford, tennessee">Wartrace</placeName> before daylight should make it too late to escape detection as a thief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>So as they were passing through a narrow gorge of the road, thickly overshadowed by tall forest trees, --a nice place for an ambush-she managed to fall behind the party and become hidden by a bend in the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>Then taking out her revolver, she fired <num value="5">five</num> shots in rapid succession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>As she expected, her rebel companions were startled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/>Supposing themselves ambushed by Federal cavalry, fear lent a <num value="1000">thousand</num> terrors to their minds, and their imaginations gave new echoes to the reports of the pistol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>Away they went, pell-mell, and laughing heartily at the success of her <quote>scare,</quote> <persName n="Cushman,Miss,,,," id="n0162.0013.00118.00592" reg="nearbymention:Cushman,A.,A.,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Cushman</surname></persName> rapidly galloped to <placeName key="tgn,2102013" n="1.000 10" reg="wartrace, bedford, tennessee">Wartrace</placeName>, where she luckily succeeded in comfortably housing her steed and in returning the borrowed clothes, without detection-and, in due time, answered the summons of the breakfast bell, as rosy and fresh-faced, and as innocent in look and manner, as if the night had been spent comfortably in her bed.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1021"/>This flattering proposition was accepted-the enamored captain forthwith ordered a complete rebel officer's uniform, and it was agreed that so soon as she should return from her proposed trip to <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, she should accompany him as <hi rend="italics">aide</hi>. Meanwhile, she was not slow to accept every invitation from him to ride over the neighboring country, thereby gaining that complete knowledge of camps, fortifications, and the paraphernalia of war, which was deemed essential to the new officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/>It may here be noticed that <persName n="Cushman,Miss,,,," id="n0162.0013.00119.00595" reg="nearbymention:Cushman,A.,A.,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Cushman</surname></persName> now departed from the strict instructions which she had received from her military superiors, not to make drawings, plans, etc., of fortifications; and at <placeName reg="Shelbyville, Bedford, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101476">Shelbyville</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2101873" n="1.000 68" reg="tullahoma, coffee, tennessee">Tullahoma</placeName> she made careful and accurate drawings, which she concealed between the inner and outer soles of her boot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>This dereliction of duty, though intended for the best, proved the ultimate cause of the troubles and miseries which afterward befell her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/>She did so, and instead of following by another ford, he incontinently disappeared, leaving her with but a small moiety of her baggage, some distance from her destination, and the night rapidly approaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1917"/>and they were compelled to switch off and let them <pb id="p.195" n="195"/> pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1918"/>At the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> station where this happened, the engineer of the road made his appearance, and was about to step on the engine, when <persName n="Andrews,,,,," id="n0162.0019.00195.00832" reg="nearbymention:Andrews,J.,J.,,"><surname>Andrews</surname></persName> told him he could not come on board, as this was an extra train running through to <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>, and that his party were engaged to run it, and in support of his assertion the iron safe was shown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1919"/>This apparently satisfied the engineer, and after taking in wood and water, the train again started.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1920"/>A <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time they were compelled to switch off, and in order to get the switch-keys, <persName n="Andrews,,,,," id="n0162.0019.00195.00833" reg="nearbymention:Andrews,J.,J.,,"><surname>Andrews</surname></persName>, who knew the road well, went into the station and took them from the office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1921"/>This caused considerable excitement, which he partly quieted by stating that the train contained gunpowder for <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0162.0019.00195.00834" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, at <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1922"/>About an hour was lost in waiting to allow these trains to pass, which, of course, enabled their pursuers to press closely after them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1923"/>But they pushed on as rapidly as possible, removing rails, throwing out obstructions along the track, and cutting the telegraph lines from time to time-attaining, when in motion, a speed of <measure n="60miles" type="distance">sixty miles</measure> per hour-but they could not regain the time which they had lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1924"/>Reaching a bridge about <placeName><distance reg="20miles">twenty miles</distance> <offset>south</offset> of  <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton, Georgia</placeName></placeName>, they set fire to <num value="1">one</num> of their cars, piled on wood, and left it on the bridge, to which they thus hoped to set fire.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1925"/>Now, let us return to the rebel engineer, conductor, and passengers, thus unceremoniously left at Big Shanty, by the amazing and sudden disappearance of the engine and part of the train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1926"/>The party who had thus stolen the march upon them, had evidently done so at that time and place, with the presumption that pursuit could not be made by an Engine short of <placeName reg="Kingston, Bartow, Georgia" key="tgn,2023318">Kingston</placeName>, some <num value="30">thirty</num> <pb id="p.196" n="196"/> miles above Big Shanty; and that, by cutting the telegraph wires as they proceeded, they should gain at least <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure> start of any pursuit which could be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1928"/>But these <num value="3">three</num> determined men, without a moment's delay, put out after the flying train <hi rend="italics">on foot</hi>, amidst shouts of laughter from the crowd, who, though lost in amazement at the unexpected and daring act, could not repress their merriment at seeing <num value="3">three</num> men starting on foot after a train which had just whirled away from before their eyes, under the highest power of steam.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1929"/>But <persName n="Fuller,Mister,,,," id="n0162.0019.00196.00839" reg="mostcommon:Fuller,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName>, <persName n="Cain,Mister,,,," id="n0162.0019.00196.00840" reg="mostcommon:Cain,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Cain</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Murphy,Mister,,,," id="n0162.0019.00196.00841" reg="nearbymention:Murphy,Anthony,,,"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Murphy</surname></persName>, nowise daunted by the disparity of motive power, put on all their speed and ran along the track for <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure>, until they came up with some track raisers who had a small truck car, which is shoved along by men so employed on railroads, on which to carry their tools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1930"/>Truck and men were at once <quote>impressed,</quote> and they took it by turns of <num value="2">two</num> at a time to run behind the truck and push it along all up-grades and level portions of the road, and let it drive at will on all the downgrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1931"/>Reaching the spot where the runaways had cut the telegraph wires and torn up the track, they found themselves suddenly tumbled out, pell-mell, truck and men, upon the side of the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1932"/>Finding, however, that <pb id="p.197" n="197"/> <quote>nobody was hurt on our side,</quote> the plucky <quote>rebs</quote> put the truck again on the track, left some hands to repair the road, and with all the power of determined will and muscle, they pushed on to <placeName reg="Etowah station">Etowah station</placeName>, some <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure> above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1933"/>Here, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing that met their sight was the <quote>Yonah,</quote> an old coal engine, <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ever used on the <rs>State</rs> road, standing already <quote>fired up.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1934"/>This venerable locomotive was immediately turned upon the track, and like an old racer at the tap of the drum, pricked up her ears and made fine time to <placeName reg="Kingston, Bartow, Georgia" key="tgn,2023318">Kingston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1935"/>There they found themselves but <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure> behind the runaway train; and leaving the <quote>Yonah</quote> to blow off, they mounted the engine of the <placeName key="possibilities=51" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Pine Branch</placeName> road, which was ready fired up, and waiting for the arrival of the passenger train nearly due.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1936"/>But a little before reaching that place they found the train at a standstill, in consequence of the destruction of a portion of the road by the <rs>Yankee</rs> runaways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1937"/>This was vexatious, but it did not discourage <persName n="Fuller,,,,," id="n0162.0019.00197.00842" reg="mostcommon:Fuller,nomatch:0"><surname>Fuller</surname></persName> and <persName n="Murphy,,,,," id="n0162.0019.00197.00843" reg="nearbymention:Murphy,Anthony,,,"><surname>Murphy</surname></persName>, who left the engine and once more put out <hi rend="italics">on foot</hi>, alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1938"/>After <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> running, they met the down freight train from Adamsville-reversed and ran it backward to that place, switched off the cars on a side track, and with the engine made fine time to. <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n0162.0019.00197.00844" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>, where they met the regular down passenger train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1939"/>Here they made a momentary halt, took on board a number of well armed volunteers, a company of track hands to repair the track as they went along, and a telegraph operator, and continued the chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1940"/>A short <pb id="p.198" n="198"/> distance above <placeName reg="Calhoun, Gordon, Georgia" key="tgn,2022321">Calhoun</placeName> they saw, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, the runaway train ahead of them.

The rails which they had last taken up they now carried off with them, but their rebel pursuers, on coming to where the rails were torn up, stopped, tore up the rails behind them and laid them down, without fastening, before the engine, which ran over them cautiously but safely; and then carefully throwing off from the track the cross-ties which had been thrown there to impede their progress, pushed on after the fugitives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1942"/>Now the race became terrible in its intensity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1943"/><quote>Nip and tuck</quote> the <num value="2">two</num> trains swept with fearful speed past <placeName key="tgn,2024046" n="1.000 167" reg="resaca, gordon, georgia">Resaca</placeName>, <persName n="Tilton,,,,," id="n0162.0019.00198.00846" reg="mostcommon:Tilton,nomatch:0"><surname>Tilton</surname></persName>, and on through <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton</placeName>, where the rebel train stopped to put off the telegraph operator, with instructions to telegraph to <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> to have them stopped there, in case he should fail to overhaul them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1944"/>On and on, fast and still faster the rebel train pressed with hot speed, sometimes in sight, as much to prevent their cutting the wires before the message could be sent, as to catch them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1945"/>The caring <rs>Yankees</rs> indeed stopped just opposite, and very near to the encampment of a rebel regiment, and cut the wires, but the operator who had been dropped at <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton</placeName> had <hi rend="italics">put the message through about <measure n="2minutes" type="date">two minutes</measure> before</hi>. They also again tore up the track, cut down a telegraph pole, and placed the <num value="2">two</num> ends of it under the cross-ties, <pb id="p.199" n="199"/> and the middle over the rail on the track.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1946"/>Their pursuers, however, got over this impediment in the same manner they did before-taking up rails behind and laying them down before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1947"/>Once over this, they shot through the great tunnel at <placeName key="tgn,2024554" n="1.000 207" reg="tunnel hill, whitfield, georgia">Tunnel Hill</placeName>, <hi rend="italics">only <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> behind</hi> the adventurous <quote>Feds,</quote> who, finding themselves closely pressed, uncoupled <num value="2">two</num> of the boxcars from their engine, hoping to impede the progress of their pursuers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1949"/>As they passed <placeName reg="Ringgold, Catoosa, Georgia" key="tgn,2024062">Ringgold</placeName>, the runaways began to show signs of <quote>giving out.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1950"/>They were out of wood, water, and oil; their rapid running and inattention to the engine had melted all the brass from its journals; and they had no time for repair, so rapid was the pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1951"/>Nearer and nearer panted the iron steed behind them, until, when it was within <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards</measure> of them, seeing that their only safety was in flight, they jumped from the engine, scattering in the thicket, each for himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1952"/>And now their troubles commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1953"/>The whole country immediately swarmed with armed pursuers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1954"/>Unacquainted with the country, they lost their way, were hunted down by mounted men and bloodhounds, and finally were all captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1955"/>Their plan had failed from causes which reflected neither upon the genius by which it was planned, nor upon the intrepidity and discretion of those engaged in it, but from a combination of unforeseen circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1956"/>It was a plan which the rebels themselves declared to have been <quote>entirely practicable on almost any day for the last year,</quote> but they did not <pb id="p.200" n="200"/> expect to meet <num value="2">two</num> <quote>extraordinary</quote> or special trains on the road; they did not expect that any men would be so apparently foolhardy as to attempt their pursuit <hi rend="italics">on foot;</hi> and they did not expect that their pursuers would find any such <quote><name n="God" type="God">God</name>-send</quote> as the old coal engine, <quote>Yonah,</quote> standing on the track, ready fired up.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1957"/>It might have been hoped that the signal bravery of such an exploit would have commanded the respect of their captors, and mitigated in some degree the resentment which such an attempt excited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1958"/>But it was not so.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1959"/>The <num value="22">twenty-two</num> captives, when secured, were thrust into the negro jail at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1960"/>There they occupied a single room, half under ground, and but <measure n="13feet" type="distance">thirteen feet</measure> square, so that there was not space enough for them all to lie down together, and a part of them were, in consequence, obliged to sleep sitting and leaning against the walls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1961"/>The only entrance to this vile room was through a trap door in the ceiling, through which, twice a day, their scanty meals were lowered in a bucket; and they had no other light or ventilation than that which came through <num value="2">two</num> small, triple grated windows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1962"/>They were covered with swarming vermin, and the oppressiveness of the heat obliged them to strip themselves entirely naked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1963"/>Added to this, they were all handcuffed, and fastened to each other in companies of twos and threes, by trail chains, secured with padlocks around their necks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1964"/>Their food, doled out to them <pb id="p.201" n="201"/> twice a day, consisted of a little flour moistened with water, and baked in the form of bread, together with spoiled pickled beef.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1965"/>And, as their pockets had been rifled of whatever money they contained at the time of their capture, they were utterly without the means to procure any better supplies from outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1966"/>Shortly after their capture, Jacob Parrot, an orphan boy, aged <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>, belonging to the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 33">Thirty-third Regiment</orgName> of <orgName type="mil" key="OHVolunteer">Ohio Volunteers</orgName>, was taken by a <orgName n="Confederate Officer" type="org">Confederate officer</orgName> and <num value="4">four</num> soldiers, who stripped him, bent him over a stone, and while <num value="2">two</num> pistols were held to his head, a lieutenant in rebel uniform inflicted, with a raw hide, over a <num value="100">hundred</num> lashes on his bare back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1967"/>This was done in the presence of an infuriated crowd, who clamored for his death, and actually brought a rope with which to hang him. The object of this prolonged scourging was to force from him (the youngest of the the party) a confession as to the objects of the expedition and the names of his comrades, especially that of the engineer who had run the train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1968"/><num value="3">Three</num> times, in the course of this horrible flogging, it was suspended, and young Parrot was asked if he would confess; but, steadily and firmly, with unswerving fidelity to the trusts of friendship and the inspirations of patriotism, he refused all disclosures, and it was not until his tormenters were weary of their cruel labor, that they abandoned the attempt.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1969"/>While thus imprisoned at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, their leader, <persName n="Andrews,Mister,,,," id="n0162.0019.00201.00848" reg="nearbymention:Andrews,J.,J.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Andrews</surname></persName>, was tried, condemned, and executed as a spy, at <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, on the <dateStruct value="-06-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1972"/>Their trial, of course, was summary, and although permitted to be present, they were not allowed to hear either the argument of their own counsel or of the <rs type="role" reg="Judge Advocate">judge-advocate</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1973"/>Their counsel, however, afterward visited them in prison, and read to them his argument, which was, in substance, that the fact of their being dressed in citizens' clothes was no more than what had been authorized in similar cases by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> itself; that the object of the expedition was a purely military <num value="1">one</num>, and as such lawful, according to the rules of war; and that not having lingered about or visited any of the camps, obtaining or seeking information, they could not rightly be considered as spies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1974"/>This just and unanswerable presentation of the case, appears to have produced a favorable impression, and the whole party soon after were removed to <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta, Ga.</placeName>, under the impression that those who had been tried had been acquitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2000"/>A few miles south of the famous <placeName reg="Cheat River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7019946">Cheat river</placeName> bridge, is a deep mountain gorge, with precipitous, rocky sides.</p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2005"/> There, on the straight track, just at the near edge of the gorge, a lot of men, in gray uniform, were hastily <pb id="p.207" n="207"/> piling up some old ties, logs, etc., while at the point where the curve was sharpest-before reaching the gorge &mdash; were several more, tugging furiously at a rail, <num value="1">one</num> end of which seemed to baffle them, as they pulled it outward.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2010"/>As we neared them, a party of them huddled together near the track.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2024"/>Extricating himself almost as suddenly as he had been deposited in the little glass door, he jerked a tin flask from his pocket, sprung on top of the tender, and from thence to the roof of the cab.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2027"/> Our damages were a few bruises each, but no serious hurts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2028"/>Our engine suffered the loss of the pilot, or cow-catcher, and head light; the front of the smoke-box was stove in, besides sundry dents and bruises on the brass casings of the cylinders; but for running purposes was absolutely uninjured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2029"/>The rebels having piled the logs squarely across the top of the track, the point of the cow-catcher had gone under them, and though broken by the shock, had raised them sufficiently to keep them from under the wheels, while the engine dashed them right and left into the gorge.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2030"/>The rebels, seeing us stop, started in pursuit; but as we found nothing serious to impede our further progress, and, as in their case, <quote> distance lent enchantment to the view,</quote> we were off again in high spirits, and without further adventure worth recounting, arrived safely at our destination.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3088"/>He came in a day or <num value="2">two</num> after the others; and <num value="1">one</num> evening, when I entered my <quote>pathetic room,</quote> I found a lately emptied bed occupied by a large, fair man, with a fine face, and the serenest eyes I ever met. <num value="1">One</num> of the earlier comers had often spoken of a friend who had remained behind that those apparently worse wounded than himself might reach a <pb id="p.305" n="305"/> shelter <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3089"/>It seemed a David and <persName><foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName> sort of friendship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3090"/>The man fretted for his mate, and was never tired of praising John-his courage, sobriety, self-denial, and unfailing kindliness of heart; always winding up with: <quote>He's an out ana out fine feller, ma'am; you see if he aint.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3091"/>I had some curiosity to behold this piece of excellence, and when he came, watched him for a night or <num value="2">two</num>, before I made friends with him; for, to tell the truth, I was a little afraid of the stately looking man, whose bed had to be lengthened to accommodate his commanding stature; who seldom spoke, uttered no complaint, asked no sympathy, but tranquilly observed what went on about him; and, as he lay high upon his pillows, no picture of dying statesman or warrior was ever fuller of real dignity than this <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> blacksmith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3092"/>A most attractive face he had, framed in brown hail and beard, comely featured and full of vigor, as yet unsubdued by pain; thoughtful and often beautifully mild while watching the afflictions of others, as if entirely forgetful of his own. His mouth was grave and firm, with plenty of will and courage in its lines, but a smile could make it as sweet as any woman's; and his eyes were child's eyes, looking <num value="1">one</num> fairly in the face with a clear, straightforward glance, which promised well for such as placed their faith in him. He seemed to cling to life as if it were rich in duties and delights, and he had learned the secret of content.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3093"/>The only time I saw his composure disturbed, was when my surgeon brought another to examine <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>, who scrutinized their faces with an anxious look, asking of the elder: <quote>Do you think I shall pull through, sir?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3095"/>And, as the <num value="2">two</num> passed on, <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>'s eye still followed them, with an intentness which would have won a clearer answer from them, had they seen it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3096"/>The next night, as I went my rounds with <rs type="role">Dr.</rs> P., I happened to ask which man in the room probably suffered most; and, to my great surprise, he glanced at <address><street n="John merryman">John</street></address>: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3101"/>I could have sat down on the spot and cried heartily, if I had not learned the wisdom of bottling up <num value="1">one</num>'s tears for leisure moments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3102"/>Such an end seemed very hard for such a man, when half a dozen worn-out, worthless bodies round him, were gathering up the remnants of wasted lives, to linger on for years, perhaps, burdens <pb id="p.307" n="307"/> to others, daily reproaches to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3103"/>The army needed men like <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>, earnest, brave, and faithful; fighting for liberty and justice with both heart and hand, true soldiers of the <rs>Lord</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3106"/>I had not the heart to do it then, and privately indulged the hope that some change for the better might take place, in spite of gloomy prophecies, so rendering my task unnecessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3107"/>A few minutes later, as I came in again, with fresh rollers, <num value="1">1</num> saw <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> sitting erect, with no <num value="1">one</num> to support him, while the surgeon dressed his back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3108"/>I had never hitherto seen it done; for, having simpler wounds to attend to, and knowing the fidelity of the attendant, I had left <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> to him, thinking it might be more agreeable and safe; for both strength and experience were needed in his case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3109"/>I had forgotten that the strong man might long for the gentler tendance of a woman's hands, the sympathetic magnetism of a woman's presence, as well as the feebler souls about him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3110"/><persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> looked lonely and forsaken just then, as he sat with bent head, hands folded on his knee, and no outward sign of suffering, till, looking nearer, I saw great tears roll down and drop <pb id="p.308" n="308"/> upon the floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3111"/>It was a new sight there; for, though I had seen many suffer, some swore, some groaned, most endured silently, but none wept.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3112"/>Yet it did not seem weak, only very touching, and straightway my fear vanished, my heart opened wide and took him in, as gathering the bent head in my arms, as freely as if he had been a little child, I said, <quote>Let me help you bear it, <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3119"/>Nor did he; for now I understood the wistful look that sometimes followed me, as I went out, after a brief pause beside his bed, or merely a passing nod, while busied with those who seemed to need me more than he, because more urgent in their demands; now I knew that to him, as to so many, I was the poor substitute for mother, wife, or sister, and in his eyes no stranger, but a friend who hitherto had seemed neglectful; for, in his modesty he had never guessed the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3120"/>This was changed now; and, through the tedious operation of probing, bathing, and dressing his wounds, he leaned against me, holding my hand fast, and, if pain wrung further tears from him, no <num value="1">one</num> saw them fall but me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3121"/>While doing this, he watched me with the satisfied expression I so liked to see; and when I offered the little nosegay held it carefully in his great hand, smoothed a ruffled leaf or <num value="2">two</num>, surveyed and smelt it with an air of genuine delight, and lay contentedly regarding the glimmer of the sunshine on the green.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3122"/>Although the manliest man among my <num value="40">forty</num>, he said, <quote>Yes, ma'am,</quote> like a little boy; received suggestions for his comfort with the quick smile that brightened his whole face; and now and then, as I stood tidying the table by his bed, I felt him softly touch my gown, as if to assure himself that I was there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3123"/>Any thing more natural and frank I never saw, and found this brave <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> as bashful as brave, yet full of excellencies and fine aspirations, which, having no power to express themselves in words, seemed to have bloomed into his character and made him what he was.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3124"/>After that night, an hour of each evening that remained to him was devoted to his ease or pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3125"/>He could not talk much, for breath was precious, and he spoke in whispers; but from occasional conversations, I gleaned scraps of private history which only added to the affection and respect I felt for him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3141"/>it did not matter now, except that a shot in front might have spared the long agony in store for him. He seemed to read the thoughts that troubled me, as he spoke so hopefully when there was no hope, for he suddenly added: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3145"/>He seemed a little startled at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, pondered over the fateful fact a moment, then shook his head, with a glance at the broad chest and muscular limbs stretched out before him:</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3147"/>I am so strong it don't seem possible for such a little wound to kill me.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3148"/></p> 
<p>Merry Mercutio's dying words glanced through my memory as he spoke: <quote>'Tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but 'tis enough.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3149"/>And <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> would have said the same could he have seen the ominous black holes between his shoulders: he never had; and, seeing the ghastly sights about him, could not believe <pb id="p.312" n="312"/> his own wound more fatal than these, for all the suffering it caused him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3150"/><quote> Shall I write to your mother, now?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3151"/>I asked, thinking that these sudden tidings might change all plans and purposes; but they did not; for the man received the order of the <rs>Divine Commander</rs> to march with the same unquestioning obedience with which the soldier had received that of the human <num value="1">one</num>, doubtless remembering that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> led him to life and the last to death.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3153"/>So I wrote the letter which he dictated, finding it better than any I had sent; for, though here and there a little ungrammatical or inelegant, each sentence came to me briefly worded, but most expressive; full of excellent counsel to the boy, tenderly bequeathing <quote>mother and <persName><foreName>Lizzie</foreName></persName></quote> to his care, and bidding him good-by in words the sadder for their simplicity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3154"/>He added a few lines, with steady hand, and, as I sealed it, said, with a patient sort of sigh, <quote>I hope the answer will come in time for me to see it;</quote> then, turning away his face, laid the flowers against his lips, as if to hide some quiver of emotion at the thought of such a sudden sundering of all the dear home ties.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3155"/>These things had happened <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> before; now <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> was dying, and the letter had not come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3156"/>I had been summoned to many death-beds in my life, but to none that made my heart ache as it did then, since my mother called me to watch the departure of a spirit akin to this in its gentleness and patient strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3157"/>As I went in, <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> stretched out both hands: <pb id="p.313" n="313"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3160"/>He was; and so rapidly that, even while he spoke, over his face I saw the gray vail falling that no human hand can lift.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3161"/>I sat down by him, wiped the drops from his forehead, stirred the air about him with the slow wave of a fan, and waited to help him die. He stood in sore need of help-and I could do so little; for, as the doctor had foretold, the strong body rebelled against death, and fought every inch of the way, forcing him to draw each breath with a spasm, and clench his hands with an imploring look, as if he asked, <quote>How long must I endure this and be still!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3162"/>For hours he suffered dumbly, without a moment's respite, or a moment's murmuring; his limbs grew cold, his face damp, his lips white, and again and again he tore the covering off his breast, as if the lightest weight added to his agony; yet through it all his eyes never lost their perfect serenity, and the man's soul seemed to sit therein, undaunted by the ills that vexed his flesh.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3163"/><num value="1">One</num> by <num value="1">one</num> the men woke, and round the room appeared a circle of pale faces and watchful eyes, full of awe and pity; for, though a stranger, <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> was beloved by all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3176"/>I thought him nearly gone, and had just laid down the fan, believing its help to be no longer needed, when suddenly he rose up in his bed, and cried out with a bitter cry that broke the silence, sharply startling every <num value="1">one</num> with its agonized appeal: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3179"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> red streak of dawn was warming the gray east, a herald of the coming sun; <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> saw it, and with the love of light which lingers in us to the end, seemed to read in it a sign of hope of help for over his whole face there broke that mysterious expression, brighter than any smile, which often comes to eyes that look their last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3180"/>He laid himself gently down, and stretching out his strong right arm, as if to <pb id="p.315" n="315"/> grasp and bring the blessed air to his lips in a fuller flow, lapsed into a merciful unconsciousness, which assured us that for him suffering was forever past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3181"/>He died then; for, though the heavy breaths still tore their way up for a little longer, they were but the waves of an ebbing tide that beat unfelt against the wreck, which an immortal voyager had deserted with a smile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3182"/>He never spoke again, but to the end held my hand close, so close that when he was asleep at last, I could not draw it away <persName n="Dan,,,,," id="n0162.0030.00315.01233" reg="mostcommon:Dan,nomatch:0"><surname>Dan</surname></persName> helped me, warning me, as he did so, that it was unsafe for dead and living flesh to lie so long together; but though my hand was strangely cold and stiff, and <num value="4">four</num> white marks remained across its back, even when warmth and color had returned elsewhere, I could not but be glad that through its touch, the presence of human sympathy, perhaps, had lightened that hard hour.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3183"/>When they had made him ready for the grave, <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> lay in state for half an hour, a thing which seldom happened in that busy place; but a universal sentiment of reverence and affection seemed to fill the hearts of all who had known or heard of him; and when the rumor of his death went through the house, always astir, many came to see him, and I felt a tender sort of pride in my lost patient; for he looked a most heroic figure, lying there stately and still as the statue of some young knight asleep upon his tomb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3184"/>The lovely expression which so often beautifies dead faces, soon replaced the marks of pain, and I longed for those who loved him best to see him when half an hour's acquaintance with Death had made them friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3185"/>As we stood looking at him, the ward master handed me a letter, saying it had been forgotten the night before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3186"/>It was <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>'s letter, come just <pb id="p.316" n="316"/> an hour too late to gladden the eyes that had longed and looked for it so eagerly: yet he had it; for, after I had cut some brown locks for his mother, and taken off the ring to send her, telling how well the talisman had done its work, I kissed this good son for her sake, and laid the letter in his hand, still folded as when I drew my own away, feeling that its place was there, and making myself happy with the thought, that even in his solitary place in the <quote>Government lot,</quote> he would not be without some token of the love which makes life beautiful and outlives death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3191"/>He smiled, but said nothing; and she noticed, as she came closer, that large drops of perspiration were standing in beads upon his brow; his <num value="1">one</num> free hand was tightly clenched, and a nervous tremor ran over his whole frame.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3203"/>There was always something inexpressibly sad to me in these moans; it seemed as though the body were compensating itself, during sleep, for the powerful restraint imposed upon it during waking hours.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3205"/>During his illness, it was all-important to keep up his strength, for as the wound began to heal, <num value="1">one</num> abscess followed another, and kept him much prostrated; we, therefore, tried to tempt his appetite in every way; and often, when I have brought him some delicacy, he has pointed me to some <num value="1">one</num> near him, with the words: <quote> Please give it to him; he cares for such things more than I do.</quote></p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3216"/>I assured him that such a signature would be stronger proof of the real state of the case than any letter I could send telling the facts, and giving the reasonable ground for hope which we now felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3217"/>But he still preferred to wait; and ere very long we found, by pinning the paper to the table, to keep it firm, he could execute a tolerably legible epistle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3241"/>We thus lost sight of him for many months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3242"/>Several times when I asked after him at our own hospital, I was told that he had been there but a short time since; sometimes the week before; sometimes only the day before; but it so happened that we never met.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3875"/>It was a dark night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3876"/>Not a star on the glimmer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3877"/>I had collected my quotum of intelligence, and was on the move for the <rs>Northern</rs> lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3878"/>I was approaching the banks of a stream whose waters <num value="1">1</num> had to cross, and had then some miles to traverse before I could reach the pickets of our gallant troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3879"/>A feeling of uneasiness began to creep over me; I was on the outskirt of a wood fringing the dark waters at my feet, whose presence could scarcely be detected but for their sullen murmurs as they rushed through the gloom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3880"/>The wind sighed in gentle accordance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3881"/>I walked <num value="40">forty</num> or <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> along the bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3884"/>I had missed my landmark, and knew not where I was.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3885"/>As I stood gasping for breath, with all the unmistakable proofs of my calling about me, the sudden cry of a bird, or plunging of a fish, would act like magnetism upon my frame, not wont to shudder at a shadow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3886"/>No matter how pressing the danger may be, if a man sees an opportunity of escape he breathes with freedom.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3888"/>In the agony of that moment &mdash; in the sudden and utter helplessness I felt to discover my true bearings-I was about to let myself gently into the stream, and breast its current for life or death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3889"/>There was no alternative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3890"/>The Northern pickets must be reached in safety before the morning broke, or I should soon swing between heaven and earth, from some green limb in the dark forest in which I stood.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3891"/>At that moment the low, sullen bay of a bloodhound struck my ear. The sound was reviving &mdash; the fearful stillness broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3892"/>The uncertain dread flew before the certain danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3894"/>After a pause of a few seconds, I began to creep mechanically and stealthily down the stream, followed, as I knew, from the rustling of the grass and frequent breaking of twigs, by the insatiable brute; although, by certain uneasy growls, I felt assured he was at fault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3895"/>Something struck against my breast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3896"/>I could not prevent a slight cry from escaping me, as, stretching out my hand, I grasped the gunwale of a boat moored beneath the bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3898"/>In an instant I had scrambled on board, and began to search for the painter in the bow, in order to cast her from her fastenings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3899"/>Suddenly a bright ray of moonlight &mdash; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gleam of hope in that black night-fell directly on the spot, revealing the silvery stream, my own skiff (hidden there <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> before), lighting the deep shadows of the verging wood, and, on the log half <pb id="p.392" n="392"/> buried in the bank, and from which I had that instant cast the line that had bound me to it, the supple form of the crouching bloodhound, his red eyes gleaming in the moonlight, jaws distended, and poising for the spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3900"/>With <num value="1">one</num> dart the light skiff was yards out in the stream, and the savage after it. With an oar I aimed a blow at his head, which, however, he eluded with ease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3901"/>In the effort thus made, the boat careened over toward my antagonist, who made a desperate effort to get his fore paws over the side, at the same time seizing the gunwale with his teeth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3902"/>Now or never was my time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3903"/>I drew my revolver, and placed the muzzle between his eyes, but hesitated to fire, for that <num value="1">one</num> report might bring on me a volley from the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3904"/>Meantime the strength of the dog careened the frail craft so much that the water rushed over the side, threatening to swamp her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4684"/>The construction of the firework called the <rs>Roman</rs> candle is known to most of our readers, and the fact is familiar that when fired they project, in succession, and at intervals of about <measure n="3seconds" type="date">three seconds</measure>, a number of brilliantly luminous balls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4685"/>These balls are thrown many feet, and cast a clear light for <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3seconds" type="date">three seconds</measure>. <pb id="p.455" n="455"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4686"/>We doubt whether the military use of the candles we instance has ever before been made:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4687"/>At the siege of <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>, the enemy attempted to storm before daylight <num value="1">one</num> of the forts-we have forgotten the name, but it was the <num value="1">one</num> before which the wires which so conveniently tripped up the enemy were arranged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4688"/>In this fort was stationed <persName n="Herzog,Lieutenant,Charles,,," id="n0162.0055.00455.01501" reg="default:Herzog,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Herzog</surname></persName>, of the <orgName n="Signal Corps" type="corps">Signal Corps</orgName>, and as a part of his equipment, he was furnished with <num value="20">twenty</num> or <num value="30">thirty</num> <name>Roman</name> candles, containing about <num value="12">twelve</num> balls each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4689"/>When used as signals, the candles are fired vertically, and the balls are visible at a great distance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4690"/>The lieutenant knew of this use of his candles, but it needed the inspiration of battle to develop the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4691"/>He had it. Before dawn, <num value="1">one</num> day, the pickets were driven in, and the enemy were swarming after them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4692"/>They came on over a crest about <measure n="800yards" type="distance">eight hundred yards distant</measure>, and our great guns opened, but the aim was wild &mdash; there was need of light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4696"/>With the gleam of its balls an idea gleamed upon him. His action, as it, was instant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4700"/><pb id="p.456" n="456"/> The great crowd of charging rebels stood out in fair relief in the glare &mdash; the distance had lessened to about <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure>-and our pieces, crammed with canister, opened on a mark perhaps as good as could have been had by daylight-only the light was not continuous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4701"/>The staunch lieutenant did not fail in expedients.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4702"/>He sent half his candles by <num value="1">one</num> of his assistants to the opposite angle of the fort, and then they opened fire together, crossing fire above and in front of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4703"/>Now a ball was in the air all the time.
