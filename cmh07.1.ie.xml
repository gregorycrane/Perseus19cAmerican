<head>Preface.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>As the introductory volume of a series, it is the purpose of this book to deal not only with the specific subjects mentioned in the title, but also with the general condition of the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName> at the outbreak of the <rs>War</rs>, the peculiar difficulties before it, and the way in which the difficulties were met. In this connection it has been necessary to touch incidentally upon matters that are the subject of animated controversy in the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName> at the present moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Such a reference to actual questions cannot be avoided, if the lessons of the <rs>War</rs> are to be fairly and fearlessly regarded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>For statements of fact, reliance has been chiefly placed upon the written accounts, official or unofficial, of those who took part in the events recorded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>In describing the operations of the blockade-runners, the narratives of <persName n="Maffitt,,,,," id="n0249.0001.00001.00001" reg="mostcommon:Maffitt,nomatch:0"><surname>Maffitt</surname></persName>, <persName n="Roberts,,,,," id="n0249.0001.00001.00002" reg="mostcommon:Roberts,A.,,,:1"><surname>Roberts</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Wilkinson,,,,," id="n0249.0001.00001.00003" reg="mostcommon:Wilkinson,nomatch:0"><surname>Wilkinson</surname></persName> have been largely used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Finally, the writer must acknowledge his obligations to many kind friends, both in and out of the service, who have aided him with valuable advice and suggestions.</p>

<head>The preparations.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>The Naval War of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> was marked by <num value="2">two</num> principal features.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is that while <num value="1">one</num> side had a small force of naval vessels, which were generally good of their kind, the other entered the contest with absolutely nothing that could be called a man-of-war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> is that though certain developments in the character and construction of ships and of weapons had been foreshadowed before the war, and had even been partially realized, it was while the struggle was actually in progress that changes took place in these respects which amounted to a revolution in naval warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>At the beginning the fact that sailing vessels were soon to be laid aside was still far from general recognition, especially among officers of conservative tendencies; the <num value="3">three</num> great weapons of to-day, the rifled gun, the ram, and the torpedo, were almost unknown in the service; and iron armor was still an experiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The modifications of the past <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure> had accustomed men's minds to the idea that considerable changes would gradually take place; but none foresaw or were prepared for the tremendous development that was wrought in <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of actual fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/><pb id="p.2" n="2"/></p> 
<p>Modern naval warfare was therefore almost a new art to the officers that were called in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> into active service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The long period of profound peace that followed the wars of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0249.0002.00002.00004" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> had been broken only by the war with <placeName key="tgn,2070527;tgn,2059719;tgn,1001893" n="0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,2070527;mexico, oswego, new york,Oswego,New York,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,2059719;mexico, audrain, missouri,Audrain,Missouri,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,1001893;mexico,Mexico,North and Central America" reg="mexico, oswego, new york,Oswego,New York,United States,North and Central America;mexico, audrain, missouri,Audrain,Missouri,United States,North and Central America;mexico,Mexico,North and Central America">Mexico</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></dateStruct>, the <rs>Crimean War</rs> in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, and the <rs>Franco-Austrian War</rs> in <dateStruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>None of these was marked by naval operations on any important scale, and such operations as there were indicated but faintly the coming development.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>In the contest with <placeName key="tgn,2070527;tgn,2059719;tgn,1001893" n="0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,2070527;mexico, oswego, new york,Oswego,New York,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,2059719;mexico, audrain, missouri,Audrain,Missouri,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,1001893;mexico,Mexico,North and Central America" reg="mexico, oswego, new york,Oswego,New York,United States,North and Central America;mexico, audrain, missouri,Audrain,Missouri,United States,North and Central America;mexico,Mexico,North and Central America">Mexico</placeName>, steamers were used in war for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time; but the enemy was so destitute of naval resources that their overwhelming importance was not fully recognized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The operations of the navy were confined to the attack of imperfectly-fortified points on the seaboard, and to blockading a country that had no commercial importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The Crimean War advanced a step farther.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The destruction of the <orgName n="Turkish fleet" type="fleet">Turkish fleet</orgName> at <placeName key="tgn,7002620;tgn,2070527" n="0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7002620;Sinop,Sinop,Karadeniz kiyisi,Turkiye,Asia,Sinop,Karadeniz kiyisi,Turkiye,Asia;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,2070527;mexico, oswego, new york,Oswego,New York,United States,North and Central America" reg="Sinop,Sinop,Karadeniz kiyisi,Turkiye,Asia,Sinop,Karadeniz kiyisi,Turkiye,Asia;mexico, oswego, new york,Oswego,New York,United States,North and Central America">Sinope</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1853--"><year reg="1853">1853</year></dateStruct>, showed the effectiveness of horizontal shell-firing, as invented by <persName n="Paixhans,,,,," id="n0249.0002.00002.00005" reg="mostcommon:Paixhans,nomatch:0"><surname>Paixhans</surname></persName>, while the success of the <name n="France">French</name> ironclads at Kinburn led the way to the practice of casing ships-of-war in armor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>In <dateStruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></dateStruct> experiments were made at <placeName key="tgn,7014278;tgn,7014277;tgn,7014276;tgn,7014275;tgn,7011393;tgn,2076183" n="0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7014278;portsmouth, portsmouth, virginia,Portsmouth,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7014277;portsmouth, rhode island, newport,Rhode Island,Newport,Rhode Island,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7014276;portsmouth, scioto, ohio,Scioto,Ohio,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7014275;portsmouth, rockingham, new hampshire,Rockingham,New Hampshire,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7011393;portsmouth,hampshire,england,united kingdom,europe,Hampshire,England,United Kingdom,Europe;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,2076183;portsmouth, carteret, north carolina,Carteret,North Carolina,United States,North and Central America" reg="portsmouth, portsmouth, virginia,Portsmouth,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;portsmouth, rhode island, newport,Rhode Island,Newport,Rhode Island,United States,North and Central America;portsmouth, scioto, ohio,Scioto,Ohio,United States,North and Central America;portsmouth, rockingham, new hampshire,Rockingham,New Hampshire,United States,North and Central America;portsmouth,hampshire,england,united kingdom,europe,Hampshire,England,United Kingdom,Europe;portsmouth, carteret, north carolina,Carteret,North Carolina,United States,North and Central America">Portsmouth</placeName> with the <rs>Erebus</rs> and Meteor, <num value="2">two</num> lightly-armored <orgName n="Floating Battery" type="battery">floating batteries</orgName>; and these were followed, in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> and in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, by the <name>Gloire</name> and the <rs>Warrior</rs>, veritable ironclad cruisers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>But the new system was still in its experimental stage; and it was left to the war of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> to show clearly its practical value.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The application of armor to the sides of vessels was accompanied, or rather induced, by improvements in ordnance, especially by the introduction of rifled guns in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> and of the heavy cast-iron smooth-bores of <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n0249.0002.00002.00006" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0"><surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Both these improvements, however, were of recent date.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> successful employment of rifled cannon in actual war was made by the <rs>French</rs> in the <rs>Italian</rs> campaign of <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> <dateStruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></dateStruct>; while the heavy <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n0249.0002.00003.00007" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0"><surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName> guns had hardly been <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> in use, and were still undergoing development.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>In regard to the ram, though seemingly a paradox, it may be said that its employment in naval warfare was so ancient that in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> it was really a new weapon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Its revival was a direct consequence of the application of steam to the propulsion of vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The <rs>Greeks</rs> and <rs>Romans</rs> had used it in their galley-fights with destructive effect; and it was only displaced by heavy guns when oars were displaced by sails, when ships no longer fought end-on, but broadside to broadside, and when the close-hauled line ahead took the place of the direct attack in line abreast, of the old galley tactics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The introduction of steam, by giving ships-of-war a motive power under their own control, independent of the action of the wind&mdash;an advantage similar to that which the triremes possessed in their banks of oars&mdash;revived the trireme's mode of attack, and made the ram once more an effective weapon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>But in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> this phase of naval development had not been recognized, and the sinking of the <rs>Cumberland</rs>, in <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> of the next year, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> revealed the addition that steam had made to the number and variety of implements of destruction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Torpedoes, though of more recent introduction than rams, were not wholly new weapons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The idea of the torpedo, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> discovered by <persName n="Bushnell,,,,," id="n0249.0002.00003.00008" reg="mostcommon:Bushnell,nomatch:0"><surname>Bushnell</surname></persName>, and developed by <persName n="Fulton,,,,," id="n0249.0002.00003.00009" reg="mostcommon:Fulton,nomatch:0"><surname>Fulton</surname></persName>, was rejected by the <rs>English Government</rs> in <dateStruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></dateStruct>, because it was recognized as giving an advantage to a weak navy over a powerful <num value="1">one</num>, and its adoption could only impair the maritime supremacy of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>On account of this advantage which the torpedo gave to the weaker side, it was brought into use by the <name>Russians</name> in the <name>Crimea</name>, and, though none of the allied vessels were destroyed by its agency, it none the less contributed appreciably to the protection of <placeName key="tgn,2634462" n="1.000 2" reg="russian river, kenai peninsula, alaska">Russian</placeName> harbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>But its great importance was not established <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> until the <rs>Civil War</rs>, and then only in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The Confederates took it up for the same reason that the <name>Russians</name> had adopted it in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, and the <rs>English</rs> had rejected it in <dateStruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Driven by the poverty of their naval resources to the use of every device that ingenuity could suggest, in the fall of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct> they established a bureau at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to elaborate and systematize torpedo warfare; and the destruction of the <rs>Housatonic</rs>, the <rs>Tecumseh</rs>, the <rs>Patapsco</rs>, and many smaller vessels, showed the tremendous power of the newly adopted weapon.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>From the fact that the navy at this period was concerned with an essentially living and growing science, it was important that its officers, above all in the senior grades, should be men of progressive minds and of energetic and rapid action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Especially was this the case when the navy found itself upon the threshold of a great war, in which every variety of naval operation was to be attempted, and every contrivance of mechanical art was to be employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>No doubt a war always brings new men to the front, irrespective of rank or age. But the main object of a navy's existence in time of peace is to be in a condition of instant readiness for war, and this object can only be attained by having the ablest and most energetic men in the foremost places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Unless such a provision is made, and made before war begins, the possibilities of naval development will be neglected; the vigor and audacity that should mark the earlier operations of a war will be wanting; and the opportunity of striking sharp and sudden blows at the outset will be lost.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Unfortunately, in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, the arrangement of the navy list failed to meet this essential condition of readiness for active operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Long years of peace, the unbroken course of seniority promotion, and the absence of any provision for retirement, had filled the highest grade with gallant veterans, <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> most of whom had reached an age that unfitted them for active service afloat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>At the head of the list were the <num value="78">seventy-eight</num> captains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>A few of them were men of commanding talents, and these few left their mark upon the records of the war. Of the rest, some had obtained distinction in an earlier period of their career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>But it is only in exceptional men that the physical and mental vigor is to be found that resists the enfeebling influences of advancing years; and it would be unjust to expect the active operations of war to be successfully carried on by a body of commanding officers most of whom had passed their <num value="60" type="ordinal">sixtieth</num> year.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>This was, however, only <num value="1">one</num> of the difficulties of the situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The excessive accumulation of older officers at the head of the list was felt as a heavy drag all the way down to the foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Promotion was blocked, as there was no provision for retirement; and the commanders and lieutenants, many of whom were conspicuous for ability and energy, were stagnating in subordinate positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The commanders at the head of the list were between <num value="58">fifty-eight</num> and <measure n="60years" type="date">sixty years</measure> of age&mdash;a time of life at which few men are useful for active service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The upper lieutenants were <num value="48">forty-eight</num> or <num value="50">fifty</num>&mdash;some indeed were past <num value="50">fifty</num>&mdash;and very few were in command of vessels, as there were <num value="200">two hundred</num> officers above them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-1">first-lieutenant</rs> of the <rs>Hartford</rs>, at that time the flagship of the <orgName n="East India Squadron" type="squadron">East India squadron</orgName>, had been <measure n="34years" type="date">thirty-four years</measure> in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>He and his contemporaries, who had entered the navy at <num value="16">sixteen</num> or thereabout, had not yet risen to the responsibilities of command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>This enforced continuance in subordinate stations could not fail to tell upon even the best men. The tendency of such a system is to make mere routine men, and to substitute apathy and inindolence for zeal and energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>If a man that has had proper <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> training is not fit for command at <num value="36">thirty-six</num>, it is not likely that he will ever be fit for it. If he has reached the point of fitness, every year of postponement, unless he is a very extraordinary man, is a year of deterioration.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The efficiency of the service was further weakened by the vicious system of promotion by seniority, to which the navy has always clung tenaciously, in the face of reason and precedent, of the analogies of civil preferment, and the example of other military and naval establishments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The defects of this system may be briefly indicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Every man who lives long enough, unless gross incompetency can be proved against him, goes to the head of the list, while those who have entered the service later, however much they may excel in ability or zeal, remain below to wait their turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>It is purely a question of survival.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>An officer comes to look upon promotion as his light, apart from any considerations of merit or distinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Public opinion in the service has no leaders, for the leading minds are not destined, as they would be in every other profession, to gravitate to the leading positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>They simply take their turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The natural conservatism of a military body is exaggerated, and judgment becomes warped by tradition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>As promotion is sure, there is no inducement to effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>No <num value="1">one</num> will readily assume responsibility, for he only runs a risk without any prospect of reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>It is not so much the presence of poor material that injures a service, as its elevation by an iron rule of promotion, and the enforced subordination of more capable men. As the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs> in <dateStruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></dateStruct> tersely put it, <q direct="unspecified">It is neither more nor less than elevating the incompetent, and then ordering the unpromoted competent to do their work.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/></p> 
<p>It became evident, shortly after the war began, that steps must be taken to remedy the existing state of things; but <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> nothing could be done at once, and it was only in <dateStruct value="1861-12-"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, that a law was passed retiring all officers at the age of <num value="62">sixty-two</num>, or after <measure n="45years" type="date">forty-five years</measure> of service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>By the same law, any captain or commander might be selected for the command of a squadron, with the rank of flag-officer, which should give him authority over his seniors in the squadron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Another act, passed in the following summer, created the grades of rear-admiral and commodore, recast the whole corps of officers, and established promotion by selection temporarily in the highest grade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>These measures, though late in coming, had the desired effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The veterans were gradually replaced by younger men; the commanders and lieutenants were raised to the places they were qualified to fill; and new life was infused into the service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>But the spirit of routine had for <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> pervaded the naval establishment, and the change could not be effected in a day. The whole tendency of the navy had been to preserve traditions, and to repress individuality in the <rs type="role" reg="junior-Officer">junior officers</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Men thought alike, talked alike, and acted alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>The officers in active service, grown old in the lower grades, and but little encouraged to exercise their powers of volition, had come to regard themselves as parts of a machine, and to wait for the orders of their superior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>As a general thing, the assumption of responsibility was neither desired nor permitted; and the subordinate who presumed, even in an emergency, to act upon his own judgment, was apt to bring down upon himself official censure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>It is related of <num value="1">one</num> of the captains at the <rs n="Battle of New Orleans" type="battle">battle of New Orleans</rs>, a man of unquestioned courage, that when he fell in with the <rs>Manassas</rs>, the hailed ship after ship to obtain an order from the admiral to run her down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Nor was this an extreme case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>As it happened, the character of the war was such as to call especially for self-reliance, resolute action, readiness of resource, and <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> the exercise of individual judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>But confirmed habits are not easily shaken off; and the operations of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> show from time to time the persistence of oldtradi-tions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Nothing short of a complete upheaval of the service brought about the needful change; commanders became admirals by a single step; and junior officers became first-lieutenants of the ships in which they were serving as midshipmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Finally, when the great leaders came into positions of active command, their encouragement and approval of individual enterprise gave to their juniors the opportunities of which the latter were only too eager to avail themselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>It was another unfortunate feature of the situation, that while there was a superabundance of old officers, there was a deficiency in the junior grades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Below the lieutenants there were less than a <num value="100">hundred</num> masters and midshipmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>These, together with a dozen of the younger lieutenants, were graduates of the <orgName n="Naval Academy" type="academy">Naval Academy</orgName>; and their service during the war showed the value of their thorough training.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>To fill the gap at the foot of the list the <num value="3">three</num> upper classes of acting midshipmen were ordered from the <name>Academy</name> into active service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Most of these were mere boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>They found themselves, with only the experience of <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> at the <orgName n="Naval School" type="school">Naval School</orgName>, suddenly placed in positions of difficulty and responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Many of them were lieutenants at <num value="19">nineteen</num>; but no better work was done in the naval war than that which was placed in the hands of these lads from the <name>Academy</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>The deficiency of officers was increased by the resignation or dismissal of those who took side with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>There were <num value="322">322</num> of these of all grades and corps, and among them were several of marked ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>But even without the losses occasioned by retirement and by resignation, the number of <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> officers would have been wholly insufficient to meet the demands of the war. Volunteers were called for, and great numbers entered the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>There were appointed altogether about <num value="7500">7,500</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>The regular officers formed only <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num> of the whole service; but in general they filled the most important positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>The additions to the line of the navy were composed of a great variety of material.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Some were merchant captains and mates of experience; others had never been at sea. Those employed on the <rs>Mississippi</rs> were chiefly steamboat men and pilots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Many of them were capable and gallant men, who, though unused to the handling of guns and the discipline of a military service, conducted themselves honorably and acquitted themselves with credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>As a class, the volunteers were an indispensable addition to the naval force, and rendered valuable service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Without the least reflection upon their good qualities, it may be said that their efficiency would have been increased by a previous military training.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>But no attempt had ever been made to form a reserve for the navy; and the administration was fortunate when it secured any nautical experience, although military training might be wholly wanting.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Great as was the want of officers, the want of trained seamen was equally great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>The complement of the navy had been fixed at <num value="7600">7,600</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Of these there were on <dateStruct value="1861-03-10"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="10">10</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, only <num value="207">207</num> in all the ports and receiving-ships on the <rs type="place">Atlantic coast</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>It was a striking illustration of the improvidence of naval legislation and administration, that in a country of <num value="30000000">thirty millions</num> of people only a couple of <num value="100">hundred</num> were at the disposal of the <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Seamen could not be had either to man the slips that might be commissioned, or to protect the exposed stations at <placeName key="tgn,7013303" n="1.000 493" reg="annapolis, anne arundel, maryland">Annapolis</placeName> and <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Prompt measures were taken during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year to increase <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> the force; and later, a great expansion took place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>In <dateStruct value="1863-07-"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, there were <num value="34000">34,000</num> men in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>But at all times there was a difficulty in obtaining trained seamen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>Large bounties were offered by State and local authorities for enlistment in the army, and transfers between the <num value="2">two</num> services were not authorized by law. When the draft was established, mariners were subjected to it like other citizens, without any regard to the service which they would prefer, or for which they might be specially fitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>In assigning the quotas to each locality, no allowance was made to maritime communities for the seamen they had furnished; so that they were forced, in self-defence, to send their seafaring population into the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>In <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, a law was passed correcting these evils; but meantime the navy suffered, and vessels were occasionally unable to go to sea for want of men. As the necessities of the service grew more pressing, the number of men in the navy increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>To obtain them, it was necessary to hold out extraordinary inducements; and in the last months, bounties as high as <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">one thousand dollars</measure> were offered and paid for a single seaman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>When the war ended, there were <num value="51500">51,500</num> men in the service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>Nothing shows more forcibly the dependence of the navy upon the merchant marine for recruiting its ranks in time of war than the enormous additions both of officers and seamen that took place between <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>It is from the merchant marine that such reinforcements must always be chiefly drawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>To fill the cadres of the army a well-trained and organized militia stands always ready, at least in many of the <name>States</name>; but no steps have ever been taken toward establishing a sea-militia, even since its importance has been demonstrated by the war. A trained reserve force is a greater necessity for the navy than for the army, not because the <num value="1">one</num> service is more important than the other, but because <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> its ranks are less easily recruited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>It may be said that drill will make any man a soldier, while a special training is required to make an efficient man-of-war's man. The army is purely a military profession; the navy combines <num value="2">two</num> professions&mdash;each an occupation by itself&mdash;the military and the nautical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>Hence the greater necessity for the navy of a large body of trained officers; and hence, also, the greater importance of a partially-trained naval reserve.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>In materiel, the navy was by no means in a backward condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>The wise policy, begun before the establishment of the <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName>, of building vessels which should be the best possible specimens of their class, had been steadily adhered to; and in war-ship construction the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> still held, and continued to hold until <dateStruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></dateStruct>, a place very near the highest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>When the importance of steam as a motive power had become established, the early side-wheelers were built,&mdash;<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the <rs>Mississippi</rs> and <rs>Missouri</rs>, and later the <rs>Powhatan</rs>, <placeName key="tgn,2093583" n="1.000 2" reg="susquehanna, susquehanna, pennsylvania">Susquehanna</placeName>, and Saranac.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>The Powhatan and <placeName key="tgn,2093583" n="1.000 2" reg="susquehanna, susquehanna, pennsylvania">Susquehanna</placeName>, at the time they were launched, in <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, were the most efficient naval vessels afloat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Next came the <num value="6">six</num> screw-frigates, which were built in <dateStruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></dateStruct>, and were regarded all the world over as the model men-of-war of the period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>Of these the largest was the <rs>Niagara</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>The other <num value="5">five</num>, the <rs>Roanoke</rs>, Colorado, <persName n="Merrimac,,,,," id="n0249.0002.00011.00010" reg="mostcommon:Merrimac,nomatch:0"><surname>Merrimac</surname></persName>, Minnesota, and <placeName reg="Fort Wabash">Wabash</placeName>, were vessels of a little over <num value="3000">three thousand</num> tons, and they carried, for their day, a powerful battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>Again, in <dateStruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></dateStruct>, <num value="12">twelve</num> screw-sloops of <num value="2">two</num> classes were built, most of which were admirable vessels, though they were wanting, with a few exceptions, in the important quality of speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class, vessels of about <num value="2000">two thousand</num> tons, included the <rs>Lancaster</rs>, <placeName reg="Hartford, Hartford, Connecticut" key="tgn,7013695">Hartford</placeName>, <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, <placeName reg="Brooklyn, New York, Kings" key="tgn,7015822">Brooklyn</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> class, of which the <rs>Pawnee</rs> and <rs>Iroquois</rs> were the largest, were also serviceable vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>Finally, in <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>, <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, Congress had made appropriation for <num value="7">seven</num> new screw-sloops, which were intended to be as efficient as their predecessors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>But these measures, well-judged though they were, were only a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step in the general conversion of the naval force from sailing vessels into steamers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Of the <num value="90">ninety</num> names borne on the <rs>Navy Register</rs> in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, <num value="50">fifty</num> were those of vessels of the older type&mdash;ships-of-the-line, frigates, sloops, and brigs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>Several of the liners were still on the stocks, never having been completed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>The others were notable ships in their day, but their day was past and gone forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>The list of frigates was headed by the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, built originally in the last century, and rendered famous by the victories of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Others had been built within a more recent period, but the type had not been materially altered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>The frigates were useful as receiving and practice-ships; but as far as war&ndash;service was concerned, they had only a historic value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>But little more could be said of the sloops and brigs; and the remainder of the sailing fleet were store-ships.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>Though swelling the total of ships-of-war to a considerable figure, the sailing vessels added little or nothing to the efficiency of the force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>This fact explains, in some degree, the inadequacy of the navy at the beginning of the war. A change had taken place about <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure> before in the motive power of ships, so radical that all the constructions of an earlier date were completely superseded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>In <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct> the navy was stronger for its day than in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>; because in <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct> all its ships were ships of the period, while in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> only half the fleet could be so regarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>The distance in time that separated the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> Macedonian from the <rs>Powhatan</rs> was not much greater than that between the <rs>Powhatan</rs> and the <rs>Hartford</rs>; yet in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> case the change was a revolution, <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> while in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> it was only a development.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>A captain that fought the <rs>Invincible Armada</rs> would have been more at home in the typical war-ship of <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct>, than the average captain of <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct> could have been at that time in the advanced types of the <rs>Civil War</rs>. As a matter of fact, it was no uncommon thing in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> to find officers in command of steamers who had never served in steamers before, and who were far more anxious about their boilers than about their enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>As naval science had advanced more in the last <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure> than in the <measure n="200years" type="date">two hundred years</measure> preceding, more than half the vessels on the navy list had become suddenly useless, and the effective force was narrowed down to the <num value="40">forty</num> that had steam as a motive power.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Another fact which helped to account for the want of preparation in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> was the supineness of the <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName> during the last months of <persName n="Buchanan,,,,," id="n0249.0002.00013.00011" reg="nearbymention:Buchanan,Franklin,,,"><surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>'s administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Few wars come on without some note of warning; and this was no exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>The effective force, small as it was, might easily have been so disposed as to be ready for an emergency, without even exciting comment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>The failure to take the necessary measures need not, however, be imputed to a treacherous sympathy with the insurgents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>It was only a part of the general policy of inaction, deliberately adopted by the <rs>Government</rs> during the winter of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>&ndash;&lsquo;<num value="61">61</num>, which forbade any measures pointing even remotely to coercion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>The most ordinary preparations were neglected; and if the crippling of the fleet had been intentional, it could not have been more effectual.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Of the <num value="40">forty</num> steamers included in the general list, <num value="5">five</num> were unserviceable, <num value="2">two</num> of them being still on the stocks, and the others useless except as receiving-ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/><num value="2">Two</num> more were mere tugs, and, together with the <rs>Michigan</rs>, stationed on the lakes, may be thrown out of the calculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/><pb id="p.14" n="14"/> <num value="8">Eight</num> others, including the <num value="5">five</num> frigates, were laid up in ordinary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>Since <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, the powerful <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n0249.0002.00015.00013" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0"><surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName> smooth-bore shell-guns had been introduced, and the new steam-frigates and sloops were armed with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>The Ix-inch guns of this description were mounted in broadside, and the Xi-inch (with a few X-inch) on pivots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>The powers of the Xi-inch had not been fully tested, and the prescribed service-charge was smaller than it was afterward found that the gun would bear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>The latest development of the smooth-bore gun was the Xv-inch, <num value="1">one</num> of which was generally mounted in each monitor turret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Rifled guns were gradually introduced during the war. These were chiefly <name type="weapon">Parrott guns</name>, <num value="20">20</num>-, <num value="30">30</num>-, and <num value="100">100</num>-pounders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>They were cast-iron guns, strengthened by a wrought-iron band around the breech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>Later, <num value="60">60</num>-pounders and <num value="150">150</num>-pounders were manufactured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>The <placeName reg="Parrott, Pulaski, Virginia" key="tgn,2113567">Parrott</placeName> gun of the smaller calibres was serviceable, but as a heavy gun it was dangerous, and occasionally burst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Besides the <name>Parrott</name> guns, a few light cast-iron <name type="weapon">Dahlgren rifles</name> were made; and in the <rs>Western</rs> flotilla, when it was transferred to the navy, there were several army rifled <num value="42">42</num>-pounders, which were so dangerous as to be nearly useless.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>The demands of the new service were many and various.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>There was the river service, where the navy acted largely in co-operation with the army, in the reduction of fortified points, and in opening and keeping open the lines of communication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>For this the essential qualification was light draft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>It needed small handy vessels, capable of approaching the shore, and of passing through shallow and difficult channels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>Quite distinct from it was the ocean service, which meant the pursuit and capture of Confederate cruisers, and of vessels engaged in illegal trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>The prime necessity here was speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Lastly, there was the coast service, <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> comprising the maintenance of the blockade, and detached operations against fortifications protected by powerful batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>The blockade required vessels that combined both speed and light draft, together with seaworthiness, and a certain degree of force to resist the sudden attacks which were made from time to time, in the hope of raising the blockade, or what was perhaps of equal importance, of inducing a belief abroad that such a result had been accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>The attack of fortified harbors, on the other hand, though from the nature of things carried on in connection with the blockade, called for an entirely different type of vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Here, force pure and simple, was needed; force offensive and defensive, heavy guns and heavy armor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>For all these kinds of service, vessels were required, and vessels in great numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>A small force could accomplish nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>The operations on the <rs>Mississippi</rs> and its tributaries alone, operations which were <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> to none in extent and efficiency, and carried on wholly in the enemy's country, required a large fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>For the ocean service, the vessels, to accomplish their object, must be numerous; while a very few served every purpose of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>It was easy for the half-dozen commerce-destroyers to catch merchantmen, with which every sea was filled, while it was a very difficult matter to catch the half-dozen commerce-destroyers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>Similarly, the blockade service required vessels at every port and inlet; otherwise it was not even legal, to say nothing of its being ineffective.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>In meeting the wants of the navy, the new administration proceeded with energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>All the ships on foreign stations, except <num value="3">three</num>, were recalled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>Measures were taken at once to increase the force by fitting out all the serviceable vessels that were laid up, by building in navy yards, and in private yards on contract, and by purchase in the open market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>The <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> difficulties were great, for the force required was enormous; and there were neither officers, men, ships, nor guns available, nor authority to procure them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>Ship-owners had failed to see that steamers were to supplant sailing-vessels for commercial purposes, and though the merchant marine was still considerable, it had not been modernized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Nor had any systematic plan been adopted, by which a Government inspection might secure the construction of merchant vessels, imperfectly perhaps, yet in some degree adapted for conversion into men of war. Indeed, in the absence of a demand, ship-builders were not prepared to supply steamers of any kind to a considerable extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>The number of machine-shops was small&mdash;from <num value="20">twenty</num> to <num value="30">thirty</num> at the most&mdash;and their plant only equal to the ordinary work of the construction and repair of machinery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>There were not more than <num value="8">eight</num> of these of any considerable size; and, in the sudden demand for locomotives and transports for the army and for marine engines for the navy, they were strained to the utmost.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/><num value="5">Five</num> distinct measures were immediately adopted for the increase of the naval force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was to buy everything afloat that could be made of service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>Purchases were made directly by the <name>Department</name>, or by officers acting under its direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>By the <dateStruct value="-07-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, <num value="12">twelve</num> steamers had been bought, and <num value="9">nine</num> were employed under charter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Subsequently it appeared that the business of purchasing, being a purely mercantile matter, might be suitably placed in the hands of a business man, who should act as the responsible agent of the <name>Department</name> in conducting the transactions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>This plan was adopted in <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>Each purchase was inspected by a <orgName n="Officers Board" type="board">board of officers</orgName>, and in this way the <name>Department</name> was enabled to secure, as far as any such were to be found, suitable vessels at a suitable price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The board of inspection could not exact a very high degree of excellence or <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> fitness, because everything afloat that could in any way be made to answer a purpose was pressed into the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>The vessels were of all sizes and descriptions, from screw-steamers and side-wheelers of <num value="2000">two thousand</num> tons to ferry-boats and tugs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>Some of the larger steamers were fast vessels and made efficient cruisers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The <rs>Connecticut</rs>, the <rs>Cuyler</rs>, the <rs>De Soto</rs>, and the <rs n="Santiago de Cuba" type="ship">Santiago de Cuba</rs> paid for their cost several times over in the prizes they captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>The majority of the purchased steamers were between <num value="100">one hundred</num> and <num value="800">eight hundred</num> tons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>Some of the least promising of these improvised men-of-war did good service against blockade-runners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>The <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Circassian</rs>, <num value="1">one</num> of the most valuable prizes made during the war, was captured outside of <placeName reg="Montour Falls, Schuyler, New York" key="tgn,2070618">Havana</placeName> by a Fulton ferry-boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>Even for fighting purposes, however, the ferry-boats, with their heavy guns, were by no means to be despised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>There were purchased altogether up to <dateStruct value="1861-12-"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, <num value="79">79</num> steamers and <num value="58">58</num> sailing vessels, <num value="137">137</num> in all. The number of vessels bought during the whole war amounted to <num value="418">418</num>, of which <num value="313">313</num> were steamers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>After the war was over, they were rapidly sold, at less than half their cost.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> measure adopted by the administration was the construction of sloops-of-war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/><num value="7">Seven</num> of these had been authorized by Congress in <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>, but the <name>Department</name> resolved to build <num value="8">eight</num>, assigning <num value="2">two</num> to each navy yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>In the latter part of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, <num value="8">eight</num> additional sloops were built, of the same general class, but larger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>All these <num value="14">fourteen</num> sloops, like their models of <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> before, were excellent vessels, and several of them are still in the service as <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-rates and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>-rates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/><pb id="p.19" n="19"/></p> 
<p>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> measure adopted by the <name>Department</name>, on its own responsibility, without waiting for the action of Congress, was to contract with private parties for the construction of small, heavily armed screw-gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/><num value="23">Twenty-three</num> of these were built, of which the <rs>Unadilla</rs> and <rs>Pinola</rs> may be regarded as types.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>They were of <num value="507">five hundred and seven</num> tons each, and mounted from <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="7">seven</num> guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>Some of them, within <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> from the date of contract, were afloat, armed, and manned, and took part in the <rs n="Battle of Port Royal" type="battle">battle of Port Royal</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>From their rapid construction, they were commonly known as the <q direct="unspecified"><num value="90">ninety</num>-day gunboats.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>They were an important addition to the navy, and were actively employed both in fighting and blockading during the whole war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>For service in the rivers and in narrow sounds and channels, still another class of vessels was needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>To meet this want, a <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> measure was adopted, by building <num value="12">twelve</num> paddle-wheel steamers, <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="400">four hundred</num> tons larger than the gunboats, but still small vessels, and of very light draft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>To avoid the necessity of turning, they were provided with a double bow, and a rudder at each end. These were the famous <q direct="unspecified">double-enders.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="12">twelve</num> were the so-called <persName n="Octorara,,,,," id="n0249.0002.00019.00015" reg="mostcommon:Octorara,nomatch:0"><surname>Octorara</surname></persName> class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>The <rs>Wateree</rs>, a vessel of the same size and general design, was built of iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>Finally the <rs>Mohongo</rs> class, also of iron, consisted of <num value="7">seven</num> double-enders of still larger size, and carrying a heavier armament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The Ashuelot<note anchored="yes">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>The <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> and last measure for the increase of the naval <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> force was the construction of ironclads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Congress had passed, at the extra session in <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, an appropriation of a <measure n="1000000.5dollars" type="currency">million and a half dollars</measure> for armored vessels, to be built upon plans approved by a <orgName n="Officers Board" type="board">board of officers</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Out of a large number of plans proposed, <num value="3">three</num> were selected by the board and ordered by the <name>Department</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>Upon these plans were built the New Ironsides, the <rs>Galena</rs>, and the <rs>Monitor</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Most of the measures, as outlined above, refer to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year of the war; but these <num value="5">five</num> types of vessels, converted merchantmen, sloops, gunboats, double-enders, and ironclads, represent the additions to the sea-going navy during the <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>In the construction of the new ships-of-war, no attempt was made to reproduce the fine screw-frigates of <dateStruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></dateStruct>, as they failed to show their usefulness, except perhaps at <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> and at <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>In the latter half of the war, however, the <name>Department</name> undertook the construction of a class of vessels of considerable size, but very different in character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>These were large, wooden steamers, with fine lines, excessively long and sharp and narrow, of light draft for their size, in which every quality was sacrificed to speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>In some of these the length was as great as <num value="8">eight</num> times the beam.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>They were to be seagoing cruisers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>Their main purpose was to capture the commerce-destroyers; and perhaps, in case of foreign complications, <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> to do a little commerce-destroying themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Their armament was heavy; but armament was not their principal feature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Above all things, they were to be fast; and in those that were built, the desired result was generally secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/><num value="1">One</num> of them, the <name>Wampanoag</name> or <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, succeeded in attaining for a short time the extraordinary speed of <num value="17">seventeen</num> and <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> knots an hour.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>The plan which comprehended the construction of these vessels was a scheme of somewhat large dimensions, and was never completed.

Under the pressure of urgent necessity, they were built of unseasoned white-oak timber, instead of the live-oak which had been hitherto used for ships-of-war; and such of them as were finished were no sooner in the water than they began to decay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/><measure n="6years" type="date">Six years</measure> after the war was ended, the <rs type="role" reg="chief-Constructor">chief constructor</rs>, writing of these vessels, reported that some of them, costing over a <num value="1000000">million</num> of dollars, had made only <num value="1">one</num> cruise, and then had been found too rotten to be repaired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>They served the purpose, however of contributing, with other circumstances, to modify the menacing attitude of foreign powers; and their serious imperfections were the necessary result of the situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>The Administration was bound to do its utmost to provide for every contingency; and the failure of preparation during peace, when plans could be matured, and materials accumulated at leisure, compelled, when the time of action came, a hurried and lavish expenditure.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>The terms of the proclamation were as follows <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Upon the issue of the proclamation, the <rs>Government</rs> immediately found itself confronted with the question whether the movement at the <rs>South</rs> should be regarded as rebellion or as war. From the legal point of view the acts of the insurgents could be looked upon in no other light than as armed insurrection; <q direct="unspecified">levying war against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>,</q> and under the constitutional definition, the actors were guilty of treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>But the extent of the movement, its well-defined area, and, above all, its complete governmental organization, made it impossible to put the legal theory into practice; and almost from the beginning hostilities were carried on precisely as in a regular war. The Government, however, in its dealings with foreign powers always asserted stoutly that the movement was purely an insurrection, and that those in arms against it were rebels, and not belligerents.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>This position, though it involved occasional inconsistencies, was maintained with considerable success, except in relation to the status of prisoners, and in those cases where the operations of the war affected foreign interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>The question <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> arose in reference to the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>Blockade, in the ordinary sense, is purely an act of war. It means the closing of an enemy's ports, and the capture of all vessels, neutral or hostile, attempting to enter with knowledge of the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>It enables a belligerent to seize vessels on the high seas bound for a blockaded port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>It stands on the same footing as the right of search, which is exclusively a war right; and like the right of search, it is a benefit to the belligerent, and a hardship to the neutral.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Even after the <rs>President</rs>'s proclamation, which was to all intents a belligerent declaration, and after the blockade had been set on foot, the <rs>Government</rs> still held to its theory that the parties to the contest were not belligerents, and that <pb id="p.29" n="29"/> rebellion was not in any sense war. In his report of <dateStruct value="1861-07-04"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="4">4</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, at the special session of Congress, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs> referred to the blockade in these terms: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/></p> 
<p>In carrying into effect these principles, and in suppressing the attempts to evade and resist them, and in order to maintain the <rs>Constitution</rs> and execute the laws, it became necessary to interdict commerce at those ports where duties could not be collected, the laws maintained and executed, and where the officers of the <rs>Government</rs> were not tolerated or permitted to exercise their functions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>In performing this <hi rend="italics">domestic municipal duty</hi>,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/> 
<p>The italics are not in the original.</p></note> the property and interests of foreigners became to some extent involved in our home questions, and with a view to extending to them every comity that the circumstances would justify, the rules of blockade were adopted, and, as far as practicable, made applicable to the cases that occurred under this embargo or noninter-course of the insurgent States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>The commanders of the squadron were directed to permit the vessels of foreigners to depart within <measure n="15days" type="date">fifteen days</measure>, as in cases of actual effective blockade, and then vessels were not to be seized unless they attempted, after having been once warned off, to enter an interdicted port in disregard of such warning.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>In referring to the blockade in these words, the <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName> clearly had in mind a measure of internal administration; and this domestic application of a belligerent right was excused on the ground of a desire to extend every possible comity to foreigners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>But in putting forward this plea, the <rs>Secretary</rs> failed to see that the application of the rules of blockade to a domestic embargo, so far from extending comity to foreigners, abridged their rights, and imposed on them liabilities and penalties which no domestic embargo of itself could produce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>It was not the foreign trader, but the belligerent cruiser that gained by the adoption of the rules of blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>A government has the right to close its own ports, and to impose heavy penalties upon all who attempt <pb id="p.30" n="30"/> to enter; but it cannot by virtue of any such measure search and seize foreign vessels on the high seas, even though bound for the embargoed port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>To do this it must establish a blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>In other words, it must wage war, and the <num value="2">two</num> parties in the contest must become belligerents.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>Although it may have been the intention of the <rs>Executive</rs> in <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> to regard the blockade as a domestic embargo, it soon gave up the idea in practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>Neutral vessels were searched and captured at sea. Prizes were sent in for adjudication, and condemned for breach of blockade and for carrying contraband, <q direct="unspecified">in pursuance of the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and the <rs>Law</rs> of Nations in such case provided,</q> and not in pursuance of any law imposing civil forfeitures or penalties for violation of a domestic embargo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The forms of examination and procedure were those of belligerent prize-courts; and the decisions expressly recognized a state of war, and could be founded on no other hypothesis.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Under these circumstances, the complaint against the <rs>British Government</rs> of having done an unfriendly act in recognizing the rebels as belligerents, had no very serious foundation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>The <rs>Queen</rs>'s proclamation of neutrality, published on <dateStruct value="-05-13"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="13">13</day></dateStruct>, was a statement that hostilities existed between the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and <q direct="unspecified">certain States styling themselves the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName>,</q> and a command to <name>British</name> subjects to observe a strict neutrality between the contending parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Its form and contents were those commonly found in the declarations of neutrals at the outbreak of war. The annoyance it gave to the <rs>Government</rs> and the elation it caused at the <rs>South</rs> were due to the fact that it appeared somewhat early in the struggle, and that it was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> recognition from abroad of the strength and organization of the insurgent Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>As a matter of law, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> had the right to declare herself <pb id="p.31" n="31"/> neutral, especially after the blockade was proclaimed, as blockade is a purely belligerent act. Her offence, reduced to its exact proportions, consisted in taking the ground of a neutral before the magnitude and force of the insurrection were such as to justify it. But the hopes raised at the <rs>South</rs> by the proclamation led to the prevalent belief throughout the <rs>Union</rs> that it was dictated by unfriendly motives; while the undisguised sympathy for the <rs>Southern</rs> cause shown by the upper classes in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> tended to strengthen the impression and to aggravate the wound.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>The inception of the blockade was somewhat irregular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Ordinarily a blockade may begin in <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="2">two</num> ways; either by a public announcement coupled with the presence of a force before the blockaded port; or by stationing the force without an announcement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is a blockade by notification; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> is a blockade in fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>As breach of blockade only becomes an offence when accompanied by knowledge, actual or constructive, of the existence of the blockade, it is a question of some importance when the blockade begins and how knowledge of it is to be acquired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>In a blockade by notification, knowledge is held to have been acquired when sufficient time has elapsed for the notice to have been generally received; and after this time a neutral vessel, by sailing for the blockaded port, has committed an offence and incurred a penalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>With a blockade that is purely <hi rend="italics">de facto</hi>, on the other hand, knowledge must be obtained on the station, and neutrals have a right to sail for the port and to be warned off on their arrival.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>Whether a blockade is initiated as a blockade by notification or as a blockade <hi rend="italics">de facto</hi>, the indispensable condition of its establishment is the presence of a force at the blockaded port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Actual notice of the fact can never precede the <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> existence of the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>'s <num value="2">two</num> proclamations did not therefore constitute actual notice, because at the date of their issue there was not even a pretence that the blockade existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Nor do they appear to have been so intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>The idea was rather to publish a manifesto declaring in a general way the intentions of the <rs>Government</rs>, and then to carry them out as promptly as circumstances would permit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>The blockade therefore began as a blockade <hi rend="italics">de facto</hi>, not as a blockade by notification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>During the summer of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> vessels were stationed at different points, <num value="1">one</num> after another, by which the blockade at those points was separately established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>Notices, of a more or less informal character, were given in some cases by the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> of the blockading force; but no general practice was observed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>When <persName n="Poor,Captain,,,," id="n0249.0003.00032.00035" reg="mostcommon:Poor,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Poor</surname></persName>, in the <rs>Brooklyn</rs>, took his station off the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, he merely informed the officer commanding the forts that New Orleans was blockaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>He added that vessels coming from a distance, and ignorant of the proclamation, would be warned off. But <persName n="Pendergrast,,,,," id="n0249.0003.00032.00037" reg="mostcommon:Pendergrast,nomatch:0"><surname>Pendergrast</surname></persName>'s announcement, though intended as a notification, was marked by the same defects as the proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>The actual blockade and the notice of it must always be commensurate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>At this time, there were several vessels in <placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName>, but absolutely no force on the coast of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>; and the declaration was open to the charge of stating what was not an existing fact.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>The importance of these early formalities arises from the <pb id="p.33" n="33"/> fact that the liability of neutral vessels depends on the actual existence of the blockade, and upon their knowledge of it. Until the establishment of the blockade is known, actually or constructively, all vessels have a right to be warned off. When the fact has become notorious, the privilege of warning ceases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>In the statement about warning, therefore, the <rs>President</rs>'s proclamation said either too much or too little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>If it was intended, as the language might seem to imply, that during the continuance of the blockade&mdash;which, as it turned out, was the same thing as during the continuance of the war&mdash;all neutral vessels might approach the coast and receive individual warning, and that only after such warning would they be liable to capture, it conceded far more than usage required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>If it meant simply that the warning would be given at each point for such time after the force was posted as would enable neutrals generally to become aware of the fact, it conveyed its meaning imperfectly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>In practice, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> interpretation was adopted, in spite of the remonstrances of neutrals; and the warnings given in the early days of the blockade were gradually discontinued, the concessions of the proclamation to the contrary notwithstanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>The time when warning should cease does not appear to have been fixed; and in <num value="1">one</num> instance at least, on the coast of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, it was given as late as <dateStruct value="1862-07-"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>The fact of warning was commonly endorsed on the neutral's register.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>In some cases the warnings had the same fault as <persName n="Pendergrast,,,,," id="n0249.0003.00033.00038" reg="mostcommon:Pendergrast,nomatch:0"><surname>Pendergrast</surname></persName>'s proclamation, in being a little too comprehensive, and including ports where an adequate force had not yet been stationed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>The concession of warning to neutrals at the port, if it had continued through the war, would have rendered the blockade to a great extent inoperative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>Vessels would have been able to approach the coast without risk of capture, and to have lain about the neighborhood until a good opportunity offered for running past the squadron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>In other words, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> risk of the blockade-runner would have been a risk of warning, instead of a risk of capture; and the chances in his favor would have been materially increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>Return cargoes were transshipped in the same way. This had a double advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>It made the continuity of the transaction much more difficult of proof, and it enabled the capitalists engaged in the trade to employ <num value="2">two</num> different classes of vessels, for the service for which each was specially adapted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>For the long voyages across the <rs>Atlantic</rs> heavy freighters could be used, of great capacity and stoutly built; and the light, swift, hardly visible steamers, with low hulls, and twin-screws or feathering paddles, the typical blockade-runners, could be employed exclusively for the <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> run on the other side of <placeName key="tgn,2535807;tgn,7006630" n="0.312 000000.6239	placename;tgn,2535807;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;0.012 000000.0248	placename;tgn,7006630;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America" reg="nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America">Nassau</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,7005064" n="1.000 3" reg="bermuda">Bermuda</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>But here again the courts stepped in, and held that though a transshipment was made, even after landing the cargo and going through a form of sale, the <num value="2">two</num> voyages were parts of <num value="1">one</num> and the same transaction, and the cargo from the outset was liable to condemnation, if the original intention had been to forward the goods to a blockaded port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>Nor did the decisions stop here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>As all the property, both ship and cargo, is confiscated upon proof of breach of blockade, it was held that the ships carrying on this traffic to neutral ports were confiscated, provided the ultimate destination of the cargo to a blockaded port was known to the owner.

<p>The adoption of this rule by the highest courts in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> raised a loud outcry on the part of those interested in the traffic, and was severely criticised by publicists abroad, especially by those who favored, in general, the continental view of the laws of war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>In truth, however, the principle adopted by the court was not a new <num value="1">one</num>, though a novel application was made of it to meet a novel combination of circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>In these cases <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Stowell</foreName></persName> held that the continuity of the voyage was not broken, unless the cargo was really imported into the common stock of the neutral country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>That the principle had not been applied to blockades was due to the fact that circumstances had never called for it, as the practice of breaking a blockade had never before been carried out on such a scale, with such perfect appliances, and by the use of such ingenious devices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>The really difficult question before the court was as to the sufficiency of the evidence in each case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>It was to be expected that every artifice in the nature of simulated papers, pretended ownership, false destination, and fictitious transfers would be adopted to escape liability; and it was the business of the court to penetrate all these disguises, and to ascertain the real character <pb id="p.41" n="41"/> of each transaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>It is probable that in no case was injustice done in brushing aside and disregarding the various ceremonies, more or less elaborate and artificial, that were performed over blockade-running cargoes at <placeName key="tgn,2535807;tgn,7006630" n="0.306 000000.6115	placename;tgn,2535807;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;0.019 000000.0372	placename;tgn,7006630;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America" reg="nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America">Nassau</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7005064" n="1.000 3" reg="bermuda">Bermuda</placeName>; and it must often have happened that the ingenuity of shippers was rewarded by a decree of restitution for the want of technical evidence, when there was no moral doubt as to the vessel's guilt.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>As a last resort, the blockade-running merchants adopted an expedient so original and so bold that it may almost be said to have merited success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>It was supposed that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would not interfere with commerce between its own ports and those of a neutral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>This expectation, however, was not well-founded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>The Government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, although federal in its organization, was not so impotent in regard to the regulation of trade as was that of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in enforcing the neutrality of its subjects; and if action could not be taken through the <rs type="place">Courts</rs>, it could be taken through the custom-houses.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>The instructions were perfectly general in character, naming no particular port or country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>The agents of the blockade-runners, however, styling themselves merchants of <placeName key="tgn,2535807;tgn,7006630" n="0.293 000000.5868	placename;tgn,2535807;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;0.025 000000.0496	placename;tgn,7006630;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America" reg="nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America">Nassau</placeName>, adopted a tone of righteous indignation, and actually had the effrontery to complain of this <q direct="unspecified">unjust discrimination</q> against what they ingenuously called the trade of the <name>Bahamas</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>As if, indeed, the <name>Bahamas</name> had had any trade, or <placeName key="tgn,2535807;tgn,7006630" n="0.293 000000.5868	placename;tgn,2535807;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;0.025 000000.0496	placename;tgn,7006630;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America" reg="nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America">Nassau</placeName> any merchants, before the days of blockade-running!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>They succeeded, however, in persuading <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> to take up the diplomatic cudgels in their behalf; but from the long correspondence that followed, the <rs>English Government</rs>, being clearly in the wrong, derived little satisfaction, and a stop was put to the traffic.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>The character of the blockade changed materially as the war went on. At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the prevailing idea seems to have been that its object was to put a stop to legitimate trade, and that this object was secured by the official declaration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>The squadrons seem to have been employed rather to comply with the requirements of international law, and to make the prohibition binding upon neutrals, than as being themselves the agency by which the prohibition was to be enforced, and without which it was only so much waste paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>This idea had some foundation in view of the fact that from the beginning, though the blockading force was then inconsiderable, the regular course of trade at the <rs>Southern</rs> ports was actually interrupted, neutrals for a time respecting the proclamation, or being satisfied to receive their warning and to go elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>In place of the regular commerce, however, a contraband trade grew up, little by little, which, beginning with any materials that came to hand, and carried on chiefly by people along the coast, gradually grew to considerable <pb id="p.43" n="43"/> proportions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>Then, and then only, was the true character of the blockade recognized, and measures were taken, by increasing the force and by perfecting its organization, to make the watch so close as really to prevent egress and ingress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>But by this time the capital embarked in the business was so large as to secure the construction of vessels built especially for the purpose, beautifully adapted to the work, and far more difficult to capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>Therefore, while the efforts of the blockaders were redoubled, the difficulties before them were vastly increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>The old traditional idea of a blockade, maintained by a few large vessels moving up and down before a port, at a distance, gave place to the entirely novel practice of anchoring a large number of small and handy steamers in an exposed position close to the bar at the entrance of the blockaded harbors; and the boldness with which, after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, men kept their vessels close in with the shore and manfully rode out the gales at their anchors&mdash;a thing which seafaring men, as a rule, had regarded as impossible, and which would have appalled the stoutest captains of former times&mdash;showed as clearly as the actual engagements the real stuff of which the navy was made.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>As to the legal efficiency of the blockade after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, there can be no question; and by the end of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> year its stringency was such that only specially-adapted vessels could safely attempt to run it. If proof of its efficiency was needed, it could be found in the increased price of cotton and in the scarcity of manufactured goods at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>In the last year it became as nearly perfect as such an operation can be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>Taking its latest development as a type, it is probable that no blockade has ever been maintained more effectually by any State; and it is certain that no State ever had such a blockade to maintain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/><pb id="p.44" n="44"/> Apart from its enormous extent, it had <num value="4">four</num> characteristics which mark it as wholly unprecedented: in the peculiar formation of the shore, which gave almost a double coastline throughout, penetrated by numerous inlets, giving access to a complicated network of channels; in the vicinity of neutral ports friendly to the blockade-runners; in the cotton-monopoly of the <rs>South</rs>, which made the blockade a source of irritation to neutrals; and finally, but the most important consideration of all, in the introduction of blockade-running vessels propelled by steam.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>The success of this undertaking, so unprecedented both in its magnitude and difficulty, can best be judged by the results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>The number of prizes brought in during the war was <num value="1149">1,149</num>, of which <num value="210">210</num> were steamers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>There were also <num value="355">355</num> vessels burned, sunk, driven on shore, or otherwise destroyed, of which <num value="85">85</num> were steamers; making a total of <num value="1504">1,504</num> vessels of all classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>The value of these vessels and their cargoes, according to a low estimate, was <num value="31000000">thirty-one millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>In the <rs>War</rs> of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, which has always, and justly, been regarded as a successful naval war, the number of captures was <num value="1719">1,719</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>But the <rs>War</rs> of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct> was waged against a commercial nation, and the number of vessels open to capture was therefore far greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>Of the property afloat, destroyed or captured during the <rs>Civil War</rs>, the larger part suffered in consequence of the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>Moreover, in the earlier war, out of the whole number of captures, <num value="1428">1,428</num> were made by privateers, which were fitted out chiefly as a commercial adventure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>In the <rs>Civil War</rs> the work was done wholly by the navy; and it was done in the face of obstacles of which naval warfare before that time had presented no example or conception.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>As a military measure, the blockade was of vital importance in the operations of the war; and it has been commonly <pb id="p.45" n="45"/> said that without it hostilities would have been protracted much longer, and would have been far more bitter and bloody than they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>Its peculiar importance lay in the isolation of the <rs>Southern States</rs> and in their dependence upon the outside world for the necessaries of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>The only neutral frontier was along the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>; and the country, for many miles on both sides of the boundary, offered few facilities for trade or transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>All supplies must come from the seaboard; and the purely agricultural character of Southern industry made supplies from abroad a necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>Had the position of the <num value="2">two</num> opponents been reversed, and an efficient blockade maintained against the <rs>Northern</rs> ports, it would have told with far less severity than at the <rs>South</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>Besides the exclusion of manufactured goods, and especially of munitions of war, which Was <num value="1">one</num> of the prime objects of the blockade, its <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and equally important object was to prevent the exportation of cotton, with which at this time the <rs>Southern States</rs> supplied the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>The amount of floating capital at the <rs>South</rs> was never large; land and slaves were the favorite forms of investment; and the sale of cotton was therefore the main source of income.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>When exportation was cut off, the <rs>Government</rs> was deprived of its revenues for the war, and the people of the very means of existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>It was the common impression at the <rs>South</rs> that the rest of the world, and especially <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, had too great an interest in the cotton supply to tolerate a prohibition on exportation; and it was believed, or at least hoped, that the blockade would prove a fatal measure for its originators, by the injury it would work abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>The injury was not over-estimated; and it doubtless had its effect upon the sympathies of the interested foreign state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/><placeName key="tgn,7008154" n="1.000 10" reg="lancashire,england,united kingdom,europe">Lancashire</placeName>, the great centre of the cotton <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> manufacture, was compelled to close its mills; and the distress that resulted among the operatives may be estimated by the fact that, <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> after the war had begun, no less than <num value="10000000">ten millions</num> of dollars had been disbursed by, the <rs>Relief Committees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>But the <rs>British Government</rs>, whatever may have been its disposition, had at no time a plausible pretext for intervention; and the blockade continued to be enforced with increased rigor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>As the war went on, the naval forces, securing the cooperation of small bodies of troops, gradually obtained a foothold at various points and converted the blockade into a military occupation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>These points then became the headquarters of the different squadrons&ndash;ports for rendezvous, refitment, and supply, for the <q direct="unspecified">repairs and coal</q> that were forever drawing away the blockaders from their stations at critical moments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>By the spring of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct> all the squadrons were well provided in this respect, though some of the centres of occupation were occasionally recovered by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>Especially on the coast of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, blockade and occupation alternated at the different Passes throughout the war, partly in consequence of the want of troops to hold the occupied points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>Curiously enough, too, these centres of occupation became in a small way centres of blockade-running&mdash;Nassaus and Bermudas on a diminutive scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>Its importance as a blockading station, especially in the early part of the war, was due to the fact that it commanded the entrance to the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1123695" n="1.000 3" reg="elizabeth, virginia, united states">Elizabeth Rivers</placeName>, upon <num value="1">one</num> of which lay the <rs>Confederate</rs> capital, and upon the other their principal naval depot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/></p> 
<p>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> cruise of the <rs>Monitor</rs> was a novel experiment and, as the event showed, full of hazard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>Had she been intended merely as a <orgName n="Floating Battery" type="battery">floating battery</orgName> to protect the harbor in which <pb id="p.57" n="57"/> she was built, the service would have called for no extraordinary sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>But she was to go to sea; and many experienced officers, both in the navy and in the merchant service, doubted seriously her ability to keep afloat in any but the calmest weather, and regarded the enterprise as desperate&mdash; an opinion which the <rs>Monitor</rs>'s subsequent career fully justified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>If she sank, she would sink quickly; and there was small chance that any of the devoted men penned up in her submerged hull would escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>All this was well understood by her officers and men; and with a courage and self-devotion of no common order, they voluntarily accepted the conditions, and prepared to meet the danger.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>The general plan of the <rs>Monitor</rs>, as originally invented by <persName n="Ericsson,,,,," id="n0249.0004.00057.00079" reg="mostcommon:Ericsson,John,,,:1"><surname>Ericsson</surname></persName>, was little less than an inspiration of genius.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>But the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> vessel of the type was by no means perfect in its details, and many improvements were made in those subsequently built.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>The defects, for grave defects they were, had a marked influence upon both her sea-going and her fighting qualities, and put her at a great disadvantage as compared with her successors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>Her armored deck or raft was attached to the hull by a single set of rivets, which were unequal to the strain caused by a heavy sea striking the projecting bow from underneath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>Her smoke-pipes and blower-pipes projected only a few feet above the deck, and could hardly fail to ship large quantities of water in a heavy sea. In action, her weakest point was the pilot-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>Its rude structure, that of an iron log hut, was ill-calculated to resist the blow of a heavy projectile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>Its roof was detached, merely resting by its weight on the walls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>Its position on the deck forward of the turret was disadvantageous, as it precluded end &mdash; on fire when the vessel was approaching an enemy, and reduced the circular sweep of the guns by nearly <num value="8">eight</num> points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>But the worst feature of the arrangement was the separation of the <pb id="p.58" n="58"/> captain who was manoeuvring the ship from the lieutenant who was working the turret and firing the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>Each was completely cut off from the other, except by a speaking-tube, which opened in the floor of the movable turret, and through which the sound would only pass when the turret was in its normal position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>The experience of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Monitor led to the simple device of putting the pilot-house over the turret, a change that was suggested by <persName n="Newton,,,,," id="n0249.0004.00058.00080" reg="nearbymention:Newton,Isaac,,,"><surname>Newton</surname></persName>, the engineer of the vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>Finally the machinery for turning the turret, a wheel and rod connected by gearing with the turret-engine, was so defective that the turret was equally slow in starting, and, once started, in coming to a stop; and there was hardly time to point the guns before the muzzles had swept by their target.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>But considering the time in which she was built, the wonder is not that she was imperfect, but that she was in anywise ready; and it was well for the country that she did not wait another day to complete her preparations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> trial of the <rs>Monitor</rs> was made <dateStruct value="-02-19"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg="19">19</day></dateStruct>, on the day that she was delivered at the <rs type="place">Navy Yard</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>She was put in commission on the <dateStruct value="--25"><day reg="2">25th</day></dateStruct>, when a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> trial took place; but her steering gear was not in working order, and she did not go out of the <placeName reg="Hardy, Mercer, West Virginia" key="tgn,2118514">East River</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>At <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> trial, a week later, she steamed-down to <placeName reg="Sandy Hook, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,2048618">Sandy Hook</placeName>, and tried her guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>The mechanics were still at work upon her; indeed, the vessel was hardly completed when she left New York, though the workmen were busy during the night before she sailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>Finally, at <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time> on the morning of <dateStruct value="-03-6"><day type="name">Thursday</day>, <month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="6">6</day></dateStruct>, she started down the harbor; and in the afternoon she was fairly at sea on her way to the <rs>Chesapeake</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>The passage down was difficult and dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>The Monitor was in tow of the <rs>Seth Low</rs>, a small tug, and was accompanied by <num value="2">two</num> unseaworthy <term type="ship">gunboats</term>, the <rs type="ship">Currituck</rs> and <rs type="ship">Sachem</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>The <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> between the commission, of the <rs>Monitor</rs> <pb id="p.59" n="59"/> and her departure had given the crew little time for practice in the management of the novel craft, with its complicated mechanism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>The wind was moderate during <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> and <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>; but about noon, off the <rs>Delaware</rs>, it freshened to a strong breeze from the northwest, and caused a rough sea, which broke over the vessel's deck, forcing the water in floods through the hawse-pipes and under the turret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>In the afternoon the sea increased, and breaking over the smoke-pipe and blower-pipe, caused the blower-bands to slip and break.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>This stopped the draft in the furnace, and filled the engine-room and fire-room with gas. <persName n="Newton,,,,," id="n0249.0004.00059.00081" reg="nearbymention:Newton,Isaac,,,"><surname>Newton</surname></persName>, with the other engineers and the firemen, strove in vain against the gas, trying to repair the injury, and they were only rescued as they lay unconscious on the floor of the engine-room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>As the engines were now useless either for propulsion or pumping, the water gained rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>The hand-pump was used and the men set to bailing, but with little effect, as the water could only be carried off over the wall of the turret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>At last the tug was headed for the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>After <measure n="5hours" type="date">five hours</measure> steaming, the vessels came into smoother water; the engine-room was cleared of gas, the blower-bands were repaired, and the engine once more moved slowly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>So matters continued until shortly after <time value="12am">midnight</time>, when the <rs>Monitor</rs>, in crossing a shoal, suddenly ran into a heavy head-sea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>The water came up through the anchor-well, forced the air through the hawse-pipe, and flowed in a stream over the ward-room table to the berth-deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>Efforts were made to close the hawse-pipe, and the rush of water was partly checked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>But the sea now broke violently over the deck, and again entered the blower-pipes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>Another disaster seemed imminent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>The head wind prevented <persName n="Worden,,,,," id="n0249.0004.00059.00082" reg="nearbymention:Worden,John,L.,,"><surname>Worden</surname></persName> from hailing the tug, and in the hurry of preparation no arrangement had been made for signalling at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/><pb id="p.60" n="60"/> Every sea that dashed the spray over the blowers was anxiously watched; and every few minutes word came from the engine-room that the engine could not go much longer unless the water was kept out. About this time the wheel-ropes jumped off the steering wheel, owing to the pitching of the ship, and became jammed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>The vessel was now unmanageable and began to sheer about wildly; but the tow-rope held, and half an hour's work repaired the injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>After <num value="5">five</num> critical hours, daylight broke, and the tug was ordered to go nearer the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>By <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time> the danger was over.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>It appears that the movements of the <rs>Monitor</rs>, at the time when there was no captain to direct her, led others besides Van Brunt to suppose that she had given up the fight; and the assertion has since been confidently made that she was beaten and driven off by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>The statement is not borne out by the facts, as the <rs>Monitor</rs> only went off a short distance into shoal water, and presently renewed the combat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>What ground he had for forming such a belief does not appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>It has also been suggested that his pilots led him to suppose that delay would prevent him from crossing the bar. But what need had he to cross?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>The bar was a mile above <placeName key="tgn,2653764" n="1.000 2" reg="sewells point, norfolk, virginia">Sewall's Point</placeName>; he had anchored safely the night before under the battery, and after destroying the <rs>Minnesota</rs>&mdash;supposing that the <rs>Monitor</rs> had disappeared&mdash;he could do the same again, and go up to <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> at his leisure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>Though both the ironclads were severely pounded in the engagement, neither had developed fully its offensive strength, and all things considered they got off rather easily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>The <rs>Merrimac</rs> leaked somewhat from the collision of her unarmed stem with the <rs>Monitor</rs>'s overhang, and the plates of her armor were broken where they were struck, but the wooden backing was not penetrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>The roof of the <rs>Monitor</rs>'s pilot-house was partly displaced, and <num value="1">one</num> of its beams was cracked; but otherwise the vessel was left intact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>So with the ordnance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>The service charge for the Xi-inch guns was <measure n="15l." type="pounds"><num value="15">fifteen</num> pounds</measure>, and the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> had enjoined upon <persName n="Worden,,,,," id="n0249.0004.00073.00126" reg="nearbymention:Worden,John,L.,,"><surname>Worden</surname></persName> to limit himself to this, though it was found later that <measure n="30l." type="pounds"><num value="30">thirty</num> pounds</measure> could be safely used; and on the other hand, owing to the great demand among the <rs>Confederates</rs> for projectiles at other points, and to the supposition that she would have only wooden vessels to encounter, the <rs>Merrimac</rs> was not supplied <pb id="p.74" n="74"/> with solid shot, which would have been far more effective against armor than shells.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>On that memorable <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> dismay and consternation pervaded the fleet; the <rs>Merrimac</rs> had the frigates at her mercy, and the waters of <placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName> under her control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>To all appearances the confidence of the country in its navy was on the point of being rudely shaken by the sudden destruction of a large force of its most powerful ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>The blockade was about to be raised at the point where it had seemed to be most firmly established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>A roadstead whose occupation was of the highest strategic importance was about to pass into the hands of the enemy; and the proposed plan of an invasion of the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs> would be rendered impracticable if the army's base and communications were threatened by the <rs>Merrimac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>It was even feared that the ironclad would issue from the <rs>Chesapeake</rs> and levy contributions on Northern ports; and though it was afterward known that she could not have gone to sea with safety, the fact that she was at large and that her egress was unchecked would have produced incalculable mischief both at home and abroad.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>But the renown of the <rs>Monitor</rs> and of the gallant officer who commanded her rest no less on the courage and conduct that carried her to victory than on the importance of the action and the dramatic interest that surrounded it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>With a fortitude beyond all praise he held to his purpose, and carried the experimental craft through her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> perilous sea-voyage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>The close of the battle found the enemy in retreat, the blockade unbroken, the fleet saved, and the <rs type="place">Roads</rs> reconquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1252"/>It is an established rule that the absence of a blockading fleet, caused by stress of weather, if the blockade is immediately resumed, constitutes only a tempoary interruption; but the dispersion of a squadron by a hostile attack puts a stop to the blockade in <hi rend="italics">toto</hi>and a renewal of the operation requires a new proclamation, or rather, requires knowledge of the re-establishment of the blockade as a ground for condemnation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1325"/>On the losing side, the parallel is equally striking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1704"/>The short-voyage blockade-runners, destined for the passage between the neutral islands and the blockaded coast, began to make their appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1705"/>In these every device was brought into use that could increase their efficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1710"/>The deck forward was constructed in the form known as <q direct="unspecified">turtle-back,</q> to enable the vessel to go through a heavy sea. Anthracite coal, which made no smoke, was burned in the furnaces.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1723"/>Having passed the outside blockade successfully, and arrived in the neighborhood of his destination, the blockade-runner would either he off at a distance, or run in close to the land to the northward or southward of the port, and wait for the darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1727"/>The difficulty of running the blockade was increased by the absence of lights on the coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1728"/>In approaching or skirting the shore, the salt-works in operation at various points served as a partial substitute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1733"/>In the earlier blockade, the lights of the squadron served as a guide to blockade-runners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1735"/>This fact soon became known to the blockade-runners; indeed, there was little about the squadron that was not known and immediately disseminated at <placeName key="tgn,2535807;tgn,7006630" n="0.072 000000.1435	placename;tgn,2535807;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;0.022 000000.0431	placename;tgn,7006630;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America" reg="nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America">Nassau</placeName>, that central-office of blockade-running intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1737"/>After a time the blockading officer discovered his error, and turned it to account by changing his position every night, thereby confusing many calculations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1738"/>The run past the inshore squadron was always a critical moment, though by no means so dangerous as it looked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1739"/>It was no easy matter on a dark night to hit, much less to stop, a small and obscure vessel, going at the rate of <num value="15">fifteen</num> knots, whose only object was to pass by. But the service nevertheless called into action all the faculties of the blockade-runner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1740"/>It required a cool head, strong nerve, and ready resource.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1741"/>It was a combat of skill and pluck against force and vigilance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1742"/>The excitement of fighting was wanting, as the blockade-runner must make no resistance; nor, as a rule, was he prepared to make any. But the chances, both outside and inshore, were all in his favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1743"/>He had only to make a port and run in, and he could choose time, and weather, and circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1744"/>He could even choose his destination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1745"/>He always had steam up when it was wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1746"/>He knew the critical moment, and was prepared for it; and <pb id="p.160" n="160"/> his moments of action were followed by intervals of repose and relaxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1747"/>The blockader on the other hand, was in every way at a disadvantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1748"/>He had no objective point except the blockade-runner, and he never knew when the blockade-runner was coming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1749"/>He could choose nothing, but must take the circumstances as they happened to come; and they were pretty sure to be unfavorable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1750"/>He was compelled to remain in that worst of all situations, incessant watchfulness combined with prolonged inaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/>There would be days and nights of anxious waiting, with expectation strained to the tensest point, for an emergency which lasted only as many minutes, and which came when it was least expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1752"/>There was no telling when or where the blow would need to be struck; and a solitary moment of napping might be fatal, inspite of months of ceaseless vigilance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1753"/>At <placeName reg="New Inlet, Brunswick, North Carolina" key="tgn,2539327">New Inlet</placeName>, which was a favorite entrance, the blockaderunners would frequently get in by hugging the shore, slipping by the endmost vessel of the blockading line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1754"/>Even on a clear night a properly prepared craft was invisible against the land, and the roar of the surf drowned the noise of her screw or paddles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1755"/>Having a good pilot and little depth, she could generally run well inside of the blockaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1756"/>After passing the line, she would show a light on her inshore side; this was answered from the beach by a dim light, followed by another, above and beyond the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1757"/>These were the range-lights for the channel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/>By getting them in line, the blockade-runner could ascertain her position, and in a few moments, she would be under the guns of the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>When the practice of blockade-running was reduced to a system, a signal-service was organized on shore, and signal officers and pilots were regularly detailed for each vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>After the fall of <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>, and before the fact was known, <pb id="p.161" n="161"/> the duties of the signal-service were assumed by the officers of the <rs>Monticello</rs>, under the direction of <persName n="Cushing,,,,," id="n0249.0007.00161.00433" reg="mostcommon:Cushing,nomatch:0"><surname>Cushing</surname></persName>; and <num value="2">two</num> well known <term type="ship">blockade-runners</term>, the <rs type="ship">Stag</rs> and the <rs>Charlotte</rs>, were helped in by range-lights from the shore, only to find themselves prizes when they were comfortably anchored in the river.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>Vessels passed so often between the squadron and the shore that special measures were taken to stop it. The endmost vessel was so placed as to leave a narrow passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/>When the blockade-runner had passed, the blockader moved nearer and closed the entrance, at the same time sending up signal rockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/><num value="2">Two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of her consorts were in waiting and closed up, and the adventurous vessel suddenly found herself hemmed in on all sides, and without a chance of escape.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>Whenever a blockade-runner was hard pressed in a chase, it was a common practice for the captain to run her ashore, trusting to favorable circumstances to save a fragment of his cargo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1765"/>Communicating with the forces in the neighborhood, he would obtain the co-operation of a detachment of infantry, often accompanied by <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> pieces of artillery, which would harass the parties sent from the blockading vessels to get the steamer off. At <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>, lunettes were thrown up along the shore, large enough for <num value="2">two</num> guns, and a fieldbat-tery of <persName n="Whitworth,,,,," id="n0249.0007.00161.00434" reg="mostcommon:Whitworth,nomatch:0"><surname>Whitworth</surname></persName> <num value="12">12</num>-pounders was kept in constant readiness to run down and occupy them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>Sometimes the blockaders were able to command the land approaches, and so prevent the people on shore from doing mischief; but at other times the latter had it all their own way. It was no easy matter in any case to float off a steamer which had been beached intentionally under a full head of steam, especially if the tide was running ebb; and the fire of <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> rifled guns placed close by on the beach made the operation hazardous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1767"/>The only course left was to burn the wreck; and even then, if <pb id="p.162" n="162"/> the work was not done thoroughly, the chances were that the fire would be extinguished, and the damaged vessel ultimately recovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1797"/>The warfare on both sides was accompanied by a variety of ruses and stratagems, more or less ingenious and successful, but usually turning out to the benefit of the blockade-runner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/>When a steamer was sighted, the blockading vessel that made the discovery fired signals in the direction she had taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1799"/>This was at best an uncertain guide, as the blockaders could only make a rough guess at the stranger's position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1800"/>The practice was no sooner understood than the enterprising captains at <placeName key="tgn,2535807;tgn,7006630" n="0.105 000000.2107	placename;tgn,2535807;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;0.006 000000.0124	placename;tgn,7006630;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America" reg="nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America">Nassau</placeName> sent for a supply of signal rockets, and thereafter they were carried as a part of the regular equipment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1801"/>Running through the fleet, and finding himself discovered, the captain immediately fired his rockets in a direction at right angles to his course; and the blockaders were sent on a wild-goose chase into the darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1802"/>If there were many of them, they were apt to get in each other's way; and more than once serious damage was done by a friendly vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1803"/>The <rs>Howquah</rs>, off <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>, on a dark night, in <dateStruct value="1864-09-"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, had nearly succeeded in making a prize, when the concentrated fire of the batteries, the <orgName n="Blockading Squadron" type="squadron">blockading squadron</orgName>, and, according to the belief of the commander, of the blockade-runner, proved to be too much for him, and caused him to draw off.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1804"/><num value="1">One</num> of the blockade-running captains relates that, on a certain night, when he found himself alongside a vessel of the fleet and under her guns, he was told to heave to. Accordingly, steam was shut off, and he replied that he had stopped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1805"/>There was a moderate sea, and the boat from the <pb id="p.165" n="165"/> cruiser was delayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/>As it reached the side of the blockaderunner, the captain of the latter gave the order, <q direct="unspecified">Full speed ahead,</q> and his vessel shot away toward the channel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1807"/>A deception of this kind, whatever may be thought of it abstractly, was <num value="1">one</num> that would be likely to recoil on the blockade-runners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1808"/>A vessel or <num value="2">two</num> might avoid being sunk by pretending to surrender, but a blockader would hardly be caught twice by such a trick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1809"/>The next time, instead of hailing before he fired, he would fire before he hailed; and he would be perfectly justified in so doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1810"/>Indeed, it is a question whether in a blockade so persistently broken as that of <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>, the ordinary rules of action for belligerent cruisers should not be modified, and vessels found <hi rend="italics">in flagrante delicto</hi>, whether neutrals or not, be destroyed instead of being captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1811"/>Certainly, if destruction and not capture had always been the object, fewer blockade-runners would have escaped, and possibly fewer would have undertaken the business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>There is always a possibility that a vessel met at sea, however suspicious the circumstances, may be innocent; but when found running through the blockading fleet, her guilt is established, and if there is any question about bringing her to&mdash;and at <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> there was always rather more than a question&mdash;the blockader is not far wrong whose <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thought is to inflict a vital injury.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1813"/>As it was, blockade-running was not an occupation involving much personal danger, and little apprehension was felt about running through the fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1814"/>Calcium lights were burned, and shot and shell flew thickly over and around the entering vessel, but they did not often hit the mark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1815"/>At <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> it was perhaps not so much the inshore blockade that killed the trade as the practice of keeping fast cruisers outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1816"/>Until near the end of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, when the stringency of the blockade became extreme, the captures wore not <pb id="p.166" n="166"/> numerous enough to take up more than a slight margin of the enormous profits that it netted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1817"/>These profits were made both on the outward and the inward voyages, and it is hard to say which were the more extraordinary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1818"/>The inward cargoes consisted of all kinds of manufactured goods, and especially of <q direct="unspecified">hardware,</q> the innocent name under which arms and ammunition were invoiced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1819"/>The sale of these brought in from <num value="500">five hundred</num> to <num value="10">one thousand per cent.</num> of their cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>The return cargo was always cotton, and the steam-presses at <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>, reducing it to the smallest possible bulk, enabled the long, narrow blockade-runners to carry <num value="600">six hundred</num>, <num value="800">eight hundred</num>, or even <measure n="1200barrels" type="mass">twelve hundred bales</measure>, of <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="600l." type="pounds"><num value="600">six hundred</num> pounds</measure> each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1821"/>Even the upper deck was piled up with <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> tiers of bales.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/>As a clear profit of <measure n="30000l." type="pounds">&pound; <num value="30000">30,000</num></measure> each way was no uncommon result, it is easy to believe that owners could afford to lose a vessel after <num value="2">two</num> successful trips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>It was the current opinion in the squadron off <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>, in the early part of the last year, that <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of the vessels attempting to enter were successful; and it has been estimated that out of the <num value="66">sixty-six</num> blockade-runners making regular trips during the war, <num value="40">forty</num> were captured or destroyed, but only after a successful career for a shorter or longer period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/>Gradually, in the last few months, too many vessels were caught to make the trade profitable; and it was slowly declining, though it did not cease altogether until the blockade was raised.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/>The Federal Government, on the other hand, could not make use of commerce-destroyers, because there was no enemy's commerce to destroy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1840"/>It follows that the history of the ocean warfare during the conflict falls naturally into a recital of the doings of Southern cruisers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1841"/>The policy of systematic operations against the merchant fleet of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was adopted at the outset.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/>Though the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> was recognized by the courts as belligerent, and a state of war was held to exist, the legal authority of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> over its subjects could not come to an end, even while these subjects were enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>According to the strict legal view, neither the fact of a civil war, nor its express recognition, involved any abrogation of the powers of the <rs>Government</rs> over its subjects in revolt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/>The Constitution defines treason to be the levying of war against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and giving aid and comfort to the enemies thereof; and it was competent for the <rs>State</rs> to bring to trial for treason those whose acts came within the constitutional definition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/>An attempt was made to put those engaged in hostilities at sea upon a different footing, and to bring them to trial for piracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1961"/>But the rule is subject to many important limitations, and as far as precedent is concerned, it rests exclusively upon <measure n="10cases" type="mass">ten cases</measure>, decided in the <rs>English</rs> <orgName n="Admiralty Court" type="court">Admiralty Court</orgName> between <dateStruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></dateStruct>, in <num value="7">seven</num> of which the vessels were condemned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1968"/>If there was no such suspicion, his only course, according to every principle and precedent, was to release her as he found her, with all her cargo and occupants intact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1969"/>The course which he adopted, though it seemed from his point of view to be a middle course, and therefore the safest, was really no middle course at all. It was a proceeding of a totally different character from either of the others.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1971"/>The action taken by the <rs>British Government</rs>, upon receiving news of the event, was summary in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1972"/>It was no new thing for the naval officers of a belligerent to commit an error by which a temporary injury resulted to a neutral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1973"/>The usual course under such circumstances is for the injured party to make proper representations, assuming that the act was the error of a subordinate; upon which a disavowal is made, and in cases demanding it an apology and reparation, and with this the affair ends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1974"/>All this was done in the case of the <rs>Trent</rs>; and though the representations of the <rs>British Government</rs> were made in suitable form, and some discretion was left with <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Lyons</foreName></persName> as to his action, yet the <num value="2">two</num> despatches sent by <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> on the <dateStruct value="-11-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> were in reality not the opening of a negotiation, but an ultimatum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1977"/>But this fact was concealed, after the despatch had been received, and the preparations were continued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1978"/>Of course the moral effect of these preparations was to arouse a sympathy for the <rs>Southern</rs> cause throughout the length and breadth of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>; and without further comment on the position of the <rs>English Government</rs>, it is enough to say that had it been influenced at this time by unfriendly motives, it could hardly have adopted a more unfriendly course of action.

<p>Long before the cruise of the <rs>Sumter</rs> was over, the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> saw that it would be unable to build suitable cruising ships-of-war at home, and took steps to procure them abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1980"/>Under the rules of international law, however, ships-of-war are or ought to be difficult things for a belligerent to obtain from a neutral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1981"/>They stand on a footing by themselves, quite different from that of other contraband articles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1982"/>For supplies of ordinary contraband, furnished by its subjects, a neutral State is not responsible; and the subjects who carry on such a trade do it at their own risk, and are not interfered with by their government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/>But the construction of a belligerent vessel fitted for purposes of war falls outside the class of acts which foreign subjects may perform consistently with the neutrality of their governments; and according to the rule embodied in the <rs>Treaty</rs> of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, though not acknowledged by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> to have been in force during the <rs>Civil War</rs>, <q direct="unspecified">a neutral government is bound to use due diligence to prevent the fitting out, arming, or equipping within its jurisdiction of any vessel which it has reasonable ground to believe is intended to cruise or carry on war against a power with which it is at peace; and also to use like diligence to prevent the departure from its jurisdiction of any vessel intended to cruise or to carry on war as above, such vessel having been specially adapted, in whole or in part, within such jurisdiction, to warlike use.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1984"/></p> 
<p>Whether this rule was a part of international law in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> or not, a rule somewhat approaching it was generally accepted, and found expression in the neutrality laws of different States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1985"/>The <name>British</name> statute then in force imposed a penalty for the <q direct="unspecified">equipping, furnishing, fitting out, or arming</q> of a vessel with the intent that the vessel should cruise or commit hostilities against a friendly State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1986"/>The <name>British</name> <pb id="p.182" n="182"/> Government held that this act defined the extent of its neutral obligations; and the <rs>Confederate</rs> agents were therefore safe if they could evade its specific provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1987"/>This was accomplished successfully by causing ships to be built and sent out completely prepared for warlike operations, except that they lacked their battery, ammunition, and full crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1988"/>All that was needed to supply these defects was then sent in another vessel to an appointed rendezvous outside of <name>British</name> jurisdiction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2437"/>He calculated nicely the time required for news of his presence to <pb id="p.223" n="223"/> reach the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and before a ship could be sent after him, he had moved to a new scene of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2438"/>The period which he generally allowed himself in any <num value="1">one</num> quarter was about <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>. At the end of this time he was on his way to another cruising-ground; and unless his movements could be foreseen, he was tolerably safe from pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2440"/>His next field was the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West Indies</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2441"/>On each of these stations he found a large number of unprotected merchant-vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2442"/>After leaving the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West Indies</placeName>, he posted himself near the equator, in the track of South American commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2443"/>The waters over which this commerce passes lie within a belt not more than <measure n="100miles" type="distance">one hundred miles</measure> wide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2444"/>The <rs>Alabama</rs> occupied this belt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2445"/>Next she passed <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> on the coast of <placeName reg="Brasil, South America, " key="tgn,1000047">Brazil</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2446"/>Thence she went to the <name>Cape</name>, near which the whole commerce of the <placeName reg="Indian Ocean" key="tgn,7016682">Indian Ocean</placeName> must pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2447"/>At the <name>Cape</name> again she remained about <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>; but <orgName type="university" n="American university">American</orgName> shipmasters had by this time become cautious, and they gave the <rs type="place">African coast</rs> a wide berth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2448"/>From the <rs type="place">Cape Semmes</rs> went to the <rs type="place">Straits of Sunda</rs>, the gateway of the <rs type="place">China Sea</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2449"/>Here he remained <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>, and was again successful.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2450"/>During all this period the <rs>Alabama</rs> was kept constantly moving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2451"/>The only delays were for repairs and coal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2452"/>The latter was furnished at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> by coaling-vessels sent to appointed rendezvous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2453"/>Later, the ship depended upon prizes, and upon supplies in neutral ports, which were never grudged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2454"/>When a long cruise made repairs or rest a necessity, an anchorage was selected, which from its remoteness and obscurity, and from its slight dependence upon a civilized power, gave an opportunity to refit at leisure and in security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2455"/>The Areas, <persName n="Noronha,,Fernando,,,de" id="n0249.0008.00223.00633" reg="expanded:Noronha,Fernando,,,"><foreName>Fernando</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Noronha</surname></persName>, Angra Peque&ntilde;a, and Pulo Condore were successively utilized in this way. <pb id="p.224" n="224"/> When more extensive repairs were required, <persName n="Semmes,,,,," id="n0249.0008.00224.00634" reg="mostcommon:Semmes,nomatch:0"><surname>Semmes</surname></persName> put boldly into a neutral port, and his ingenuity generally supplied the authorities with the points that were needed to justify them in extending to him every facility.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2456"/>It is common to speak of the <rs>Alabama</rs> and the other Confederate cruisers as privateers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2457"/>It is hard to find a suitable designation for them, but privateers they certainly were not. The essence of a privateer lies in its private ownership; its officers are persons in private employment; and the authority under which it acts is a letter-of-marque.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2458"/>To call the cruisers pirates is merely to make use of invective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2459"/>Most of them answered all the legal requirements of ships-of-war; they were owned by the <rs>Government</rs>, and they were commanded by naval officers acting under a genuine commission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2460"/>Some of them were put in commission at sea or in foreign waters, and never saw the country of their adoption; but their commission could not thereby be invalidated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2461"/>There is no rule of law which prescribes the place where a Government shall commission its ships, or which requires the ceremony to take place, like the sessions of prize-courts, within the belligerent territory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2462"/>Assuming that the commissioned vessels of the <rs>Confederates</rs> were <hi rend="italics">prima facie</hi> ships-of-war, the question arises whether they were entitled to the privileges accorded to such vessels by the usage of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2463"/>They were acting for a Government whose belligerency had been recognized, though no recognition had been accorded to the state which it was seeking to establish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2464"/>This fact might modify somewhat the view in which the vessels were regarded by foreign states, in that the latter could maintain no official relations with the insurgent Government, and were therefore deprived of the ordinary method of redress, if the vessels should commit an offence against their sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2465"/>But <pb id="p.225" n="225"/> the method of obtaining redress by negotiation is by no means the only way of dealing with offending ships-of-war in foreign waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2466"/>They may be summarily ordered to depart; they may be forbidden to enter; and, finally, if they assail in any way the local sovereignty, or if they refuse to comply with an order for their departure or their exclusion, force may be used against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2467"/>There is, and there can be, no rule of law, which compels a government to remain passive while its laws are openly violated, simply because of the sanctity which is supposed to surround a public vessel; nor, when a neutral government has allowed its neutrality to be infringed by the cruisers of <num value="1">one</num> belligerent, can it justify itself to the other by putting forward such a plea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2468"/>With stronger reason, a ship-of-war whose very existence is a consequence of evasions or infringements of the local law may be denied the ordinary immunities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2469"/>When, therefore, the <rs>Alabama</rs> and the <rs>Florida</rs>, vessels that had been allowed to go to sea from <name>English</name> ports in violation of <name>English</name> neutrality, at a subsequent period entered ports of the same Power, while engaged in their belligerent enterprises, the <rs>Government</rs> could not excuse its inaction on the ground of respect for the <rs>Confederate</rs> commission; and, by refusing either to exclude or to detain the cruisers, it added to the wrong which it had already committed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2470"/>In view of the respect which civilized states exact for their public vessels, it is desirable that every safeguard should be employed by the <rs>State</rs> itself to protect this character from abuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2471"/>The <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> showed considerable laxity in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2472"/>If it had not been incapable of negotiation, and if the neutral powers had pursued the ordinary policy of neutrals, it would doubtless have received some emphatic remonstrances on the subject.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2478"/>A few of the prominent cases will serve to show the nature of these arrangements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2479"/>The <rs>Japan</rs> or <rs>Georgia</rs> left the <rs>Clyde</rs>, registered in the name of a British subject as a British vessel, and she remained, for nearly <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>, still registered in the name of her ostensible owner, though she was all that time engaged in hostilities against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2505"/>A great deal of uncalled &mdash; for abuse has been heaped upon the <rs>South</rs> for the work of the <name n="Confederate States">Confederate</name> cruisers, and their mode of warfare has been repeatedly denounced as barbarous and piratical in official and unofficial publications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2506"/>But neither the privateers, like the <rs>Petrel</rs> and the <rs>Savannah</rs>, nor the commissioned cruisers, like the <rs>Alabama</rs> and the <rs>Florida</rs>, were guilty of any practices which, as against their enemies, were contrary to the laws of war. The expediency of enforcing the right of maritime capture has been much discussed during the last <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure>, and has often been questioned on humanitarian grounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2507"/>It is not proposed to consider that question here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2508"/>For the present purpose, it is sufficient that the right to capture an enemy's private property at sea is fully recognized by the law and practice of nations to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2509"/>All that is necessary is to establish the enemy ownership, and this being done, the prize-courts of every country in the world will decree confiscation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2510"/>Whether the prize is destroyed at sea, or is brought into a <orgName n="Prize Court" type="court">prize-court</orgName> and condemned, can make no possible difference to the owner, if the owner is clearly an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2511"/>The officer making the capture is responsible to his Government, and as the proceeds of the prize usually go in part to the <rs>State</rs>, the officer's Government may and doubtless will require him to bring in his prize, if possible, for adjudication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2512"/>But this is a matter purely of internal discipline, a question between the <rs>State</rs> and its officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2513"/>So also, if by accident or intention neutral property is captured and destroyed, a question arises between the captor's government and that of the neutral, but it is a question with which the other belligerent has nothing to do. <pb id="p.230" n="230"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2514"/>So much for the law on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2515"/>As for the practice, it is usual for governments to require their officers to give sufficient reason why a prize is not brought in. Either the unseaworthiness of the prize, or the want of men to navigate her, would manifestly be a sufficient reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2516"/>In the absence of any preventing cause, the prize should be brought to a port of adjudication; and, if that is impossible, to the nearest neutral port that will admit it. But during the war, the ports of the <rs>Confederates</rs> were under blockade, and the rule was generally adopted by neutrals of excluding the prizes of both belligerents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2517"/>Nothing then remained but to destroy the captured vessel at sea. To have done otherwise would have been to abandon the right of maritime capture.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2518"/>The practice of destroying prizes, however, even when it is possible to send them in, is no new thing in maritime warfare, especially in the maritime warfare of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2525"/>A military force, whether intended to operate on land or at sea, exists primarily for purposes of war. Cruising on foreign stations during peace, in these days when piracy has disappeared, is not an occupation calculated to exercise fully its powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2526"/>Ships-of-war are no doubt of use from time to time at various points, but their usefulness is not so great that a government whose foreign relations are generally amicable would keep up a large establishment for this object alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2527"/>Their real purpose is to become the national defence in time of war. As with the ships, so with the officers; it is in war, not in peace, that the fruit of their labors is to be gathered.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2528"/>So far, doubtless, everybody is agreed; in fact, what has been said is little more than a truism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2529"/>But the logical inference drawn from the premises is far from commanding <pb id="p.232" n="232"/> universal assent, and still farther from obtaining recognition in practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2530"/>The inference is this: that the primary object for a navy at all times is to maintain itself, in all its branches, materiel, personnel, and organization, in the most perfect state that is possible of readiness and efficiency for war. This should be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and ever-present consideration with those who enact, who administer, and who execute measures of naval policy; the ability to place the whole establishment in the condition of active warlike operation, as instantaneously and as smoothly as an engineer starts his machine.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2531"/>In <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, the navy was by no means in a condition of readiness for war, although war was the purpose for which it existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2532"/>In materiel, it had a few ships suitable for cruising purposes, and it had superior ordnance; but half the fleet was antiquated, and the rest was displaying the flag on distant stations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2533"/>As to the personnel, it is useless to deny the fact that the list was heavily weighted by the old officers at the head, who had reached their position, not because of merit, but because of the date when they happened to enter the service; that the middle of the list was suffering from long stagnation, and from the absence of any inducement to effort; and finally, that the young men, who were to bear the brunt of the work, were altogether too few for the needs of the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2534"/>It is commonly said that the navy was on a peace footing; but if that was the case, a complete and well-defined provision should have been made for expansion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2535"/>To speak of a <q direct="unspecified">peace footing</q> implies that a <q direct="unspecified">war footing</q> is something different; and no naval establishment can consider itself prepared for war that has not made beforehand all the arrangements necessary to pass at once from <num value="1">one</num> to the other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2536"/>Conceding the necessity of a peace footing for personnel <pb id="p.233" n="233"/> and materiel, on the score of expense, there is no necessity for such a thing as a peace footing for organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2537"/>The organization of a military or naval establishment is fixed primarily with a view to efficiency in war, and only such slight modifications are introduced in time of peace as are indispensable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2538"/>So far from this being the case in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, the whole administration was arranged on an exactly opposite basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2539"/>It was about as unfitted for the conduct of a war as it was possible to be. The organization was that of <num value="5">five</num> bureaus, independent of each other, and only united by a common subordination to the <rs type="place">Head</rs> of the <name>Department</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2540"/>Now, whatever merits the system of nearly independent bureaus may have in time of peace, it is entirely inadequate as an organization for carrying on war. The direction of military or naval operations must be centralized, not only in the person of the <name>Departmental</name> bead, but in his responsible professional advisers; and to impose this heavy burden upon Chiefs of Bureaus, whose business is with certain specific branches of administration, is to expect men to take in at the same moment the whole field of view and the minutest details of a single part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2541"/>It is the essence of a good organization that every branch of it should have its own work, and should confine itself to that; and for that, and that alone, it should be held to the fullest responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2542"/>The province of a Bureau is to furnish a gun, or a hull, or an engine, or a crew, the best possible that can be obtained; and to devolve upon its Chief the duty of planning campaigns is only to divert him from his legitimate business, and would, in the nature of things, result disastrously both to the campaign and the bureau.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2543"/>The general direction of military and naval operations, if we are to accept the testimony of the highest authorities and the evidence of the most successful campaigns, is the work of men bred in the business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2544"/><pb id="p.234" n="234"/> It cannot be done successfully, according to the demands of modern warfare, by this or that officer picked up on the spur of the moment, or by boards of officers created as the exigency arises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2545"/>It must be put in the hands of those who have spent much labor and thought in examining and fastening upon the strong and weak points of all possible enemies; who have made their office the repository of all possible information; who have, as <persName n="Moltke,,,,," id="n0249.0009.00234.00642" reg="mostcommon:Moltke,nomatch:0"><surname>Moltke</surname></persName> is said to have had, the whole details of campaigns in their pigeon-holes, to be modified, month by month, as new circumstances arise; and finally, who are studying, not gunnery, nor machinery, nor construction, nor fleet-tactics alone, but the science of war, in all its bearings, as an actual, living, and, above all, as a growing science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2546"/>In short, the direction of naval operations, like that of military operations, should be entrusted to a previously-trained and previously-equipped <rs n="General Staff" type="misc">General Staff</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2547"/>Now, in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, the navy had no <rs n="General Staff" type="misc">general staff</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2548"/>Staff-work was a branch of naval science as uncultivated as the attack and defence by torpedoes; nor did it occur to the authorities at the time that a staff might be created.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2549"/>So they set about to find a substitute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2550"/>By <num value="1">one</num> of those fortunate accidents, which lead our happy-go-lucky nation to fall on its feet, when it has come unprepared upon a crisis, a man had about this time come forward, in connection with the reliefexpedi-tions to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, who was fitted, as nearly as any <num value="1">one</num> man could be, to take charge of the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2551"/>This man was <persName n="Fox,Captain,Gustavus,V.,," id="n0249.0009.00234.00643" reg="default:Fox,Gustavus,V.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>Gustavus</foreName> <foreName>V.</foreName> <surname>Fox</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2552"/>It may be said in passing that an accident of this kind cannot be counted on, nor can it justify the absence of preparation, when preparation is so simple and easy &mdash;in war nothing must be left to chance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2553"/>In addition to his natural attainments, which were exceptional, <persName n="Fox,,,,," id="n0249.0009.00234.00644" reg="nearbymention:Fox,Gustavus,V.,,"><surname>Fox</surname></persName> was a man of varied experience, having passed <measure n="18years" type="date">eighteen years</measure> in the navy, <pb id="p.235" n="235"/> during which he had served in ships-of-war, in the <orgName n="Coast Survey" type="military">Coast Survey</orgName>, and in command of mail-steamers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2554"/><measure n="5years" type="date">Five years</measure> before the war he had resigned, and had engaged in business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2555"/>He therefore started in his career as <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Secretary">Assistant Secretary</rs> with a grasp of the situation, and a capacity to meet it, that could be found in few men at that time, either outside the service or in it. To say that he became <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Secretary">Assistant Secretary</rs> does not define his position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2556"/>He was anything but an <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Secretary">Assistant Secretary</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2557"/>He was really the <rs type="role" reg="Chief of Staff">Chief of Staff</rs>; or rather he was the whole <rs n="General Staff" type="misc">general staff</rs> in person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2558"/>Of course he could not perform all the details of his work himself, and as he had not at command a previously-trained body of staff-officers, he made judicious use of the material at his disposal by the creation of temporary boards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2559"/><num value="1">One</num> board was organized, composed of <persName n="Dupont,Captain,,,," id="n0249.0009.00235.00645" reg="mostcommon:Dupont,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captains</roleName> <surname>Dupont</surname></persName> and <persName n="Davis,Captain,,,," id="n0249.0009.00235.00646" reg="mostcommon:Davis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain"></roleName><surname>Davis</surname></persName>, <persName n="Barnard,Major,,,," id="n0249.0009.00235.00647" reg="mostcommon:Barnard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Barnard</surname></persName> of the <rs>Engineers</rs>, and <persName n="Bache,Professor,,,," id="n0249.0009.00235.00648" reg="mostcommon:Bache,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Bache</surname></persName>, to report on the coast of the enemy, its points of access and its defences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2560"/>Here the exceptional character of the war led to the selection of exceptional persons to give the information necessary for intelligent operations; for, as the enemy's coast was also our own, no <num value="1">one</num> could be better informed about its accessibility and defences than the <rs>Superintendent</rs> of the <orgName n="Coast Survey" type="military">Coast Survey</orgName>, and the engineer who had built the forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2561"/>Similarly another board, composed of <persName n="Smith,Commodore,,,," id="n0249.0009.00235.00649" reg="mostcommon:Smith,Melancton,,,:2"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodores</roleName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> and <persName n="Paulding,Commodore,,,," id="n0249.0009.00235.00650" reg="nearbymention:Paulding,Hiram,,,"><roleName n="Commodore"></roleName><surname>Paulding</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Davis,Captain,,,," id="n0249.0009.00235.00651" reg="mostcommon:Davis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> again, was appointed to examine plans for ironclad vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2562"/>The board modestly stated in its report that it approached the subject <q direct="unspecified">with diffidence, having no experience and but scanty knowledge in this branch of naval architecture.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2563"/>It was composed of extremely able men, and their conclusions were formed under the circumstances with promptness and judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2564"/>Yet the report of the board was only made <dateStruct value="-09-16"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="16">16</day></dateStruct>, <dateStruct value="-09-5"><day reg="5">five</day></dateStruct> months after the war may be said to have begun, and <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure> after the <name>Act</name> of Congress <pb id="p.236" n="236"/> authorizing the expenditure for the purpose of building ironclads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2565"/>A properly-organized <rs n="General Staff" type="misc">general staff</rs> in working operation would have had every plan that could be presented thoroughly examined and passed upon before Congress was even in session; and the contracts should have been ready for signature on the day after the appropriation was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2566"/>The importance of time, even in a war as loosely conducted and as long drawn out as that of the <rs>Rebellion</rs>, has no better illustration than in the case of the <rs>Monitor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2567"/>Congress assembled <dateStruct value="-07-5"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="5">5</day></dateStruct>; a month later it passed the appropriation; in <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure> the board reported; <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> afterward the contract for the <rs>Monitor</rs> was signed; and, after all this deliberation and discussion, had the <rs>Monitor</rs>'s arrival in <placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName> been postponed by <num value="1">one</num> single day, by the infinitesimal space, considering the length of preparation, of <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>, she would have found little in the shape of a fleet to need her protection.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2568"/>It is a common mistake to point to our experience in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> to show that a navy can be prepared for action at short notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2569"/>It is supposed that, because the <rs>Government</rs> came out victorious in the end in its naval operations, without having made any preparation beforehand, it will always be safe to postpone measures looking to war until the war is upon us the supply of a large body of trained officers, the selection of the ablest men for the higher grades, the establishment and training of a <rs n="General Staff" type="misc">general staff</rs>, the organization of reserves, the construction of modern vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2570"/>It is true that a partial substitute for all these requisites of an efficient force was secured before the war was over; that in <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct> there were <num value="7600">7,600</num> officers and <num value="50000">50,000</num> seamen in the service, that the ablest men had come to the front, that a <rs type="role" reg="Chief of Staff">Chief of Staff</rs> was found in the person of the <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Secretary">Assistant Secretary</rs>, and that the fleet had been increased from <num value="69">sixty-nine</num> vessels to <num value="600">six hundred</num> <pb id="p.237" n="237"/> and <num value="71">seventy-one</num>, <num value="208">two hundred and eight</num> of which had been built or begun while hostilities were going on. Perhaps, if our next war lasts <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, and if all the sea-board cities are not destroyed during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> half-year, we may do the same again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2571"/>No doubt the <name>Administration</name> was handicapped at the outset by its unwillingness, for reasons of public policy, to take the offensive; but even allowing for this delay, the fact remains that in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>&mdash;months during which, in modern wars, not only the most telling blows are struck, but the issue of the war is generally decided&mdash;all that could be done with the most strenuous efforts, and the greatest energy in the administrative head, was to collect our fragmentary resources and to discover the men who could make them available.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2572"/>Fortunately, we were fighting a Government that was destitute of a naval force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2573"/>Had our enemy been a maritime power with a navy in the most ordinary condition of readiness, and with a competent working staff, it would have fared ill with us in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2574"/>In our next war we shall probably have no such good fortune, and we shall learn to our cost the fatal result of procrastination.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2575"/>It is idle to suppose, in face of the changes that mechanical science is making every year in our daily lives, that the materials of naval warfare will remain long at any given stage of development.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2576"/>Progress will go on, and the only way in which a naval force can be kept up which shall be equal to the barest necessities of the country is by a constant adaptation of fleets and armaments to the new demands of modern war. Objectors may say that if changes are so rapid, new constructions will shortly be superseded by newer ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2577"/>But science advances, whether Governments wish it or not; and if the navy is to be kept up at all, it must be kept up to date.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2578"/>New instruments of warfare cannot <pb id="p.238" n="238"/> be manufactured in a day; nor can officers be expected to use them to advantage when they have had no previous opportunity to practise their use. <q direct="unspecified">Our occupation,</q> wrote <persName n="Graviere,Admiral,Jurien,de la,," id="n0249.0009.00238.00652" reg="default:Graviere,Jurien,de la,,"><roleName n="Admiral">Admiral</roleName> <foreName>Jurien</foreName> <foreName>de la</foreName> <surname>Graviere</surname></persName>, shortly after the war, <q direct="unspecified">was formerly an instinct; now it is a science.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2579"/>The mastery of a science requires study; but while war is going on, men have little time to think, much less to study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2580"/>They can only use as best they may the new tools that are put into their hands, if their government has not given them modern tools beforehand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2581"/>Even admitting, though it should never be admitted for a moment, that it is too much to ask that provision should be made for keeping the material in the forefront of scientific progress, there is at least a limit to the distance which it may be allowed to fall in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2582"/>If we must be out of date, it is better to be <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> behind the times than to be <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> behind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2583"/>It is hard to see how the advocates of a policy of procrastination can reiterate the old arguments about the success of our naval operations in the war, to justify inaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2584"/>It was not really a naval war, for there was hardly a naval enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2585"/>There were <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> cruisers at sea, some of which were captured or destroyed after having obliterated our commerce, and <num value="1">one</num> of which, at least, never was captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2586"/>There was an extemporized fleet here and there, made up of anything that came to hand, such as drove the <orgName n="Blockading Squadron" type="squadron">blockading squadron</orgName> from the <rs type="place">Head</rs> of the <name>Passes</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2587"/>There was <num value="1">one</num> steam-frigate that had been raised out of the water, and made in some sense a modern war vessel, which played havoc with her antiquated opponents, and for a month kept the force at <placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName> at bay. There were other ironclads which had been fitted out under almost every disadvantage that circumstances could create, and which had a short career at various points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2588"/>In coping, not with this <pb id="p.239" n="239"/> force, for it could hardly be called a force, but with the simple obstruction of natural causes, the navy, as soon as it obtained any suitable ships, maintained an extensive blockade, and captured many vessels; it occupied several points on the coast, but only <num value="3">three</num> of them in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year; it was compelled to postpone attacking others until years had been spent in making them impregnable; and it cruised in the dark after the commerce-destroyers, without adequate sources of intelligence or unity of direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2589"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, the enemy had few powerful forts, and fewer torpedoes; his navy hardly existed; and yet all that could be done was to effect an entrance at <placeName reg="Hatteras Inlet">Hatteras Inlet</placeName>, and to establish a blockade that during this period came near the suspicion of being fictitious, except at a few of the principal ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2590"/>If a navy can be built to order after a war begins, how did it happen that with unheard &mdash; of efforts there was not an adequate force afloat in <dateStruct value="1861-09-"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, to enter every Southern port?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2591"/>The cause did not he in the officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2592"/>Such faults as they had were faults, not of the men, but of the system&mdash;a system which ignored the cardinal principle of naval policy, that a navy must always be maintained in a condition of readiness for instant war. Neither in its central organization, nor in the number and mode of advancement of its personnel, nor in the character of its ships, did it approach such a condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2593"/>Even the bravery, endurance, and energy of its officers, and the capacity shown in its direction during the war, in the face of extraordinary obstacles, cannot blind us to the fact that the work would have been better and more quickly done under a better system&mdash;a system which should utilize the long intervals of peace to prepare, with the utmost thoroughness, for the sudden emergency of war. <pb id="p.240" n="240"/> </p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2604"/> 
<text><body> 
<p>All officers commanding vessels employed on blockading service belonging to the squadron under my command, are to be governed by the following general directions in the discharge of their duties:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2605"/><num value="1">1</num>. Duly notify neutrals of the declaration of the blockade, and give to it otherwise all the publicity in your power.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2606"/><num value="2">2</num>. The blockade must be strict and absolute, and only public armed vessels of foreign powers are to be permitted to enter the ports which are placed in a sate of blockade.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2607"/><num value="3">3</num>. Protect our commerce from the depredations of privateers, and, as a matter of course, capture them and all other vessels of the enemy whenever you can do so without being seduced away from your station.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2608"/><num value="4">4</num>. A lawful maritime blockade requires the actual presence of an adequate force stationed at the entrance of the port, sufficiently near to prevent communication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2609"/>The only exception to this rule arises out of the occasional temporary absence of the blockading vessels, produced by accident, as in the case of a storm, which does not suspend the legal operation of a blockade, and to take advantage of such an accidental absence is a fraudulent attempt to break the blockade, and will justify the application of penalties.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2610"/><num value="5">5</num>. A neutral or foreign vessel, proceeding toward the entrance of a blockaded port, is not to be captured or detained if she shall not have received previously from <num value="1">one</num> of the <orgName n="Blockading Squadron" type="squadron">blockading squadron</orgName> a special notification of the existence of the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2611"/>This notification must be inserted in writing on the register and muster-roll of the neutral vessel by the cruiser which meets her, anti it should contain the announcement, together with statements of the day and the latitude and longitude in which it was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2612"/><pb id="p.252" n="252"/></p> 
<p><num value="6">6</num>. Until the ports are closed by proclamation (that is, declared to be no longer ports of entry) the warning just mentioned is to be continued to vessels instead of capturing at once, as will be the case when they come to be so closed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2613"/><num value="7">7</num>. Vessels leaving guarded insurgent ports without legal clearances are to be seized and sent in for adjudication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2614"/>If it be claimed that there is not an effective blockade, and therefore that they are entitled to depart, still they must not disregard our municipal laws and the requirements of the <rs>National Government</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2615"/><num value="8">8</num>. On the coast of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> more particularly, there is an extensive scheme of deliberately concerted measures to evade our vigilance and disregard our laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2616"/>This must be broken up, and every effort is to be made to accomplish the purpose effectually.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2617"/><num value="9">9</num>. Vessels with contraband goods on board, approaching any of the blockaded ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2618"/>or vessels that may have cleared for any of these ports, or be found, with a due warning on their papers, hovering about any of them, are all to be seized and sent in for adjudication. </p><closer><signed><persName n="Goldborough,,L.,M.,," id="n0249.0012.00252.00696" reg="default:Goldborough,L.,M.,,"><foreName>L.</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName>  <surname>Goldborough</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Flag-Officer">Flag-Officer</rs>.</signed> <dateline><dateStruct value="1861-09-28"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="28">28</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.</dateline></closer></body></text> </p></div1>
