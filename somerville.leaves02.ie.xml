<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>We have shown how this amount fluctuated from time to time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>On account of a varying income arising from the <orgName n="School Fund" type="fund">school fund</orgName>, it is hard to determine always what was the yearly cost of the school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>The master's salary sometimes included the rent of a house for his family; sometimes he was allowed to demand of his pupils a small tuition fee. <persName n="Wood,,,,," id="n0302.0013.00059.00608" reg="mostcommon:Wood,nomatch:0"><surname>Wood</surname></persName> for the schoolhouse, in winter, was pretty generally supplied throughout all <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> towns by the pupils' parents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>The sum total of the master's earnings seems meagre enough, but we may believe that it averaged well with what was paid in neighboring communities.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>If the management of the school for a century showed but little change on its financial side, probably the same might be said of the curriculum of studies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>There is no evidence that the school question was a very vital <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>The requirements for entrance to <orgName n="Harvard College" type="college">Harvard College</orgName> set the standard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>Latin was generally taught, but there is no mention of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> on our records.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>We may believe there was little real progress in educational matters, both within and without that charmed circle of scholars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>Judging, however, from the character and achievements of the men who taught this particular school, we may well believe that their pupils did not lack mental and moral incentives to good work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>In training and experience requisite for what was demanded of them, these teachers must have been the equals of those in any other age. Compared with modern schools, those of that day were most deficient in school appliances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>This is particularly noticeable in the poor school buildings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/><placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName> had built <num value="2">two</num> in the course of the century, wretched little affairs, both of which, not many years after their erection, were in need of constant repairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>Not all the young men of <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName> who graduated from the college were trained in the town school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>The sons of the poor had some slight attention, but the &lsquo;youth,&rsquo; the sons of the better class, whether they knew it or not, formed a privileged order in the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>As yet there was no real democratic equality in educational matters, and no free schools in the modern acceptation of the term.</p>

It was a small, but sturdy people shaking the fist of defiance at an old and powerful empire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>Subsequent events disclosed that this was no idle threat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>But it has received very meagre attention at the hands of the general historian, and, until lately, has been held in but slight local estimation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>This condition of affairs will now continue no longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>We now see the events which happened on this height in their true perspective, and their significance is felt and appreciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>It furnishes a theme worthy of much investigation, and new historic data of significance may be expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>The artistic laying out of the park was the work of much thought and careful consideration.
