<head>Preface.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>few nations, if any, in the world, would have been able to accomplish what the people of this great country have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Within <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure>, an army larger than that possessed by any of the great powers of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> has been raised, armed, equipped, drilled, and put in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Men of all classes, rich and poor, have entered the ranks; and there is scarcely any quiet occupation which has not furnished its share of officers and privates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The merchant and the lawyer, yesterday at their desks, to-day command regiments and armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>If we can only admire this great national movement and the patriotism which has caused it, we may perhaps be allowed to make a few observations the importance of which every intelligent officer will admit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Bravery is a national virtue of the <rs>American</rs>, and we certainly do not doubt that of the officers of the great army; but bravery is not sufficient to gain victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>War is a science, and a difficult <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>History is full of examples of the weak defeating the strong by superiority of knowledge in conducting troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>In drilling, we learn but the figures which troops may form; but we do not learn their application: therefore every officer should know the great principles of war, which will teach him how to approach the enemy, and, when in his presence, how to apply the figures of the drill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/><pb n="viii"/></p> 
<p>I have undertaken, in this little work, to give a clear and precise idea of the great maxims of war. It was written for the citizen soldier and officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>To show the application of the principles, I have given several examples fully developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>My intention was not to write anything new, nor to give a learned dissertation on military matters, but simply to fill up the void that exists, by a popular work treating those military matters, of easy understanding even to the civilian who has never before been connected with military occupations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The professed officer who takes this book in hand must, therefore, excuse, if it does not realize his ideas of a precise treatise on the art of war. Those who wish to instruct themselves more fully in the art of conducting troops must consult other and more special works. </p></div1></front> <body>

<head>The Art of War.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>every war is undertaken to obtain a certain object.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>A war is a calamity; therefore the means giving the speediest attainment of our object are the best.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Only preconcerted and precise plans, in accordance with the rules of the military sciences, with our means and those of the enemy, with the configuration of the theater of war, will permit an energetic action, and, in consequence, a speedy termination of the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>War can be offensive, purely defensive, or defensive with offensive return.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Offensive wars, if properly conducted, have many advantages; purely defensive ones will always end with submission.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Defensive, with offensive return, may be accompanied with great results.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The rules which ought to guide us in the adoption of our plans are defined in the military sciences called:--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Strategy, or the art of directing the masses of our army on the theater of war for the attainment of our object.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Grand Tactics, or the art to move and dispose of troops in the presence of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/><pb id="p.10" n="10"/></p> 
<p><num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Logistics, or the art of arranging our movements.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/><num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The Art of Engineering defense and attack of places.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/><num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Tactics of each Arm.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Every war is composed of marches, battles, sieges, erection of fortifications, and pauses of repose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Each of these separate operations is to be conducted in accordance with the strict rules laid down in <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="5">five</num> separate sciences.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The entire war, composed of these different operations may be looked at as a great drama, in which these different operations form the different acts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>As soon as our armies are ready to take the field, the nature of the war is to be fixed &mdash; if offensive, if defensive, or if of the offensive defense.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The next care will be the study of the theater of the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It will then be upon the rules of strategy upon which we must fix our base of operation, our lines of advance or retreat, our manoeuvres, our different objects before the attainment of the final and main object, our lines of defense, our places of refuge in case of defeat.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Our manoeuvers and marches will conduct us, sooner or later, in the presence of the enemy; it is then, by the rules of grand tactics, that we learn how to displace or destroy the obstacles the enemy puts in our way in the shape of his army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>In the application of grand tactics, we use certain figures and forms by which we dispose of our different <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> to enable there better to sustain the shock of the <num value="2">two</num> masses.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Those figures and forms are given in the small tactics of every country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/><pb id="p.11" n="11"/></p> 
<p>Our strategical movements may conduct us to overcome natural and artificial difficulties which we find in our way, as, for instance, rivers, fortifications, etc. It is then that the art of engineering will find its employment; and, finally, to arrive from <num value="1">one</num> point to another, we must march in a certain order, we must be provided with provision and ammunition; and their logistics will tell us how to make our different arrangements.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>There are <num value="3">three</num> great maxims common to the whole science of war; they are--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Concentrate your force, and act with the whole of it on <num value="1">one</num> part only of the enemy's force.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Act against the weakest part of your enemy &mdash; this center, if he is dispersed; his flank or rear, if concentrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Act against his communications without endangering your own.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/><num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Whatever you do, as soon as you have made your plan, and taken the decision to act upon it, act with the utmost speed, so that you may obtain your object before the enemy suspects what you are about. </p></div1> 
<div1 id="c.3" type="chapter" n="3"> <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> 
<head>Strategy.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>it is impossible to give here a full account of all the expressions and rules of strategy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>I shall only mention the principal ones, and then at once proceed, by an example, to show how strategical combinations may be conducted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/><emph>Base of Operation.</emph>--Upon entering into a war, we must have a line for the concentration of our troops, where we <figure id="fig.012"> 
<head>Fig.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/><num value="1">1</num>.</head></figure> have our depots and magazines, and from which we advance to execute our different plans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>This line is called <hi rend="italics">base of</hi> <pb id="p.13" n="13"/><hi rend="italics">operation</hi>. The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> choice of this line is of the utmost importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The result of a whole campaign may depend on it. If, for instance, <hi rend="italics">a b c d</hi> is the theater of the war, if <hi rend="italics">a c</hi> and <hi rend="italics">a b</hi> belong to us, if <hi rend="italics">b d</hi> is the sea, the army of the enemy has for sole retreat <hi rend="italics">c d</hi>. We may choose <hi rend="italics">a b</hi> or <hi rend="italics">a c</hi> for our base.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>We may be offensive in the operations, ever though the war is defensive for us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>The initiative is always advantageous, and we decide upon taking the defensive only in case of an inferiority in strength.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>The defense can act, as well as the offensive, on simple or several lines of operation; it is always more intimately connected with the configuration of the ground than the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>In the defense, the natural or artificial obstacles of the country should supply the deficiency of men, either in strategical or tactical operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>When acting on simple lines, and opposed only to <num value="1">one</num>, but a superior, army of the enemy, our own army should retreat in defending all the natural obstacles of the theater of the war, such as rivers, mountains, etc. ; it should organize small bodies for acting in the rear of the advancing enemy, to endanger his convoys and force him to make large detachments to cover them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>In making those detachments, the invading army becomes smaller the more it advances, while, on the other hand, the defending army generally gets stronger the nearer it approaches the center of its country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>If by this the difference in force is decreased, and the chances more equal, the army for the defense should pass to a vigorous offensive, either by unexpectedly attacking the enemy or by awaiting him in a well-chosen, strong, and fortified position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>The commanders of the different armies have received their orders, and the operations commence.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>Let us begin with the operations of the <rs>Potomac</rs> and <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName> armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>These <num value="2">two</num> armies have to co-operate; and they have for main object the taking of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and the occupation of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>Their nearest object is the destruction of the armies B, B<hi rend="sup">I</hi>, and B<hi rend="sup">II</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>A and A<hi rend="sup">I</hi> united are stronger than the <num value="3">three</num> rebel armies B, B<hi rend="sup">I</hi>, and B<hi rend="sup">II</hi>, and therefore their action should be simultaneous, to engage at <num value="1">one</num> and the same moment the while and inferior rebel armies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>Considering the difference between A and A<hi rend="sup">I</hi>, we conclude that A<hi rend="sup">I</hi> plays a more subordinate role than A. It is, in fact, nothing else than a great detachment of this army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>The action of A<hi rend="sup">I</hi> has therefore more the character of a diversion in favor of A, than that of a separate and main operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/><pb id="p.29" n="29"/></p> 
<p>If B is kept in continual expectation of being attacked by A, it cannot move; and if, at the same time, A<hi rend="sup">I</hi> attacks B<hi rend="sup">I</hi>, and defeats it by its superior force, B will either be obliged to give up its line of defense or to send a part of its force to the reinforcement of B<hi rend="sup">I</hi>, and then the moment for the main attack by A has arrived.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>To act a diversion &mdash; that is, to make the enemy commit the fault of a division of his forces &mdash; the diversion must have the appearance of a main operation; it must be directed on the weak parts of the enemy, and, as it never acts with sufficient forces, the energy of its action and the speed and daring of its movements must supply the want of men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Therefore the advance of A<hi rend="sup">I</hi> from <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName> must be impetuous, irresistible; whatever may be its loss, whatever may be the difficulties on its way, A<hi rend="sup">I</hi> must surmount them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>It must defeat the army opposed to it, force its way through any obstacle, and must arrive at <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, from whence it has to proceed to <placeName reg="Kent, Portage, Ohio" key="tgn,7013830">Kent</placeName> and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>This last town is to be taken by assault; and as soon as this is accomplished, A<hi rend="sup">I</hi> has fulfilled its nearest object &mdash; that is, the diversion; it should, therefore, fall back, land take up its position in advance of <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, so that it cannot be cut off from its base, but may still reach <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> in <num value="1">one</num> forced march, or recommence the action as soon as the circumstances require its doing so.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>A has advanced at the same time that A<hi rend="sup">I</hi> has, and threatens B with an attack; B, in the expectation of a battle, cannot easily make a detachment, but, hearing of B<hi rend="sup">I</hi>&lsquo;s defeat, and the danger of B<hi rend="sup">II</hi> and of its own lines of communication, it will be obliged either to retreat entirely, and to leave its line <pb id="p.30" n="30"/>of defense to A or to support B<hi rend="sup">I</hi> and B<hi rend="sup">II</hi> by sending them a strong reinforcemend In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> case, the nearest object of A is obtained without battle; in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, the moment B has divided, its force will be made use of by A to make with its concentrated fore an attack on the weakened B B's of defense will be carried; A advances pushing B before it, arrives near <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>; the action of A<hi rend="sup">I</hi> recommences, it acts against the wing and rear of the already defeated and strongly pressed Army B; complete rout of B would be the consequence, and the taking of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and the attainment of the main object would be an easy matter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>This, or similar, would be the plan of attack; this plan, on the whole, is easily imagined by the rebel leaders, through the concentration of the <rs>Union</rs> forces, and their object is to prevent its execution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>The rebel armies B, B<hi rend="sup">I</hi>, and B<hi rend="sup">II</hi>, being inferior to A and A<hi rend="sup">I</hi> united, but superior to A or A<hi rend="sup">I</hi>, have to act with their whole force against each <num value="1">one</num> separately Therefore if the whole plan of A and A<hi rend="sup">I</hi>--that <hi rend="italics">is</hi>, of the attack &mdash; is based on a simultaneous action, action in <num value="1">one</num> and the same moment of time, the plan of the defense must be based on a consecutive action, or action in <num value="2">two</num> consecutive moments of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>To bring those <num value="2">two</num> consecutive moments of time as near as possible to each other, the rebels, in their defense, have to make the best use of their central position, and they have to complete their interior lines of <hi rend="italics">communication</hi>, as would be a railway from <placeName reg="Manassas, Manassas, Virginia" key="tgn,2112877">Manassas Junction</placeName> to <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> and <num value="1">one</num> from <placeName key="tgn,7013448;tgn,2031150;tgn,7013447" n="0.150 000000.5992	placename;tgn,7013448;Bowling Green, Wood, Ohio,Wood,Ohio,United States,North and Central America;0.093 000000.3720	placename;tgn,2031150;Bowling Green, Parke, Indiana,Parke,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;0.046 000000.1860	placename;tgn,7013447;Bowling Green, Warren, Kentucky,Warren,Kentucky,United States,North and Central America" reg="Bowling Green, Wood, Ohio,Wood,Ohio,United States,North and Central America;Bowling Green, Parke, Indiana,Parke,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;Bowling Green, Warren, Kentucky,Warren,Kentucky,United States,North and Central America">Bowling Green</placeName> to <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>The corps of observation which B<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> left opposed to A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> has effected in the mean time its retreat, and forms, with the <num value="10000">10,000</num> men already at <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, a body of <num value="20000">20,000</num> men, whose duty it is to prevent A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> crossing the <rs>Mississippi</rs> until the defeat of A<hi rend="sup">III</hi> is accomplished.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>As soon as A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> ascertains that a small corps only opposes it, it can easily imagine what has occurred; if it passes the river, it would come in contact with all the rebel armies united, and its entire destruction would be the consequence; if it remains in the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, the main body of the rebel army will pass on the line to <placeName key="tgn,2039351" n="1.000 35" reg="hickman, fulton, kentucky">Hickman</placeName>, and cross the river there, A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> would be cut from its base of operation, and its loss would be certain; it has nothing else to do but retreat at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>The duty of the <num value="20000">20,000</num> men at <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> would have been to deceive A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> as long as possible about their real strength, and to make it lose all the time they could, by showing, for instance, dispositions for fighting, or by spreading false rumors, or even by inducing it to cross the <rs>Mississippi</rs> by a feigned retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>If, nevertheless, A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> retreats, <pb id="p.36" n="36"/>a body of <num value="10000">10,000</num> or <num value="15000">15,000</num> men should follow it and disturb its retreat as much as possible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>The time the execution of those operations will occupy may be calculated as follows: it would take the <orgName n="Army of Missouri" type="army">Missouri army</orgName> about <measure n="14days" type="date">14 days</measure> to march from <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName> to <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, and the same time for the <orgName n="Army of Kentucky" type="army">Kentucky army</orgName> to go from the <rs>Ohio</rs> to <placeName reg="Decatur, Macon, Illinois" key="tgn,7013516">Decatur</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>Considering that the rebels use every obstacle for defense, destroy the bridges, and in general render slow the advance of A<hi rend="sup">III</hi> and A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi>, we may suppose that it will take A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> about <measure n="4weeks" type="date">four weeks</measure> to reach <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, while A<hi rend="sup">III</hi> requires <measure n="5weeks" type="date">five weeks</measure> to arrive at <placeName reg="Decatur, Macon, Illinois" key="tgn,7013516">Decatur</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>The <num value="70000">70,000</num> men of B<hi rend="sup">IV</hi>, who are transported by rail to the junction with B<hi rend="sup">III</hi>, will require about <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6days" type="date">six days</measure> to arrive and concentrate near there, so that the whole operations of the <rs>Western</rs> armies, from the day they were commenced up to the achievement of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> victory, would take from <num value="30">30</num> to <measure n="40days" type="date">40 days</measure>, or <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="4">four</num> times more than those on the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Here also the rebels must pass to an offensive war, but their action will depend entirely on the operations of the <rs>Eastern</rs> armies; we must therefore return to them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>We left these armies at the moment A had regained its old line of defense on the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>To justify its future movements, as well as those of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> B, we must refer to the map.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>At the beginning of this work, under Strategy, Fig. <num value="1">1</num>, we have shown the danger of an army occupying a space forming a rectangle, <num value="2">two</num> sides of which belong to us, the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> formed by the sea or a neutral country, and the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> side left as sole retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>This is exactly the case with the <pb id="p.37" n="37"/>position of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Potomac army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>The country where it now placed, forms a triangle--<num value="1">one</num> side being formed by the <rs>Potomac</rs> or the frontier of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, the next by the <rs type="place">Chesapeake Bay</rs>, and the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> by the railway line leading from <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>The <num value="2">two</num> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lines can certainly not be used for lines of retreat by the <rs>Union</rs> army; and the rebels, by gaining the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> side with a superior force, would entirely cut the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> A from the <rs>Northern States</rs>, and force it, in the event of its trying to escape, to open its way with the bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>If this should not succeed, the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> A would be obliged to surrender.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>To execute this plan, which would be similar to the movements of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0052.0003.00037.00037" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Marengo, McHenry, Illinois" key="tgn,2028962">Marengo</placeName>, <persName n="Ulm,,,,," id="n0052.0003.00037.00038" reg="mostcommon:Ulm,nomatch:0"><surname>Ulm</surname></persName>, and <placeName reg="Jena, Loudon, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099764">Jena</placeName>, the rebels would have to leave a strong corps of observation opposite to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and with their main force to cross the <rs>Potomac</rs> above this town, to erect some field works to cover their tete-de-pont in case of retreat, and then advance along the <rs>Potomac</rs> toward the capital.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>The Union army has <num value="3">three</num> lines of conduct left:--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>To await them in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, by trying to defend this place.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/><num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>To try to escape by the road to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> case, the condition of the <num value="2">two</num> armies must be taken into consideration.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>If the victorious rebels, with <num value="250000">250,000</num> men, cross the <rs>Potomac</rs> above the capital, and advance there, and this only <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> (necessary time for the march) after tie retreat and defeat of A, this would only be able to oppose to <pb id="p.38" n="38"/>this army from <num value="180000">180,000</num> to <num value="200000">200,000</num> men, disorganized and discouraged, their defeat would be almost certain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>The manoeuvre of the rebels would be of much less value, if they were to cross with an army only as strong as that of A, and if the latter had not been previously defeated; however, they might even then act with some advantage, as they would risk little more than their <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> in case of defeat, and, in the event of a victory, it would be decisive.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>If A awaits the arrival of the rebels in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, nothing would be gained by it. The only line of communication with the <rs>North</rs>, being that of <persName><foreName>Baltimore</foreName></persName>, would be destroyed by the rebels, and the <rs>Union</rs> troops in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> would be soon obliged to surrender in consequence of the want of provisions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Finally, if A tries to escape on the road to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, B can easily overtake it, as the distance from this place to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> is nearly equal to that from Point-of-Rocks to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>These lines form, with the road from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to Point-of-Rocks, a sort of equilateral triangle, and therefore any position which the rebels hold on the last-mentioned line would give them the facility of arriving at the same time as the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> A on the opposite side of the <orgName n="Baltimore Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore railway</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>A would be forced to fight with its rear toward the <rs type="place">Chesapeake Bay</rs> &mdash; that is, with the certainty of destruction in case of defeat.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>From what has been said, after the defeat of A the decisive point becomes evidently Point-of-Rocks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>The <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="2">two</num> armies which <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> occupies it and the passages above this point will evidently be master of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>The <num value="2">two</num> armies, A and B, should therefore make forced <pb id="p.39" n="39"/>marches to arrive there <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; but the distance being somewhat shorter on the left bank of the <placeName reg="Hodgson Point, Saint Marys, Maryland" key="tgn,7020782">Potomac</placeName>, we may suppose that A gains this point before B does, and will defend the passages over the river.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>Both armies being exhausted by the different marches and fights, a few days' repose is necessary for them to reorganize; and we may therefore suppose that from A's departure from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> till B recommences operations on the <rs>Upper Potomac</rs>, <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure> more will have elapsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>During those <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure> A has taken every means to re-establish its army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>For this, the <num value="75000">75,000</num> men of the reserve Army A<hi rend="sup">II</hi> are called in; <num value="25000">25,000</num> of the reserve Army A<hi rend="sup">V</hi> are called likewise; and the <num value="50000">50,000</num> men at <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> are ordered back, their presence in the rear of a victorious enemy, and so far from the decisive point, being considered unnecessary.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>All these measures are taken, but B will evidently not wait to commence operations till A is properly reinforced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>At this moment it is decidedly superior in strength, and must try to force the passage across the <rs>Potomac</rs> above the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> A, an act against A's <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName>; the latter is thereby obliged to arch still higher up the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>A's retreat would be called parallel to the frontier.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Though B advances, A would have the advantage of preventing it gaining ground on Union territory; instead of approaching, it would recede from Northern towns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>A is continually reinforced in its retreat by the arrival of fresh troops from the reserve armies A<hi rend="sup">II</hi> and A<hi rend="sup">V</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>The <orgName n="West Virginian" type="newspaper">Western Virginian</orgName> army likewise receives orders to retreat, to cross the <rs>Ohio</rs> in a northern direction, and to unite with A; but, on the other hand, B is also joined by <pb id="p.40" n="40"/> B<hi rend="sup">VII</hi>. A continues its retreat parallel to the frontiers till it arrives on the opposite side of the <rs>Ohio</rs>, which would take place about <num value="15">15</num> or <measure n="16days" type="date">16 days</measure> after its departure from Point-of-Rocks; it is joined by the different reinforcements, and amounts now to <num value="250000">250,000</num> or even <num value="275000">275,000</num>, to whom the rebels could oppose only about <num value="250000">250,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>A would therefore pass from the defensive to the offensive, and oblige in its turn B to retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>But B might accept battle in a chosen position, or it might, by some well-combined marches, pass to the <rs>Southwest</rs>, cross the <rs>Ohio</rs> below A, and thereby gain a central position between A and the <orgName n="Army of Kentucky" type="army">Kentucky Army</orgName> A<hi rend="sup">III</hi>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>These different movements of A and B, from the commencement of operations up to the last move of B, have taken <num value="35">35</num> or <measure n="40days" type="date">40 days</measure>, at about which time the defeat of A<hi rend="sup">III</hi> will also be accomplished, as shown in the preceding pages. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>The question now is how the whole rebel force should act. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>The war, for them, has become decidedly offensive, and an entirely new plan is to be devised. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>The positions of the different armies, at this period of the operations, would be the following:-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>A, after leaving <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> well garrisoned, retreated with <num value="150000">150,000</num> men, was reinforced by <num value="60000">60,000</num> to <num value="70000">70,000</num> men from the reserve Army A<hi rend="sup">II</hi>, besides <num value="25000">25,000</num> from the reserve Army A<hi rend="sup">V</hi>, and <num value="25000">25,000</num> from the <orgName n="West Virginian" type="newspaper">Western Virginian</orgName> Army A<hi rend="sup">VI</hi>-the whole now forming a total of <num value="260000">260,000</num> to <num value="270000">270,000</num> men, who occupy a position on the right bank of the <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706"><rs type="direction">Upper</rs> Ohio</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>A<hi rend="sup">VI</hi> is on its way from <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> to New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>A<hi rend="sup">V</hi>, consisting now of only <num value="25000">25,000</num> men, is on the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio</placeName> and <placeName reg="Mississippi, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> is near <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, on the right bank of the <placeName key="tgn,7022231" n="1.000 1584" reg="mississippi river">Mississippi</placeName>, and commences its retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/><pb id="p.41" n="41"/> </p> 
<p>B left <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> with <num value="225000">225,000</num> men, and was joined by ByV from <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, and occupies with those <num value="245000">245,000</num> men a position on the right bank of the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio</placeName> below A. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/><num value="15000">15,000</num> men, or B<hi rend="sup">VI</hi>, are on their way to join B, as, through the departure of A<hi rend="sup">VII</hi> from <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>, they have become disposable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>B<hi rend="sup">III</hi> and B<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> are near <placeName reg="Decatur, Macon, Illinois" key="tgn,7013516">Decatur</placeName>, with <num value="180000">180,000</num> to <num value="190000">190,000</num> men, and <num value="20000">20,000</num> are left at <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, opposed to A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>It is easy to see that the rebels have the advantage on their side; their armies occupy central positions between those of the <rs>Union</rs>; their lines of communication are interior, compared with those of the <rs>North</rs>; and, besides, the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> is already placed in such a position that its loss is certain if the rebels make the best use of their time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>The difference in the number of men of the armies A and B is too small to give <num value="1">one</num> a decided superiority over the other in an engagement; the tactical arrangements, the moral state of the troops, and many other circumstances would decide who was to be the victor, and then the victory would probably result only in a well-ordered retreat of the defeated party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Considering these different circumstances, the rebels may choose either of <num value="2">two</num> lines of conduct for their plan of offense. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Either B, exciting its troops by the news of the defeat of A<hi rend="sup">III</hi>, advances against A before this is reinforced by the <orgName n="Army of Port Royal" type="army">Port Royal army</orgName>, engages, and tries to defeat it &mdash; in case of a victory, pursuing A; in case of a defeat, retreating, and making a junction with the advancing reinforcement from B<hi rend="sup">III</hi> or-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>B awaits, in a well-chosen and even temporarily fortified position, the attack of A and the arrival of its own reinforcements from <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> and <placeName reg="Decatur, Macon, Illinois" key="tgn,7013516">Decatur</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/><pb id="p.42" n="42"/></p> 
<p>B<hi rend="sup">III</hi> and B<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> have only <num value="1">one</num> step to take &mdash; that is, to proceed at once against A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi>, and use every means to prevent it escaping to the <rs>East</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>For this they must reach <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName> before A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> can prevent them, and, having then the passages of the <rs>Ohio</rs> and <rs>Mississippi</rs> in their possession, they will act according to circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>But <num value="200000">200,000</num> men are more than necessary to beat <num value="100000">100,000</num>; therefore the army may divide, and act simultaneously on <num value="2">two</num> points-<num value="1">one</num> part, about <num value="140000">140,000</num> men, may act against A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> and the dispersed Army A<hi rend="sub">V</hi>, the other, about <num value="60000">60,000</num> men, will have to join the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> B; their action is offensive, and consequently they must act on divergent lines, to keep the shortest communication for themselves, and to place their own armies between the divided bodies of the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>The larger army of <num value="140000">140,000</num> men might cross the <rs>Mississippi</rs> at <placeName key="tgn,2039351" n="1.000 35" reg="hickman, fulton, kentucky">Hickman</placeName>, but it is probable that it would arrive too late to cut A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> from its base of operation; and as it must prevent A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> passing the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, and from retreating to the <rs>Eastern States</rs>, the passage at <placeName key="tgn,2039351" n="1.000 35" reg="hickman, fulton, kentucky">Hickman</placeName> would be a fault, except in the event of its having received the intelligence that A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> was still detained at <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>The rebel army must, therefore, gain the left bank of the <placeName key="tgn,7022231" n="1.000 1584" reg="mississippi river">Mississippi</placeName> above the <rs>Ohio</rs>, and hinder the <rs>Union Army</rs> A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi>, by a small force, from crossing, and, by means of several feigned attacks, make good its own passage, and oblige A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> to fight against a superior force.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>We will suppose that the rebel Army B<hi rend="sup">III</hi> follows the plan as just explained, and that the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> B awaits its reinforcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>The conduct of the latter might be considered a fault, as an energetic general would not lose this occasion <pb id="p.43" n="43"/>for fighting, considering the excitement of his troops and the discouragement of those of the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>Here, however, we must observe <num value="1">one</num> thing: operations with <num value="400000">400,000</num> in <num value="1">one</num> army are impossible; and the rebels, in order to continue, would be compelled to form several lines of operation, giving a great advantage to the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> A, which might now regain by a defensive campaign what could not be obtained by an offensive <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>As this would form an entirely new example, and as the operations already described may give a sufficient idea of strategical movements, we will now leave the present example, and proceed to a criticism of the different operations, so that the reader may well understand why those victories have taken place.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>Here I must make some remarks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>In the discussion of strategical movements, or, as it is called, making war on the map, the distances are generallly calculated by a certain number of days' march, each from <num value="17">17</num> to <num value="20">20</num> for ordinary, and about <measure n="25miles" type="distance">25 miles</measure>, or even more, for extraordinary or forced marches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>The distances are mostly taken without the state of the roads being at all considered.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>An army in presence of a retreating but always fighting enemy, can scarcely march more than <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> per day, and even sometimes less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>The passage of a river generally takes a considerable time, and, before a strong army, becomes nearly impossible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>In the engagements supposed to have taken place, we have made a complete abstraction of all tactical arrangements; we have always supposed that the strongest in men, <pb id="p.47" n="47"/>and who, according to his force, takes the initiative in the attack, is victorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>This is not always the case in war, although we may assert that well-combined plans, if executed with boldness and daring, have generally a more favorable result than those which do not possess these qualities.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>In passing now through the different operations, we conclude--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>That the general plan of attack by the <rs>Union</rs> troops was badly devised: too great a division of forces; wrong lines of operation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>That, after the failure of the great plan, the <rs>Union</rs> armies, through the force of circumstances, are more and more conducted to a concentration of all their means, and the adoption of only <num value="1">one</num> line of operation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/><num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>That the rebels' plan of defense was based on a cooperation of all their forces on a grand scale, leading to--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>Concentration of their forces by the right choice of their lines of operation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>They act concentric in their defense, and always make use of their interior lines.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>In their attack they act divergently, and isolate the different Union armies by putting larger armies between them, by keeping up central positions, and by acting with superior force against each isolated Union army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>The campaign of A and A<hi rend="sup">I</hi> is, in a strategical point of view, lost for them even before it commences.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>Their plan of attack may be devised in many different ways; but the result would be very little changed, as the rebels could at almost any time, no matter what we imagine, transport the mass of their forces successively against A and <pb id="p.48" n="48"/>A<hi rend="sup">I</hi>; the only difference, perhaps, would be that the ground gained at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> by the <rs>Union</rs> troops would be more; but this is of very little or no consequence, as they would lose it by the following operations of the rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>If A<hi rend="sup">I</hi> is much stronger, this would be but of little use, and the case would be the same with A. The fortifications and lines of defense of the rebels should then be stronger too, and more numerous, and the <rs>Western</rs> armies would have to supply <num value="20000">20,000</num> or <num value="30000">30,000</num> men from their contingent to the augmentation of the <orgName n="Army of Richmond" type="army">Richmond army</orgName>; the final result would be the same.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/><num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>We see that, by a good choice of accidental lines of operation, we may, even after great disasters, save a whole campaign.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>We would call the line of retreat of A parallel to the frontier, or the <rs>Potomac</rs>, an accidental line of operation; and this retreat should be considered a fine strategical movement, as A, although retreating, prevents B gaining any ground on Union territory, and increases the distance between it and the great Northern capitals, centers of industry and wealth which would have been endangered if it had effected a retreat to the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>(<placeName reg="Frederick, Frederick, Maryland" key="tgn,7016855">Frederick</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1757--"><year reg="1757">1757</year></dateStruct>, and <persName n="Soult,,,,," id="n0052.0003.00048.00039" reg="mostcommon:Soult,nomatch:0"><surname>Soult</surname></persName>, in <dateStruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></dateStruct>, executed similar retreats.)</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>A might, perhaps, have done even better in retreating from <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> to <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, instead of to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, if such a course was possible, after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> engagements, forcing it to the retreat, as by such a step it prevents B, at the very outset, from acting against the capital, or dividing it from the <rs>North</rs>; it remains longer on the enemy's territory, and forces the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> B to follow it in the direction of <pb id="p.49" n="49"/><placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>; but, on the other hand, it is also more exposed to the attacks of the stronger B.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>In neither of these cases, however, can B proceed to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, as, in doing so, A would be continually in its rear and on its communications, and A, being now daily reinforced by the reserve Army A<hi rend="sup">II</hi>, would soon be enabled to pass again to the offensive, and place B in a similar position to what its own would have been, if it had remained on the line of defense of the <rs>Potomac</rs> after its defeat.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Whatever A does, the pursuit of B should be undertaken with the greatest energy, and the rebels should try their utmost to force A to fight again, and to prepare it heavy losses; besides, nothing disorganizes a beaten enemy more than a well-conducted pursuit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>On the other hand, A must carefully avoid a general engagement, and act against B only when the result is quite certain, by surprising detachments of it, or by attacking it in the operation of crossing a river, and by destroying that part of B's army which has already passed and cannot be supported by its main army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>A should pass again to the offensive only if sufficiently reinforced, so as not to expose itself to entire defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>It would then be time for B to retreat.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>The retreat of B in the direction of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, and parallel to the <rs>Southern</rs> frontier, should also be considered as a clever strategical movement,--so much more as it approaches the <rs>Western</rs> armies, renders a junction with them easy, and can, by means of the <rs>Nashville</rs> and <orgName n="Richmond Railroad" type="railroad">Richmond railway</orgName> line, reach the latter town soon enough to prevent an attack by A, if this <num value="1">one</num> had marched in that direction, to <pb id="p.50" n="50"/>take the now only insufficiently occupied fortifications of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>In the operation of the <orgName n="Army of Missouri" type="army">Missouri army</orgName>, we see that this army, though acting in conformity with its orders, might have operated very differently to what it did.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>Instead of advancing to <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, it might have tried to deceive B<hi rend="sup">IV</hi>, and, passing the <rs>Mississippi</rs> near <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName>, force its passage across the <rs>Missouri</rs>, advance in the direction of A<hi rend="sup">III</hi>, to form a junction with this army before B<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> could form <num value="1">one</num> with B<hi rend="sup">III</hi>; then they might have acted together by trying to obtain a central position between the <num value="2">two</num> rebel armies, the fate of which would then have been easily decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>On the other hand, B<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> should have prevented that, in passing the <rs>Mississippi</rs> at <placeName key="tgn,2039351" n="1.000 35" reg="hickman, fulton, kentucky">Hickman</placeName>, and in being transported by rail to the <placeName reg="Memphis-Decatur">Memphis-Decatur</placeName> line, and to the junction with B<hi rend="sup">III</hi>. In this case, or if in general A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> was suspected of having formed the plan to pass the <rs>Mississippi</rs> near <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName>, the passages over the <rs>Ohio</rs> near this place ought to be well guarded by detachments from B<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> or B<hi rend="sup">V</hi>. The action of B<hi rend="sup">III</hi> should have been different from what it was when B<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> retreated to <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>Instead of opposing A<hi rend="sup">III</hi>, it should have retreated as quickly as possible, and have tried to increase the distance by every means between A<hi rend="sup">III</hi> and A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi>. A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi>, in making a junction with A<hi rend="sup">III</hi>, cannot use any rail; therefore, if A<hi rend="sup">III</hi> has advanced too far, it will pay dearly for its boldness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>If A<hi rend="sup">III</hi> and A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> can unite, it will be hardly possible for them to prevent B<hi rend="sup">III</hi> and B<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> uniting likewise, as they possess the shortest lines, except that B<hi rend="sup">III</hi> and B<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> make great mistakes &mdash; B<hi rend="sup">III</hi>, for instance, by engaging itself in a serious fight, in which it is outflanked on <num value="1">one</num> wing and <pb id="p.51" n="51"/>forced from its line of retreat into another direction, or B<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> by not making the best use of its time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>If, therefore, A<hi rend="sup">III</hi> and A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> unite, and B<hi rend="sup">III</hi>, B<hi rend="sup">IV</hi>, and B<hi rend="sup">V</hi> unite too, a battle will follow, but it would probably take place on ground chosen by the rebels, as A<hi rend="sup">III</hi> and A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi>, in order to obtain their objects &mdash; being the destruction of the rebel armies and the occupation of their territory &mdash; would be obliged to attack them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>The slight numerical superiority, besides the advantage of the ground, would most likely give the rebels the best of the conflict; but, however, the odds would be much more equal than if A<hi rend="sup">III</hi> and A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> fought separately against the <num value="3">three</num> rebel armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>Although resulting in a retreat, this would be far from destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>Returned to the base of operation, they will strengthen themselves by the reserve Army A<hi rend="sup">V</hi>, and advance again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>However, this will show better than anything else that the <rs>Union</rs>'s <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> plan of operation was wrong, and, even if everything was for the best, it ended by a retreat.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/><num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>We see, further, in the example, that the rebels made the best use of their time; that speed, and a quick and unrelinquished pursuit of their object, conducted the rebels from victory to victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>If B<hi rend="sup">III</hi> and B<hi rend="sup">IV</hi>, after defeating A<hi rend="sup">III</hi>, had reposed on their laurels, the result would have been that A<hi rend="sup">IV</hi> would have retreated to the <rs>Eastern States</rs>, and the remainder of the reserve army, A<hi rend="sup">V</hi>, would have done the same, and, by joining with the great <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Potomac army</orgName>, have formed a body equal in strength to all the rebel armies united.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/><num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>As a general rule, we can also conclude that great <pb id="p.52" n="52"/>detachments should be avoided, if obliged to act in the rear of much larger armies of the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>With the best will to assign, in the example, a place for the operation of the army at <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>, I found it quite impossible to give this army anything like a role to play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>It was only opposed by a very small force; but, surrounded on all sides by the enemy, it could not leave its base, without the danger of being entirely cut from it. The rebels, with their means of transport, could assemble in a few days a large army, and defeat it. Besides, if the rebels in the <rs>North</rs> are victorious, this army of <num value="50000">50,000</num> men would not prevent them being so; and if they are beaten, the result of the war would be decided before its action could commence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>Therefore we should reflect well before we embark in such operations; we should consider their enormous cost, and if we will receive an equivalent in the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>Finally, we should keep in view that those expeditions are dependent upon our fleet; that our fleet is neither shell nor storm proof; and, if we are not undisputed masters of all seas, if the fleets at our disposal are not such that <num value="1">one</num> lost could be replaced at once by another, we place the entire safety of our army on the safety of our fleet, and it would therefore depend on the friendship and good &mdash; will of our neighbors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>These expeditions might then become of more use to the enemy than to us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/><num value="7" type="ordinal">7th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>Finally, we conclude that, by the application of the maxims of strategy, we might come victorious out of a struggle with a much stronger enemy, as they conduct us to <pb id="p.53" n="53"/>a concentration of our forces, and to fight only when we can do so with superior against inferior means.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>We may say that, in supposing the plan of the <rs>Union</rs> forces to be the same, the rebels might have effectually defended their territory even with less means &mdash; for instance, by opposing the <num value="2">two</num> Western armies with much smaller ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>The main army on the <rs>Potomac</rs> would then have been transported successively to a junction with the different corps of observation, and, with their assistance, the campaign would have ended in a similar manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>Only the loss of ground at the beginning, by the rebels, would have been greater, and the offensive operations could not have been so energetic as they are supposed in our example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>If we give the rebels <num value="400000">400,000</num>, we may suppose them to be distributed as follows: <num value="250000">250,000</num> on the <rs>Potomac</rs>, representing B, B<hi rend="sup">I</hi>, B<hi rend="sup">II</hi>; the armies B<hi rend="sup">III</hi>, B<hi rend="sup">IV</hi>, each of <num value="60000">60,000</num> men; B<hi rend="sup">V</hi>, <num value="10000">10,000</num> men; B<hi rend="sup">VI</hi>, <num value="10000">10,000</num>, and B<hi rend="sup">VII</hi>, <num value="10000">10,000</num> men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>If the attack on the <rs>Potomac</rs> takes place <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, B can easily, as soon as a result there is obtained, send <num value="90000">90,000</num> men to the <rs>West</rs>, and; by uniting the different forces in a similar way, as shown in the example, they will still be able to defeat the <rs>Union</rs> forces <num value="1">one</num> after the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>We may suppose their force to be still less, say <num value="350000">350,000</num> or <num value="300000">300,000</num> men: even then they could prevent the advance of the different Northern armies.

<head>Grand Tactics.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>we have given, in the preceding chapter, the view of a war in its whole <hi rend="italics">ensemble</hi>, and we have shown the principles which should guide us in the direction to give our armies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>All our movements and manoeuvres, as given in the example, have brought us in the presence of the enemy; and the main object of those movements was, to bring, in the collision, the odds on our side.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>It is evidently not enough to have the odds for us; our skill in tactics must be equal to that in strategy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>Our most skillful strategical combinations might prove of very little use, if our enemy, by a very superior tactical arrangement, would wrench the victory, which we have already half won, from our hands.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>We must therefore study more closely the arrangement of our troops in fight and battle, see how we may consider an army and a battle; and let us then draw from the definition, as a sort of consequence, the way we should use the <num value="1">one</num> in order to gain the other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>An army represents an accumulation of forces, to be used in destroying the obstacles which another party puts in our way to prevent us attaining our object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/><pb id="p.56" n="56"/></p> 
<p>The greater the force, in comparison to the obstacle, the easier this is destroyed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>Marches and manoeuvres are the preparations; battle is the act of destruction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>If the preparations have exhausted our forces, we have none left for the destruction, and our own loss might be the consequence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>If the obstacle in our way is too heavy to be removed in <num value="1">one</num> action, we must divide it, and destroy or remove each part of it separately; therefore, with superior forces we should act against each part of the enemy's army, and destroy <num value="1">one</num> after the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>But as the entire obstacle is endowed with life, acts to obtain its own object, and tries its utmost to prevent us attaining ours, it will by every means endeavor to hinder the destruction of <num value="1">one</num> of its parts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>The great art of Tactics is, therefore--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>To concentrate such forces on <num value="1">one</num> point of our battle line, that we may destroy or completely remove the enemy's forces opposed to us on that point, before they can be properly reinforced.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>To choose such a point for our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> action, that the consequence of its success is the destruction or removal of the other parts of the enemy's army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/><num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>While we are gaining our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> partial victory, to prevent the enemy attaining his own object or reinforcing the part we are beating.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>Reflections on these <num value="3">three</num> principal rules will bring us to the following conclusions :--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>That we should place, in our tactical arrangements, just as much weight on the employment of our time as we do on our space.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/><pb id="p.57" n="57"/></p> 
<p><num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>That the force at our disposal must be divided into parts connected by <num value="1">one</num> organization and acting like <num value="1">one</num> machine, so that we can give each of those parts <num value="1">one</num> of the separate tasks to fulfill, which arise by the arrangement of our time and space on the battle-field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>We have, therefore, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to look to the organization of our armies and the elements composing them, before we can proceed to show their use. </p>

<head>Elements composing them, and their organization.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>armies are composed of troops, and troops are composed of armed men,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>By the nature of the armament we distinguish <emph>Infantry, Cavalry,</emph> and <emph>Artillery.</emph> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>Each of those armed men represents, by his own individual strength as well as by the nature of his arm, a force capable of doing a certain amount of work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>The amount of work differs for each of the <num value="3">three</num> arms; their examination will, therefore, be our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> object.</p> 
<div4 id="c.4.6" type="section" n="c.4.6"> 
<head>Infantry.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>Infantry forms to-day the mass of our armies; it is composed of men whose principal arm is a gun, on which a bayonet is fixed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>The character of the arm shows the nature of the work infantry can produce.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>The gun itself is a fire-arm, and its effect can be felt even at a great distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>The force that produces the work is the powder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>The right application of the work depends on the skill of the man; therefore, in the management of the fire-arm, skill is more required than strength.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>The bayonet, on the other hand, is an arm which can <pb id="p.59" n="59"/>only be used at close quarters, and in the man-against-man fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>For the management of this arm strength and individual courage are the principal qualities.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>By the above definitions, we conclude that the men most distinguished for their skill in fire-arms should be particularly employed for distant fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>Men, on the other hand, distinguished for their great strength and courage, ought to be employed in the man-against-man struggle, and their arm should be the bayonet; this, therefore, conducts us to the adoption of different classes of infantry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>The best marksmen should be taken from the army to form special corps, called sharpshooters, rifles, skirmishers, (<hi rend="italics">Chasseurs, <persName n="Jager,,,,," id="n0052.0004.00059.00040" reg="mostcommon:Jager,nomatch:0"><surname>Jager</surname></persName></hi>.) Their principal, object is distant fight; they have to prepare the action for the mass of our infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>The strongest men, and those most remarkable for great bravery and courage, and who have seen the longest service, should form what is called a corps of reserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>They should be employed only in the last and most decisive moments, and their great object is to act <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> in the struggle at close quarters, and by their strength, bravery, and coolness decide the victory in our favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>The rest of the infantry would be called simply <orgName n="Line Infantry" type="infantry">infantry of the line</orgName>; its object is to form the real line of battle, and to be employed under all circumstances either for skirmishing or for fighting with the bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>Here the question arises, if we should arm these <num value="3">three</num> classes of infantry differently, their action, and principally the time of it, being different.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>I believe that <num value="1">one</num> and the same caliber and <num value="1">one</num> and the same ammunition should be adopted for all the armies of <pb id="p.60" n="60"/><num value="1">one</num> and the same country; but I think a difference should be made in the construction of the gun.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>All the guns should be rifled, and used with the same ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>The sharpshooter's gun should be provided with finer sights; it should be somewhat shorter than that of the infantry, to permit of an easier management.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>The sharpshooters, once in the engagement, can fire whenever they please, or whenever they have a chance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>Each man has time to charge and use his gun with coolness and reflection; therefore to sharpshooters quick-loading guns should not be given; it would induce the men to spend their whole ammunition before they had even arrived to effective ranges.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>On the other hand, the reserve and all those troops whose principal task is to fight at close quarters, who act in most parts <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi>, fire only by order, and, what is still more important, fire nearly always only at the most decisive moment and at short distances, should be provided with guns permitting a quickly-succeeding and unremitting fire.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>Infantry acting <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> or individually is. enabled to fight nearly on every ground, and to surmount, in its advance or retreat, any difficulty which roads or configuration of the country would oppose to it. Infantry can easily make use of cover, and can pass over from <num value="80">eighty</num> to a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> in <num value="1">one</num> minute for great distances; and for small distances, its speed for a time may be even more than doubled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>These different qualities have made infantry the principal arm in all well-organized armies. </p></div4> 
<div4 id="c.4.7" type="section" n="c.4.7"> <pb id="p.61" n="61"/> 
<head>Cavalry.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>We have seen that Infantry is able to fight at a distance as well as at close quarters; we may say that Cavalry and Artillery form the <num value="2">two</num> extremes of Infantry, and possess each <num value="1">one</num> quality of the <rs>Infantry</rs>, but in a higher degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>Cavalry is only fit for fighting in close battle; when exposed to distant fight, its loss is certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>Artillery, on the other hand, is only fit for distant fight, and close quarters is its death.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>The arms of the horse soldier are his sword and horse; fire-arms are also used, but they are more to inspire confidence or to give signals, than of real use on the battle-field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>Cavalry, therefore, acts only by the muscular strength of the parts composing it; being formed of <num value="2">two</num> parts, each endowed with force, the man and the horse, we can use either the strength of the man or that of the horse, or both combined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>In other words, cavalry may be used only for the speed of the horse, as in ordnance service, or in fight where speed and shock of the horse; the bravery and strength of the man, find their consecutive employment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>This would lead us to the adoption of different kinds of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>Light cavalry, with the duties of outposts, pickets, foraging parties, for expeditions in the enemy's flank and rear, and for reconnoitering parties, etc.,--here speed is the principal requisition; daring and the capacity for fighting should evidently be found also, but we do not require strength and power in such a degree as we do for heavy and medium cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>This should act by its force and shock; speed is needed only for short times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/><pb id="p.62" n="62"/></p> 
<p>The perfection of fire-arms has made cavalry, and principally heavy cavalry, lose much of its importance; and it is probable that <num value="1">one</num> good medium, or even only light cavalry, will, in a short time, be exclusively used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>Cavalry, although quicker than infantry, cannot be used on all ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>Its speed can, for a time, be double that of infantry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>Cavalry amounts, in most of the <rs>European</rs> armies, to <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> or <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> of the infantry; but it is probable that the next wars will reduce this number.</p></div4> 
<div4 id="c.4.8" type="section" n="c.4.8"> 
<head>Artillery.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>In Infantry and Cavalry individuals form the composing elements; in Artillery it is the arm.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>The arm of <orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">Field Artillery</orgName> is a gun reposing on a carriage drawn by <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="8">eight</num> horses, and served by <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="20">twenty</num> men; it fires shots from <num value="6">6</num> to <measure n="12l." type="pounds"><num value="12">12</num> pounds</measure>, and shells up to <measure n="24l." type="pounds"><num value="24">24</num> pounds</measure>. The object of artillery is distant fight; therefore, a powerful and precise fire is of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>The fire is directed against movable objects; besides, its effects increase or decrease according to the distance; therefore the guns should possess facility of movement in an equally high degree.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>The last <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> have, by the introduction of rifled guns, worked such changes in the construction as well as the employment of this arm, that I will perhaps be allowed to say a few more words concerning it, than I did of the other <num value="2">two</num> arms &mdash; so much more, as all the advantages which may be derived from a right choice of rifled guns are generally <pb id="p.63" n="63"/>not yet fully understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>In passing in review the whole history of gunnery, we find, from the day of the invention of cannon, the manifest desire to have powerful guns and to have manageable ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>To the heaviest <num value="24">24</num> and <num value="32">32</num> pounders on the most awkward carriages, used together with <num value="2">2</num> and <num value="3">3</num> pounders dragged by the men, we see succeed lighter <num value="24">24</num>-pounders on more manageable carriages, used together with <orgName n="Horse Artillery" type="artillery">horse artillery</orgName> and light <num value="6">6</num>-pounders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>With the mobility of armies we see increase the mobility of guns in general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/><num value="24">24</num>-pounders are replaced by <num value="12">12</num> and <num value="18">18</num> pounders; <orgName n="Horse Artillery" type="artillery">horse artillery</orgName>, light <num value="6">6</num> and <num value="4">4</num> pounders, were made still lighter than before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>Carriages, caissons,, and the whole organization of artillery were arranged to permit of all calibers having a greater facility of manoeuvre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>This was the state in which we find artillery only some few years ago. Powerful artillery was represented by <num value="12">12</num>-pounders, heavy and long guns, and by <num value="24">24</num> and <num value="32">32</num> pounder howitzers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>Manageable artillery found its representatives in the light <num value="6">6</num>-pounder gun and <num value="12">12</num>-pounder howitzer of horse and <orgName n="Foot Artillery" type="artillery">foot artillery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>In comparing the different times, we see that, with the improvement of the <hi rend="italics">materiel</hi> and the many succeeding inventions, the calibers of the light and <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName> approach nearer each other; however, up to <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> ago, most countries had still <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> different calibers, and consequently as many different artillery organizations, in their armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>In large armies simplification became a necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step was taken by the present <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs>, in whose army all guns and howitzers were replaced by <num value="1">one</num> light <num value="12">12</num>-pounder gun firing shot and shell, and uniting powerful fire to great mobility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>In its fire it <pb id="p.64" n="64"/>was inferior to the long and heavy <num value="12">12</num>-pounder, but superior to it by its mobility; in this last quality it was somewhat inferior to the light <num value="6">6</num>-pounder, but at the same time surpassing this <num value="1">one</num> by the power of its fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>This gun was constructed on the principle that a heavy projectile fired with a small charge is preferable to a light <num value="1">one</num> fired with a heavy charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>The application of this principle soon conducted to the construction of rifled guns; and with their introduction we may say that artillery has entered an entirely new phase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>From a rifled gun an elongated projectile, weighing more than the round bullet of the same diameter, is fired, with the same or even a smaller charge of powder than the last <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>The initial velocity of the elongated projectile will be smaller than that of the bullet; but its ranges will be greater at equal elevation, <hi rend="italics">already</hi> at short distances, because it more easily overcomes by its greater weight the resistance of the air. The initial velocity of the projectile being small, that of the recoil of the gun will be small too. We therefore conclude that by rifling guns we can fire a heavier projectile from a lighter gun, which means that we can unite in <num value="1">one</num> and the same gun great power of fire with great mobility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>The great art of the artilleryman is to choose from the infinity of variations of rifled guns the right <num value="1">one</num>--that is, a gun possessing the highest degree of mobility joined to <hi rend="italics">only</hi> the requisite quantity of power of fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>The lightest gun that can be found producing this required amount of power of fire will, therefore, be the best, and the model for <orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">field artillery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>A <num value="9">9</num>-pound shell fired with precision up to <measure n="3000yards" type="distance">3000 yards</measure> is as much as we should demand of a field gun. Few countries permit ranges over <num value="2500">2500</num> <pb id="p.65" n="65"/>or <measure n="3000yards" type="distance">3000 yards</measure>; if above these distances, scarcely anything can be discerned: <num value="2500">2500</num> to <measure n="3000yards" type="distance">3000 yards</measure> is, therefore, the limit for the ranges; and as regards the weight of the projectile, we can only choose between <num value="12">12</num>-pound shells and those of less weight; heavier shells would conduct us to too heavy an artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>The inferior limit of an effective shell is from <num value="9">9</num> to <measure n="10l." type="pounds"><num value="10">10</num> pounds</measure>; below this weight, the shell would have too small a diameter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>The ranges of <num value="12">12</num>-pound and <num value="9">9</num> to <measure n="10l." type="pounds"><num value="10">10</num> pound</measure> shells are little different; the question will, therefore, arise, if the greater bursting effect of the <num value="12">12</num>-pounder will make up for the quarter more weight, or, at equal weight, the quarter-less shells, that we must carry with us in the field, besides the difference in the weight of the guns and the more or less mobility which would be the consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>I think the question should be answered in the negative, and has been answered so by nearly all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> artilleries; the consequence was that, in nearly all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> armies, rifled <num value="4">4</num>-pounders, firing a <num value="9">9</num> to <measure n="10l." type="pounds"><num value="10">10</num> pound</measure> shell, were introduced, as the <hi rend="italics">only</hi> field guns, and we may say that the construction of this gun was the solution of the greatest problem of artillery since the invention of powder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>The <rs>Armstrong</rs>, <persName n="Whitworth,,,,," id="n0052.0004.00065.00041" reg="mostcommon:Whitworth,nomatch:0"><surname>Whitworth</surname></persName>, and many other rifled guns, corresponding in their weight more to the smooth-bored <num value="6">6</num>-pounders, all those beautiful weapons may be said to be of faulty construction as field guns; they possess an excess of power, but are far from having the mobility of the rifled <num value="4">4</num>-pounder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>This rifled gun is drawn by only <num value="4">four</num> horses, and served by only <num value="6">six</num> men. The Prussian <num value="4">4</num>-pounder gun is, however, in nearly every respect superior to the <rs>French</rs> <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>Being equally light, its <hi rend="italics">ranges</hi>, <pb id="p.66" n="66"/>and principally its <hi rend="italics">precision</hi>, are much greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>The introduction of those guns has wonderfully simplified the organization of <orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">field artillery</orgName> : but <num value="1">one</num> caliber throughout the army, but <num value="1">one</num> kind of ammunition, but <num value="1">one</num> organization as mounted artillery, reduction of costs and losses by the employment of less horses and men, multiplied action by its great mobility, and great effect by its powerful and precise fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>Firing but shells, with infinitely more precision up to <measure n="3000yards" type="distance">3000 yards</measure> than the smooth-bored <num value="12">12</num>-pounders could fire their shots at <dateStruct value="1500--"><year reg="1500">1500</year></dateStruct>, it replaces advantageously guns and howitzers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>Considering the standard of the science of artillery, we may say that, to-day, any field gun requiring more than <num value="4">four</num> horses, to execute with ease its manoeuvring on any kind of ground, is of faulty construction, and possesses an excess of power to the detriment of mobility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>It is very possible that the introduction of these light guns will conduct to an augmentation of the arm in general, and at the same time bring about a reduction of cavalry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>The number of guns now employed is about <num value="3">three</num> for every <dateStruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></dateStruct> soldiers; it will probably come to <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>With new and inexperienced soldiers, the number of guns should be greater than with old and tried troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>In speaking of the use of the <num value="3">three</num> arms in battle, I will say a few more words concerning the management of this <orgName n="New Artillery" type="artillery">new artillery</orgName>.</p></div4></div3> 
<div3 id="c.4.9" type="section" n="c.4.9"> 
<head>Organization.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>We have seen in the preceding chapters what are the elements composing an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>These elements must be joined with an organization to permit of their simultaneous action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/><pb id="p.67" n="67"/>Their simultaneous action is only possible by submitting them to <num value="1">one</num> will; therefore an army is commanded by <num value="1">one</num> person, and must be commanded by <num value="1">one</num> person only, and not by <num value="2">two</num> or more.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>The orders of the commander must be executed by the elements composing the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>The commander cannot give orders for each element separately; therefore our elements should be formed into a certain number of bodies, and their <hi rend="italics">commanders only</hi> should receive the orders from the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>The number of those under-commanders <num value="1">one</num> chief can attend to is restricted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>Experience proves that the number should not be less than <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num>, and not more than <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>An army of <num value="200000">200,000</num> men, for instance, might, according to this, be divided into <num value="8">eight</num> parts, each part numbering <num value="25000">25,000</num> men. For these <num value="25000">25,000</num> men we come to the same conclusion that we did for the whole army; subdivisions must be made, not less than <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num>, and not more than <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>These subdivisions must be again divided, and so on till we come to the unit of evolution &mdash; that is, <num value="1">one</num> body composed of elements &mdash; which is not any more divided in the evolutions, as given in the small tactics of each arm. These divisions have received names, which are: <emph><orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">Army corps</orgName>,</emph> a body of <num value="20000">20,000</num> to <num value="50000">50,000</num> men, making part of a large army; <emph>division,</emph> a body from <num value="10000">10,000</num> to <num value="20000">20,000</num> men; <emph>brigade,</emph> from <num value="4000">4000</num> to <num value="10000">10,000</num> men; the brigade is composed of regiments, regiments of battalions, battalions of companies, squadrons, and batteries, and these of platoons, sections, etc.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>A regiment is composed only of elements of the same <pb id="p.68" n="68"/>arm; it can be of infantry, cavalry, or artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>A brigade can be composed of infantry or cavalry, it can also be composed of the <num value="3">three</num> arms together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>A division is ordinarily composed of <num value="2">two</num> arms, infantry or cavalry joined with artillery, but it can likewise be provided with the <num value="3">three</num> arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>The <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> is always composed of the <num value="3">three</num> arms, and forms in itself a small army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>The battalion of infantry, squadron of cavalry, and battery of artillery form what is called a tactical unit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>In speaking of the force of an army, it is generally given by the number of battalions, squadrons, or batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>Their strength varies in the different armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>In the <rs>European</rs> armies, a battalion amounts to from <num value="600">600</num> to <dateStruct value="1300--"><year reg="1300">1300</year></dateStruct> men; squadrons, from <num value="80">80</num> to <num value="200">200</num> horses; and batteries, from <num value="4">4</num> to <num value="12">12</num> guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>Too strong a battalion is too difficult to move, and too small a <num value="1">one</num> too soon used up; it is the same with squadrons; very strong batteries are subject to be too often divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>For infantry, battalions of <num value="800">800</num> to <dateStruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></dateStruct> men; for cavalry, squadrons from <num value="100">100</num> to <num value="150">150</num> horses; for artillery, batteries from <num value="6">6</num> to <num value="8">8</num> guns, are, however, the numbers generally used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>Regiments of infantry are composed of <num value="2">2</num> to <num value="4">4</num> battalions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>Regiments of cavalry, from <num value="4">4</num> to <num value="10">10</num> squadrons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>Regiments of artillery, from <num value="4">4</num> to <num value="12">12</num> batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>The brigade has generally <num value="6">6</num> battalions; the division, <num value="2">2</num> or <num value="3">3</num> brigades; and the <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>, <num value="2">2</num> or <num value="3">3</num> divisions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>The organization of an army is different in nearly every country, and it is hardly possible to find <num value="1">one</num> that is faultless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>The bodies forming the immediate subdivisions of an army should be provided with the <num value="3">three</num> arms, and form <pb id="p.69" n="69"/>small armies by themselves; they should be able to fight independently of the main body.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>The number of brigades in these small armies is of importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>If we form a line of battle, <num value="3">3</num> brigades would be preferable to <num value="2">2</num>, as we would be able to have <num value="1">one</num> on each wing and <num value="1">one</num> in the center; but we must have a reserve, and, besides, we might be compelled to make detachments: this would give us <num value="2">2</num> brigades more, and would then lead us to an <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> composed of <num value="5">5</num> brigades instead of <num value="3">3</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>In treating of marches, we shall see that the <num value="5">number 5</num> is also the most convenient in the arrangement for marching in several columns.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>The formation of these brigades should be different, each <num value="1">one</num> having different tasks to fulfill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>The brigade for detachment would be, in many cases, obliged to keep up a fight independently of the other <num value="4">4</num> brigades; it should, therefore, be provided with the <num value="3">three</num> arms, and principally with the elements permitting a well-sustained distant fight, as in many cases it would have to contend with superior numbers, whose advance it would have to arrest or retard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>The <num value="3">three</num> brigades forming the line of battle require no cavalry, as they can be provided with this arm from the reserve; they should each have a battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>The <orgName n="Reserve Brigade" type="brigade">reserve brigade</orgName>, acting only in the last extremity, should be composed of the best infantry regiments, besides all the cavalry and <orgName n="Reserve Artillery" type="artillery">reserve artillery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>This would give for the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Brigade">first brigade</orgName>, which we will call advanced guard brigade, a composition of <num value="4">4</num> battalions of infantry, <num value="2">2</num> battalions of rifles, <num value="2">2</num> batteries, and <num value="4">4</num> squadrons; for each of the <num value="3">3</num> brigades of the line, <num value="4">4</num> battalions of infantry, <num value="1">1</num> battalion of rifles, and <pb id="p.70" n="70"/><num value="1">1</num> battery; for the brigade of reserve, <num value="4">4</num> battalions of infantry, <num value="6">6</num> squadrons, and <num value="6">6</num> batteries.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>The more the organization of an army is complete, the more the command is facilitated; the order given at the head passes in a few moments through the whole army, and all the parts of this great mass work like <num value="1">one</num> machine; but the command has only put all those forces to work; the work itself must be assigned beforehand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>Besides, the machine must be kept in the best possible order; in other words, an army must be provided with ammunition and provisions; if it marches, the roads must be pointed out to the chief of every division or <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>, the time of the different movements determined, the places where rivers are to be passed shown, the means for crossing the rivers provided, orders for marching given, the place for each <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> in battle assigned, the time of action, the moment for the arrival of the different bodies, the lines of advance or retreat must be fixed in general and for each of the smaller parts in particular.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>It is quite evident that the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs> of an army cannot attend to all these details; therefore he has another general under him, who is called the chief of the <rs n="General Staff" type="misc">general staff</rs>, whose duties are to render possible the ideas and orders of the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs>, and to see that those orders are properly carried out. Besides the above-mentioned duties of the staff, there are others which consist in a thorough study of the theater of the war and the providing of the most complete and correct maps, the working out of the general plan of campaign, the special plans of the battles, the receiving and giving the orders of the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs>, <pb id="p.71" n="71"/>etc.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>etc. The commander of each <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> has his special staff.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>In treating of the <num value="3">three</num> arms separately, we have spoken of their proportions in an army; those proportions change much, according to the country and the length of the war. It becomes, therefore, <num value="1">one</num> of the principal studies of a general, to always choose such ground for his actions, where he can make the best use of the arm in which he is superior, and where he can best spare the arm in which he is deficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/><placeName reg="Large plains">Large plains</placeName> are best adapted for the action of <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName> and cavalry; hilly country, <orgName n="Light Artillery" type="artillery">light artillery</orgName> and infantry; covered ground, infantry and sharpshooters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>Too small a quantity of artillery is dangerous, because our own troops, being too much exposed to the enemy's fire, and without the means of returning his ravages, would become demoralized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>To new troops a strong artillery is of great advantage; after a check, it covers their retreat, and gives them time to reassemble; it well prepares their advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>Too small a body of cavalry forces us into narrow limits, prevents us from well surveying the surrounding country and from gathering information concerning the enemy; besides, cavalry alone can turn a defeat into a rout.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>Generally speaking, the strength of an army depends on its number, the right proportion of the <num value="3">three</num> arms, the confidence of the troops in their leader, and the <orgName n="General Character" type="misc">general character</orgName> of the men who compose the army. </p></div3>

<head>Normal arrangement of troops in battle.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>Now that we know the elements and how they are united, we must see how they are to be disposed, to execute the order of their commander for a simultaneous or successive action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>Men, we have seen, represent forces capable of doing a certain amount of work in a certain length of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>The work done, exhaustion will follow for another length of time, till the strength of the men is re-established by food and repose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>In an engagement, the exhaustion of our forces arises from several causes &mdash; the fatigue of the men, the using up of the ammunition, and their exposure to the destroying work of the enemy; this last cause acts on the <hi rend="italics"></hi>number of our forces, and is even of more importance than the <num value="2">two</num> others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>Therefore we conclude that, if all our men commence work at the same time, and all act simultaneously, their action will be short and their exhaustion will be simultaneous; if, on the other hand, they act but in small parties, and <num value="1">one</num> party after the other, their work will be done successively, their action will be long, and total exhaustion will only follow after a great length of time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>If we dispose all our <figure id="fig.072"> 
<head>Fig.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/><num value="9">9</num>.</head></figure> men in <num value="1">one</num> line, <hi rend="italics">a b</hi>, Fig. <num value="9">9</num>, parallel to the line of the enemy <hi rend="italics">m n</hi>, each man will represent <num value="1">one</num> of the forces, <hi rend="italics">f</hi>. We see that all those forces act simultaneously, but also that they are all exposed to the work of the forces <hi rend="italics">f&prime;</hi> of the enemy's line <hi rend="italics">m n</hi>. The time of the action will therefore be short, <pb id="p.73" n="73"/>and <hi rend="italics">a b</hi> will be soon exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>If, on the other hand, we dispose all our forces <num value="1">one</num> <emph>behind</emph> the other, Fig. <num value="10">10</num>, and make them act against <hi rend="italics">m n</hi>, <figure id="fig.073">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/><num value="10">10</num>.</head></figure> <num value="1">one</num> force after the other will act, the work will be done successively, the time of the action will be long, and the exhaustion of the entire force will only follow after a greater length of time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>The representation for simultaneous action will, therefore, be the arrangement of our men in line parallel, and that of a successive action in line perpendicular, to that of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>Applied to a battalion, this means for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> disposition in line deployed, for the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> in columns.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>Experience has given limits to the extension of lines and the depth of columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>Lines may be used in open and close order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>In open order we see the skirmishers act; and if they do not form a regular line, their arrangement bears, at all events, the character, as it permits their simultaneous action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>Arranged in close order, <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> ranks are chosen in preference to a single rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>Columns may be of different depths &mdash; those which have the necessary depth for fighting, and those which are only used in marching to overcome the difficulties of the ground more easily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>From <num value="8">eight</num> to <num value="10">ten</num> ranks, <num value="1">one</num> behind the other, are sufficient to give a column the desired quality of a longer sustained fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>More than <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> ranks would only be an unnecessary accumulation of force which would never be required for action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/><pb id="p.74" n="74"/>Whatever we adopt, the line or the column, they will be both used up in the engagement; the length of time only will be different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>If, therefore, to prevent our whole force being exhausted too quickly, we divide it into <num value="2">two</num> parts, leaving <num value="1">one</num> behind the other out of the enemy's reach, we will be enabled at any time to bring fresh troops in the conflict, and, by choosing the right moment for action &mdash; that is, when the enemy, by the struggle with our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> force, is already weakened and in a state of confusion &mdash; those fresh troops will evidently have the best of it. This conducts to the arrangement of <num value="2">two</num> or more lines of battle, <num value="1">one</num> behind the other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>If, for instance, <hi rend="italics">a</hi> and <hi rend="italics">a&prime;</hi>, Fig. <num value="11">11</num>, <figure id="fig.074"> 
<head>Fig.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/><num value="11">11</num>.</head></figure> represent each a battalion, <hi rend="italics">a</hi> arranged in column and <hi rend="italics">a&prime;</hi> in line, <num value="2">two</num> other battalions, <hi rend="italics">b</hi> and <hi rend="italics">b&prime;</hi> should be arranged behind them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>To advance, being formed in line, is difficult; and, as <hi rend="italics">b</hi> and <hi rend="italics">b&prime;</hi> must advance at the right moment, they are both arranged in columns.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>To permit the action of <hi rend="italics">b</hi> and <hi rend="italics">b&prime;</hi>, an interval must be left between <hi rend="italics">a</hi> and <hi rend="italics">a&prime;</hi> through which <hi rend="italics">b</hi> and <hi rend="italics">b&prime;</hi> can advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>If <hi rend="italics">b</hi> and <hi rend="italics">b&prime;</hi> are in straight line behind <hi rend="italics">a</hi> and <hi rend="italics">a&prime;</hi>, their advance through the <figure id="fig.074.1">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/><num value="12">12</num>.</head></figure> interval will be more difficult; besides, if <hi rend="italics">a</hi> and <hi rend="italics">a&prime;</hi> retreated in disorder, they might involve <hi rend="italics">b</hi> and <hi rend="italics">b&prime;;</hi> we may, therefore, arrange <hi rend="italics">b</hi> and <hi rend="italics">b&prime;</hi> in the intervals of <hi rend="italics">a</hi> and <hi rend="italics">a&prime;</hi>, Fig. <num value="12">12</num>. <pb id="p.75" n="75"/></p>

<head>Fig.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/><num value="13">13</num>.</head></figure> depend on our intention to fight formed in line or in columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>If we suppose that <hi rend="italics">a, a&prime;, a&prime;</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">b, b&prime;, b&prime;</hi> represent battalions, Fig. <num value="13">13</num>, they may all have to act in columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>The distance from the center of a to the center of <hi rend="italics">a&prime;</hi>, Fig. <num value="14">14</num>, must, then, be <figure id="fig.075.1">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/><num value="14">14</num>.</head></figure> equal to the front of <hi rend="italics">a</hi> and <hi rend="italics">b</hi> both formed in column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>If <hi rend="italics">a, a&prime;, a&prime;</hi> have to form in line, and <hi rend="italics">b, b&prime;, b&prime;</hi> remain in column, the distance from center to center of <hi rend="italics">a</hi> and <hi rend="italics">a&prime;</hi> must be equal to the front of <hi rend="italics">a</hi> formed in line and <hi rend="italics">b</hi> in column.</p>

<p><hi rend="italics">a&prime;</hi> are formed in line, Fig. <num value="15">15</num>, and the interval should be such that <hi rend="italics">b</hi>, after advancing, could form in line too, the distance from center to center of <hi rend="italics">a</hi> and <hi rend="italics">a&prime;</hi> must be equal to the front of <hi rend="italics">a</hi> and <hi rend="italics">b</hi> both formed in line.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>We may, according to circumstances, employ any of the <num value="3">three</num> arrangements, as well as considerations of different nature may oblige us to increase still more the distance between <hi rend="italics">a, a&prime;, a&prime;</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>But the arrangement of the enemy's troops is similar to ours; the moment our <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line of battle advances against his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> victorious <num value="1">one</num>, his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line of battle, consisting <pb id="p.76" n="76"/>of fresh troops, advances against ours; therefore <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> line would be necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>As, however, on many points our <num value="2">two</num> lines might prove sufficient, and as we do not know on which point the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> line of battle might be required, we form it in <num value="1">one</num> mass called reserve; this mass is placed near the center of our whole line of battle, and will act, or send reinforcements to the endangered parts only of our front line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>As soon as its action is finished in that <num value="1">one</num> part, it returns to its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>If we have a point of great importance to defend, or if we wish to make a very vigorous attack on any particular point there, we may arrange more than <num value="2">two</num> lines of battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>We do the same with troops very apt to get into confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>Cavalry, more easily disordered, should always be arranged in more lines of battle than infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>Artillery, on the other hand, never fighting individually, cannot get into disorder, and requires, therefore, but <num value="1">one</num> line.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>There remains to be shown the average number of men disposed on every yard of the front line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>It is easy to see that the number of troops will be different according to the distance between the centers of <hi rend="italics">a, a&prime;, a&prime;</hi>, and we have seen that those distances vary much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>It is admitted that from <num value="2">2</num> to <num value="5">5</num> men, for each yard of the front, is a low number, from <num value="6">6</num> to <num value="8">8</num> an average, and above <num value="8">8</num> a high number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>We must, however, observe that an order of battle may not be deep, even if there are <num value="8">8</num> or more men for every yard of the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>The meaning of a deep order of battle is, that a long fight can be kept up and continually supplied with fresh troops pouring in from the rear.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>The number of men for every yard of the front line depends <pb id="p.77" n="77"/>greatly on the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>Covered ground requires less troops, and admits of less men for every yard of front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>The defense always requires less than the attack, and especially if favored by the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>Therefore the distribution of forces may be very different near the different parts of the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>Near the main attack, from <num value="10">10</num> to <num value="15">15</num> men may be placed for every yard, while in other places, perhaps <num value="2">2</num> or <num value="3">3</num> could only be disposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>The number also varies with the total strength of the army; a small army will have less men for every yard of the front than a larger <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>In nearly every country normal battle formations have been adopted; those formations varying with the organization of the armies, it would be much too long to give even a part of them, as there are so many variations; but as, in the last chapter, I have given an organization for an <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>, I will now show how this army might be arranged, leaving the ground entirely out of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>The advanced guard may be called upon to fight independently of the remaining portion of the other body, or they might fight together, the advanced guard being the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attacked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>I will give several plates showing how the troops might be arranged in the different cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>Those normal battle formations may be of great advantage when we have not much time for reflection &mdash; if attacked, for instance, on a march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>The arrangement of the troops in those normal orders, as given in the plates, will show that, in fact, the troops are disposed in <num value="4">four</num> lines of battle instead of <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>The skirmishers <pb id="p.78" n="78"/>form the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line; they act in open order, and their action is simultaneous; their exhaustion soon follows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line finds its employment principally in the distant fight, but at effective ranges; from this it passes to the fight at close quarters; there it is relieved and sustained by the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> line; and if this line is not sufficient, the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> <num value="1">one</num>, or reserve, must join its action with the <num value="3">three</num> preceding ones.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>As a general rule, however, for all these arrangements, without considering whether the space be large or small, we may say that a great portion of it should be kept in reserve; in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line, only the number of troops just necessary should be placed.</p>

<head>Battles, fights, skirmishes, etc.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>we distinguish between battles, fights, and skirmishes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>Battles are fought between the main bodies of <num value="2">two</num> armies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>Fights are the rencounters between the larger portions of the main body.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>Skirmishes are the rencounters of <num value="2">two</num> small bodies or advanced guards of larger bodies, without the intention on either side to engage in any serious fight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>If the parts of a great army are so strong that they form in themselves armies, any serious engagement with a similar corps of the enemy may be called a battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>On the other hand, a rencounter between <num value="2">two</num> main bodies may bear only the character of a fight, in consequence of the small number of troops engaged, the insignificant result of the affair, and the wish on both sides, or on <num value="1">one</num> only, to avoid a battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>We have seen in the foregoing chapters that battles are the consequence of our strategical arrangements and movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>If we understood by our strategical plan the way to direct our concentrated forces against smaller bodies of the enemy, which we could easily defeat, a whole campaign might end in a series of fights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>But if the enemy has as well calculated his movements as we have, an engagement of the main bodies will probably take place, which, in consequence <pb id="p.81" n="81"/>of the results, will be called a decisive or drawn battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>In this engagement, <num value="1">one</num> or both parties may have acted aggressively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>A battle can, therefore, as well as a whole campaign, be aggressive, defensive, or of the offensive defense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>The whole nature of the war, as well as our preceding strategical arrangements, will most probably decide which of the <num value="2">two</num> parties is to be the attacking <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>If we have gained the strategical victory &mdash; if, for instance, our manoeuvres have conducted us on the communications of the enemy, we might await his attack in the position chosen by us; our object being not merely to repulse the enemy from our position, but to defeat and destroy him, we would be conducted to a battle bearing the character of an offensive defense.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>If, on the other hand, the enemy's army stands in our way, and prevents us attaining our object, we would naturally become the attacking party; and finally, if we were inferior to it in number, and our only object consisted in the defense of <num value="1">one</num> of its passages, we might be conducted to a purely defensive battle.</p> 
<div3 id="c.4.14" type="section" n="c.4.14"> 
<head>Purely defensive battles.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>We can only determine upon fighting a purely defensive battle in case of a great inferiority to the enemy; we must then choose such a position as will make up for the deficiency of men. This position should prevent the enemy from developing any larger force than our own. It should present many obstacles, to make the enemy lose time in trying to surmount them; this time that we gain should be employed in acting against his already engaged, separated, and <pb id="p.82" n="82"/>inferior forces by our superior fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>But we should not choose too strong a position, because the enemy would then try to turn it; and there exists scarcely any position which cannot be turned.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>In general, there is little to be said on purely defensive battles; their whole art consists in making the right use of the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>They can never be decisive, as the only thing we could do would be to repulse the enemy, but not defeat him; they would retard, but never prevent, the final result: the enemy, repulsed on <num value="1">one</num> point, would choose another, and force us to fight in a less favorable position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>Those battles may, however, be advantageously chosen, if their main object is to retard the enemy's progress, and to gain the necessary time for assembling our principal forces on the really decisive point; but then those battles have more the character of a subordinate fight than that of a main action.</p></div3> 
<div3 id="c.4.15" type="section" n="c.4.15"> 
<head>Defensive battles with offensive Returns.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>We are conducted to such battles if the whole nature of the war is defensive for us; if we have been the defensive party in the strategical struggle; or, finally, if we have gained such a strategical victory over the enemy that we oblige him to attack us. The arrangement of defensive battle will always depend more or less on the nature of the ground; by choosing our own ground, we will evidently make the best use of it. The relation between the configuration of the ground and our arrangement will, however, vary much with the object we have in view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/><pb id="p.83" n="83"/></p> 
<p>We may compare the general who fights a defensive battle with offensive return to a swordsman waiting to parry the thrust of his adversary and to follow it by a thrust of his own, or to the more consummate swordsman who feigns to be off his guard in order to induce his adversary to make a certain thrust, which he parries and follows by a deadly blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>This little illustration may be applied in the following manner: <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>To await the enemy's attack in a chosen and strong position; to proceed ourselves to the attack only at the moment he enters our lines or that we have repulsed him. <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>To await the enemy's attack in order to bring his forces in such a relative position to our own that his defeat or his destruction is inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>In this case, we do. not even await his attack, but commence our own as soon as his troops have arrived in the required positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> case, only defeat, in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, total destruction, may be the consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, where the decision takes place, will be in our own lines; in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, it will be in advance of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>The general battle arrangements and orders of battle, as wall as many other considerations, will be the same as those of offensive battles; they will, therefore, be treated in the next chapter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>I will give <num value="2">two</num> examples &mdash; the plans of the battles of <placeName reg="Austerlitz, Lucas, Ohio" key="tgn,2140495">Austerlitz</placeName> and <placeName reg="Talavera de la Reina, Toledo, Castilla-La Mancha" key="tgn,7008710">Talavera</placeName> &mdash; for the better understanding of battles of the offensive defense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>We are conducted to such battles if the nature of the war is aggressive; or if the enemy opposes the attainment of our strategical object; or if we are forced by the manoeuvres of the enemy; and, finally, if by a wrong movement he exposes his army, or parts of it, to certain defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>In an offensive battle <num value="2">two</num> things may occur:--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>That we meet him unexpectedly on the march.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>In the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> case the general dispositions are the same as in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, with the exception that we have no time for making any premeditated arrangements: a few words, therefore, will suffice to explain this <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> case, as all general arrangements will be spoken of in treating of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>The enemy, in finding us unexpectedly in his way, will probably be as much astonished as ourselves; therefore the <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="2">two</num> who acts <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> with the greatest energy and coolness, and, principally, who has studied beforehand the entire configuration of the country, the principal roads, courses of rivers, mountains, distances of villages, extension of woods, etc. etc., and who has chosen the best order for marching and the best roads for the direction of his troops, will have the advantage on his side; he will at once find the important point where to direct his efforts, to concentrate his troops; and, being victorious there, he may attach little importance to secondary points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>In unexpected battles the genius of a general will show itself more than in any other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> case, we suppose that the enemy awaits us in a position chosen by himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>Our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> care should be to <pb id="p.85" n="85"/>obtain a thorough knowledge of the ground, as well as the strength of the enemy's forces and the position they occupy on that ground.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>By what has already been said, it is easy to conclude in what way troops should be disposed for fighting offensively or defensively.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>For an offensive battle, in which we are the attacking party, <hi rend="italics">movement</hi> is the main requisition; therefore the principal mode of formation will be the column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1020"/>A brigade destined to execute an attack would be disposed as shown in Fig. <num value="6">6</num>, Plate <num value="3">III</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1021"/>If the space in which the attack takes place is larger than the front of this brigade, another <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.117" n="117"/>should be disposed, in a similar way, on its side, by alternate masses of battalions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/>Various modes of disposing troops in the attack have been tried &mdash; to advance in line deployed; or to advance <num value="1">one</num> battalion in line deployed, and <num value="1">one</num> battalion on each-wing in columns; or to advance in large columns, like Fig. <num value="13">13</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>All these diverse dispositions are, however, not so practical as that given in Fig. <num value="6">6</num>, which is now generally employed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/>The attack in columns of company is an impossibility as soon as it is executed by more than <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> battalions; and, even then, it should be resorted to only when the ground is too much covered to permit of the action of an entire battalion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/>The attack itself should always be preceded by clouds of skirmishers, to protect the front and flank of the advancing columns; to drive back the skirmishers of the enemy; to prevent them from shooting the officers of the advancing troops; and, arriving near the energy's line, to damage it as much as possible; to direct their fire principally on the officers, and to bring the line in disorder before the shock of the <num value="2">two</num> masses really takes place.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>The improvement in fire-arms generally conducts the men and officers to a desire of prolonging the distant fight; <hi rend="italics">this should be carefully avoided when we act offensively</hi>, as the defending army is mostly favored by the ground it acts on, and naturally wishes a fight, which is never decisive, and in which our loss is probably greater than its own. The relative strength of the combatants remains nearly the same; the decisive moment is retarded or even totally missed, and the loss we sustain in the distant fight is a pure sacrifice of <pb id="p.118" n="118"/>men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>It is not a retreat in good order to which we must force our enemy, but <num value="1">one</num> in disorder, in which we can break or cripple a part of his army with little or no loss to ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>Such a retreat can only be obtained by the struggle at close quarters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>The principal formation for the defense is the deployed line, which may be also arranged in alternate masses of battalions or in echelons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>The last disposition is more solid, especially for a wing which we do not intend to have reinforced, or for which we have only few troops to spare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>Fig. <num value="7">7</num>, Plate <num value="3">III</num>., shows a similar disposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>An advancing enemy is always taken in flank, either by the battery on the extreme wing or by the regiments above or below the <num value="1">one</num> attacked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>The distance between <num value="2">two</num> battalions is generally equal to the front of <num value="1">one</num> of them deployed in line.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>There is <num value="1">one</num> great maxim for every defense, whatever be our disposition, whether in echelons or alternate masses, which is--<hi rend="italics">After having delivered a well-directed volley at short distance, to encounter an advancing enemy by our own advance</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>By acting on this principle, the <rs>English</rs> lines nearly always defeated the <rs>French</rs> columns, during the <name>Peninsular</name> war. The <name>English</name> battalions, disposed in deployed lines of <num value="2">two</num> ranks, were posted <num value="30">thirty</num> to <measure n="40yards" type="distance">forty yards</measure> behind the ridge of steep hills; the columns, arriving breathless on this spot, received <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> a volley at half pistol-shot distance, which laid low nearly the whole of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rank, and were then assailed with the bayonet, and invariably thrown down the hill.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1036"/>When our line of battle is composed of alternate masses <pb id="p.119" n="119"/>of battalions, and if the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line is strongly pressed and obliged to retreat, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line, which always disposed in columns, should advance, and pass the intervals in advancing, and not wait till they are passed by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lire in retreating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/>This is necessary, as well for the order as for the <hi rend="italics">morale</hi> of the troops; and, besides, it has the advantage of permitting our disordered battalions sooner to form again, before the disorder has become too great, and of better checking the advance of the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/>If infantry is obliged to act against cavalry alone, it forms in order of battle; but, instead of disposing in line or column, the battalions are disposed in squares.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1039"/>These can also be formed by an entire brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/>The batteries are generally disposed on the corners of the squares, being their weakest points.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>When cavalry is the fighting troop, we may arrange it in various ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/>It can never act defensively; and even if inferior, and attacked, it must defend itself by attacking.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1043"/>Being easily brought into disorder, it must be arranged in deep order of battle ; when several regiments are united, and have to form in line of battle, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line may be arranged by squadrons deployed in line, as the ravages of artillery are less; the intervals between <num value="2">two</num> regiments are equal to the front of <num value="1">one</num> squadron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/>In the intervals, but <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="500yards" type="distance">five hundred yards</measure> behind, is arranged the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line, either in close column or in columns of squadrons by platoons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/>Fig. <num value="11">11</num>, Plate <num value="3">III</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>Besides this <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line, the reserve is kept in readiness a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> behind it. There exist many other battle arrangements for cavalry; there are <pb id="p.120" n="120"/>now, however, few civilized countries in which large masses of cavalry can act.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>In all cavalry engagements, the party who keeps the best order during the charge will, everything else being equal, be successful; after a charge, the victorious cavalry is in just as much confusion as the defeated; and if, at this moment, it is charged itself, defeat will be sure to follow; besides, charges on the flank of charging cavalry are nearly always attended with success; from this it results that, in cavalry engagements, a rapid <hi rend="italics">coup d'oeil</hi>, by the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs>, is of the greatest importance &mdash; sparing his forces, so as to have the last reserve to give out, and always engaging at the right moment his different squadrons, will assuredly give him the advantage over even a stronger enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/>In acting against infantry formed in squares, it would seem that quickly succeeding charges, but executed each time only with a limited number of men, are more advantageous than those executed by too large a mass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1049"/>The squadrons are then generally disposed in open column or in echelons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1050"/>Fig. <num value="12">12</num>, Plate <num value="3">III</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1051"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="1Squadron">first squadron</orgName> arriving near the infantry deprives it of its fire for the succeeding squadrons; and it is difficult, with the bayonet alone, to prevent cavalry breaking the ranks of infantry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1052"/>However, it must be stated that cavalry should generally only charge infantry in disorder or while marching, as in acting against infantry which is <hi rend="italics">not</hi> so, and which has time to form in squares, its loss is heavy and unnecessary.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1053"/>Artillery never acts alone; it is always accompanied by <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="2">two</num> other arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1055"/>Against deployed lines, shrapnel and canister, and against columns, shrapnel and shot are the most advantageous.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1056"/>Rifled guns commence firing sooner; the projectiles used are shells, shrapnels, and canister, the last only at short distances.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/>When acting against artillery of the enemy, our batteries should be disposed so as to take his batteries <hi rend="italics">en echarpe</hi>, or to place them in a concentric fire.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/>Each fight, when not intended to surprise the enemy, has an introduction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1082"/>In placing our army in the position M N, we cannot march at once to M <quote> N</quote> ; we do not know exactly the enemy's position, neither do we know the strength of his forces; we must <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> see if it be prudent to engage in a fight, and if we may be aggressive, or if, by the superiority of the enemy, we would become defensive.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/>From the columns of march we must arrange our army in line of battle; we must reconnoiter the ground, and find out the best points of attack; all this takes a certain time, and is therefore called the <name>Introduction</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/>Our army arrived at long cannon ranges, we put some of our batteries in position, and open a slow and measured fire ; we send our skirmishers in advance to scour and clear the ground we wish to occupy; we send also some detachments of cavalry as far as the enemy's <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line of battle, to reconnoiter his position and strength.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/>The enemy will probably answer our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> proceedings in a similar way; in the mean time our army draws near, and arrives at really effective cannon ranges, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> period gradually passes to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>. </p> 
<p rend="rend=center">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/><hi rend="italics">Advance and Preparation</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>In consequence of the counter disposition of the enemy, as well as the information received from our reconnoitering parties, we have been able to form an idea of his arrangements <pb id="p.124" n="124"/>and his strength; we have seen and reflected; we must now begin to act.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>We have chosen our points of attack; and it is there we must proceed against the enemy, and drive him from his position.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>The advance of our troops, however, must be prepared; our batteries must be put in position, with orders to keep up a continuous fire; our skirmishers must advance by degrees, and we must drive the enemy from any post he has taken in advance of his whole line of battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>Artillery plays the principal role in this period of the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>The few batteries we have already placed in line should multiply themselves by their great energy and by their quick and rapid manoeuvres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>They should act by whole batteries, and not by sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>Their duty is to find out the points where they can do the enemy the greatest damage, drawing near his battalions, delivering a short and well-directed fire, changing their position to act against another battalion, appearing where the enemy least expects them, where his battalions, behind cover, thought themselves well screened, disappearing before the enemy can make any attempt to drive them away, reappearing to spread disorder and loss in another direction, directing an overwhelming fire of shells and shrapnels against the astonished enemy, and spreading fear and terror through his whole line of battle,--this is the way artillery should act. Only light rifled guns, as now employed in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, can accomplish such work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>In this period, artillery has principally to fire against <pb id="p.125" n="125"/>the enemy's cavalry and infantry; if, however, <num value="2">two</num> of our batteries can unite their efforts, they may by their superiority silence <num value="1">one</num> of the enemy's batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>To do this, they should advance in echelons by sections; some of the guns should fire shrapnels, to prevent a quick serving of the enemy's battery, and the others should try to dismount some of his guns by continually directing their united efforts on <num value="1">one</num> gun; if they succeed in dismounting this, they should then proceed to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/>They should, in this operation, take such positions that their fire is concentric; at the same time that <num value="1">one</num> battery fires at the enemy in front the other should rake him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/>The last is preferable, as the column, being once stopped and deployed, cannot be easily formed again; besides, the men, once in motion, and excited by the whole scene around them, are much more fit for dealing blows than for cool shooting; and finally, besides all this, the enemy might just choose <pb id="p.127" n="127"/>the moment we are deploying to fall himself on us.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1132"/>The fight, as described, generally takes place when well-disciplined troops are opposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/>It is not necessary to say that our whole disposition, and the time of the <num value="4">four</num> different periods, should differ according to the importance of the attack or to the character of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1134"/>To deal with <placeName key="tgn,7005560" n="1.000 10" reg="Mexico,North and Central America">Mexican</placeName> or Neapolitan soldiers, we need not pay much attention as regards introduction and preparation; the more boldly we act the greater will be the success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1135"/>I was told by an eye-witness of the battle of the <name>Volturno</name>, in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, that a band of <name>English</name> sailors belonging to a British man-of-war, having leave to go ashore, were present to see the light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1136"/>Carried away by the excitement of the whole scene around them, they advanced and found themselves at once in the vicinity of a Neapolitan battery, just commencing its fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1137"/>With <num value="1">one</num> impulse the unarmed <name>English</name> tars rushed to the battery, stormed it, and drove away the cannoneers; at the same moment the battalion for the cover of the battery advanced to attack them with the bayonet, but the battalion shared the same fate as the cannoneers &mdash; they were literally boxed out of the battery, which then turned its fire on its proper owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1138"/>Any ammunition spent against such soldiers would evidently be a loss; the bayonet and sword are quite sufficient to settle every difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1139"/>Besides the character, the strength of the enemy opposed to us, as well as the importance of the point of attack, will <figure id="fig.130">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1188"/>In the attack of intrenched camps, or of field-works in general, we cannot proceed as we do against an army in open field; the enemy is more protected from our fire by the epaulement; and our advance, or rather our closing with him, is rendered difficult by the ditch; besides, in the advance, we are too much exposed to his fire, without being able to return it. On the other hand, the defender of an intrenched camp or redoubt cannot deploy great forces, and cannot himself pass to the offensive at the right moment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1189"/>These different circumstances should tell us how to conduct the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1190"/>A converging and overwhelming fire of shells should be directed on <num value="1">one</num> point &mdash; if possible, against a corner of the intrenchment &mdash; to dismount the artillery of defense, to bring the troops in disorder, and to hinder the disposal of a strong reserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1191"/>Heavy masses of skirmishers should advance also in a converging manner against that same point; and small columns of assault should be kept in readiness, but sheltered as much as possible up to the last moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1192"/>If the ditch is deep &mdash; a serious obstacle to the passage of the troops &mdash; every skirmisher, before commencing to fight, should be provided with a fagot, to roll before him, and to serve him, at the same time, as cover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1193"/>Arrived at the ditch, this should be filled up with those fagots, and the columns which are kept ready should pass immediately to the assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1194"/>If the epaulement is steep, the <pb id="p.135" n="135"/>storming column should be provided with ladders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1195"/>If the redoubts are open behind, cavalry should charge and enter them by the gorge, while the infantry attacks in front, and by this facilitate the action of the storming columns.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1196"/>In general, it may be said that troops and their commanders who seek safety in intrenched positions, instead of giving open battle, are already half defeated, as they evidently give up all idea of offensive movements, and must quietly await the counter dispositions of the attacking and stronger enemy. </p></div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1467"/>The arrangements for a retreating army belong more to logistics than to tactics; and to well understand them, it is necessary <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to read the chapter on logistics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1468"/>I will only give the principal moments, and the rest will be found in the next chapter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1469"/>So long as a retreating army is not pursued, its march offers nothing particular; but from the moment the enemy is in pursuit, the question changes entirely; and it becomes most difficult after a lost battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1470"/>Small armies, in which disorder can never be so very great, should try to evade pursuit by forced or night marches; but with large armies this is impossible &mdash; a slow and well-ordered retreat must be executed, with strong rear guards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1471"/>The service of the latter being very difficult, they are relieved every <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>; that is, the main body, arrived at a favorable place for defense, leaves a number of troops equal to the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName>; these form in line of battle, and receive the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName>, which now retreats, and joins the main body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1472"/>The new <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> arrests as long as possible the progress of the enemy's advanced guard, and then begins its own retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1473"/>In large armies, the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> is generally composed <pb id="p.165" n="165"/>of a whole <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1474"/>In most cases, it amounts to <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the entire force.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1475"/>As regards the disposition of the retreating columns, there are several: We may march our whole army on <num value="1">one</num> road and in <num value="1">one</num> mass, or on <num value="1">one</num> road but in several columns, separated by <num value="1">one</num> or several days' march; or we may retreat on several parallel roads, or on divergent or concentric lines.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1476"/>Retreats on divergent lines are to be rejected; those on concentric ones, to be recommended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1477"/>As regards the <num value="3">three</num> other modes, we can only say this &mdash; that, in the march for retreat as well as in that for advance, our army must be always so arranged that it can form from the marching order as quickly as possible in line of battle, or at least be able to bring, in a fight, at the same time as the enemy, a force equal to his own.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1478"/>If the enemy pursues us having his army formed in <num value="1">one</num> long column on <num value="1">one</num> road, we might retreat in a similar way, or even in leaving a space of from <num value="0.5">one-half</num> to <num value="1">one</num> day's march between the columns, to prevent the incumbrance of the roads.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1479"/>Retreats in <num value="1">one</num> column have the great disadvantage of leading us very easily into difficulties by the incumbrance of the roads, which occasions the stopping of the whole army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1480"/>If the enemy pursues us disposed in several columns marching parallel, we would be obliged to do the same, as, by not doing so, our <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> would risk being separated from the army by the flank columns of the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1481"/>Finally, if pursued on our flank, our arrangements must be similar to a flank march, the disposition of which is given under Logistics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1482"/><pb id="p.166" n="166"/></p> 
<p>The <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName>, according to its importance, should be several miles to half a day's march from the main army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1483"/>The <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> should be most intrepid and enterprising, and at the same time cool and steady.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1484"/>He should more often and more impetuously attack the advanced guard of the pursuing enemy than allow himself to be attacked; this sustains the <hi rend="italics">morale</hi> of the troops, and renders the enemy slower and less bold in his pursuit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1485"/>On the other hand, the pursuit should be conducted with the greatest energy and most unceasing activity, so as not to give the retreating army time to form again and reorganize.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1486"/>Pursuits on the flank, if in our own country, are more advantageous than those in the rear, as they enable the pursuing army to prevent the retreat at the passage of a river or at any place it chooses to do so.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1500"/>The <name>English</name> armies in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are a proof of this, and the <name>Peninsular</name> war might likewise serve as an example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1502"/>The <rs>English</rs> could never have succeeded in conquering the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>, had they not been assisted by the population of the whole country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1503"/>Expeditions with a restricted object, but still of a certain extent, are scarcely ever attended with the results we anticipate; or, at least, what we obtain by them is seldom an equivalent for the cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1504"/>Examples of this are the <orgName n="English expedition" type="expedition">English expedition</orgName> to <persName n="Antwerp,,,,," id="n0052.0010.00168.00284" reg="mostcommon:Antwerp,nomatch:0"><surname>Antwerp</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></dateStruct>, and the great expedition to the <name>Crimea</name> in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1505"/>To understand this, the reader must be well impressed with the principles of strategy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1506"/>An expedition is nothing else than a large detachment, or a division of our force separated from us by exterior lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1507"/>If this detachment has a light task only to perform &mdash; such as the burning of undefended or slightly defended magazines, depots, and towns, or the destruction of some coast batteries, etc.--it is, in most cases, successful; that is, if the arrangements have been well planned, and the secret of the expedition well kept.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1508"/>In these cases, the means are small, and no great preparation necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1509"/>If, on the contrary, the detachment has a certain role to play &mdash; such as acting against the enemy's rear, to force him to make detachments, to take possession of places, and, in <num value="1">one</num> word, after its disembarkation, to execute an offensive operation in the country-its task becomes difficult.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1510"/>These operations are then generally successful at the commencement, because the enemy is unable to have strong forces on every point of his coast; but, knowing once the point attacked, he can easily concentrate greater forces, and not only defeat, but utterly destroy these detachments as soon as they leave the protection of their ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1511"/><pb id="p.169" n="169"/></p> 
<p>In expeditions serving only as diversions, it would be much better to have but <num value="1">one</num> detachment, which is quickly transported from <num value="1">one</num> place to another, making descents near the larger towns, forcing them to pay contributions, and thereby obliging the enemy to a large display of force on his coasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1512"/>Those troops are lost to him; he cannot make any use of them, in the continual expectation of being attacked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1513"/>On the other hand, we oppose to all his forces only that <num value="1">one</num>, but continually changing detachment, which descends every-where, excepting on or near the point where the enemy awaits it. In such a way more is gained than by half a dozen expeditions, which would only conduct us to a division of our own forces, and draw them from the decisive point.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1514"/>The tactical arrangements for a descent are very similar to those for the passage of a river.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1515"/>We must distinguish the case of the descent being opposed or not. In the last case, speed is the principal requisition; the troops should disembark as quickly as possible, before the enemy can appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1516"/>The vessels of war which accompany these expeditions should be disposed on the right and left sides of the descending troops, so as to sweep the country with their heavy guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1517"/>Necks of land entering the sea are most favorable for the disembarkation, as they permit of a concentric fire from the ships, and the possibility of arranging the troops in good order before advancing, and their retreat in the same space covered by their ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1518"/>It is exactly the same as a river forming a curve.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1519"/>If the descent is to be made on a part where the enemy is in force, it is necessary to deceive him on the real point, to draw his forces in another direction, by making feigned <pb id="p.170" n="170"/>attacks, and by bringing the ships of transport in the night near the chosen point of descent, which should be made at daybreak.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1520"/>All the large boats should be provided with boat howitzers, similar to those of <persName n="Dahlgren,Captain,,,," id="n0052.0010.00170.00285" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName>, for instance, which are of an excellent pattern; they should be landed, and immediately serve as artillery to the troops going on shore, until their own <orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">field artillery</orgName> is landed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1521"/>The disembarkation should be well flanked by the ships of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1522"/>As soon as a sufficient number of troops is assembled, and if the enemy has been totally deceived as to the point of attack, they should advance, without losing time, against the rear or flank of the enemy, who is not prepared for such an attack.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1523"/>If the landing is only slightly opposed, the troops should also advance as soon as possible to hinder the enemy assembling in too great force to prevent or endanger the disembarkation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1524"/>Islands near the main land are very favorable for descents, as the enemy has great difficulty to sustain his force placed there; and, once gained, they offer us a secure base for further operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1525"/>As soon as the descent has been made, field-works should be raised to serve as a sort of tete-de-pont.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1526"/>These works should be large enough to hold the greater parts of the troops from the expedition; the depots and magazines should also be established there; they should be situated so as to cover the ships, and enable the troops to re-embark at any moment and in any kind of weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1527"/>The fortifications form the base of operation for the landed troops.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1533"/>A few words on the defense may find their place here.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/>It is seldom possible to effectually oppose a descent; but <pb id="p.172" n="172"/>when accomplished, the disembarking corps should be crushed by superior armies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/>The most certain way would be to oppose it but little; to leave a corps of observation at the point of descent, which retreats before the corps of the expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/>But as soon as it is at a certain distance from its base, it should be attacked by very superior forces, and by means of tactical manoeuvres be entirely separated from its base.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/>In trying to cut off its line of retreat by strategical manoeuvres, the corps we intend to act against might be informed in time of our movements, and quickly retreat to its base; we would then gain nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>The result of a fight in which the corps is outflanked and turned by a superior force is, therefore, to be preferred.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>The corps of observation left opposed to the expedition should throw up some field-works in opposition to those of the latter, so as to render its advance, at least, not entirely without danger.
