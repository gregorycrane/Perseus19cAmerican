<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>Sometimes the ancient worthies took snuff; we find a few grains between the leaves of their books, and often the sand from the sand box glistens in the light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>We have never seen this but once, on the occasion of a <orgName n="Sunday School" type="school">Sunday-school</orgName> picnic, and were then told its story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>On such occasions, stories told should be truthful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>As we recollect it, the monument was about <measure n="2.5feet" type="distance">two and a half feet</measure> high, and had an inscription of a few words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>Truly a tragic affair must it have been, and sorrow in the extreme must have filled the hearts of all his family and friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>We will now tell the tale as we heard it years ago on the spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>In those old days there used to be a hotel called the <rs type="place">Spot Pond House</rs> near the boundary line of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 12" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2050706" n="1.000 16" reg="stoneham, middlesex county, massachusetts">Stoneham</placeName>, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> respectable in character, and for the accommodation of travellers on the old <address><street n="Andover turnpike">Andover turnpike</street></address>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>His boon companions thought it appropriate to mark the spot for future remembrance, and so set up the marker with the truthful inscription, <q direct="unspecified">Here Shute Fell.</q>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>It is built of structural steel bolted together, braced diagonally in all directions, and rests in a concrete base a foot in thickness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>The stability of this lofty and slender tower depends entirely upon the series of guys that are attached thereto at various intervals in its height, and which reach back to anchorages of concrete embedded in the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1320"/>This increase of subscription price is absolutely necessary, as during its entire history its publication has been at a deficit that in some way had to be met from the treasury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1321"/>Increased expenses in the management of the <name>Society</name> preclude such payment further, and the consensus of opinion is, that the publication must continue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1322"/>Notice of the advance was immediately sent to all subscribers, and the renewal coupons already received indicate their interest in our work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1323"/>A little earnest effort on the part of all our members just now will put the register on a secure business foundation and be an encouragement to the contributors to its pages to do more and better work (if that be possible) in the future.
