<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Nothing could have been further from the minds of that household than that in the future that baby, when grown to manhood, was to stand before a Medford audience of <placeName>Medford</placeName> people and submit for consideration a paper on their <q direct="unspecified"><persName><roleName n="Brother">Brother</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName></persName>,</q> for that was the way he was always addressed, in the delightfully formal manner characteristic of their home life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>When the educational revival had been in progress for <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure>, and teachers and educators had appreciated the magnificence of the undertaking, it seemed to them to be well to hold a meeting at which the historical features might be treated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>He began the book as a <q direct="unspecified"><address><street n="Common place">Common place</street></address> Book,</q> using <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> it for sundry scraps and clippings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Later, some of these earlier scraps were covered with others of later date.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>In addition, there is the usual miscellaneous assortment of scraps having no connection with each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Whatever he wrote that had appeared in the papers he has preserved, also, any mention of him was duly clipped and inserted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>There are some family scraps, tax bills, etc. Here is a bill rendered his great great grandfather, <persName n="Reeve,,Cochran,,," id="n0334.0002.00004.00017" reg="default:Reeve,Cochran,,,"><foreName>Cochran</foreName> <surname>Reeve</surname></persName>, in <dateStruct value="1738--"><year reg="1738">1738</year></dateStruct>, for expenses on account of a slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The items are specified as freight, nursing, and a coffin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The jailors's bill had not been received, so that could not be included.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>But for our present purpose we find many clippings which will be referred to from time to time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>It is a strange sensation to study, not to glance hastily, but to study a scrap-book, especially such a personal <num value="1">one</num> as this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>In our own experience we find ourselves at times perplexed as to why we preserved some clipping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>It was probably <persName n="Brooks,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00004.00018" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Charles,,,"><surname>Brooks</surname></persName>' experience as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>And yet, after reading what he said about the <q direct="unspecified">educational antiquary,</q> <num value="1">one</num> is struck with these lines, pasted just below his printed signature on a circular regarding the <rs>Clergyman</rs>'s <orgName n="Aid Society" type="society">Aid Society</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>It seems as if he may have again been looking into the future.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>But later he wrote these lines, when he was in a reminiscent mood, and dated them <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>. <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The question arose as to how fully these clippings represented the newspaper accounts of <persName n="Brooks,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00005.00019" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Charles,,,"><surname>Brooks</surname></persName>' work, and so it seemed well to examine a file of a cotemporary newspaper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The <placeName reg="Hingham, Plymouth, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049904">Hingham</placeName> paper was selected, as that was the paper of his town, and the result showed that <persName n="Brooks,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00005.00020" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Charles,,,"><surname>Brooks</surname></persName> clipped and preserved in the scrap-book practically all the references to himself that appeared in the paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/><persName n="Brooks,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0002.00005.00021" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName> relied on the press for much help during his active work, but the methods of that day were much different from those of ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>There was not the appeal to the interest of all classes and conditions of men; the reading public seems to have been limited in numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>But there have been many changes in thought and life during the <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure> that have elapsed since <persName n="Brooks,,Charles,,," id="n0334.0002.00005.00022" reg="default:Brooks,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName> was doing his grand work of bringing to the common people of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> a remedy for their great needs, and these changes must be considered before taking up directly what <persName n="Brooks,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00005.00023" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Charles,,,"><surname>Brooks</surname></persName> did.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>For instance, in the &apos;30s an assemblage of the gentle sex was denominated a company of females.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>To this appellation some bright mind would venture a protest, but the custom was too firmly established to be set aside because some lone <q direct="unspecified">female</q> objected.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Again, suppose it were now printed on a notice that <orgName n="Harvard College" type="college">Harvard College</orgName> sent to members of a committee, announcing that a meeting would be held, <q direct="unspecified">Gentlemen will please to select their own method of conveyance and charge the expense to the <rs type="place">University</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Such a note <persName n="Brooks,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0002.00005.00024" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName> received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>When <num value="1">one</num> sees it he wonders how many different methods there were for reaching <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, which was the most used, and what was the expenditure of time and money.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Or again, what is there in the statement, <q direct="unspecified">As is the teacher, so is the school,</q> that endangers the established order, or that is revolutionary in its character?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Any man who would now hesitate to subscribe to that statement, <q direct="unspecified">As is the teacher, so is the school,</q> would find <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> it difficult to get a hearing for his doubts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Yet it was to impress this truth on the thinking and acting minds of his day that <persName n="Brooks,,Charles,,," id="n0334.0002.00006.00025" reg="default:Brooks,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName> gave unsparingly of his time, his money, and his strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>If it were not for these changes in thought and life, it would suffice to read the <name>Framingham</name> address, which in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct> <persName n="Brooks,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00006.00026" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Charles,,,"><surname>Brooks</surname></persName> delivered on his work, its methods, and results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>It is written in his characteristic style, simple, frank, and attractive, but unless <num value="1">one</num> can get at the general thought of the time, the difficulties, the obstacles, the discouragements, and the triumphs, the address, if read without comment, would serve to arouse, but not to satisfy, inquiry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>To meet this inquiry, to supply some comment, and to define <persName n="Brooks,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00006.00027" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Charles,,,"><surname>Brooks</surname></persName>' part in the great educational revival, is the purpose of this paper.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>If we briefly summarize what <persName n="Brooks,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0002.00006.00028" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName>' life had been prior to undertaking this work, we may be able to form a better conception of his personality, for this attractive personality was a predominating feature in his success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Few of those who knew him now remain, except such as knew him in his later years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>It has been interesting to record the epithets these use in describing him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>As the story of his work is told, we shall be able to see reasons for using words descriptive of deeper, stronger, and more abiding traits of character which will be discerned on a closer acquaintance.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1294"/>My own cross of crosses,&mdash;as I hold myself to be by nature an indolent, good-natured person, too easy to cotton to fault-finding,&mdash;is the finding myself absolutely compelled either to hoodwink my moral sense of right and wrong, or to withdraw esteem and fellowship from old familiar acquaintances, friends even, in the common acceptation of the term.
