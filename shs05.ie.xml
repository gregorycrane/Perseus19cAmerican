<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>The following splendid oration treats mainly of <hi rend="italics">post bellum</hi> history; but this is a period of great importance as exhibiting the <hi rend="italics">fruits</hi> of the doctrines of the <rs>Federal</rs> war-party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>The distinguished orator has given a picture of the violation of the peace of &lsquo;<num value="65">65</num>, and the war upon the <rs>Constitution</rs> made by the <name>Radical</name> party, which should be widely read, and most carefully preserved as material for the future historian.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>The efforts of the <orgName n="Southern Historical Society" type="society">Southern Historical Society</orgName> have been most appropriately directed to the collection of facts relating to the period of actual and open war from <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>That field is yet but slightly gleaned, and it is indispensable that this generation of Southern men should gather all its sad truths and preserve them until a later period, when, in a cloudless atmostphere, the patient and impartial philosopher shall be able to place facts and deductions side by side, and do justice to the people of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>In the future our historical records will probably abound with success and prosperity, which the world takes for the measure of high qualities and great deservings, and we shall not then need that any should vindicate us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>It is our duty, also, to consider well the turning point in our destiny which we have just past, so that the future &mdash; that now is dawning so auspiciously-shall not become darker than the past, through a mistake of the facts or principles on which our hopes are rested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>The present is, perhaps, the most important period of our history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>I have selected the events now occurring as the truest interpreters of the past, as they seem to furnish also the most certain indications of the future of our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/><pb id="p.2" n="2"/></p> 
<p>The causes that have made it necessary to compile a separate history of the <rs>Southern States</rs> had their origin in differences of opinion reaching back to <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>These differences seem to have ended in <dateStruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>They were always political-relating to constructions of the <rs>Constitution</rs> as applied to different measures that have been proposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>They never resulted from natural causes, such as give rise to the quarrels of different nations or races of men, except so far as they related to <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>They only became sectional when the measures which excited the discussion happened to affect a particular section of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>In <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></dateStruct> some of the <name>States</name> of the <rs>North</rs> strongly threatened to secede from the <rs>Union</rs>, which then implied a desire to return to their former allegiance to the <rs>British Crown</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>In <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></dateStruct> there was manifested an almost fatal purpose in some of the <name>States</name> to assert the right to remain in the <rs>Union</rs> and set at defiance some of the laws which, though constitutional in form, were alleged to be locally oppressive.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>In <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, the question of slavery furnished the occasion or provocation under which this ancient quarrel culminated in open war. While the question thus presented involved great political issues, it also included the dangerous element of race antagonism and race supremacy, and involved the accumulated wealth of <measure n="2centuries" type="date">two centuries</measure> invested by the <rs>South</rs> in slave property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It is scarcely conceivable that any free Government could have afforded a peaceful solution of such a question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Until the strife of contention over the powers and principles of our Federal Government connected itself with this question and threatened the extermination of slavery, there had been no occasion of sufficient magnitude to demand its solution with war. That question was local and sectional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It had hold of every sentiment and interest and prejudice, and involved every ground of former differences of opinion as to the construction of the <rs>Constitution</rs> that could excite, arouse, and make desperate the contending parties.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The absolute right of home rule as to slavery, in its ownership and control, was alleged by <num value="1">one</num> party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The other party &mdash; the <name>Abolitionists</name> &mdash; denied this right, claiming that a law higher than the <rs>Constitution</rs> condemned slavery and everything that upheld it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>In the excitement of this controversy, and because of the political power this party embodied, others who denied the political propositions on which the <orgName n="Abolition party" type="party">Abolition party</orgName> was based followed its lead, believing that it was safer to violate the <rs>Constitution</rs> than to lose power, and hoping that the expurgation of slavery from the country would condone their delinquency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>They followed the lead of the <name>Abolitionists</name>, denying even their purpose to abolish slavery until after it was destroyed, and then they avowed it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Their denials were merely protests against the doctrines of the <quote>higher law</quote> party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>They really desired that slavery should be extirpated, but <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> could not admit that the <rs>Federal</rs> power reached the subject even in States that were in rebellion, as they saw fit to designate the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Still they kept in line with the dominant and aggressive power, and contented themselves with gentle protests against the destruction of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The old question, which in fact led to the war &mdash; the question of the right, of local self-government in the <name>States</name>, which was the substantial political issue between the <name>Abolitionists</name> and the <name>States</name> of the <rs>South</rs>--was for a time silenced in the tempest of war. It slept until slavery was destroyed, and then arose again, when it was attempted to destroy the <name>States</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><num value="1000">Thousands</num> of men engaged in the destruction of slavery, and, having that for the purpose of every blow they struck, were assisted by tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num> who fought to save the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">Union of the States</orgName>, leaving the question of the rights and powers of the <rs>State</rs> and Federal governments, which led the <rs>South</rs> to secession, undecided by the results of the war. All these are free now as they were before the war to assert or to deny that the <name>States</name> have still the right of local self-government, and some of them deny it, while others admit the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It may be safely said, in <dateStruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></dateStruct>, that this question will never again result in war. It has become impossible to excite the country to war upon sectional divisions, because there remain no questions of material interest upon which they can divide by lines of latitude or longitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>All sectional controversies being removed from the domain of discussion, whatever affects <num value="1">one</num> State in like manner affects all the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>If <num value="1">one</num> is wounded in its rights, all suffer alike, if not equally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The turning point in the destiny of the <rs>South</rs> that has been reached in <dateStruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></dateStruct> is the final practical restoration to the <name>States</name> of the right of local self-government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It was for this that the people of the <rs>South</rs> fought in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>; for this they suffered <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> of terrible persecution, from <dateStruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></dateStruct>; and it is with this right firmly secured that they are content.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>This is the end of a period of trials and suffering in which we have been exposed to the danger of the total subversion of our State governments, and with them to the loss of all substantial guaranties of our personal rights and liberties.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It is the beginning of an era of peace, which is the result of the failure of a pernicious effort to subordinate the <name>States</name> to the absolute will of Congress.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The political forces that have so long acted with repressive power upon the <name>States</name> have ceased, and they rise again with restorative and compensatory energy to their former dignity and influence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>In this year those institutions of government which we have been so proud to call American reached their lowest depression in the respect of mankind; and with quick and safe reaction they have regained their lost <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> ground and have become a pattern for the nations of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Our people of all sections and all parties have shown that they are fully capable of exercising with wisdom and prudence the vast powers which reside in them under our free system of government, so that the most violent storms of popular excitement shall not destroy it, or defeat the ultimate power of the law.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>When <num value="40000000">forty millions</num> of people, with <num value="10000000">ten millions</num> of voters, raise themselves above the atmosphere of hot and bitter recrimination engendered by a terrible civil war, and, forgetting party ties and prejudices, and overlooking insults and injuries which affect their keenest sensibilities, declare for the <rs>Constitution</rs> as the inviolable rule of government in all public administration and as the security of every private right, the world may again confidently believe that all enlightened races are capable of self-government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Until <dateStruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></dateStruct> it was supposed that it was impossible that there could be evolved through our political system a greater or more disastrous evil than our great civil war. But this opinion has been disproved by subsequent events.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>When that war closed faith and confidence between the real belligerents was immediately restored, so that the soldiers of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> were disbanded on the field of battle and discharged from every restraint that did not apply to every citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>But <num value="1">one</num> right, which had been the subject of controversy before and during the war, was destroyed &mdash; the right of property in slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>This was not destroyed by actual agreement, but was left to a tacit understanding, which was afterwards confirmed by the formal consent of the <rs>Southern States</rs> and people, acting as a free people, under the forms of law and through solemn constitutional ordinances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>In this action several of the <name>States</name> even anticipated the propositions of Congress to add the <num value="13" type="ordinal">thirteenth</num> amendment to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>This is all that we yielded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Of course the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> perished in the war, but the government of the <name>States</name> that composed the <name>Confederation</name> remained as if the war had never been waged, as to their rights and powers of home-rule.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>It was not through the magnanimity of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> that the <rs>Southern States</rs> were restored to these rights and powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>This is a common but most mistaken view of the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> has always held that we could neither forfeit nor abandon the rights and duties of the <name>States</name>--that ours is an imperishable union of indestructible States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>It was the only avowed purpose of the war to restore the seceding States to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>This could not be done by destroying their autonomy as States of the <rs>Union-States</rs> like the others, and with equal powers and privileges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>There can be no conquered States <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> in the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>When conquered they become provinces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>If we had come back by compulsion as conquered States, the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">Union of States</orgName> could not have been restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>It was a result of the war, as binding on the <rs>Federal Government</rs> as on the seceding States, that when they returned to the <rs>Union</rs> they should come back to the same position they had attempted to resign.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>When this result was achieved, and the <rs>Union</rs> was re-established by war, and was found to be perfect in every respect, as it had been before the war, without a State missing or destroyed, or impaired in its rights, a great pledge was maintained, a great victory had been gained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>A restoration had been accomplished which aroused the triumphant enthusiasm of those who believed that they had saved the <rs>Union</rs>, and left a lighter burden of regret upon the hearts of the vanquished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The States came forth from the hideous night of civil war, as the stars appear after the storms have swept the heavens.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The admiration of the civilized nations of the world was excited to the highest degree at the inherent power and indestructibilty of our free constitutional Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>When it was rent with the secession of nearly half of its entire territory, strained to the uttermost in every possible resource, with more dead and wounded fallen from the ranks of its armies than the entire number of its armed foes, the monarchical powers recalled a jeering prophecy of a <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure> ago. But when peace was restored, and they saw it readjusting the nice and delicate relations between States and people, so that not a flaw or blemish or imperfection was discernible, not a scar was seen on the body politic, they felt that their prophecy had been unjust towards the <num value="1000000">millions</num> of our race, who have for so many centuries aspired to the blessings of liberty regulated by constitutional law. And when they saw it at last rising proudly from the struggle, strengthened by its trials and ennobled and purified by its efforts to preserve its organism in the exact form and proportions in which our fathers had given it to the people, they realized a fact, that was not too dearly established even through the horrors of civil war, that constitutional liberty based on the sovereignty of the people, is a stronger and more enduring power than any royal dynasty, or any form of monarchical government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Those who were vanquished had always believed that this form of government was the best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>When they separated from the other States they adopted the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, without any essential change of its form or principles, as their plan of government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Although they had seceded from the <rs>Union</rs> they proved, by their adoption of this form of government, that their quarrel had not been with the <rs>Constitution</rs> or the form of our Government, but with a system of constructions which they believed were subversive of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Measures had <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> been enacted and others had been forecast in the final decrees of the ballot-box, which the <rs>Southern</rs> people believed to be wholly unjust and unconstitutional.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>When these measures were carried by force of arms, and had become by tacit or express recognition the law of the land, and when the <name>States</name> of the <rs>South</rs> were again restored to the <rs>Union</rs>, the people still believed that the old Constitution, as it was at the close of the war, was fully adequate to the protection of every remaining right.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>This was an honest and hearty belief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>They realized the fact that slavery had met its fated hour in the united judgment of the civilized nations of the white race, and that it was necessary and even better to yield it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>They felt that they could not afford to remain in relations with the white people of the earth which involved their censure, however unmerited, and kept them always embroiled, even with their kindred in their own country, in defending their rights.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>They returned with alacrity, and not with the sullen reluctance of a conquered people, to their allegiance to a restored <orgName n="Constitutional Union" type="union">constitutional Union</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The Constitution remained in its full unbroken efficiency to protect every right except that <num value="1">one</num> which had perished in the conflict of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>So the matter was received and understood by the people of the <name>Sonth</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>After they had done all that required by duty and honor to defend the right which they at last yielded; when they felt that greater sacrifices were not required for that cause, even though it involved more than half of all their property, their reunion with the <name>States</name> of the <rs>North</rs>, under the flag and Constitution of a common country, was a grateful result to them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>For a period of nearly <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> the peace of <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct> remained almost unbroken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>So far as the <rs>South</rs> was concerned, it was kept in good faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>They considered it as a real and faithful peace.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>It is true that unconstitutional taxes were levied upon their productions; confiscators and plunderers took their property by force, and after having consumed the greater part in their charges for the robbery, paid the residue into the <orgName n="U. S. Treasury" type="org">United States treasury</orgName>, where it has been set aside by subsequent laws as a conscience fund.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Many wrongs that sorely tried the people were inflicted upon them merely because they were powerless; but these things did not drive them from the line of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>They kept faith with the entire country; they kept peace within their own borders; they respected, obeyed, and enforced the laws; they amended their constitutions so as to make them conform to the results of the war; and a prosperity attended their labors which proved that no calamity and no misrule could deprive the beautiful land of the <rs>South</rs> of its sceptre as the queen of the commerce of this hemisphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/><pb id="p.7" n="7"/></p> 
<p>But this peace was afterwards rudely and unnecessarily broken through the wicked ambition of men who had no honorable agency in the great war, and great capitulation, which had resulted in peace in <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>In <dateStruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></dateStruct> Congress broke the treaty made by the armies at the surrender, without just cause or reasonable excuse.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The peace of <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct> was not made by treaty between belligerent nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> Government was destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>It was not made between the <name>States</name> because, under the <rs>Constitution</rs> they could not be recognized individually, and as to each other, as beligerents, or in any respect as powers foreign to the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The treaty, if it may be called such, was made by terms of capitulation between the <num value="2">two</num> armies in the field, and was ratified in the parole of every Confederate soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Thus the most sacred of all the engagements of public faith was made a matter of personal agreement between the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and the soldiers of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>When <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0040.0002.00007.00004" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,:13"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> and <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0040.0002.00007.00005" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,William,Preston,,:9"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> surrendered their armies they did not consent to impose upon them conditions of civil inferiority when they should return to their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>They would never have surrendered upon such terms.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Never was the honor of a country more bound up in any treaty, and never was public faith more unjustly disregarded, than it was when the government that received these paroles afterwards disregarded them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>The <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName>, under its power to make war, and with the army under its control-made subject to its command by a flagrant invasion of the prerogatives of the President-resumed hostilities against the people of the <name>States</name> that had been engaged in the war of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>While the <rs>President</rs> was extending the pardoning power to the relief of almost every person in the <rs>South</rs> from all the consequences of the alleged rebellion of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, Congress was engaged in a new declaration of war based upon these pardoned offences.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>The war of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> had been a war of restoration of the <rs>Union</rs> and of the supremacy of the <rs>Federal</rs> laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>The war of <dateStruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></dateStruct> was waged for conquest, subjugation, and spoils.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>Then began the <measure n="9years" type="date">nine years</measure> war of reconstruction, that was separated from the <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> war of restoration by nearly <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>A peace which was only interrupted by the complainings of the people, mingled with the beastly exultations of the plunderers &mdash; as the great and silent deserts are sometimes awakened in the night by the cries of the jackalls mingled with the plaintive calls of their victims that have wandered from the caravans.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>It is true that in the <rs>South</rs>, as in the <rs>North</rs>, there was a strong sense of antagonism and resentment between the people after the war, but it was less aggravated from <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></dateStruct>, than it was from thence to <dateStruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>The war of reconstruction was a dishonorable oppression for an unworthy cause; and it was condemned accordingly in the hearts of good men of all sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>But those who fought to preserve the <rs>Union</rs> and not to destroy the <name>States</name> have, for the <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> past, been cast down with shame and grief because <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> the condition of the country had made it possible that such a war could be waged for such a cause and against a people so helpless and unoffending.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>The real purpose of the war of <dateStruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></dateStruct> was to secure a presidential election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>The immobility of <persName n="Johnson,President,,,," id="n0040.0002.00011.00006" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, like a rock in the sea, had caused a reactionary movement among the people to save the <rs>Constitution</rs> as well as the <rs>Union</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>Those who wanted the <rs>Union</rs> without the <rs>Constitution</rs> &mdash; who wanted an oligarchy instead of a republic&mdash;at once discerned that nothing but a state of war in the <rs>South</rs> could justify the exercise of the power necessary to stop the reflux tide which the resistance of the <rs>President</rs> had set in motion; and so they levied war against the <rs>State</rs> governments, and marshalled an army to enforce the movement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>It was the right of local self-government in the <name>States</name> that stood in the way of the marplots who intended to control the presidency at every hazard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>This purpose could only be accomplished by taking the government of the <rs>Southern States</rs> out of the hands of the people, and that could only be accomplished by war. The power to make war was the only power possessed by Congress that could touch the <name>States</name> in this vital point.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>The war of reconstruction was waged to secure the permanent ascendancy of a <orgName n="Political Party" type="party">political party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>If the <rs>Southern States</rs> had been Republican instead of Democratic in their party associations, this war would have been spared us, and the country would have escaped a lasting disgrace.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>No Democrat, <name>North</name> or <name>South</name>, engaged in this war except as he was drawn beneath the chariot wheels as a bloody victim of its cruelties.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Not all the <name>Republicans</name> engaged in this war.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>Congress at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> raised this issue with the <rs>Southern States</rs> by refusing to them representation in either house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>They did not neglect, however, to tax the people to whom they refused representation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>It soon became apparent that the rights and powers of home rule comprised nearly everything valuable in government, so far as it related to the personal welfare of the masses of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>They did not repine at the neglect of Congress, or even at its aversion towards them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>At the end of <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> the ostracised States had fully established the fact that their people could live and prosper for a century without.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>They could have the protection of the flag of the <rs>Union</rs> such as the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> enjoyed; they were entitled to exemption from taxation as the <name>Indians</name> are, because they had no representation in Congress; they had the sympathy and respect of their sister States, and could trust to their interested guardianship of the equal rights of all the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>What more could they really need, besides the power of local self-government, to make their people safe and prosperous?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>Such a condition would not, of course, meet the demands of a great and proud people, but it would be preferable to that low condition in which a despised minority should be compelled to submit to insult and injustice continually at the hands of those in power.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>It was this demonstration of the great fact that the <name>States</name> are the real repositories of the essential powers of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> in money, in men, and in military resources, in the election of Presdents and Representatives in Congress in both Houses; and that, by withholding these things, the <name>States</name> can at any moment paralyze the <rs>Federal Government</rs>; that alarmed the higher law people, and they struck home, at the root of the tree, when they, in the war of reconstruction, struck at the great rights of home rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>The struggle for these rights has been long and painful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>We could only meet military force with patient suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>In the beginning, a vast number of men in the <rs>South</rs> were disfranchised who had given long and attentive study to our peculiar and nicely adjusted system of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>In their places, those were put who were in no sense qualified for free and independent suffrage, to say nothing of the intelligent exercise of this important privilege.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>Then came military intimidation, arrests, imprisonments, the espionage of brutal spies and detectives in the private and sacred sanctuaries of home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>Then hired <quote>traitors to the blood that coursed in their veins</quote> were licensed, by nominal elections to office, to steal and plunder at will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>But no <num value="1">one</num> pen will ever enumerate these crimes, and no tongue will ever be able to portray them in their horrid enormity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>This struggle has ended, I believe, forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>The revolution of <dateStruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></dateStruct> has at last failed of its purpose; ballot after ballot has expressed the decree of the popular will against the revolution; there seems to be no remaining cause which can lead to a renewal of the struggle, and it is ended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>In this struggle the people of the <rs>South</rs> have won a great moral victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>It was the cherished and abiding hope of the peace-breakers that we should be goaded into armed resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>They sought this occasion against us to destroy us.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>We of the <rs>South</rs>, in concert with the people of the <name>North</name> and <name>West</name>, elected a statesman to the <name>Presidency</name> who was pledged to put an end to this war against the <name>States</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>His opponent, who became <rs type="role2">President</rs>, had declared his opinions in favor of the principles on which the <rs>Southern States</rs> have so long stood united, but it was supposed by some who supported him that those declarations were only meant to deceive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>They did not rightly appreciate him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>How insignificant the prospect that those who have so greatly harmed the country through the evil times of the war of reconstruction will ever be able to undo the work now completely finished.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>Their followers sustain them, and the covenant of peace is sealed by the authentic act of both the great political parties of the country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>The States have regained the dignity with which they clothed themselves, and the immortal honors with which they were crowned by the nations of the earth when, after having achieved their independence, the <num value="13">thirteen</num> States were each received into the circle of the great ruling powers with earnest congratulations, and sat in council together to create the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States of America</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>The restoration to the people of those constitutional rights which they have never agreed to surrender &mdash; which remain to them after <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of open warfare and nearly <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> of misrule and persecution-has removed the last obstacle to perfect reconciliation.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>The desire of the people for peace and reconciliation existed, and was a controlling sentiment for years, during which the politicians kept them apart and seemingly in bitter antagonism,</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>Few of this class of rulers have been present on occasions, so credible to humanity, when the people have given sad but genuine expression to their reconciliation.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>This reconciliation is not on either side the result of humiliating confession of wrongs done to the country or to posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>The latter is the true proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>The people reject a denunciation that they feel to be unjust, and will some day expunge it from the laws.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>The war of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> was not on either side a crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>We did not like them or approve them, but we have bound ourselves collectively as States, and in our State Constitutions, as well as by multiplied oaths taken on all possible occasions, by our people individually, to support and obey those amendments as parts of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>This was not required of us, and we surrendered it, because we supposed the <rs>Northern States</rs> would demand it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>It was the immediate cause of hostilities in the form in which they were opened, and unless the <rs>South</rs> had believed in the right of secession as an essential element of State sovereignty, it is most likely that war would not have ensued between the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>Our interest in slavery was never so great as our interest in our slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>And now that they are free, our concern for their personal welfare is naturally greater than it is for their political promotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>We desire to benefit them practically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>We did not enslave them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>If their enslavement was a sin, it is not at our door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>They were brought to us as slaves, and from a slave country; and chiefly, by Northern slave-dealers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>Few Southern eyes ever witnessed the horrors of the middle passage, and fewer Southern ships ever sailed in the slave-trade.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>We have not added a shadow to the darkness of their native barbarism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>On the contrary, we have used the code under which they were born; the system of laws adopted instinctively by their rulers, as all systems of unrevealed law have been adopted by all races of men; and we have added to it, in their government, the revealed law which contains statutes adapted to such people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>We have thus educated and enlightened them until they compare favorably in actual knowledge with many civilized and christianized peoples; until our own brethren have thought them worthy to be set in authority over the people who have been their only teachers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>We believe that as a body of people they are deficient in the faculties which comprise the power to govern with wisdom and safety, in that highest form of civilized government, the constitutional republic of the <pb id="p.26" n="26"/> <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; but they can fully enjoy its blessings; and it is to our interest, and in full accordance with our desires, that they should do so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>At all events, we cannot afford to surrender the political power that depends upon their right of suffrage.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>These plain statements seem to dispense with further argument as to the grounds of our satisfaction with our present relations to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and of our faith in the future prosperity of the <rs>South</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>There are still higher grounds upon which we feel that we are justly entitled to repose confidence, and to receive confidence, when we assert our intention to abide by the decisions which were the result of the war.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>I refer confidently to the character of the <rs>American</rs> people, which, after all, is the vital power of the government, and the foundation of every hope of the future.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>No country can be so unhappy as that where every man feels that every other man who may oppose him in his political opinions, is a traitor to his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>Sometimes, the people acting under great excitement, seem to be controlled by such thoughts; but the moment a result is obtained, and declared by lawful authority, it is peacefully accepted, and the people assume their wonted friendship.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>An illustration was furnished, in the events with which this year began, of the love of the people for their country and its institutions and for each other, rising above their regard for any man or any party, or anything except the written Constitution and the law as declared by legitimate authority, that should shame into silence those who traduce the honor of the people of the country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>In this great matter of the <name>Presidential</name> election, the <name>Democrats</name> of the <rs>South</rs> and the whole country felt that they had been victimized and betrayed by a false confidence reposed in the most important tribunal which has existed in this country since <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>; and while <num value="1000000">millions</num> of them believed, and still believe, that its judgment was a mere expression of partisan injustice, yet that judgment stood for law and admitted of no appeal, and they obeyed it. They consented to look to their lawful power to correct it hereafter at the ballot-box, and to provide against its recurrence by additional laws.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>It was expected of the people in the <rs>South</rs> that, through the alliance of Democrats in the <name>North</name> and <name>West</name>, they would seek to avenge themselves <pb id="p.27" n="27"/> for the losses and sufferings of the past by dragging the country into civil war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>When we disappointed those to whom <quote>the wish was father to the thought</quote> and refused to make or to suffer war to establish a presidential succession, they taunted us with a want of spirit and decried our boasted chivalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>They should have known that whatever of blood our people have shed, or may have to shed, on questions of controversy with their brethren, is consecrated to the cause of the <rs>Constitution</rs> of their country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>Neither malice, nor revenge, nor lust of power, nor even any wrong or insult, however grievous, for which the <rs>Constitution</rs> and laws afford a remedy has caused us, or will ever cause us to open our veins, or theirs, in any controversy with our brethren.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>But a fatal blow, aimed at that instrument, which no other means can meet or parry, will never find our hearts too weak for resentment, nor our arms too feeble to strike in its defence.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>The men who saved the land from bloodshed in <dateStruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></dateStruct>, because the <rs>Constitution</rs>, though in some sense violated, was not broken beyond the reach of a peaceful remedy, are the same who in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> attempted to supply the remedy of armed resistance against those who outlawed their rights, and declared them beyond the pale of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>Many of these men yet live, and their sons, who were little children in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, have taken the places of their heroic dead, with not a vacancy in the ranks to tell that ever <num value="1">one</num> was lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>It is a mistake to suppose that they are numerically weak, or that they are broken in spirit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>Those heroes of a <num value="1000">thousand</num> battle-fields, whose very graves are lost beyond the power of recognition, are all replaced with men just such as they were; men who have no higher conceptions of honor and glory than to wish to live or die just such as they were; men who feel that the grave of every Confederate soldier contains the ashes of a patriot whose memory is a sacred legacy-fathers and sons, they are the same men now that they have always been.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>These younger men, however, are not amenable to any accusation of treason, except that they had hearts to love their venerable fathers and the cause which they espoused; their brothers, and the country whose bosom was bathed with the outpouring of their blood.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>The framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, remembering that its most important principles were born of Anglo-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0040.0002.00027.00015" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> rebellion against royal power, and that attainder and confiscation had too often been the badges of a noble martyrdom, protected the children of rebels against confiscation and their blood against attainder by positive provisions of the organic law.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>How insulting to the spirits of the great men who ordained this Constitution is that unworthy prejudice which would visit upon the children, even then unborn, the penalties which have been denounced against <pb id="p.28" n="28"/> their fathers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>The American people cannot dishonor themselves by the encouragement or toleration of a feeling so unworthy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>These young men have not been taught to hate the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, but they have been taught to hold as enemies to their country those who trample upon and spurn its Constitution after having been sworn to defend it.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>They are tottering along the steep declivities of life, without purse or scrip, looking hopefully to a future here peace is eternal, and feeling that the work of life has been faithfully accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>The honor and reverence bestowed upon them by the people of the <rs>South</rs> compensates them for the privations and hardships which followed the sacrifices they made of all their wealth and influence to the cause that commanded their homage.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>The soldiers of the <name>Oonfederacy</name> are now, as they have been since <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, the representative men of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>Those who would comprehend the people of the <rs>South</rs> must know them and their children.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>When I speak of the soldiers of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> as representative men, I do not mean that they have sought or received recognition as the official exponents of the opinions of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>Deference to the opinions of their friends in other sections, and a just regard for the policy that was thought to be the wisest in the restoration of peace, confidence and composure to the country, led them to decline any unavoidable part in the public councils.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>Some politicians in the <rs>South</rs> also demanded that they should take <quote>back seats,</quote> and they took them cheerfully, until the people required them to come to the front.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>Neither do I exclude from the honorable title of Confederate soldiers the men and women who devoted themselves, through their sympathies, prayers, labors, sacrifices, and sufferings, and gave their property, comfort, and ceaseless toil to the cause of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>The honors of the battle-field won by their soldiers are not a more precious remembrance to the people of the <rs>South</rs> than the heroic devotion and sufferings of their mothers, sisters, and wives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>Whatever may be the judgment of those who yet live amidst the lingering shadows of that great struggle, human nature will never find in the history of all the generations past and to come a higher or more worthy example of patriotism and sacrificial devotion than was furnished us in the conduct of the women of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>Woman cannot espouse, with her soul's deepest and truest devotion, a cause that is not just and honorable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>If she doubts the cause in which her husband or son suffers or is lost, her bereavement has no bounds, It is misery without consolation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>When the dearest ties were severed in that cause they suffered the bereavement in silent, uncomplaining grief, feeling sustained by the purest and highest motives, as they bore upon their bleeding hearts a rich sacrifice of love to the altars of their country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>For the same reasons that inspired our soldiers, the wives and mothers of the country were as willing to give their loved ones to their country as they were to die in its service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>When the battle was over, and the faithful and true <num value="1">one</num> was lost to his loved ones at home, the life of the husband and the love of the wife, blended in a sweet incense of free-offering, ascended together to Heaven.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>Did not you, my comrades, act worthily, according to your most sincere and solemn sense of duty, when you entered the field to sustain convictions and defend rights which were thus felt and understood by the mothers, wives and daughters of the land?</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>Was not their honor, their future welfare, their safety against evils which seemed to threaten the sacred things of your home circles the decisive influence which called you to arm for the defence of your country?</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>Under the guide of your own convictions, after having reflected maturely and voted with unconstrained freedom, you felt that the ballot-box could not protect your rights, and you grasped your musket.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>You stood on the defensive, feeling that you had no responsibilities then, or in the past, for the spirit of aggression which had set itself to the abolishing of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>This you believed would overwhelm the <rs>South</rs> with ruin, degrade it to a political vassalage, deprave it to a social position which you could not contemplate without abhorrence.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>When they left their homes to join the army, whether their feet pressed for the last time the marble threshold of palace or the rude door-sill of a log cabin, the soldiers of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> went forth with equal alacrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>Their purposes, hopes, and resolves were the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>No more unjust or disparaging misrepresentation was ever made than that which imputed to the non-slaveholders, or the poor man of the <pb id="p.30" n="30"/> South, reluctance in fighting its battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>My idea was, that in the march through those States the army would meet no organized obstruction; would be supplied with provisions, and even reinforcements, by those friendly to our cause, and would inevitably result in drawing <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0040.0003.00056.00332" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> from <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> to look after and protect his own territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>The idea seemed to be a new <num value="1">one</num> to him, but he was evidently seriously impressed with it. We discussed it over and over, and I discovered that his main objection to it was that it would, if adopted, force him to divide his army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>He left no room to doubt, however, that he believed the idea of an offensive campaign was not only important but necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/><pb id="p.57" n="57"/></p> 
<p>At length, while we were discussing the idea of a western forward movement, he asked me if I did not think an invasion of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> by his own army would accomplish the same result, and I replied that I did not see that it would, because this movement would be too hazardous, and the campaign in thoroughly Union States would require more time and greater preparation than <num value="1">one</num> through <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>I soon discovered that he had determined that he would make some forward movement, and I finally assented that the <rs>Pennsylvania</rs> campaign might be brought to a successful issue if he could make it offensive in strategy, but defensive in tactics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>This point was urged with great persistency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>I suggested that, after piercing <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> and menacing <placeName reg="Washington, Wilkes, Georgia" key="tgn,2024666">Washington</placeName>, we should choose a strong position and force the <rs>Federals</rs> to attack us, observing that the popular clamor throughout the <rs>North</rs> would speedily force the <rs>Federal General</rs> to attempt to drive us out. I recalled to him the <rs n="Battle of Fredericksburg" type="battle">battle of Fredericksburg</rs> as an instance of a defensive battle, when, with a few <num value="1000">thousand</num> men, we hurled the whole Federal army back, crippling and demoralizing it, with trifling loss to our own troops; and <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName> as an instance of an offensive battle, where we dislodged the <rs>Federals</rs>, it is true, but at such a terrible sacrifice that half a dozen such victories would have ruined us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>I reminded him, too, of <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName>'s advice to <persName n="Marmont,,,,," id="n0040.0003.00057.00337" reg="mostcommon:Marmont,nomatch:0"><surname>Marmont</surname></persName>, to whom he said, when putting him at the head of an invading army, <quote>Select your ground and make your enemy attack you.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>I recall these points simply because I desire to have it distinctly understood that, while I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> suggested to <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0040.0003.00057.00338" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> the idea of an offensive campaign, I was never persuaded to yield my argument against the <rs n="Gettysburg Campaign" type="campaign">Gettysburg campaign</rs>, except with the understanding that we were not to deliver an offensivs battle, but to so manceuvre that the enemy should be forced to attack us-or, to repeat, that our campaign should be <num value="1">one</num> of offensive strategy, but defensive tactics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>Upon this understanding my assent was given, and <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0040.0003.00057.00339" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, who had been kind enough to discuss the matter with me patiently, gave the order of march.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>We awaited about <measure n="40minutes" type="date">forty minutes</measure> for these troops and then moved forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>A delay of several hours occurred in the march of the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>The cause of this delay was that we had been ordered by <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0040.0003.00062.00424" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> to proceed cautiously upon the forward movement so as to avoid being seen by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>The march was necessarily slow, the conductor frequently encountering points that exposed the troops to the view of the signal station on <persName n="Top,,Round,,," id="n0040.0003.00062.00430" reg="default:Top,Round,,,"><foreName>Round</foreName> <surname>Top</surname></persName>. At length the column halted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>After waiting some time, supposing that it would soon move forward, I sent to the front to inquire the occasion of the delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>It was reported that the column was awaiting the movements of <persName n="Johnston,Colonel,,,," id="n0040.0003.00062.00431" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,William,Preston,,:9"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, who was trying to lead it by some route by which it could pursue its march without falling under view of the <rs>Federal</rs> signal station.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>I became very impatient at this delay, and determined to take upon myself the responsibility of hurrying the troops forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>I did not order <pb id="p.63" n="63"/> <persName n="McLaws,General,,,," id="n0040.0003.00063.00433" reg="mostcommon:McLaws,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McLaws</surname></persName> forward because, as the head of the column, he had direct orders from <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0040.0003.00063.00434" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> to follow the conduct of <persName n="Johnson,Colonel,,,," id="n0040.0003.00063.00435" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,Andrew,,,:2"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>He did so, and thus broke up the delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>The troops were rapidly thrown into position and preparations were made for the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>From an intercepted dispatch we learned that another corps was in camp about <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> from the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>We had every reason, therefore, to believe that the <rs>Federals</rs> were prepared to renew the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>My men charged with <name n="Great Spirit" type="divinity">great spirit</name> and dislodged the <rs>Federals</rs> from the peach orchard with but little delay, though they fought stubbornly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>The artillery was brought forward and put into position at the peach orchard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>The force thrown upon this point was so strong as to seize our right, as it were, in a vise.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>When they had fairly started up the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> ridge, I discovered that they were suffering terribly from a fire that swept over their right and left flanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1309"/><num value="1">1</num>. I was an impartial observer; <num value="2">2</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1310"/>I was, so far as I know, the only man on the <rs>Southern</rs> side who could see everything going on in that battle, having climbed into the top of a very tall tree near <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 4" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName>, which overlooked all the woody country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1311"/>I had so good a view that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0040.0004.00090.00860" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen'l</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> himself came up to the tree twice to ask about the positions and movements of the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1312"/>It was the same tree upon which <persName n="Freemantle,Colonel,,,," id="n0040.0004.00090.00861" reg="mostcommon:Freemantle,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Freemantle</surname></persName> sat (see <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n0040.0004.00090.00862" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen'l</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s letter) until the opening of the battle, when (longing to see a fight, which he had never seen before,) he left his position.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1313"/>The questions of the <rs>English</rs> author, whose name I do not know, lead me to suppose that either he is not a soldier or has never studied the war, and they remind me of the questions asked by the famous <quote>Committee on the <name>Conduct</name> of the war,</quote> which made the officers of our army smile.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1314"/>But the result of those poor questions is a splendid, rich, military harvest, which will most deeply interest every <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> soldier.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1315"/>I cannot remember, notwithstanding my earnest studies in military history, <num value="1">one</num> case where the history of a battle has been so fully illustrated and illuminated by individual reports given by all of the prominent leaders &mdash; not immediately after the battle, when personal impressions are conflicting, but after a lapse of more than <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>, when time and matured judgment have ripened the <pb id="p.91" n="91"/> fresh sketch into a splendid picture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1316"/>The result is so impressive that if I were professor of military science, I would choose the <rs n="Battle of Gettysburg" type="battle">battle of Gettysburg</rs> for the special study of my students.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1322"/>He weighed everything, even the smallest detail, in making his general plan of battle, and he made the boldest dispositions with heroic courage and the most stubborn energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1323"/>He gave to every link the right place in the construction of a chain which became a masterpiece of military workmanship.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1324"/>He did not reach his conclusions, as <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0040.0004.00091.00866" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:4"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0040.0004.00091.00867" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> did, by an instinctive, sudden impulse; his plans did not come upon him like the lightning's flash followed by the thunder's crash: but he painfully and studiously labored in order to arrange those splendid dispositions fraught with the keenest and most hardy enterprises, and well worthy of the troops which were ordered to execute them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1334"/>In the days at <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 4" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName> this quiet self-possessed calmness was wanting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1336"/>After the shock of battle was over he resumed his accustomed calmness, for then he saw clearly and handled the army with that masterly ability which was peculiar to him. This uneasiness during the days of the battle was contagious to the army, as will appear from the reports of <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n0040.0004.00092.00878" reg="nearbymention:Longstreet,James,,,"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>, <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0040.0004.00092.00879" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>, <persName n="Heth,,,,," id="n0040.0004.00092.00880" reg="mostcommon:Heth,nomatch:0"><surname>Heth</surname></persName>, and others, and as appeared also to me from the peep I had of the battle-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1728"/>And these admitted qualities were quite sufficient to preserve him from any unmanly display of weakness, such as <persName n="Wilson,General,,,," id="n0040.0006.00125.01197" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,James,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName> has pretended to relate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1964"/>On my return to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1862-09-"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, to assume command of the <orgName n="Department of South Carolina and Georgia" type="department">Department of South Carolina and Georgia</orgName>, I found the defences of those <num value="2">two</num> States in a bad and incomplete condition, including defective location and arrangement of works, even at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> and <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1965"/>Several points-such as the mouths of the <placeName reg="Stono River, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2697036">Stono</placeName> and <placeName reg="Edisto, South Carolina, United States" key="tgn,1123652">Edisto rivers</placeName>, and the headwaters of <placeName key="tgn,2195763" n="1.000 17" reg="broad river, south carolina, united states">Broad river</placeName> at <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> &mdash; I found unprotected; though soon after the fall of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, as I was about to be detached, I had designated them to be properly fortified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1966"/>A recommendation had even been made by my immediate predecessor that the outer defences of <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston Harbor</placeName> should be given up as untenable against the ironclads and monitors then known to be under construction at the <rs>North</rs>, and that the water-line of the immediate city of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> should be made the sole line of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1967"/>This course, however, not having been authorized by the <rs>Richmond</rs> authorities, it was not attempted, except that the fortifications of <placeName reg="Snake Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2673066">Cole's Island</placeName> &mdash; the key to the defence of the <placeName reg="Stono River, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2697036">Stono river</placeName> &mdash; was abandoned and the harbor in the mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,2697036" n="1.000 97" reg="stono river, charleston, south carolina">Stono</placeName> left open to the enemy, who made it their base of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1968"/>Immediately on my arrival I inspected the defences of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> and <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, and made a requisition on the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> for additional troops and heavy guns deemed necessary; but neither could be furnished, owing, it was stated, to the pressing wants of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> at other points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1969"/>Shortly afterward <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> was added to my command, but without any increase of troops or guns, except the few already in that State; and, later, several brigades were withdrawn from me, notwithstanding my protest, to reinforce the armies of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>. <pb id="p.147" n="147"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1970"/>As I have already said, I found at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> an exceedingly bad defensive condition against a determined attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1971"/>Excepting <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName>, on <placeName reg="Sullivan's Island, Sullivan's Island, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096782">Sullivan's Island</placeName>, the works and batteries covering <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston Harbor</placeName>, including <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, were insufficiently armed and their barbette guns without the protection of heavy traverses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1972"/>In all the harbor works there were only <num value="3">three</num> <measure n="10inch" type="distance">10-inch</measure> and a few <measure n="8inch" type="distance">8-inch</measure> columbiads, which had been left in <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Forts Sumter</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Moultrie</placeName> by <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0040.0011.00147.01460" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,R.,H.,,:4"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, and about a dozen rifle gunsunbanded <num value="32">32</num>-pounders, made by the <rs>Confederates</rs>--which burst after a few discharges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1973"/>There were, however, a number of good <num value="42">42</num>-pounders of the old pattern, which I afterward had rifled and banded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1974"/>I found a continuous floating boom of large timbers bound together and interlinked, stretching across from <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1975"/>But this was a fragile and unreliable barrier, as it offered too great a resistance to the strong current of the ebb and flood tide at full moon, especially after southeasterly gales, which backed up the waters in the bay and in the <placeName key="tgn,2139122" n="1.000 4" reg="ashley river, south carolina, united states">Ashley</placeName> and <placeName reg="West Branch Cooper River, Berkeley, South Carolina" key="tgn,2757667">Cooper rivers</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1976"/>It was exposed, therefore, at such periods, to be broken, particularly as the channel-bottom was hard and smooth, and the light anchors which held the boom in position were constantly dragging &mdash; a fact which made the breaking of the boom an easy matter under the strain of hostile steamers coming against it under full headway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1977"/>For this reason the engineers had proposed the substitution of a rope obstruction, which would be free from tidal strain, but little had been done toward its preparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1978"/><num value="1">1</num>, therefore, soon after assuming command, ordered its immediate completion, and, to give it protection and greater efficiency, directed that <num value="2">two</num> lines of torpedoes be planted a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> in advance of it. But before the order could be carried out, a strong southerly storm broke the timber boom in several places, leaving the channel unprotected, except by the guns of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Forts Sumter</placeName> and <persName n="Moultrie,fort,,,," id="n0040.0011.00147.01461" reg="mostcommon:Moultrie,nomatch:0"><roleName n="fort"></roleName><surname>Moultrie</surname>.</persName> Fortunately, however, the <orgName n="Federal Fleet" type="fleet">Federal fleet</orgName> made no effort to enter the harbor, as it might have done if it had made the attempt at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1979"/>A few days later the rope obstruction and torpedoes were in position, and so remained without serious injury till the end of the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1980"/>The rope obstruction was made of <num value="2">two</num> heavy cables, about <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> apart, the <num value="1">one</num> below the other, and connected together by a network of smaller ropes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1981"/>The anchors were made fast to <pb id="p.148" n="148"/> the lower cable, and the buoys or floats to the upper <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1982"/>The upper cable carried a fringe of smaller ropes, about <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of an inch in diameter by <measure n="50feet" type="distance">fifty feet</measure> long, which floated as so many <quote>streamers</quote> on the surface, destined to foul the screw propeller of any steamer which might attempt to pass over the obstruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/>Shortly after these cables were in position a blockade-runner, in attempting at night to pass through the gap purposely left open near the <rs type="place">Sullivan Island</rs> shore, under the guns of <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName> and of the outside batteries, accidentally crossed the end of the rope obstruction, when <num value="1">one</num> of the streamers got entangled around the shaft, checking its revolutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1984"/>The vessel was at once compelled to drop anchor to avoid drifting on the torpedoes or ashore, and afterward had to be docked for the removal of the streamer before she could again use her propeller.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1985"/>The torpedoes, as anchored, floated a few feet below the surface of the water at low tide, and were loaded with <measure n="100l." type="pounds"><num value="100">one hundred</num> pounds</measure> of powder arranged to explode by concussion &mdash; the automatic fuse employed being the invention of <persName n="Lee,Captain,Francis,D.,," id="n0040.0011.00148.01462" reg="default:Lee,Francis,D.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <foreName>Francis</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, an intelligent young engineer officer of my <rs n="General Staff" type="misc">general staff</rs>, and now a prominent architect in <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1986"/>The fuse or firing apparatus consisted of a cylindrical lead tube with a hemispherical head, the metal in the head being thinner than at the sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1987"/>The tube was open at the lower extremity, where it was surrounded by a flange; and, when in place, it was protected against leakage by means of brass couplings and rubber washers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1988"/>It was charged as follows: In its centre was a glass tube filled with sulphuric acid and hermetrically sealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1989"/>This was guarded by another glass tube sealed in like manner, and both were retained in position by means of a peculiar pin at the open end of the leaden tube; the space between the latter and the glass tube was then filled with a composition of chlorate of potassa and powdered loaf sugar, with a quantity of rifle powder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1990"/>The lower part of the tube was then closed with a piece of oiled paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1991"/>Great care had to be taken to ascertain that the leaden tube was perfectly water-tight under considerable pressure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1992"/>The torpedo also had to undergo the most careful test.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1993"/>The firing of the tube was produced by bringing the thin head in contact with a hard object, as the side of a vessel; the indentation of the lead broke the glass tubes, which discharged the acid on the composition, firing it, and thereby igniting the charge in the torpedo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1994"/>The charges used <pb id="p.149" n="149"/> varied from <num value="60">sixty</num> to <measure n="100l." type="pounds"><num value="100">one hundred</num> pounds</measure> rifle powder, though other explosives might have been more advantageously used if they had been available to us. Generally <num value="4">four</num> of the fuses were attached to the head of each torpedo so as to secure the discharge at any angle of attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1995"/>These firing tubes or fuses were afterward modified to avoid the great risk consequent upon screwing them in place and of having them permanently attached to the charged torpedo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1996"/>The shell of the latter was thinned at the point where the tube was attached, so that, under water pressure, the explosion of the tube would certainly break it and discharge the torpedo; though, when unsubmerged, the explosion of the tube would vent itself in the open air without breaking the shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1997"/>In this arrangement the tube was of brass, with a leaden head, and made water-tight by means of a screw plug at its base.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1998"/>Both the shell and the tube being made independently water-tight, the screw connection between the <num value="2">two</num> was made loose, so that the tube could be attached or detached readily with the fingers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1999"/>The mode adopted for testing against leakage was by placing them in a vessel of alcohol, under the glass exhaust of an air-pump.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2000"/>When no air bubbles appeared the tubes could be relied on. <persName n="Lee,Captain,,,," id="n0040.0011.00149.01463" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Francis,D.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> had also an electric torpedo which exploded by concussion against a hard object; the electric current being thus established, insured the discharge at the right moment.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2002"/>It originated as follows: I-e reported to me that he thought he could blow up successfully any vessel by means of a torpedo carried some <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> under water at the end of a pole <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="12feet" type="distance">twelve feet</measure> long, which should be attached to the bow of a skiff or rowboat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2003"/>I authorized an experiment upon the hulk of an unfinished and condemned gunboat anchored in the harbor, and loaded for the purpose with all kinds of rubbish taken from the <quote>burnt district</quote> of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2004"/>It was a complete success; a large hole was made in the side of the hulk, the rubbish being blown high in the air, and the vessel sank in less than a minute..<note anchored="yes" id="n.149.1">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2005"/> 
<p>Since writing the above I have been informed by <persName n="Barrett,Captain,F.,,," id="n0040.0011.00149.01465" reg="default:Barrett,F.,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Barrett</surname></persName>, <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2010"/>While he heartily approved, he stated his inability to act in the matter, as it was a subject that appertained to the navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2011"/>He, however, introduced me and urged it to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of Navy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2012"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> could do nothing, and the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs> would not, for the reason that I was not a naval officer under his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2013"/>So I returned to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> without accomplishing anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2014"/>After a lapse of some months I was again sent to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 16" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> to represent the matter to the <rs>Government</rs>, and I carried with me the indorsement of the best officers of the navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2015"/>The result was the transfer of an unfinished hull, on the stocks at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, which was designed for a gunboat-or rather <orgName n="Floating Battery" type="battery">floating-battery</orgName>, as she was not arranged for any motive power, but was intended to be anchored in position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2016"/>This hull was completed by me, and a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-hand and much worn engine was obtained in <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> and placed in her. Notwithstanding her tub-like model and the inefficiency of her engine, <persName n="Carlin,Captain,,,," id="n0040.0011.00150.01468" reg="mostcommon:Carlin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Carlin</surname></persName>, commanding a blockade-runner5 took charge of her in an attack against the New Ironsides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2019"/>The boat was almost entirely submerged, and painted gray like the blockade-runners, and, like them, made no smoke, by burning anthracite coal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2022"/>This order was misunderstood, and, in place of going the <quote>bow on</quote> as was proposed, she ran alongside of the New Ironsides and entangled her spar in the anchor-chain of that vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2023"/>In attempting to back the engine hung on the centre, and some delay occurred before it was pried off.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2105"/>As no instructions for their service accompanied the guns, and the metal between the exterior surface of the breech and the rear of the inner chamber did not exceed <num value="6">six</num> to <measure n="8inches" type="distance">eight inches</measure>, against all experience in ordnance, apprehensions were excited that the gun would burst in firing with so large a charge and such weight of projectile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2106"/>Under the circumstances it was determined to charge it with an empty shell and the minimum of powder necessary to move it; the charge was divided in <num value="2">two</num> cartridges, <num value="1">one</num> to fit the small rear chamber and the other the main bore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2109"/>The happy results of the extensive experiments made by this board with many guns of different calibre, including muskets, and last of all with the other <rs>Blakely</rs>, was that if the cartridge were not pressed down to the bottom of the bore of a gun, and a space were thus left in rear of the charge, as great a velocity could be imparted to the projectile with a much smaller charge and the gun was subject to less abrupt strain from the explosion, because this air-chamber, affording certain room for the expansion of the gases, gave time for the inertia of the heavy mass of the projectile to be overcome before the full explosion of the charge, and opportunity was also given for the ignition of the entire charge, so that no powder was wasted as in ordinary gunnery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2110"/>When this was discovered the remaining <rs>Blakely</rs> was tried from a skid, without any cartridge in the rear chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2111"/>It fired both projectiles, shell and solid shot, with complete success, notwithstanding the small amount of metal at the extremity of the breech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2625"/>But I will endeavor to be as brief and as courteous as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2626"/>The facts, which are notorious to every surviving officer and private of every battery concerned in them, are as follows:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2627"/>I arrived with my battalion, not at the head of the column, but at the very tail of it, having marched in that honorable but unappreciated position from <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 4" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName> without once having the usual privilege of alternating in the lead on the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2629"/>On doing so, <pb id="p.202" n="202"/> I was ordered to take command of all the artillery on the field for action, but to leave <persName n="Walton,Colonel,,,," id="n0040.0012.00202.02214" reg="nearbymention:Walton,J.,B.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Walton</surname></persName>'s own battalion where it was then in bivouac near the <placeName reg="Cashtown, Franklin, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2087007">Cashtown</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2630"/>I did take the command and exercised it actively, and personally put in position every battalion, and nearly every battery, except a a part of <placeName key="tgn,6002055" n="1.000 83" reg="fort henry, stewart, tennessee">Henry</placeName>'s battalion, on our extreme right flank, which the pressure in the centre did not allow me time to visit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2632"/>Throughout that da.y I was in the most entire and active command of the whole line of guns, and only withdrew with the last battery late at night, and I have remained in ignorance until this day that my personal supervision was not exclusive.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2905"/>Sir: I beg leave to submit the following report of the part taken by the <orgName type="regiment" key="13LAVolunteer">Thirteenth Louisiana volunteers</orgName> in the action of the <num value="31" type="ordinal">31st</num>:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2906"/>We were posted on the right of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Adams,,,,," id="n0040.0015.00217.02476" reg="mostcommon:Adams,nomatch:0"><surname>Adams</surname></persName>' brigade</orgName>, the right of the regiment resting near the river and the <num value="2">two</num> left companies overlapping the rail-track.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2907"/>We advanced in line of battle until we reached the houses destroyed by fire, and the point at which the ground swelled into a considerable hill, stretching towards the line of the enemy, and where the river turned off quite abruptly to the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2908"/>We here halted in order that disposition might be made to pass the obstacles in front of us, the regiment next to the <num value="13" type="ordinal">Thirteenth</num>--the <orgName type="regiment" key="16LAVolunteer">Sixteenth Louisiana volunteers</orgName>-having been thrown into column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2909"/>We then advanced up the ascent, leaving quite an unoccupied space between the right and the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2910"/>Ascending the elevated position, I discovered the enemy moving troops rapidly down the river on our right, and placing them also in ambush in the cornfield on our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2911"/>Riding to the rail-track, I saw, not more than <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards distant</measure>, a line of battle of the enemy, using the embankment as a breastwork and to conceal them from our troops, on the low-ground to our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2912"/>The line of battle on the rail-track, as the line of battle on the river bank, <pb id="p.218" n="218"/> was at right angles to our advancing line, and the enemy reserved his fire until we were flanked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2913"/>So soon as I discovered the disposition of the enemy, I rode across the railroad and informed <persName n="Adams,General,,,," id="n0040.0015.00218.02477" reg="mostcommon:Adams,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2914"/>It was, however, too late to accomplish a timely change in our positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2915"/>Moreover, from the moment of our advance in the face of the enemy, their artillery had kept a constant fire upon us, while the fire of his infantry was reserved, rendering it the more difficult, in addition to the broken nature of the ground, to make new dispositions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2916"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fire we received was from the river bank and directed upon the <name>Infirmary</name> corps of the regiment, posted considerably in our rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2917"/>I immediately moved the regiment double-quick by the right-flank towards the river, but finding a front as well as flanking fire open upon us, I commanded a halt, and determined to contest the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2918"/>The right of the regiment stood firm for a few minutes, but under the combined fires gave way. The men naturally faced the direction in which the severest fire came, and this caused some confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2919"/>We were enabled to hold the left in its position, the fence in its front affording some protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2920"/>I felt the necessity of holding our position until the balance of the brigade, already falling back, should pass the point at which the enemy was pressing us on the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2921"/>Should this be prematurely lost, there had been a much larger force than the rest of the brigade, with every advantage of position, covering its entire front and enveloping its right flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2922"/>I called upon <persName n="Austin,Major,,,," id="n0040.0015.00218.02478" reg="mostcommon:Austin,J.,E.,,:1"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Austin</surname></persName> to form on my line and assist in its defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2923"/>In a few moments he disposed his battalion of sharpshooters as I suggested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2924"/>We were successful in holding the high-ground on the right of the railroad until the left portion of the brigade, driven back by a storm of artillery and infantry fire on its front and flank, had reached a point beyond our line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2925"/>The ground was much broken; a continuous line of battle could not be formed on the hill, and this was <num value="1">one</num> of the main reasons why there was some apparent irregularity in falling back.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2926"/>I should do injustice to the officers and men of the <orgName type="regiment" key="13LAVolunteer">Thirteenth Louisiana volunteers</orgName>, did I not state that they displayed the best qualities of soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2927"/>It is difficult for troops to stand firm against great odds, under a heavy fire from the front and on the flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2928"/>This was not only done for some minutes, but at the outset and until the full force of the enemy was developed on our right flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2929"/>We drove back his line on our front, charging beyond the fence in the cornfield and rescuing the colors of some Confederate regiment, which had previously engaged the enemy in this position and whose dead marked plainly its line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2930"/>I send the colors that you may return them to the gallant regiment, whose brave dead spoke its eulogy.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2945"/>These dispositions had hardly been effected when the general advance began, and I immediately moved forward my line, consisting of the <orgName type="regiment" key="LA13">Thirteenth Louisiana</orgName> consolidated regiment, <persName n="Guillet,Major,,,," id="n0040.0016.00219.02502" reg="nearbymention:Guillet,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Guillet</surname></persName>, and the <orgName type="regiment" key="LA16">Sixteenth Louisiana</orgName> consolidated regiment, <persName n="Zacharie,Major,,,," id="n0040.0016.00219.02503" reg="mostcommon:Zacharie,F.,C.,,:1"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Zacharie</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2946"/>The interval between the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and secondlines was very well preserved until the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> became generally engaged with the enemy, when I at once halted the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line and ordered the officers and men to lie down, so as to cover them from the enemy's batteries, whose fire we were drawing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2947"/>We drove in his skirmishers from the opposite side of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2948"/>I then rode forward to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line in the woods on the right to consult with <persName n="Hanson,General,,,," id="n0040.0016.00219.02504" reg="mostcommon:Hanson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hanson</surname></persName> as to the particular moment when the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line <pb id="p.220" n="220"/> should come to his support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2949"/>I had scarcely reached him when he was struck, and, I observed, so seriously wounded as to disable him from conferring with me. I determined not to engage the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line until the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gave way. <persName n="Hanson,General,,,," id="n0040.0016.00220.02505" reg="mostcommon:Hanson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hanson</surname></persName> had hardly fallen, however, when his line began to yield, and after a few moments many of his men were falling to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2950"/>I saw that they needed support, and going back to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line, instantly ordered the right regiment (<orgName type="regiment" key="13LAVolunteer">Thirteenth Louisiana volunteers</orgName>, <persName n="Guillet,Major,,,," id="n0040.0016.00220.02506" reg="nearbymention:Guillet,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Guillet</surname></persName>,) to move by the right flank, in order to avoid the river, towards which we were marching, and then to advance in line of battle towards the woods; and having my horse disabled by a wound in riding back, I dispatched <persName n="Lipscomb,Captain,,,," id="n0040.0016.00220.02507" reg="mostcommon:Lipscomb,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Lipscomb</surname></persName> to give the same order to <persName n="Zacharie,Major,,,," id="n0040.0016.00220.02508" reg="mostcommon:Zacharie,F.,C.,,:1"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Zacharie</surname></persName>, commanding the <orgName type="regiment" key="16LAVolunteer">Sixteenth Louisiana volunteers</orgName>, already under the bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2951"/>I moved rapidly forward the right regiment and soon engaged the enemy, under heavy ire. I presumed that the <num value="16" type="ordinal">Sixteenth</num> was moving under the river bank on our left, in accordance with the order sent by <persName n="Lipscomb,Captain,,,," id="n0040.0016.00220.02509" reg="mostcommon:Lipscomb,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Lipscomb</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2952"/>The woods were full of troops apparently in great confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2953"/>Many of these formed on our line, and we advanced, driving the enemy before us beyond a ravine, on the further side of which was a picket fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2954"/>This ravine was filled with men broken from their commands, who were sheltered from the enemy, but such was their confusion, that they could accomplish nothing against him. I formed the fighting line on the rear side of the ravine, on the lower side of the crest, and by a well-directed volley poured into the advancing lines of the enemy, broke and dispersed it. When this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> compact line gave way there was a momentary lull &mdash; a suspension of fire-and we prepared to charge; but, as if in the twinkle of an eye, another line of the enemy, extending far beyond our right, assumed the lost position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2955"/>This was dispersed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2956"/>Presently a number of skirmishers appeared on our right, and we were fired upon from the left, on the opposite side of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2957"/>The men in the ravine broke to the rear under these fires, that were aimed chiefly at them, and from which they appeared to suffer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2958"/>There was perpetual skirmishing from the moment we entered the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2959"/>Again, another line came on our front, which engaged us. I observed that our own right had given way, going through the open field on the right of us to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2960"/>I moved to our extreme left and saw the enemy was in heavy lines on the opposite bank, and already beginning to cross.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2961"/>I saw at once that we would be enveloped on the right and left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2962"/>I ordered my command to fall back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2963"/>It was a matter of doubt whether this could be accomplished successfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2964"/>Scarcely any <num value="1">one</num> could enter the open field to our right and rear without being shot down, either by the infantry or by the batteries of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2965"/>I should observe, that from the moment we approached the elevated ground near the river, the batteries of the enemy, posted on the opposite side, poured into our ranks without intermission.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2966"/>As soon as he was driven from the high ground on this side his batteries played upon it. His batteries and infantry concentrated on every spot from <pb id="p.221" n="221"/> which he was driven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2967"/>It was for this reason that after a sharp conflict of <measure n="30minutes" type="date">thirty minutes</measure>, and having won the position, we were forced to abandon it. And this accounts, too, for the extraordinary loss we sustained, and for the fact that nearly all our wounded and killed were left on the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2968"/>Under my own observation several parties bearing off wounded were shot down as soon as they entered the open field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2969"/>Many, therefore, of those put down as missing, were killed or wounded in this affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2970"/>Out of <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> officers who went into the fight, <num value="14">fourteen</num> were wounded, and most of them severely, and as the event may prove, I fear, mortally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2971"/>This was in the <orgName type="regiment" key="13LAVolunteer">Thirteenth Louisiana volunteers</orgName>, <persName n="Guillet,Major,Charles,,," id="n0040.0016.00221.02510" reg="default:Guillet,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Guillet</surname></persName>, of whose conduct I cannot speak in terms too high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2974"/>The loss of this regiment was, in <num value="2">two</num> short actions, lasting both together not more than an hour, say <num value="19">nineteen</num> officers and <num value="332">three hundred and thirty-two</num> men killed, wounded, and missing-losing as many as some brigades.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2976"/>After entering the woods the fire of our own batteries, together with that of the enemy just opposite, and the immediate development of infantry in heavy force along the opposite bank below him, prevented any orders of mine from reaching him or his joining us. He moved up the river, recrossed and joined the reserve.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3180"/>As my account of the <rs n="Battle of Gettysburg" type="battle">battle of Gettysburg</rs> was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> given to the public in your columns, I respectfully ask space therein sufficient to make the following explanation and correction of the statement of the strength of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate Army</orgName> then made in that campaign:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3181"/>I would premise with the mention of the fact that <num value="2">two</num> kinds of returns of the strength of the army were required to be made to the <name>Department</name> during the war &mdash; the <num value="1">one</num> a <quote>field return,</quote> made twice a month (on the <num value="10" type="ordinal">10th</num> and <num value="20" type="ordinal">20th</num>), and the other a <quote>monthly return,</quote> made on the last day of each month.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3182"/>In the field returns there was a column for the <quote>officers present for duty,</quote> and <num value="1">one</num> for <quote>enlisted men present for duty</quote> ; the sum of the <num value="2">two</num> would give the <quote>effective total</quote> as generally understood &mdash; that is, the fighting strength.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3183"/>In the monthly report the arrangement was different: there was a column for each grade of officers, both of the line and staff, and also a column for sergeants, <num value="1">one</num> for corporals, and <num value="1">one</num> for privates-enlisted men. There was then a column headed <quote>effective total,</quote> which embraced only the enlisted men present for duty &mdash; that is, the non-commissioned staff, sergeants, <rs type="role" n="Corporal">corporals</rs>, and privates; there being no column for the aggregate of the commissioned officers present for duty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3184"/>There are many methods of comparing the strength of opposing armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3185"/>The <num value="1">one</num> adopted by me was to take the <quote>effective total,</quote> or the sum of the officers and enlisted men present for duty, <pb id="p.240" n="240"/> excluding all consideration of the special or extra-duty men, those sick, and those in arrest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3186"/>As this manner of estimating was applied to both armies, it seemed to me the most equitable and satisfactory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3187"/>In taking notes from the returns on file in the <rs type="place">Archive Office</rs> at <placeName key="tgn,2024666;tgn,7013962" n="0.164 000000.8181	placename;tgn,2024666;washington, wilkes, georgia,Wilkes,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.109 000000.5454	placename;tgn,7013962;district of columbia,District of Columbia,United States,North and Central America" reg="washington, wilkes, georgia,Wilkes,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;district of columbia,District of Columbia,United States,North and Central America">Washington</placeName>, I aimed to arrive at the <quote>effective total.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3188"/>This in the <quote>field returns</quote> was readily determined by adding together the officers and enlisted men present for duty; but in the case of the <quote>monthly reports</quote> it was a very natural error for <num value="1">one</num> to take the addition of the column headed <quote>effective total</quote> as representing the effective strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3189"/>Now, it so happened that the basis of my estimate of the strength of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0040.0019.00240.02704" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> at <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 4" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName> was the <hi rend="italics">monthly report</hi> of the <dateStruct value="1863-05-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> <month reg="05">May</month>, <year>1863</year>,</dateStruct> and not a <hi rend="italics">field return</hi>. I, therefore, took the total amount of the column headed <quote>effective total</quote> --viz., <num value="68352">68,352</num>-as representing what is generally understood by that term, and under the impression that the extensions under that column embraced the officers and men present for duty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3190"/>I was the more naturally led into this error, as <persName n="Swinton,Mister,,,," id="n0040.0019.00240.02705" reg="mostcommon:Swinton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Swinton</surname></persName>, whose figures I had before me, had done precisely the same thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3192"/>I at once made application to the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> for the information necessary to settle the matter, and having been kindly favored with a prompt reply to my request, I have been enabled to review my figures, and find that the estimate of strength on the <dateStruct value="1863-05-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> <month reg="05">May</month>, <year>1863</year>,</dateStruct> does not include the officers present for duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3193"/><hi rend="italics">At that date</hi> the effective strength of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0040.0019.00240.02708" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> was as follows: <orgName n="command"><persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n0040.0019.00240.02709" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,James,,,:8"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>, <num value="29171">29,171</num>; <persName n="Hill,,A.,P.,," id="n0040.0019.00240.02710" reg="default:Hill,A.,P.,,"><foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="command">command</orgName>, <num value="30286">30,286</num>; cavalry, <num value="10292">10,292</num>; artillery, <num value="4702">4,702</num>. <hi rend="italics">Total effective</hi> of all arms, <num value="74451">74,451</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3194"/>And carrying out the same reasoning as that originally pursued, I would say that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0040.0019.00240.02711" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> had at <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 4" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName>, including all the cavalry, <num value="67000">67,000</num> men &mdash; that is to say, <num value="53500">53,500</num> infantry, <num value="9000">9,000</num> cavalry, and <num value="4500">4,500</num> artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3195"/><pb id="p.241" n="241"/></p> 
<p>Of course this number was not available to him at any <num value="1">one</num> time, as I have previously explained, but I prefer to adopt the greatest number as shown by the official reports; and in like manner I would persist in estimating the strength of the <rs>Federal</rs> army by the statement of <persName n="Hooker,General,,,," id="n0040.0019.00241.02712" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,Charles,E.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hooker</surname></persName> to <persName n="Halleck,General,,,," id="n0040.0019.00241.02713" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Halleck</surname></persName>, made on the <dateStruct value="-06-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> day of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>, to the effect that his <quote>whole force of <hi rend="italics">enlisted men</hi> present for duty would not exceed <num value="105000">105,000</num>.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3196"/>As <persName n="Hooker,General,,,," id="n0040.0019.00241.02714" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,Charles,E.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hooker</surname></persName> thus gave only his <hi rend="italics">enlisted men</hi> present for duty, perhaps the figures originally given by me as the strength of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0040.0019.00241.02715" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> &mdash; that is say, <num value="67452">67,452</num> on the <dateStruct value="1873-05-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> <month reg="05">May</month>, <year>1873</year>,</dateStruct> and <num value="62000">62,000</num> at <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 4" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName> &mdash; should be employed in the comparison, as they represent also his <hi rend="italics">enlisted men</hi> present for duty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3197"/>For if we add to the <num value="105000">105,000</num> enlisted men of the <rs>Federal</rs> army the same proportion for officers as that found in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>, it would raise the effective strength of the former to fully <num value="115000">115,000</num> on the <dateStruct value="-06-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> day of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>, <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> previous to the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3203"/>It is, in my judgment, as conclusive evidence as has yet been presented of the great disparity in the strength of the <num value="2">two</num> armies, when <num value="1">one</num> who deducts <num value="0.13">thirteen per cent.</num> from the effective strength of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>, and makes a further deduction of <num value="0.07">seven per cent.</num> for the straggling from that army, during a period of <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure>, while he allows but <num value="0.04">four per cent.</num> for the reduction of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>, from the same cause, during a period of nearly <num value="1">one</num> month, should yet admit that the former army exceeded the latter in numerical strength by <quote>somewhat more taan <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3204"/>It appears to me, however, that the <rs>Count</rs> unnecessarily surrounds a plain matter of fact with perplexing questions involving much that is indeterminate, and seeks to reach a result by doubtful inferences and intricate calculations which is readily attainable by direct, positive, and contemporaneous evidence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3205"/>In the first place, I do not see the necessity for attempting a comparison that shall embrace the men on extra or special duty with both armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3206"/>I would not object to this if a satisfactory result could be had; but when the most positive evidence we have relates to the numbers present with each army for duty, why not limit the comparison to these?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3207"/>Why not seek at once to ascertain the number of men in line of battle available for the fight?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3208"/>When we speak of <quote>officers and enlisted men present for duty,</quote> a clear understanding is had of what is meant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3209"/>It matters not how many men were with the organizations, or sick in ambulances; they took no part in the fight, and some of them were, perhaps, so far removed from the scene as not even to hear the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3210"/>But, apart from this, it is not so easy to determine their number as it is to ascertain the number of those who were present for duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3211"/><pb id="p.243" n="243"/></p> 
<p>The returns of both armies were alike in this, viz.: in each there was a column for the officers <quote>present for duty,</quote> and <num value="1">one</num> for the enlisted men <quote>present for duty.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3212"/>Entirely distinct from this, but under the general heading <quote>present,</quote> were separate columns for <quote>extra or special duty,</quote> <quote>sick,</quote> and <quote>in arrest.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3213"/>The extra or special-duty men were, as a rule, on service with the trains, and were never counted by regimental commanders with us gn their reports of <quote>men present for duty.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3214"/>Without discussing the point made by the <rs>Count</rs>, that the <quote>Federal officers gave as what they called their <hi rend="italics">effective strength</hi> the figures representing <hi rend="italics">all the men present</hi>, and not only those <hi rend="italics">present for duty</hi>,</quote> I would call attention to the fact that, in his official correspondence with the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">General-in-Chief</rs>, <persName n="Hooker,General,,,," id="n0040.0020.00243.02729" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,Charles,E.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hooker</surname></persName>, on the <dateStruct value="1863-06-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> day of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>-<measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> previous to the battle-stated that his <quote>whole force of <hi rend="italics">enlisted men present for duty</hi> would not exceed <num value="105000">105,000</num>.</quote>

It is needless to say that the same thing would have happened had the battle taken place either earlier or later.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3461"/>The force stationed there when the battle opened had been there all day, and was wholly inadequate to hold it; hence <persName n="Meade,,Gederal,,," id="n0040.0025.00263.02934" reg="default:Meade,Gederal,,,"><foreName>Gederal</foreName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName>'s anxiety to hurry up additional troops after the battle had opened, and his congratulation that <persName n="Sykes,,,,," id="n0040.0025.00263.02935" reg="mostcommon:Sykes,nomatch:0"><surname>Sykes</surname></persName>, by throwing forward <quote>a strong force,</quote> was enabled to drive us from it and secure it to the <rs>Federals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3533"/>Everything developed by this closer reconnaissance went to confirm the impression made upon me by my reconnoissance during the day. I therefore determined not to make the attack, and ordered my troops back to the original line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3535"/>They soon made the battle so severe for him that he was obliged to call for reinforcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3536"/>At about <time value="3pm">3 P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3537"/>I changed my course and hurried to the point indicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3538"/>I found them standing upon a high piece of ground, from which they had full view of the battle being made against <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0040.0025.00267.02992" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:4"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3539"/>We could see the solid masses of the <rs>Federals</rs> forming for a charge against <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s weakening lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3540"/>They were gathered in immense force, and it seemed impossible that <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s thin lines could withstand the onset.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3541"/>The Federals moved forward steadily, surging on in solid blocks, headed directly for <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3542"/>Just then a courier arrived in great haste with orders from <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0040.0025.00267.02993" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> for me to hurry to the assistance of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0040.0025.00267.02994" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:4"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3543"/>It was in the very crisis of the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3544"/>I had very serious doubts about being able to reach <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0040.0025.00267.02995" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> in time to be of any service to him. I had no doubt, however, that I could impede or paralyze the immense mass of men that was pressing steadily to his overthrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3545"/>We were standing on the flank of the advancing columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3546"/>They swept on at right angles to our line of vision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3547"/>They were within easy artillery range, and I felt certain that a heavy enfilading fire poured unexpectedly into their charging columns would disconcert and check it. Instead of moving to reinforce <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0040.0025.00267.02996" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:4"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, therefore, I sent dispatches for batteries to hurry to where I was.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3548"/>They were wheeled into position and directed against the moving flank of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3549"/>The range was fair, and as the <num value="6">six</num> guns flashed the heavy shot went ploughing through the solid flank of the <rs>Federals</rs>, doing terrible damage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3550"/>The result was anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3551"/>The line faltered for an instant, started again, hesitated, reformed and pressed forward, and then as a rear broadside was poured into them, broke ranks and retired, slowly, sullenly and doggedly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3552"/><persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0040.0025.00267.02998" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> did not pursue, and the <rs>Federals</rs> halted after moving back a short distance, and arranged to reform their ranks and renew the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3553"/>As soon as they started, however, they were obliged to face against <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0040.0025.00267.02999" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3554"/>This exposed them, of course, to our enfilading fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3555"/>We now had several batteries in position, and as soon as the lines had taken shape and started on their <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> assault we poured a perfect hail of balls into their flanks and scattered them again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3556"/>Although discomfited they were not broken, but retired with their slow, angry, sullen step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3557"/>When they had gone beyond the fair range of our batteries they halted and tried to form again for the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3558"/>I now determined to end the matter, feeling that I had an easy victory in my grasp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3559"/>I therefore ordered every battery to be in readiness, and drew my men up for a charge, designing to throw them into the broken ranks of the enemy as soon as my artillery had dispersed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3560"/>The Federals moved forward once more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3561"/>When they were fairly in range every gun was opened upon them, and before they had recovered from the stunning effect, I <pb id="p.268" n="268"/> sprung every man that I had to the charge, and swept down upon them like an avalanche.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3562"/>The effect was simply magical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3563"/>The enemy broke all to pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3564"/>I pushed my men forward in a pell-mell pursuit, hoping to reach the main Federal lines at the same time with their retreating forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3565"/>We succeeded in this and drove the enemy back, pursuing them until fully <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time> at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3566"/>In the meanwhile I received a note from <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0040.0025.00268.03000" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4148"/>The event possesses every attraction to me; it is inspired by the <rs>Ladies</rs>' Memorial Association; the monument is to be located in the keystone State of the <rs>Confederate</rs> arch, and to commemorate the sacrifices of those who died in the defence of our inherited and <quote>inalienable</quote> rights.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4149"/>What though we were overborne by numbers and accessories not less efficient, truth is not to be measured by success in maintaining it against force; nor is the glory less of him who upholds it in the face of unequal <pb id="p.303" n="303"/> odds, but is it not rather more to his credit that he counted all else as dust in the balance when weighed with honor and duty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4150"/>On many a stricken field our soldiers stood few and faint, but fearless still, for they wore the panoply of unquestioning confidence in the rectitude of their cause, and knew how to die but not to surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4151"/>Let not any of their survivors impugn their faith by offering the penitential plea that <quote>they believed they were right..</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4152"/>It is meet that this monument should have originated with the ladies of the land, whose self-denial was conspicuous through all the tri'als and sufferings of war, whose gentle ministrations in the hospitals and at the wayside refectories so largely contributed to relieve the sick and the wounded, and whose unfaltering devotion to their country's cause in the darkest hours of our struggle illustrated the fidelity of the sex which was last at the cross and <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> at the sepulchre.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4153"/>I am profoundly thankful to them for inviting me to represent them as their orator on the approaching occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4154"/>Had it been practicable to accept, their request would have been to me a command, obeyed with no other reluctance than the consciousness of inability to do justice to the theme.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4155"/>Thanks to the merits of our Confederate dead, they need neither orator nor bard to commend their deeds to the present generation of their countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4156"/>Many fell far from home and kindred, and sleep in unmarked graves, but all are gathered in the love of those for whom they died, and their memories are hallowed in the hearts of all true Confederates.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4157"/>By the pious efforts of our people many humble cemeteries &mdash; such as, in their impoverishment, were possible &mdash; have been prepared, and the <rs>Confederate</rs> dead have been collected in them from neighboring battlefields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4162"/>the answer is, They do not need it, but posterity may. It is not their reward, but our debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4163"/>If the greatest gift a hero gives his race is to have been a hero in order that this gift may be utilized to coming generations, its appreciation by cotemporaries should be rendered as visible and enduring as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4164"/>Let the monument, rising from earth toward heaven, lift the minds of those who come after us to a higher standard than the common test of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4165"/>Let it teach that man is born for duty, not for expediency; that when an attack is made on the community to which he belongs, by which he is protected, and to which his allegiance is due, his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> obligation is to defend that community; and that under such conditions it is better to have <quote>fought and lost than never to have fought at all.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4166"/>Let posterity learn by this monument that you commemorate men who died in a defensive war; that they did not, as has been idly stated, submit to the arbitrament of arms the questions at issue-questions which involved the inalienable rights inherited from their ancestors and held in trust for their posterity; but that they strove to maintain the <rs>State</rs> sovereignty which their fathers left them, and which it was their duty, if possible, to transmit to their children.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4167"/>Away, then, with such feeble excuses for the abandonment of principles which may be crushed for awhile, but which, possessing the eternal vitality of truth, must in its own good time prevail over perishable error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4168"/><pb id="p.304" n="304"/> Let this monument teach that heroism derives its lustre from the justice of the cause in which it is displayed, and let it mark the difference between a war waged for the robber-like purpose of conquest and <num value="1">one</num> to repel invasion &mdash; to defend a people's hearths and altars, and to maintain their laws and liberties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4169"/>Such was the war in which our heroes fell, and theirs is the crown which sparkles with the gems of patriotism and righteousness, with a glory undimmed by any motive of aggrandizement or intent to inflict ruin on others.
