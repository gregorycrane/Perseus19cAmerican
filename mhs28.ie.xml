Another improvement he suggested was to round up the ends of the main transom, thereby relieving the quarters and thus making the after-body finer and the stern above the water-line much lighter and handsomer.<note anchored="yes">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>It was our liberty, not theirs alone, for which they risked all they had to give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>It is therefore fitting that we evidence our remembrance of these men by a memorial more permanent than the spoken word or the gathering of the day.
