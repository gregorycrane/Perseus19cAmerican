<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>A history of the military operations of the troops raised in the <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">State of Mississippi</placeName> during the war of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> should embrace their operations within the <rs>State</rs> and wherever they participated in battles fought in other States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Before proceeding to discharge this duty (assigned to the writer), it is proper to make a brief statement of the reasons which impelled the <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">State of Mississippi</placeName> to dissolve her connection with the <rs>Federal</rs> government, as expressed in her legislature, and more solemnly in her <orgName n="Sovereign Convention" type="convention">sovereign convention</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Our forefathers, in their solemn <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> which severed the ties that bound them to the mother country, declared: <q direct="unspecified">That these colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent States.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>They waged the <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> war of the <name>Revolution</name> to maintain this declaration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>They succeeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>When they came to form a civil government to protect the liberties thus dearly achieved, they refused to give the general or federal government, created under the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation, the power of taxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>The war of the <name>Revolution</name> had been waged by them to free the colonies from <q direct="unspecified">unjust, onerous and oppressive taxation without representation.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>It was doubtless this recollection, fresh in their minds, which prompted them to deny the power of taxation to the newly constructed confederacy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>A very few years sufficed to show that a general or federal government, dependent on the voluntary quota of <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> taxes to be furnished by each State, and without the power of taxation, could not be self-sustaining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The <orgName n="Continental Congress" type="congress">Continental Congress</orgName> passed an act authorizing a convention of all the original <num value="13">thirteen</num> States, to assemble at <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct> to adopt a new constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The convention, presided over by <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n0264.0001.00004.00002" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>, adopted the new constitution known as the <rs>Constitution</rs> of <dateStruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></dateStruct>, and in accordance with its own provisions submitted it to the several States for their adoption or rejection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Let it at once be noted that by the very terms of this constitution, it was to become a constitution over the <name>States</name> only <q direct="unspecified">when <num value="9">nine</num> of the original <num value="13">thirteen</num> States should, in convention assembled, adopt the same;</q> thus placing it in the power of <num value="4">four</num> of the smallest of the original <num value="13">thirteen</num> States, with an insignificant and sparse population, to have defeated its adoption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It is also important to observe that this Constitution of <dateStruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></dateStruct> further provided, that when adopted <q direct="unspecified">by <num value="9">nine</num> of the original <num value="13">thirteen</num> States it should only be operative and binding on the <name>States</name> so ratifying the same.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Each State ratified the <rs>Constitution</rs> for itself, by itself, and was bound only by its own ratification.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>So, when the rights and liberties of the <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">State of Mississippi</placeName> and other Southern States were invaded by unlawful conspiracies and combinations to destroy their property and disturb their domestic tranquillity, what was more natural than that they should declare, as they acceded to the <rs>Union</rs> of their own right and free will to secure liberty and the peaceable possession of their property, when this was denied them they had the right of secession?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>When the war closed we surrendered by capitulation, with arms in our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>What were the terms of the capitulation with <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0264.0001.00004.00003" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:2"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName> and <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0264.0001.00004.00004" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>They were that the <rs>Confederates</rs> should furl their flags, stack their arms, return to their homes and yield obedience to the <rs>Constitution</rs> and laws of the <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> Union then existing; and it was stipulated on the other side, that they should have the protection of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and laws of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>That the <rs>Confederates</rs> kept the terms of their capitulation, no <num value="1">one</num> will be heard to deny.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The question soon arose as to how the seceded States were to be brought back into the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It was at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attempted to effect this by force, and on this plan military commanders were assigned to duty as governors over the seceded States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>This proved a failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>It was then attempted to rehabilitate the seceded States by unjust and oppressive reconstruction laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>This, too, proved a failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States government</orgName> had at last to recognize the great principle of home rule and community independence, which is the corner stone of the <rs>Constitution</rs> of <dateStruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></dateStruct>, and allow the <name>States</name>, in their own conventions, to resume their places in the <rs>Union</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The sovereign power and entity of the <name>States</name> had not been destroyed by the secession of the <name>States</name>, nor had it been destroyed by the terrible <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> war between the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> itself, that august tribunal to whose ultimate decisions all good citizens bow, declared in the celebrated case of <persName n="Garland,,,,," id="n0264.0001.00005.00005" reg="mostcommon:Garland,W.,H.,,:1"><surname>Garland</surname></persName> that this was <q direct="unspecified">an indissoluble Union, composed of indestructible States.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>And so the termination of the war found <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> and all the <rs>Southern States</rs> with indestructible sovereignties still theirs, and yielding a willing obedience to the laws of the <rs>Union</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Having thus prefaced my task with a brief resume of the causes of the war, I proceed to show, in detail, the civil action of the <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">State of Mississippi</placeName> and the history of the troops in the field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The reasons that moved Mississippians to withdraw from the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> were given by themselves in their legislative as well as their sovereign capacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Before presenting these reasons, however, and for the purpose of comparison hereafter, and to show the unanimity with which the people acted, an observation or <num value="2">two</num> may <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> be deemed necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The threatened invasion of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> soil, the assailment of their right of property and its possible ultimate destruction, caused Whig and Democrat to stand shoulder to shoulder and hand to hand in support of a common cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The report of the auditor of public accounts of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> for the year <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> shows that there were <num value="60001">60,001</num> free white polls between <num value="21">21</num> and <measure n="50years" type="date">50 years</measure> of age in the <rs>State</rs>, and <num value="415689">415,689</num> slaves under <measure n="60years" type="date">60 years</measure> of age. In a memorial of the legislature to the <orgName n="Provisional Congress" type="congress">Provisional Congress of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName></orgName>, adopted <dateStruct value="1861-07-29"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="29">29</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, it is stated that fully <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> of the entire cotton crop, averaging <measure n="40dollars" type="currency">$40</measure> per bale, was gathered from the soil of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, and that at the time of separation the people were in a prosperous condition.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>In the momentous step which our State has taken, of dissolving its connection with the government of which we so long formed a part, it is but just that we should declare the prominent reasons which have induced our course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery&mdash;e greatest material interest of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of the commerce of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and, by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition or a dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>That we do not overstate the dangers to our institution, a reference to a few unquestionable facts will sufficiently prove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The hostility to this institution commenced before the adoption of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and was manifested in the well known ordinance of <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct> in regard to the <rs type="place">Northwestern Territory</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The feeling increased until, in <dateStruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></dateStruct>, it deprived the <rs>South</rs> of more than half the vast territory acquired from <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The same hostility dismembered <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> and seized upon all the territory acquired from <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>It has grown until it denies the right of property in slaves and refuses protection to that right on the high seas, in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, and wherever the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> has jurisdiction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>It refuses the admission of new slave States into the <rs>Union</rs>, and seeks to extinguish it by confining it within <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> its present limits, denying the power of expansion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>It tramples the original equality of the <rs>South</rs> under foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>It has nullified the <rs>Fugitive Slave Law</rs> in almost every free State in the <rs>Union</rs>, and has utterly broken the compact which our fathers pledged their faith to maintain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>It advocates negro equality, socially and politically, and promotes insurrection and incendiarism in our midst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>It has enlisted its press, its pulpits and its schools against us, until the whole popular mind of the <rs>North</rs> is excited and inflamed with prejudice.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>It has made combinations and formed associations to carry out its schemes of emancipation in the <name>States</name> and wherever else slavery exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>It seeks not to elevate or support the slave, but to destroy his present condition without providing a better.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>It has invaded a State and invested with honors a wretch whose purpose was to apply flames to our dwellings and the weapons of destruction to our lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>It has broken every compact into which it has entered for our security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>It has given indubitable evidence of its design to ruin our agriculture, to prostrate our industrial pursuits and to destroy our social system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>It knows no relenting or hesitation in its purposes; it stops not in its march of aggression, and leaves us no room to hope for cessation or for pause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>It has recently obtained control of the government by the prosecution of its unhallowed schemes, and destroyed the last expectation of living together in friendship and brotherhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Utter subjugation awaits us in the <rs>Union</rs>, if we should consent longer to remain in it. It is not a matter of choice, but of necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>We must either submit to degradation and to the loss of property worth <num value="4">four</num> billions of money, or we must secede from the <rs>Union</rs> framed by our fathers to secure this as well as other species of property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>For far less cause than this, our fathers separated from the crown of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Our decision is made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>We follow in their footsteps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>We embrace the alternative of separation and, for the reasons here stated, we resolve to maintain our rights, with the full consciousness of the justice of our course and the undoubting belief of our ability to maintain it.</p></quote> </p>
