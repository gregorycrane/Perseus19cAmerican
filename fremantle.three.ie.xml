<head>Preface.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>At the outbreak of the <rs>American</rs> war, in common with many of my countrymen, I felt very indifferent as to which side might win; but if I had any bias, my sympathies were rather in favor of the <rs>North</rs>, on account of the dislike which an Englishman naturally feels at the idea of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>But soon a sentiment of great admiration for the gallantry and determination of the <name>Southerners</name>, together with the unhappy contrast afforded by the foolish bullying conduct of the <name>Northerners</name>, caused a complete revulsion in my feelings, and I was unable to repress a strong wish to go to <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> and see something of this wonderful struggle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Having successfully accomplished my design, I returned to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and found amongst all my friends an extreme desire to know the truth of what was going on in the <rs>South</rs>; for, in consequence of the blockade, the truth can with difficulty be arrived at, as intelligence coming mainly through Northern sources is not believed; and, in fact, nowhere is the <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> ignorance of what is passing in the <rs>South</rs> more profound than it is in the <rs>Northern States</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>In consequence of a desire often expressed, I now publish the <name>Diary</name> which I endeavored, as well as I could, to keep up day by day during my travels throughout the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>I have not attempted to conceal any of the peculiarities or defects of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Many persons will doubtless highly disapprove of some of their customs and habits in the wilder portion of the country; but I think no generous man, whatever may be his political opinions, can do otherwise than admire the courage, energy, and patriotism of the whole population, and the skill of its leaders, in this struggle against great odds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>And I am also of opinion that many will agree with me in thinking that a people in which all ranks and both sexes display a unanimity and a heroism which can never have been surpassed in the history of the world, is destined, sooner or later, to become a great and independent nation. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2547"/>At <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> I saw a train containing <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> Confederate prisoners, who were being stared at by a large number of the <hi rend="italics">beau monde</hi> of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2548"/>I mingled with the crowd which was chaffing them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2552"/>The greenbacks seem to be nearly as good as gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2553"/>The streets are as full as possible of well-dressed people, and are crowded with able-bodied <pb id="p.299" n="299"/> civilians capable of bearing arms, who have evidently no intention of doing so. They apparently <hi rend="italics">don't feel the war at all</hi> here; and until there is a grand smash with their money, or some other catastrophe to make them feel it, I can easily imagine that they will not be anxious to make peace. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2554"/>I walked the whole distance of <placeName key="tgn,2110813" n="1.000 2" reg="broadway, rockingham, virginia">Broadway</placeName> to the <rs type="place">Consul's house</rs>, and nothing could exceed the apparent prosperity; the street was covered with banners and placards inviting people to enlist in various highsounding regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2555"/>Bounties of <measure n="550dollars" type="currency">$550</measure> were offered, and huge pictures hung across the street, on which numbers of ragged <hi rend="italics">Graybacks</hi>,<note anchored="yes" id="n.299.1">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2557"/>On returning to the <address><street n="5 Avenue">Fifth Avenue</street></address>, I found all the shopkeepers beginning to close their stores, and I perceived by degrees that there was great alarm about the resistance to the draft which was going on this morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2558"/>On reaching the hotel I perceived a whole block of buildings on fire close by: engines were present, but were not allowed to play by the crowd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2559"/>In the hotel itself, universal consternation prevailed, and an attack by the mob had been threatened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2560"/>I walked about in the neighborhood, and saw a company of soldiers on the march, who were being jeered at and <pb id="p.300" n="300"/> hooted by small boys, and I saw a negro pursued by the crowd take refuge with the military; he was followed by loud cries of <quote>Down with the b &mdash; y nigger!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2561"/>Kill all niggers!</quote> &amp;c. Never having been in New York before, and being totally ignorant of the state of feeling with regard to negroes, I inquired of a bystander what the negroes had done that they should want to kill them He replied civilly enough-<quote>Oh sir, they hate them here; they are the innocent cause of all these troubles.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2562"/>Shortly afterwards, I saw a troop of citizen cavalry come up; the troopers were very gorgeously attired, but evidently experienced so much difficulty in sitting their horses, that they were more likely to excite laughter than any other emotion.</p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2564"/>I love my country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2566"/>I suggested an interview with <persName n="Archibald,Mister,,,," id="n0017.0007.00300.01414" reg="mostcommon:Archibald,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Archibald</surname></persName>, but neither of them seemed to care about going to the <hi rend="italics">Counsel</hi> just yet.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2567"/>I heard every <num value="1">one</num> talking of the total demoralization of the <rs>Rebels</rs> as a certain fact, and all seemed to anticipate <pb id="p.301" n="301"/> their approaching destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2570"/>I was filled with astonishment to hear the people speaking in this confident manner, when <num value="1">one</num> of their most prosperous States had been so recently laid under contribution as far as <placeName reg="Harrisburg, Dauphin, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013694">Harrisburg</placeName>; and <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, their capital itself, having just been saved by a fortunate turn of luck.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2572"/>The consternation in the streets seemed to be on the increase; fires were going on in all directions, and the streets were being patrolled by large bodies of police followed by special constables, the latter <pb id="p.302" n="302"/> bearing truncheons, but not looking very happy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2573"/>I heard a British captain making a deposition before the <rs>Consul</rs>, to the effect that the mob had got on board his vessel, and cruelly beaten his colored crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2574"/>As no <name>British</name> man-of-war was present, the <rs>French Admiral</rs> was appealed to, who at once requested that all <name>British</name> ships with colored crews might be anchored under the guns of his frigate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2575"/>The reports of outrages, hangings, and murder, were now most alarming, the terror and anxiety were universal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2576"/>All shops were shut: all carriages and omnibuses had ceased running.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2577"/>No colored man or woman was visible or safe in the streets, or even in his own dwelling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2578"/>Telegraphs were cut, and railroad tracks torn up. The draft was suspended, and the mob evidently had the upper hand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2579"/>The people who can't pay <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">$300</measure> naturally hate being forced to fight in order to liberate the very race who they are most anxious should be slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2580"/>It is their direct interest not only that all slaves should remain slaves, but that the free Northern negroes who compete with them for labor should be sent to the <rs>South</rs> also.</p></div2>

<head>Postscript.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2586"/>During my voyage home in the <rs>China</rs>, I had an opportunity of discussing with many intelligent Northern gentlemen all that I had seen in my Southern travels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2587"/>We did so in a very amicable spirit, and I think they rendered justice to my wish to explain to them without exaggeration the state of feeling amongst their enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2588"/>Although these Northerners belonged to quite the upper classes, and were not likely to be led blindly by the absurd nonsense of the sensation press at New York, yet their ignorance of the state of the case in the <rs>South</rs> was very great. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2589"/>The recent successes had given them the impression that the last card of the <rs>South</rs> was played.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2590"/><placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> was about to fall; <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Wilmington River, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,2775185">Wilmington</placeName> would quickly follow; <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0017.0008.00305.01417" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> they thought, was a disheartened, disorganized mob; <orgName n="army"><persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0017.0008.00305.01418" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:1"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> in a still worse condition, fleeing before <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n0017.0008.00305.01419" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>, who would carry every thing before him. They felt confident that the fall of the <rs>Mississippian</rs> <pb id="p.306" n="306"/> fortresses would prevent communication from <num value="1">one</num> bank to the other, and that the great river would soon be open to peaceful commerce. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2591"/>All these illusions have since been dispelled, but they probably still cling to the idea of the great exhaustion of the <rs>Southern</rs> <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2592"/>But this difficulty of recruiting the <rs>Southern</rs> armies is not so great as is generally supposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2593"/>As I have already stated, no Confederate soldier is given his discharge from the army, however badly he may be wounded; but he is employed at such labor in the public service as he may be capable of performing, and his place in the ranks is taken by a sound man hitherto exempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2594"/>The slightly wounded are cured as quickly as possible, and are sent back at once to their regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2595"/><hi rend="italics">The women take care of this</hi>. The number actually killed, or who die of their wounds, are the only total losses to the <rs>State</rs>, and these form but a small proportion of the enormous butcher's bills which seem at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> so very appalling. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2596"/>I myself remember, with <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Polk,General,,,," id="n0017.0008.00306.01420" reg="mostcommon:Polk,Leonidas,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName>, a fine-looking man who had had both his hands blown off at the wrists by unskilful artillery-practice in <num value="1">one</num> of the early battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2597"/>A currycomb and brush were fitted into his stumps, and he was engaged in grooming artillery-horses with considerable skill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2598"/>This man was called an hostler; and, as the war drags on, the number of these handless hostlers will increase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2599"/>By <pb id="p.307" n="307"/> degrees the clerks at the offices, the orderlies, the railway and <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName> officials, and the stage-drivers, will be composed of maimed and mutilated soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2600"/>The number of exempted persons all over the <rs>South</rs> is still very large, and they can easily be exchanged for worn veterans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2601"/>Besides this fund to draw upon, a calculation is made of the number of boys who arrive each year at the fighting age. These are all <quote>panting for the rifle,</quote> but have been latterly wisely forbidden the ranks until they are fit to undergo the hardships of a military life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2602"/>By these means, it is the opinion of the <rs>Confederates</rs> that they can keep their armies recruited up to their present strength for several years; and, if the worst comes to the worst, they can always fall back upon their negroes as the last resort; but I do not think they contemplate such a necessity as likely to arise for a considerable time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2603"/>With respect to the supply of arms, cannon, powder, and military stores, the <rs>Confederates</rs> are under no alarm whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2604"/><placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> furnishes more than sufficient gunpowder; <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, copper caps, &amp;c. The <orgName n="Tredegar Works" type="works">Tredegar works</orgName> at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and other foundries, cast more cannon than is wanted; and the <rs>Federal</rs> generals have always hitherto proved themselves the most indefatigable purveyors of artillery to the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, for even in those actions which they claim as drawn battles or as victories, <pb id="p.308" n="308"/> such as <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7014175" n="1.000 17" reg="murfreesborough, rutherford, tennessee">Murfreesborough</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, they have never failed to make over cannon to the <name>Southerners</name> without exacting any in return. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2605"/>My Northern friends on board the <rs type="ship">China</rs> spoke much and earnestly about the determination of the <rs>North</rs> to crush out the <rs>Rebellion</rs> at any sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2606"/>But they did not show any disposition <hi rend="italics">to fight themselves</hi> in this cause, although many of them would have made most eligible recruits; and if they had been Southerners, their female relations would have made them enter the army whether their inclinations led them that way or not. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2607"/>I do not mention this difference of spirit by way of making any odious comparisons between <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> in this respect, because I feel sure that these Northern gentlemen would emulate the example of their enemy if they could foresee any danger of a Southern <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n0017.0008.00308.01421" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> exercising his infamous sway over <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, or of a Confederate <persName n="Milroy,,,,," id="n0017.0008.00308.01422" reg="mostcommon:Milroy,nomatch:0"><surname>Milroy</surname></persName> ruling with intolerable despotism in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, by withholding the necessaries of life from helpless women with <num value="1">one</num> hand, whilst tendering them with the other a hated and absurd oath of allegiance to a detested Government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2608"/>But the mass of respectable Northerners, though they may be willing to pay, do not very naturally feel themselves called upon to give their blood in a war of aggression, ambition, and conquest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2609"/>For this war is essentially a war of conquest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2610"/>If ever a nation <pb id="p.309" n="309"/> did wage such a war, the <rs>North</rs> is now engaged, with a determination worthy of a more hopeful cause, in endeavoring to conquer the <rs>South</rs>; but the more I think of all that I have seen in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> of the devotion of the whole population, the more I feel inclined to say with <persName n="Polk,General,,,," id="n0017.0008.00309.01423" reg="mostcommon:Polk,Leonidas,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName>-<quote>How, can you subjugate such a people as this?</quote>
