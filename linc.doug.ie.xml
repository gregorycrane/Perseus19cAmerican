<argument> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>The following speech was delivered at <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield, Ill.</placeName>, at the close of the <rs>Republican</rs> <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State Convention</orgName> held at that time and place, and by which Convention <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0001.00001.00002" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had been named as their candidate for <persName n="Senator,,U.,S.,," id="n0024.0001.00001.00003" reg="default:Senator,U.,S.,,"><foreName>U.</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Senator</surname></persName>. <persName n="Douglas,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0001.00001.00004" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> was not present.</p></argument> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/><emph><rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, and Gentlemen of the <rs>Convention</rs></emph>: If we could <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> know where we are, and whither we are tending, we could better judge what to do, and how to do it. We are now far into the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> year, since a policy was initiated with the avowed object, and confident promise, of putting an end to slavery agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Under the operation of that policy, that agitation has not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>In my opinion, it will not cease, until a crisis shall have been reached and passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/><quote>A house divided against itself cannot stand,</quote> I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>I do not expect the <rs>Union</rs> to be dissolved &mdash; I do not expect the house to fall-but I do expect it will cease to be divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>It will become all <num value="1">one</num> thing, or all the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it. where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction ; or its advocates will push it forward, till it shall become alike lawful in all the <name>States</name>, old as well as new-North as well as South. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Have we no tendency to the latter condition? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Let any <num value="1">one</num> who doubts, carefully contemplate that now almost complete legal combination-piece of machinery, so to speak-compounded of the <rs>Nebraska</rs> doctrine, and the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Let him consider not only what work the machinery is adapted to do, and how well adapted ; but also, let him study the history of its construction, and trace, if he can, or rather fail, if he can, to trace the evidences of design, and concert of action, among its chief architects, from the beginning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The new year of <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct> found slavery excluded from more than half the <name>States</name> by State Constitutions, and from most of the national territory by Congressional prohibition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/><measure n="4days" type="date">Four days</measure> later, commenced the struggle which ended in repealing that Congressional prohibition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>This opened all the national territory to slavery, and was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> point gained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>But, so far, Congress only had acted ; and an indorsement by the people, real or apparent, was indispensable, to save the point already gained, and give chance for more. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>This necessity had not been overlooked; but had been provided for, as well as might be, in the notable argument of <quote>squatter sovereignty,</quote> otherwise called <quote><pb id="p.2" n="2"/> sacred right of self-government,</quote> which latter phrase, though expressive of the only rightful basis of any government, was so perverted in this attempted use of it as to amount to just this: That if any <num value="1">one</num> man choose to enslave <hi rend="italics">another</hi> no <hi rend="italics"><num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></hi> man shall be allowed to object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>That argument was incorporated into the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill itself, in the language which follows : <quote>It being the true intent and meaning or this act not to legislate every into any Territory or State, nor to exclude it therefrom; but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Then opened the roar of loose declamation in favor of <quote><persName n="Sovereignty,,Squatter,,," id="n0024.0001.00002.00005" reg="default:Sovereignty,Squatter,,,"><foreName>Squatter</foreName> <surname>Sovereignty</surname></persName>,</quote> and <quote>sacred right of self-government.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/><quote>But,</quote> said opposition members, <quote>let us amend the bill so as to expressly declare that the people of the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> may exclude slavery.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/><quote>Not we,</quote> said the friends of the measure ; and down they voted the amendment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>While the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill was passing through Congress, a <hi rend="italics">law case</hi> involving the question of a negro's freedom, by reason of his owner having voluntarily taken him <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> into a free State and then into a Territory covered by the <name>Congressional</name> prohibition, and held him as a slave for a long time in each, was passing through the <orgName n="U. S. Circuit Court" type="org">U. S. Circuit Court</orgName> for the <orgName n="District of Missouri" type="district">District of Missouri</orgName> ; and both <placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> bill and law suit, were brought to a decision in the same month of <dateStruct value="1554-05-"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1554">1554</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The negro's name was <quote><persName n="Scott,,Dred,,," id="n0024.0001.00002.00006" reg="default:Scott,Dred,,,"><foreName>Dred</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>,</quote> which name now designates the decision finally made in the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Before the then next Presidential election, the law case came to, and was argued in, the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName> ; but the decision of it was deferred until after the election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Still, before the election, <persName n="Trumbull,Senator,,,," id="n0024.0001.00002.00007" reg="mostcommon:Trumbull,Lyman,,,:7"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Trumbull</surname></persName>, on the floor of the <name>Senate</name>, requested the leading advocate of the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill to state his <hi rend="italics">opinion</hi> whether the people of a Territory can constitutionally exclude slavery from their limits ; and the latter answers : <quote>That is. A question for the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/></p> 
<p>The election came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/><persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0001.00002.00008" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:8"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> was elected, and the indorsement, such as it was, secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>That was the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> point gained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The indorsement, however, fell short of a clear popular majority by nearly <num value="400000">four hundred thousand</num> votes, and so, perhaps, was not overwhelmingly reliable and satisfactory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The outgoing <rs>President</rs>, in his last annual message, as impressively as possible echoed back upon the people the weight and authority of the indorsement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> met again ; did not announce their decision, but ordered a re-argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The Presidential inauguration came, and still no decision of the court ; but the incoming <rs>President</rs> in his inaugural address, fervently exhorted the people to abide by the forthcoming decision, whatever it might be. Then, in a few days, came the decision. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The reputed author of the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill finds an early occasion to make a speech at this capital indorsing the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision, and vehemently denouncing all opposition to it. The new <rs>President</rs>, too, seizes the early occasion of the <name>Silliman</name> letter to indorse and strongly construe that decision, and to express his astonishment that any different view had ever been entertained! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>At length a squabble springs up between the <rs>President</rs> and the author of the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill, on the mere question of <hi rend="italics">fact</hi>, whether the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> was or was not, in any just sense, made by the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> ; and in that quarrel the latter declares that all he wants is a fair vote for the people, and that he cares not whether slavery be voted <hi rend="italics">down</hi> or voted <hi rend="italics">up</hi>. I do not understand his declaration that he cares not whether slavery be voted down or voted up, to be intended by him other than as an apt definition of the policy he would impress upon the public mind &mdash; the principle for which he declares he has suffered so much, and, is ready to suffer to the end. And well may he cling to that principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>If he has any parental feeling, well may he cling to it. That principle is the only shred left of his original <placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Under the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision <quote>squatter sovereignty</quote> squatted out of existence, tumbled down like temporary scaffolding-like the mould at the foundry served through <num value="1">one</num> blast and fell back into loose sand-helped to carry an election, and then was kicked to the winds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>His late joint struggle with the <name>Republicans</name>, against the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>, <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> involves nothing of the original <placeName key="tgn,7007525" n="1.000 51" reg="nebraska">Nebraska</placeName> doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>That struggle was made on a point &mdash; the right of a people to make their own constitution &mdash; upon which he and the <name>Republicans</name> have never differed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The several points of the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision, in connection with <persName n="Douglas,Senator,,,," id="n0024.0001.00003.00009" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s <quote>care not</quote> policy, constitute the piece of machinery, in its present, state of advancement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>This was the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> point gained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The working points of that machinery are: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, That no negro slave, imported as such from <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, and no descendant of such slave, can ever be a citizen of any State, in the sense of that term as used in the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>This point is made in order to deprive the negro, in every possible event, of the benefit of that provision of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">United States Constitution</rs>, which declares that <quote>The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/></p> 
<p>Secondly, That <quote>subject to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>,</quote> neither Congress nor a <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> can exclude slavery from any <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>This point is made in order that individual men may fill up the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> with slaves, without, danger of losing them as property, and thus to enhance the chances of permanency to the institution through all the future. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Thirdly, That whether the holding a negro in actual slavery in a free State, makes him free, as against the holder, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> courts will not decide but will leave to be decided by the courts of any slave State the negro may be forced into by the master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>This point is made, not to be pressed immediately; but, if acquiesced in for awhile, and apparently indorsed by the people at an election, then to sustain the logical conclusion that what <persName n="Scott,,Dred,,," id="n0024.0001.00003.00010" reg="default:Scott,Dred,,,"><foreName>Dred</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>'s master might lawfully do with <persName n="Scott,,Dred,,," id="n0024.0001.00003.00011" reg="default:Scott,Dred,,,"><foreName>Dred</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, in the free <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">State of Illinois</placeName>, every other master may lawfully do with any other <num value="1">one</num>, or <num value="1000">one thousand</num> slaves, in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, or in any other free State. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Auxiliary to all this, and working hand in hand with it, the <rs>Nebraska</rs> doctrine, or what is left of it, is to educate and mould public opinion, at least Northern public opinion, not to care whether slavery is voted down or voted up. This shows exactly where we now are ; and partially, also, whither we are tending. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>It will throw additional light on the, latter, to go back, and run the mind over the string of historical facts already stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Several things will now appear less dark and mysterious than they did when they were transpiring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The people were to be left <quote>perfectly free,</quote> <quote>subject only to the <rs>Constitution</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>What the <rs>Constitution</rs> had to do with it, outsiders could not then see. Plainly enough now, it was an exactly fitted niche, for the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision to afterward come in, and declare the perfect freedom of the people to be just no freedom at all. Why was the amendment, expressly declaring the right of the people, voted down?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Plainly enough now : the adoption of it would have spoiled the niche for the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Why was the court decision held up?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Why even a <rs type="role2">Senator</rs>'s individual opinion withheld, till after the <name>Presidential</name> election?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Plainly enough now : the speaking out then would have damaged the perfectly free argument upon which the election was to be carried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Why the outgoing <rs>President</rs>'s felicitation on the indorsement?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Why the delay of a reargument?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Why the incoming <rs>President</rs>'s advance exhortation in favor of the decision?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>These things look like the cautious patting and petting of a spirited horse preparatory to mounting him, when it is dreaded that he may give the rider a fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>And why the hasty after-indorsement of the decision by the <rs>President</rs> and others? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>We cannot absolutely know that all these exact adaptations are the result of preconcert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>But when we see a lot of framed timbers, different portions of which we know have been gotten out at different times and places and by different workmen &mdash; <persName><foreName>Stephen</foreName></persName>, <persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n0024.0001.00003.00012" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,nomatch:0"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName>, <persName><foreName>Roger</foreName></persName> and <persName><foreName>James</foreName></persName>, for instance-and when we see these timbers joined together, and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill, all the tenons and mortices exactly fitting and all the lengths and proportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their respective places, and not a piece too many or too few &mdash; not omitting even scaffolding-or, if a single piece be lacking, we see the place in the frame exactly fitted and prepared yet to bring such piece in &mdash; in such a case, we find it impossible not to believe that <persName><foreName>Stephen</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n0024.0001.00003.00013" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,nomatch:0"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName> and <persName><foreName>Roger</foreName></persName> and <persName><foreName>James</foreName></persName> <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> all understood <num value="1">one</num> another from the beginning, and all worked upon a common plan or, draft drawn up before the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blow was struck. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>It should not be overlooked that, by the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill, the people of a <hi rend="italics">State</hi> as well as Territory, were to be left <quote>perfectly free,</quote> <quote>subject only to the <rs>Constitution</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Why mention a State?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>They were legislating for Territories, and not for or about states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Certainly the people of a State are and ought to be subject to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> ; but why is mention of this lugged into this merely Territorial law?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Why are the people of a Territory and the people of a State therein lumped together, and their relation to the <rs>Constitution</rs> therein treated as being precisely the same?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>While the opinion of the court, by <persName n="Taney,Chief-Justice,,,," id="n0024.0001.00004.00014" reg="mostcommon:Taney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</roleName> <surname>Taney</surname></persName>, in the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> case, and the separate opinions of all the concurring Judges, expressly declare that the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> neither permits Congress nor a <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> to exclude slavery from any <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> Territory, they all omit to declare whether or not the same Constitution permits a State, or the people of a State, to exclude it. <hi rend="italics">Possibly</hi> this is a mere omission; but who can be quite sure, if <persName n="McLean,,,,," id="n0024.0001.00004.00015" reg="mostcommon:McLean,nomatch:0"><surname>McLean</surname></persName> or <persName n="Curtis,,,,," id="n0024.0001.00004.00016" reg="mostcommon:Curtis,nomatch:0"><surname>Curtis</surname></persName> had sought to get into the opinion a declaration of unlimited power in the people of a State to exclude slavery from their limits, limits as <persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n0024.0001.00004.00017" reg="mostcommon:Chase,Giddings,,,:1"><surname>Chase</surname></persName> and <persName n="Mace,,,,," id="n0024.0001.00004.00018" reg="mostcommon:Mace,nomatch:0"><surname>Mace</surname></persName> sought to get such declaration, in behalf of the people of a Territory, into the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill ; I ask, who can be quite sure that it would not have been voted down in the <num value="1">one</num> case as it had been in the other?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The nearest approach to the point of declaring the power of a State over slavery, is made by <persName n="Nelson,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0001.00004.00019" reg="mostcommon:Nelson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Nelson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>He approaches it more than once, using the precise idea, and almost the language, too, of the <rs>Nebraska</rs> act. On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, his exact language is, <quote>except in cases where the power is restrained by the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, the law of the <rs>State</rs> is supreme over the subject of slavery within its jurisdiction.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>In what cases the power of the <name>States</name> is so restrained by the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">United States Constitution</rs>, is left an open question, precisely as the same question, as to the restraint on the power of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, was left open in the <rs>Nebraska</rs> act. Put this and that together, and we have another nice little niche, which we may, ere long see filled with another <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> decision, declaring that the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> does not permit a <hi rend="italics">State</hi> to exclude slavery from its limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>And this may especially be expected if the doctrine of <quote>care not whether slavery be voted down or voted up,</quote> shall gain upon the public mind sufficiently to give promise that such a decision can be maintained when made. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Such a decision is all that slavery now lacks of being alike lawful in all the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Welcome, or unwelcome, such decision is probably coming, and will soon be upon us, unless the power of the present political dynasty shall be met and overthrown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>We shall lie down pleasantly dreaming that the people of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> are on the verge of making their State free, and we shall awake to the reality instead, that the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> has made <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> a slave State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>To meet and overthrow the power of that dynasty, is the work now before all those who would prevent that consummation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>That is what we have to do. How can we best do it? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>There are those who denounce us openly to their own friends, and yet whisper us softly, that <persName n="Douglas,Senator,,,," id="n0024.0001.00004.00020" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> is the aptest instrument there is with which to affect that object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>They wish us to <hi rend="italics">infer</hi> all, from the fact that he now has a little quarrel with the present head of the dynasty ; and that he has regularly voted with us on a single point upon which he and we have never differed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>They remind us that he is a great man, and that the largest of us are very small ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Let this be granted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>But <quote>a living dog is better than a dead lion.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/><persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0001.00004.00021" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, if not a dead lion, for this work, is at least a caged and toothless <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>How can he oppose the advances of slavery?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>I have not the vanity to believe that it is any personal compliment to me. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>It is an expression of your devotion to that great principle of self-government, to <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> which my life for many years past has been, and in the future will be, devoted.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>When I found an effort, being made during the recent session of Congress to force a Constitution upon the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> against their will, and to force that State into the <rs>Union</rs> with a Constitution which her people had rejected by more than <num value="10000">10,000</num> I felt bound as a man of honor and a representative of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, bound by every consideration of duty, of fidelity, and of patriotism, to resist to the utmost of my power the consummation of that fraud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>With others I did resist it, and resisted it successfully until the attempt was abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>We forced them to refer that Constitution back to the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, to be accepted, or rejected as they shall decide at an election, which is fixed for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Monday in <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>It is true that the mode of reference and the form of the submission, was not such as I could sanction with my vote, for the reason that it discriminated between Free States and Slave States ; providing that if <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> consented to come in under the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> it should be received with a population of <num value="35000">35,000</num>; but. that if she demanded another Constitution, more consistent with the sentiments of her people and their feelings, that it should not be received into the <rs>Union</rs> until she has <num value="93420">93,420</num> inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>I did not consider that mode of submission fair, for the reason that any election is a mockery which is not free &mdash; that any election is a fraud upon the rights of the people which holds out inducements for affirmative votes, and threatens penalties for negative votes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>But whilst I was not satisfied with the mode of submission, whilst I resisted it to the last, demanding a fair, a just, a free mode of submission, still, when the law passed placing it within the power of the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> at that election to reject the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>, and then make another in harmony with their principles and their opinions, I did not believe that either the penalties on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, or the inducements on the other, would force that people to accept a Constitution to which they arc irreconcilably opposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>All I can say is, that if their votes can be controlled by such considerations, all the sympathy which has been expended upon them has been misplaced, and all the efforts that have been made in defense of their right to self-government have been made in an unworthy cause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>Hence, my friends, I regard the <name>Lecompton</name> battle as having been fought, and the victory won, because, the arrogant demand for the admission of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> under the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> unconditionally whether her people wanted it or not, has been abandoned, and the principle which recognizes the right of the people to decide for themselves has been submitted in its place. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Fellow-citizens: While I devoted my best energies &mdash; all my energies, mental and physical &mdash; to the vindication of the great principle, and whilst the result has been such as will enable the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> to come into the <rs>Union</rs>, with such a Constitution as they desire, yet the credit of this great moral victory is to be divided among a large number of men of various and different political creeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>I was rejoiced when I found in this great contest the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> coming up manfully and sustaining the principle that the people of each Territory, when coming into the <rs>Union</rs>, bare the right to decide for themselves whether slavery shall or shall not exist within their limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>I have seen the time when that principle was controverted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>I have seen the time when all parties did not recognize the right of a people to have slavery or freedom, to tolerate or prohibit slavery, as they deemed best; but claimed that power for the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName>, regardless of the wishes of the people to be affected by it, and when I found upon the <name>Crittenden</name>-<persName n="Montgomery,,,,," id="n0024.0002.00006.00032" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,nomatch:0"><surname>Montgomery</surname></persName> bill the <name>Republicans</name> and <name>Americans</name> of the <rs>North</rs>, and I may say, too, some glorious <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0024.0002.00006.00033" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> and old line Whigs from the <rs>South</rs>, like <persName n="Crittenden,,,,," id="n0024.0002.00006.00034" reg="mostcommon:Crittenden,John,J.,,:2"><surname>Crittenden</surname></persName> and his patriotic associates, joined with a portion of the <name>Democracy</name> to carry out and vindicate the right of the people to decide whether slavery should or should not exist within the limits of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, I was <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> rejoiced within my secret soul, for I saw an indication that the <rs>American</rs> people, when they come to understand the principle, would give it their cordial support. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>It proposed to refer the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> back to the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, and give them the right to accept or reject it as they pleased, at a fair election, held in pursuance of law, and in the event of their rejecting it and forming another in its stead, to permit them to come into the <rs>Union</rs> on an equal footing with the original states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>It was fair and just in all of its provisions!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>I regard the great principle of popular sovereignty, as having been vindicated and made triumphant in this land, as a permanent rule of public policy in the organization of Territories and the admission of new States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/><placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> took her position upon this principle many years ago.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>I appeared before the people of <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName> at a mass meeting an vindicated each and every <num value="1">one</num> of those measures ; and by reference to my speech on that occasion, which was printed and circulated broad-cast throughout the <rs>State</rs> at the time, you will find that I then and there said that those measures were all founded upon the great principle that every people ought to possess the right to form and regulate their own domestic institutions in their own way, and that that right being possessed by the people of the <name>States</name>, I saw no reason why the same principle should not be extended to all of the <rs>Territories</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>A general election was held in this State a few months afterward, for members of the <name>Legislature</name>, pending which all these questions were thoroughly canvassed and discussed, and the nominees of the different parties instructed in regard to the wishes of their constituents upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>When that election was over, and the <name>Legislature</name> assembled they proceeded to consider the merits of those Compromise measures and the principles upon which they were predicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>And what was the result of their action?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>They passed resolutions, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> repealing the <name>Wilmot</name> proviso instructions, and in lieu thereof adopted another resolution, in which they declared the great principle which asserts the right of the people to make their own form of government and establish their own institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>That resolution is as follows: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Resolved, That our liberty and independence are based upon the right of the people to form for themselves such in government as they may choose; that this great principle, the birthright of freemen, the gift of Heaven, secured to us by the blood of our ancestors, ought to be secured to future generations, and no limitation ought to be applied to this power in the organization of any Territory of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, of either Territorial Government or State Constitution, provided the <rs>Government</rs> so established shall be Republican, and in conformity with the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>That resolution, declaring the great principle of self-government as applicable to the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> and new States, passed the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> of this State by a veto of <num value="61">sixty-one</num> in the affirmative, to only <num value="4">four</num> in the negative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>Thus you find that an expression of public opinion: enlightened, educated, intelligent public opinion on this question by the representatives of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></dateStruct>, approaches nearer to unanimity than, has ever been obtained on any controverted question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>That resolution was entered on the journal of the <orgName n="State Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of the State of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName></orgName>, and it has remained there from that day to this, a standing instruction to her <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> and a request to her Representatives in Congress, to carry out that principle in all future cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/><placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, therefore, stands pre-eminent as the <rs>State</rs> which stepped forward early-and established a platform applicable to this slavery question, concurred in alike by Whigs and Democrats, in which it was declared to be the wish of our people that thereafter the people of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> should be left perfectly free to form and <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, and that no limitation should be placed upon that right in any form. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Hence what was my duty, in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct> when it became necessary to bring forward a bill for the organization of the <rs>Territories</rs> of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> and <placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Was it not my duty, in obedience to the <rs>Illinois</rs> platform to your standing instructions to your <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, adopted with almost entire unanimity, to incorporate in that bill the great principle of self-government, declaring that it was <quote>the true intent and meaning of the act not to legislate slavery into any State or Territory, or to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>I did incorporate that principle in the, <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>-<placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> bill, and perhaps I did, as much as any living man in the enactment of that bill, thus establishing the doctrine in the public policy of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>I then defended that principle against assaults from <num value="1">one</num> section of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>During this last winter it became my duty to vindicate it against assaults from the other section of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>I vindicated it boldly and fearlessly, as the people of <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName> can bear witness, when it was assailed by Freesoilers; and during this winter I vindicated and defended it as boldly and fearlessly when it was attempted to be violated by the almost united South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>I pledged myself to you on every stump in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, I pledged myself to the people of other States, <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>--wherever I spoke-and in the <orgName n="U. S. Senate" type="org">United States Senate</orgName> and elsewhere, in every form in which I could reach the public mind or the public ear, I gave the pledge that, I, so far as the power should be in my hands, would vindicate the principle of the right of the people to form their own institutions, to establish Free States or Slave States as they chose, and that that principle should never be violated either by fraud, by violence, by circumvention, or by any other means, if it was in my power to prevent it. I now submit to you, my fellow-citizens, whether I have not redeemed that pledge in good faith!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Yes, my friends, I have redeemed it in good faith, and it is a matter of heart-felt gratification to me to see these assembled <num value="1000">thousands</num> here to-night bearing their, testimony to the fidelity with which I have advocated that principle and redeemed my pledges in connection with it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>I will be entirely frank with you. My object was to secure the right of the people of each State and of each Territory, <name>North</name> or <name>South</name>, to decide the question for themselves, to have slavery or not, just as they chose ; and my opposition to the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> was not predicated upon the ground that it was a pro-slavery Constitution, nor would my action have been different had it been a Freesoil Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>My speech against the <name>Lecompton</name> fraud was made on the <dateStruct value="-12-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, while the vote on the slavery clause in that Constitution was not taken until the <num value="21" type="ordinal">21st</num> of the same month, nearly <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> after.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>I made my speech against the <name>Lecompton</name> monstrosity solely on the ground that it was a violation of the fundamental principles of free government ; on the ground that it was not the act and deed of the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> ; that it did not embody their will ; that they were averse to it ; and hence I denied the right of Congress to force it upon them, either as a free State or a slave State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>I deny the right of Congress to force a slave-holding State upon an unwilling people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>I deny their right to force a free State upon an unwilling people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>I deny their right to force a good thing upon a people who are unwilling to receive it. The great principle is the right of every community to judge and decide for itself, whether a thing is right or wrong, whether it would be good or evil for them to adopt it ; and the right of free action, the right of free thought, the right of free judgment upon the question is dearer to every true American than any other under a free government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>My objection to the <name>Lecompton</name> contrivance was, that it undertook to put a Constitution on the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> against their will, in opposition to their wishes, and thus violated the great principle upon which all our institutions rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>It is no answer to this argument to say that slavery is an evil, and hence should not be tolerated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>You must allow the people to decide for themselves whether it is a good or an evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>You allow them to decide for themselves whether they desire a Maine liquor law or not; you allow them to decide for themselves <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> what kind of common schools they will have; what system of banking they will adopt, or whether they will adopt any at all; you allow them to decide for themselves the relations between husband and wife, parent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>and child, guardian and ward; in fact, you allow them to decide for themselves all other questions and why not upon this question?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Whenever you put a limitation upon the right of any people to decide what laws they want, you have destroyed fundamental principle of self-government. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>In connection with this subject, perhaps it will not be improper for me on this occasion to allude to the position of those who have chosen to arraign my conduct on this same subject.

<p>In other word, <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0002.00009.00038" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> asserts, as a fundamental principle of this government that there must be uniformity in the local laws and domestic institutions of each and all the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Union</rs> ; and he therefore invites all the non-slaveholding States to band together, organize as <num value="1">one</num> body, and make war upon slavery, in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, upon slavery in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, upon the <name>Carolinas</name>, upon slavery in all of the slaveholding States in this Union, and to persevere in that war until it shall be exterminated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>He then notifies the slaveholding States to stand together as a unit and make an aggressive war upon the free States of this Union with a view of establishing slavery in them all; of forcing it upon <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, of forcing it upon New York, upon <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, and upon every other free State, and that they shall keep up the warfare until it has been formally established in them all, In other words, <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0002.00009.00039" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> advocates, boldly and clearly a war of sections, a war of the <rs>North</rs> against the <rs>South</rs>, of the free States against the slave States--a war of extermination to be continued relentlessly until the <num value="1">one</num> or the other shall be subdued, and all the <name>States</name> shall either become free or become slave. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>Now, my friends, I must say to you frankly, that I take bold, unqualified issue with him upon, that principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>I assert that it is neither desirable nor possible that there should be uniformity in the local institutions and domestic regulations of the different States of this Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>The framers of our government never contemplated uniformity in its internal concerns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>The fathers of the <name>Revolution</name>, and the sages who made the <rs>Constitution</rs>, well understood that the laws and domestic institutions which would suit the granite hills of <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName> would be totally unfit for the rice plantations of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>; they well understood that the laws which would suit the agricultural districts of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> and New York would be totally unfit for the large mining regions of the <rs>Pacific</rs>, or the lumber regions of <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>They well understood that the great varieties of soil, of production and of interests, in a Republic as large as this, required different local and domestic regulations in each locality, adapted to the wants and interests of each separate State, and for that ge <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> reason it was provided in the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> that the <num value="13">thirteen</num> original States should remain sovereign and supreme within their own limits in regard to all that was local, and internal, and domestic, while the <rs>Federal Government</rs> should have certain specified powers which were general and national, and could be exercised, only by federal authority. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>The framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> well understood that each locality, having separate and distinct interests, required separate and distinct laws, domestic institutions, and police regulations adapted to its own wants and its own condition ; and they acted on the presumption, also, that these laws and institutions would be as diversified and as dissimilar as the <name>States</name> would be numerous, and that no <num value="2">two</num> would be precisely alike, because the interests of no <num value="2">two</num> would be precisely the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>Hence I assert, that the great fundamental principle which underlies our complex system of State and Federal Governments, contemplated diversity and dissimilarity in the local institutions and domestic affairs of each and every State then in the <rs>Union</rs>, or thereafter to be admitted into the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>I therefore conceive that my friend, <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0002.00010.00040" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, has totally misapprehended the great principles upon which our government rests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>Uniformity in local and domestic affairs would be destructive of State rights, of State sovereignty, of personal liberty and personal freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Uniformity is the parent of despotism the world over, not only in politics, but in religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Wherever the doctrine of uniformity is proclaimed, that all the <name>States</name> must be free or all slave, that all labor must be white or all black, that all the citizens of the different States must have the same privileges or be governed by the same regulations, you have destroyed the greatest safeguard which our institutions have thrown around the rights of the citizen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>How could this uniformity be accomplished, if it was desirable and possible?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>There is but <num value="1">one</num> mode in which it could be obtained, and that must be by abolishing the <rs>State Legislatures</rs>, blotting out State sovereignty, merging the rights and sovereignty of the <name>States</name> in <num value="1">one</num> consolidated empire, and vesting Congress with the plenary power to make all the police regulations, domestic and local laws, uniform throughout the limits of the <rs>Republic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>When you shall hare done this, you will have uniformity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Then the <name>States</name> will all be slave or all be free; then negroes will vote everywhere or nowhere; then you will have a Maine liquor law in every State or none; then you will have uniformity in all things, local and domestic, by the authority of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>But when you attain that uniformity, you will have converted these <num value="32">thirty-two</num> sovereign, independent States into <num value="1">one</num> consolidated empire, with the uniformity of disposition reigning triumphant throughout the length and breadth of the land. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>From this view of the case, my friends, I am driven irresistibly to the conclusion that diversity, dissimilarity, variety in all our local and domestic institutions, is the great safeguard of our liberties ; and that the framers of our institutions were wise, sagacious, and patriotic, when they made this government a confederation of sovereign States, with a Legislature for each, and conferred upon each Legislature the power to make all local and domestic institutions to suit the people it represented, without interference from any other State or from the <orgName n="General Congress" type="congress">general Congress</orgName> of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>If we expect to maintain our liberties, we must preserve the rights and sovereignty of the <name>States</name> ; we must maintain and carry out that great principle of self-government incorporated in the compromise measures of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> ; indorsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>by the <orgName n="Illinois Legislature" type="legislature">Illinois Legislature</orgName> in <dateStruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></dateStruct> ; emphatically embodied and carried out in the <rs>Kansas</rs>-<placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> bill, and vindicated this year by the refusal to bring <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> into the <rs>Union</rs> with a Constitution distasteful to her people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>The other proposition discussed by <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0002.00010.00041" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> in his speech consists in a crusade against the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName> on account of the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>On this question, also, I desire to say to you unequivocally, that I take direct and distinct issue with him. I have no warfare to make on the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>: of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, either on account of that or any other decision which they have pronounced from that bench.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>The <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> has provided that <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> the powers of government (and the <rs>Constitution</rs> of each State has the same provision) shall be divided into <num value="3">three</num> departments-executive, legislative, and judicial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>The right and the province of expounding the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and constructing the law, is vested in the judiciary established by the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>As a lawyer, I feel at liberty to appear before the <rs type="place">Court</rs> and controvert any principle of law while the question is pending before the tribunal ; but when the decision is made, my private opinion, your opinion, all other opinions must yield to the majesty of that authoritative adjudication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>I wish you to bear in mind that this involves a great principle, upon which our rights, our liberty and our property all depend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>What security have you for your property, for your reputation, and for your personal rights, if the courts are not upheld, and their decisions respected when once fairly rendered by the highest tribunal known to the <rs>Constitution</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>I do not choose, therefore, to go into any argument with <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0002.00011.00042" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> in reviewing the various decisions which the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> has made, either upon the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> case, or any other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>I have no idea of appealing from the decision of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> upon a Constitutional question to the decisions of a tumultuous town meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>I am aware that once an eminent lawyer of this city, now no more, said that the <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">State of Illinois</placeName> had, the most perfect judicial system in the world, subject to but <num value="1">one</num> exception, which could be cured by a slight amendment, and that amendment was to so change the law as to allow an appeal from the decisions of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName></orgName>, on all Constitutional questions, to <rs type="role" reg="Justice">Justices</rs> of the <name>Peace</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>My friend, <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0002.00011.00043" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, who sits behind me, reminds me that that proposition was made when I was <rs type="role" reg="Judge">Judge</rs> of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>Be that as it may, I do not think that fact adds any greater weight or authority to the suggestion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>It matters not with me who was on the bench, whether <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0002.00011.00044" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> or myself, whether a Lockwood or a Smith, a Taney or a Marshall; the decision of the highest tribunal known to the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the country must be final till it has been reversed by an equally high authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>Hence, I am opposed to this doctrine of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0002.00011.00045" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, by which he proposes to take an appeal from the decision of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName>, upon this high constitutional question, to a Republican caucus sitting in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>Yes, or any other caucus or town meeting, whether it be Republican, American, or Democratic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>I respect the decisions of that august tribunal ; I shall always bow in deference to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>I am a law-abiding man. I will sustain the <rs>Constitution</rs> of my country as our fathers have made it. I will yield obedience to the laws, whether I like them or not, as I find them on the statute book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>I will sustain the judicial tribunals and constituted authorities in all matters within the pale of their jurisdiction as defined by the <rs>Constitution</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>But I am equally free to say that the reason assigned by <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0002.00011.00046" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> for resisting the decision of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> in the <rs>Dred Scott</rs>, case, does not in itself meet my approbation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>He objects to it because that decision declared that a negro descended from <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> parents, who were brought here and sold as slaves, is not, and cannot be, a citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>He says it is wrong, because it deprives the negro of the benefits of that clause of the <rs>Constitution</rs> which says that citizens of <num value="1">one</num> State shall enjoy all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the several States ; in other words, he thinks it wrong because it deprives the negro of the privileges, immunities and rights of citizenship, which pertain, according to that decision, only to the white man. I am free to say to you that in my opinion this government of ours is founded on the white basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>It was made by the white man, for the benefit of the white man, to be administered by white men, in such manner as they should determine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>It is also true that a negro, an Indian, or any other man of inferior race to a white man, should be permitted to enjoy, and humanity requires that he should have all the rights, privileges and immunities which he is capable of exercising consistent with the safety of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>I would give him every right and every privilege which his capacity would enable him to enjoy, consistent with the good of the society in which he lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>But you may ask me, what are these rights and these privileges?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>My answer is, that each State must decide for itself the nature and extent of these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/><pb id="p.12" n="12"/> rights. <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> has decided for herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>We have decided that the negro shall not be a slave, and we have at the same time decided that he shall not vote; or serve on juries or enjoy political privileges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>I am content with that system of policy which we have adopted for ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>I deny the right of any other State to complain of our policy in that respect, or to interfere with it, or to attempt to change it. On the other hand, the <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">State of Maine</placeName> has decided that in that State a negro man may vote on an equality with the white man. The sovereign power of <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName> had the right to prescribe that rule for herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/><placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> has no right to complain of <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName> for conferring the right of negro suffrage, nor <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName> any right to interfere with, or complain of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> because she has denied negro suffrage: The <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">State of New York</placeName> has decided by her Constitution that a negro may vote, provided that he own <measure n="250dollars" type="currency">$250</measure> worth of property, but not otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>The rich negro can vote, but the poor <num value="1">one</num> cannot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>Although that distinction does not commend itself to my judgment, yet I assert that the sovereign power of New York had a right to prescribe that form of the elective franchise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/><placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and other States have provided that negroes, or a certain class of them in those States, shall be slaves having neither civil or political rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>Without indorsing the wisdom of that decision, I assert that <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> has the same power by virtue of her sovereignty to protect slavery within her limits, as <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> has to banish it forever from our own borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>I assert the right of each State to decide for itself on all these questions, and I do not subscribe to the doctrine of my friend, <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0002.00012.00047" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, that uniformity is either desirable or possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>I do not acknowledge that the <name>States</name> must all be free or must all be slave. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>I do not acknowledge that the negro must have civil and political rights everywhere or nowhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>I do not acknowledge that the <name>Chinese</name> must have the same rights in <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> that we would confer upon him here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>I do not acknowledge that the <name>Cooley</name> imported into this country must necessarily be put upon an equality with the white race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>I do not acknowledge any of these doctrines of uniformity in the local and domestic regulations in the different States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>Thus you see, my fellow-citizens, that the issues between <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0002.00012.00048" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and myself, are respective candidates for the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>He goes for uniformity in our domestic institutions, for a war of sections, until <num value="1">one</num> or the other shall be subdued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>I go for the great principle of the <rs>Kansas</rs>-<placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> bill the right of the people to decide for themselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>On the other point, <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0002.00012.00049" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> goes for a warfare upon the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName>, because of their judicial decision in the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>I yield obedience to the decisions in that court &mdash; to the final determination of the highest judicial tribunal known to our constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>He objects to the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision because it does not put the negro in the possession of the rights of citizenship on an equality with the white man. I am opposed to negro equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>I repeat that this nation is a white people &mdash; a people composed of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> descendants &mdash; a people that have established this government for themselves and their posterity, and I am in favor of preserving not only the purity of the blood, but the purity of the government from any mixture or amalgamation with inferior races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>I have seen the effects of this mixture of superior and inferior races-this amalgamation of white men and Indians and negroes ; we have seen it in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, in <placeName reg="Central America" key="tgn,7016739">Central America</placeName>, in <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName>, and in all the <rs>Spanish-American States</rs>, and its result has been degeneration, demoralization, and degradation below the capacity for self-government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>I am opposed to taking any step that recognizes the negro man or the <rs>Indian</rs> as the equal of the white man, I am opposed to giving him a voice in the administration of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>I would extend to the negro, and the <rs>Indian</rs>, and to all dependent races every right, every privilege, and every immunity consistent with the safety and welfare of the white races ; but equality they never should have, either political or social, or in any other respect whatever. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>My friends, you see that the issues are distinctly drawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>I stand by the same platform that I have so often proclaimed to you and to the people of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> heretofore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/><pb id="p.13" n="13"/> I stand by the <rs>Democratic</rs> organization, yield obedience to its usages, and support its regular nominations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>I indorse and approve the <rs>Cincinnati</rs> platform, and I adhere to and intend to carry out, as part of that platform, the great principle of self-government, which recognizes the right, of the people in each State and Territory to decide for themselves their domestic institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>In other words, if the <name>Lecompton</name> issue shall arise again, you have only to turn back and see where you have found me during the last <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, and then rest assured that you will find me in the same position, battling for the same principle, and vindicating it from assault from whatever quarter it may come, so long as I have the power to do it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Fellow-citizens, you now have before you the outlines of the propositions which I intend to discuss before the people of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> during the pending campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>I have spoken without preparation and in a very desultory manner, and may have omitted some points which I desired to discuss, and may have been less implicit on others than I could have wished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>I have made up my mind to appeal to the people against the combination which has been made against me. The Republican leaders have formed an alliance, an unholy, unnatural alliance with a portion of the unscrupulous <orgName n="Federal office" type="office">federal office</orgName>-holders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>I intend to fight that allied army wherever I meet them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>I know they deny the alliance while avoiding the common purpose, but yet these men who are trying to divide the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> for the purpose of electing a Republican <rs type="role2">Senator</rs> in my place, are just as much the agents, the tools, the supporters of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0002.00013.00050" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> as if they were avowed Republicans, and expect their reward for their services when the <name>Republicans</name> come into power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>I shall deal with these allied forces just as the <name>Russians</name> dealt with the allies at <placeName reg="Sebastopol, Madison, Illinois" key="tgn,2650580">Sebastopol</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>The <rs>Russians</rs>, when they fired a broadside at the common enemy, did not stop to inquire whether it hit a Frenchman, an Englishman, or a Turk, nor will I stop, nor shall I stop to inquire whether my blows hit the <rs>Republican</rs> leaders or their allies, who are holding the federal offices and yet acting in concert with the <name>Republicans</name> to defeat the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> and its nominees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>I do not include all of the <orgName n="Federal office" type="office">federal office</orgName>-holders in this remark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Such of them as are Democrats and show their Democracy by remaining inside of the <rs>Democratic</rs> organization and supporting its nominees, I recognize as Democrats, but those who, having been defeated inside of the organization, go outside and attempt to divide and destroy the party in concert with the <rs>Republican</rs> leaders, have ceased to be Democrats, and belong to the allied army, whose avowed object is to elect the <rs>Republican</rs> ticket by dividing and destroying the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>My friends, I have exhausted myself, and I certainly have fatigued you, in the long and desultory remarks which I have made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>It is now <num value="2">two</num> nights since I have been in bed, and I think I have a right to a little sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>I will, however, have an opportunity of meeting you face to face, and addressing you on more than <num value="1">one</num> occasion before the <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>In conclusion, I must again say to you, justice to my own feelings demands it, that my gratitude for the welcome you have extended to me on this occasion knows no bounds, and can be described by no language which I can command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>During the course of his remarks my name was mentioned in such a way as, I suppose, renders it at least not improper that I should make some sort of reply to him.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>There was <num value="1">one</num> question to which he asked the attention of the crowd, which I deem of somewhat less importance-at least of propriety for me to dwell upon-than the others, which he brought in near the close of his speech, and which I think it would not be entirely proper for me to omit attending to, and yet if I were not to give some attention to it now, I should probably forget it altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>While I am upon this subject, allow me to say that I do not intend to indulge in that inconvenient mode sometimes adopted in public speaking, of reading from documents; but I shall depart from that rule so far as to read a little scrap from his speech, which notices this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> topic of which I shall speak &mdash; that is, provided I can find it in the paper. </p>

<p>Gentlemen, only a few more words as to this alliance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>For my part, I have to say, that whether there be such an alliance, depends, so far as I know, upon what may be a right definition of the term alliance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>If for the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> to see the other great party to which they are opposed divided among themselves, and not try to stop the division and rather be glad of it &mdash; if that is an alliance, I confess I am in ; but if it is meant to be said that the <name>Republicans</name> had formed an alliance going beyond that, by which there is contribution of money or sacrifice of principle on the <num value="1">one</num> side or the other, so far as the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> is concerned; if there be any such thing, I protest that I neither know any thing of it, nor do I believe it. I will, however, say &mdash; as I think this branch of the argument is lugged in &mdash; I would before I leave it, state, for the benefit of those concerned, that <num value="1">one</num> of those same <persName n="Buchanan,,,,," id="n0024.0003.00015.00059" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:8"><surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> men did once tell me of an argument that he made for his opposition to <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00015.00060" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>It was wrong in the application to a Territory in regard to which the question had been settled ; it was brought forward at a time when nobody asked him ; it was tendered to the <rs>South</rs> when the <rs>South</rs> had not asked for it, but when they could not well refuse it ; and for this same reason he forced that question upon our party; it has sunk the best men all over the nation, everywhere ; and now when our <rs type="role2">President</rs>, struggling with the difficulties of this man's getting up, has reached the very hardest point to turn in the case, he deserts him, and I am for putting him where he will trouble us no more.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>Popular sovereignty!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>everlasting popular sovereignty!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Let us for a moment inquire into this vast matter of popular sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>What is popular sovereignty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>We recollect that at an early period in the history of this struggle, there was another name for the same thing--<hi rend="italics"><persName n="Sovereignty,,Squatter,,," id="n0024.0003.00015.00063" reg="default:Sovereignty,Squatter,,,"><foreName>Squatter</foreName> <surname>Sovereignty</surname></persName></hi>. It was not exactly Popular Sovereignty, but <persName n="Sovereignty,,Squatter,,," id="n0024.0003.00015.00064" reg="default:Sovereignty,Squatter,,,"><foreName>Squatter</foreName> <surname>Sovereignty</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>What do those terms mean?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>What do those terms mean when used now?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>And vast credit is taken by our friend, the <rs>Judge</rs>, in regard to his support of it, when he declares the last years of his life have been, and all the future years of his life shall be, devoted to this matter of popular sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>What is it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>Why, it is the sovereignty of the people!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>What was <persName n="Sovereignty,,Squatter,,," id="n0024.0003.00015.00065" reg="default:Sovereignty,Squatter,,,"><foreName>Squatter</foreName> <surname>Sovereignty</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>I suppose if it had any significance at all it was the right of the people to govern themselves, to be sovereign in their own affairs while they were squatted down in a country not their own, while they had squatted on a Territory that did not belong to them, in the sense that a State belongs to the people who inhabit it-when it belonged to the nation &mdash; such right to govern themselves was called <quote><persName n="Sovereignty,,Squatter,,," id="n0024.0003.00015.00066" reg="default:Sovereignty,Squatter,,,"><foreName>Squatter</foreName> <surname>Sovereignty</surname></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/></p> 
<p>Now I wish you to mark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>What has become of that <persName n="Sovereignty,,Squatter,,," id="n0024.0003.00015.00067" reg="default:Sovereignty,Squatter,,,"><foreName>Squatter</foreName> <surname>Sovereignty</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>What has become of it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Can you get any body to tell you now that the people of a Territory have any authority to govern themselves, in regard to this mooted question of slavery, before they form a State Constitution?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>No such thing at all, although there is a general running fire, and although there has been a hurra made in every speech on that side, assuming that policy had given the people of a Territory the right to govern themselves upon this question ; yet the point is dodged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>To-day it has been decided &mdash; no more than a year ago it was decided by the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName>, and is insisted upon to-day, that the people of a Territory have no right to exclude slavery from a Territory, that if any <num value="1">one</num> man chooses to take slaves into a Territory, all the rest of the people have no right to keep them out. This being so, and this decision being made <num value="1">one</num> of the points that the <rs>Judge</rs> approved, and <num value="1">one</num> in the approval of which he says he means to keep me down-put me down I should not say, for I have never been up. He says he is in favor of it, and sticks to <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> it, and expects to win his battle on that decision, which says that there is no such thing as <persName n="Sovereignty,,Squatter,,," id="n0024.0003.00016.00068" reg="default:Sovereignty,Squatter,,,"><foreName>Squatter</foreName> <surname>Sovereignty</surname></persName> ; but that any <num value="1">one</num> man may take slaves into a Territory, and all the other men in the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> may be opposed to it, and yet by reason of the <rs>Constitution</rs> they cannot prohibit it. When that is so, how much is left of this vast matter of <persName n="Sovereignty,,Squatter,,," id="n0024.0003.00016.00069" reg="default:Sovereignty,Squatter,,,"><foreName>Squatter</foreName> <surname>Sovereignty</surname></persName> I should like to know? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>When we get back, we get to the point of the right of the people to make a Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/><placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> was settled, for example, in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>It was a Territory yet, without having formed a Constitution, in a, very regular way, for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>. All this time negro slavery could be taken in by any few individuals, and by that decision of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>, which the <rs>Judge</rs> approves, all the rest of the people cannot keep it out; but when they come to make a Constitution they may say they will not have slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>But it is there ; they arc obliged to tolerate it some way, and all experience shows it will be so &mdash; for they will not take the negro slaves and absolutely deprive the owners of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>All experience shows this to be so. All that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>space of time that runs from the beginning of the settlement of the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> until there is sufficiency of people to make a State Constitution &mdash; all that portion of time popular sovereignty is given up. The seal is absolutely put down upon it by the <rs type="place">Court</rs> decision, and <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00016.00070" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> puts his own upon the top of that, yet he is appealing to, the people to give him vast credit for his devotion to popular sovereignty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Again, when we get to, the question of the right of the people to form a State Constitution as they please, to form it with slavery or without slavery &mdash; if that is any thing new, I confess I don't know it. Has there ever been a time when any body said that any other than the people of a Territory itself should form a Constitution?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>What is now in it that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00016.00071" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> should have fought several years of his life, and pledge himself to fight all the remaining years of his life for?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Can <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00016.00072" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> find any body on earth that said that any body else should form a Constitution for a people?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>[A voice, <quote>Yes.</quote> ] Well, I should like you to name him ; I should like to know who he was.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>He insisted on the same principle as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00016.00076" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> ; but, his mode of applying it, in fact, was wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>It is enough for my purpose to ask this crowd, when ever a Republican said anything against it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>They never said anything against it, but they have constantly spoken for it ; and whosoever will undertake to examine the platform, and the speeches of responsible men of the party, and of irresponsible men, too, if you please, will be unable to find <num value="1">one</num> word from anybody in the <rs>Republican</rs> ranks, opposed to that Popular Sovereignty which <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00016.00077" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> thinks that he has invented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>I suppose that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00016.00078" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> will claim in a little while, that he is the inventor of the idea that the people should govern themselves ; that nobody ever thought of such a thing until he brought it forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>We do not remember, that in that old <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, it is said that <quote>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights ; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness ; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>There is the origin of Popular Sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Who, then, shall come in at this day and claim that he invented it? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>The Lecompton Constitution connects itself with this question, for it is in this matter of the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> that our friend <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00016.00079" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> claims such vast credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>I agree that in opposing the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>, so far as I can perceive, he was right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>I do not deny that at all; and, gentlemen, you will readily see why I could not deny it, even if I wanted to. But I do not wish to ; for all the <name>Republicans</name> in the nation opposed it, and they would have opposed it just as much without <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00016.00080" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s aid as with it. They had all taken ground against it long before he did. Why, the reason that he urges against that Constitution; I urged against him a year before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>I have the printed speech in my hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The argument that he makes, why that Constitution should not be adopted, that the people were not fairly represented nor allowed to vote, I pointed out in a speech a year ago, <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> which hold in my hand now, that no fair chance was to be given to the people. [ <quote>Read it ,</quote> <quote>read it.</quote> ] I shall, not waste your time by trying to read it. [ <quote>Read it</quote> <quote>read it.</quote> ] Gentlemen, reading from speeches is a very tedious business, particularly for an old man that has to put on spectacles, and more so if the man be so tall that he has to bend over to the light. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>A little more, now, as to this matter of Popular Sovereignty and the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>The Lecompton Constitution; as the Judge-tells us, was defeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>The defeat of it was a good thing or it was not. He thinks the defeat of it, was a good thing, and so do I, and we agree in that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>I said there that <quote>we are now far into the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> year since a policy was instituted for the avowed object, and with the confident promise, of putting an end to slavery agitation ; under the operation of that policy, that agitation had only not ceased, but had constantly augmented.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/></p> 
<p>What is the paragraph?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>In this paragraph which I have quoted in your hearing, and to which I ask the attention of all, <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00018.00097" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> thinks he discovers great political heresy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>I want your attention particularly to what he has inferred from it. He says I am in favor of making all the <name>States</name> of this Union uniform in all their internal regulations; that in all their domestic concerns I am in favor of making them entirely uniform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>He draws this inference from the language I have quoted to you. He says that I am in favor of making war by the <rs>North</rs> upon the <rs>South</rs> for the extinction of slavery ; that I am also in favor of inviting (as he expresses it) the <rs>South</rs> to a war upon the <rs>North</rs>, for the purpose of nationalizing slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>Now, it is singular enough, if you will carefully read that passage over, that I did not say that I was in favor of anything in it. I only said what I expected would take place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>I made a prediction only &mdash; it may have been a foolish <num value="1">one</num> perhaps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>I did not even say that I desired that slavery should be put in course of ultimate extinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>I do say so now, however, so there need be no longer any difficulty about that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>It may be written down in the great speech. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>Gentlemen, <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00018.00098" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> informed you that this speech of mine was probably carefully prepared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>I admit that it was. I am not master of language ; I have not a fine education ; I am not capable of entering into a disquisition upon dialectics, as I believe you call it ; but I do not believe the language I employed bears any such construction as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00018.00099" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> puts upon it. But I don't care about a quibble in regard to words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>I know what I meant, and I will not leave this crowd in doubt, if I can explain it to them, what I really meant in the use of that paragraph. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>I am not, in the first place, unaware that this Government has endured <measure n="82years" type="date">eighty-two years</measure>, half slave and half free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>I know that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>I am tolerably well acquainted with the history of the country, and I know that it has endured <measure n="82years" type="date">eighty-two years</measure>, half slave and half free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>I Believe &mdash; and that is what I meant to allude to there &mdash; I believe it has endured, because during all that time, until the introduction of the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill, the public mind did rest all the time in the belief that slavery was in course of ultimate extinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>That was what gave us the rest that we had through that period of <measure n="82years" type="date">eighty-two years</measure> ; at least, so I believe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>I have always hated slavery, I think, as much as any Abolitionist &mdash; I have been an Old Line Whig &mdash; I have always hated it, but I have always been quiet about it until this new era of the introduction of the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>I always believed that everybody was against it, and that it was in course of ultimate extinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>[Pointing to <persName n="Browning,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0003.00018.00100" reg="mostcommon:Browning,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Browning</surname></persName>, who stood near by.] <persName n="Browning,,,,," id="n0024.0003.00018.00101" reg="mostcommon:Browning,nomatch:0"><surname>Browning</surname></persName> thought so ; the great mass of the nation have rested in the belief that slavery was in course of ultimate extinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>They had reason so to believe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>The adoption of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and its attendant history led the people to believe so ; and that such was the belief of the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself, why did those old men, about the time of the adoption of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, decree that slavery should not go into the new Territory, where it had not already gone?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>Why declare that within <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> the <rs>African Slave Trade</rs>, by which slaves are supplied, might be cut off by Congress?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>Why were all these acts?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>I might enumerate more of these acts-but enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>What were they but a clear indication that the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> intended and expected the ultimate extinction of that institution?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>And now, when I say, as I said in my speech that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00018.00102" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> has quoted from, when I say that I think the opponents of slavery will resist the farther spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest with the belief that it is in course of ultimate extinction, I only mean to say, that they will place it where the founders of this Government originally placed it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>I have said a <num value="100">hundred</num> times, and I have now no inclination to take it back, that I believe there is no right, and ought to be no inclination in the people of the free States to enter into the slave States, and interfere with the question of slavery at all. I have <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> said that always ; <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00019.00103" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> has heard me say it &mdash; if not quite a <num value="100">hundred</num> times, at least as good as a <num value="100">hundred</num> times ; and when it is said that I am in favor of interfering with slavery where it exists, I know it is unwarranted by anything I have ever <hi rend="italics">intended</hi>, and, as I believe, by anything I have ever <hi rend="italics">said</hi>. If, by any means, I have ever used language which could fairly be so construed (as, however, I believe I never have), I now correct it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>So much, then, for the inference that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00019.00104" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> draws, that I am in favor of setting the sections at war with <num value="1">one</num> another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>I know that I never meant any such thing, and I believe that no fair mind can infer any such thing from anything I have ever said. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>Now in relation to his inference that I am in favor of a general consolidation, of all the local institutions of the various States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>I will attend to that for a little while, and try to inquire, if I can, how on earth it could be that any man could, draw such an inference from anything I said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>I have said, very many times, in <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00019.00105" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s hearing that no man believed more than I in the principle of self-government; that it lies at the bottom of all my ideas of just government, from beginning to end. I have denied that his use of that term applies properly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>But for the thing itself, I deny that any man has ever gone ahead of me in his devotion to the principle, whatever he may have done in efficiency in advocating it. I think that I have said it in your hearing &mdash; that I believe each individual is naturally entitled to do as he pleases, with himself and the fruit of his labor, so far as it in no wise interferes with any other man's rights &mdash; that each community, as a State, has a right to do exactly as it pleases with all the concerns within that State that interferes with the right of no other State, and that the <rs>General Government</rs>, upon principle, has no right to interfere with anything other than that general class of things that does concern the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>I have said that at all times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>I have said as illustrations, that I do, not believe in the right of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> to interfere with the cranberry laws of <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>, the, oyster laws of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, or the liquor laws of <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>I have said these things over and over again, and I repeat them here as my sentiments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>How is it, then, that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00019.00106" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> infers, because I hope to see slavery put where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, that I am in favor of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> going over and interfering with the cranberry laws of <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>What can authorize him to draw any such inference?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>I suppose there might be <num value="1">one</num> thing that at least enabled him to draw such an inference that would not be true with me or many others, that is, because he looks upon all this matter of slavery as an exceedingly little thing &mdash; this matter of keeping <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> of the population of the whole nation in a state of oppression and tyranny unequaled in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>He looks upon it as being an exceedingly little thing &mdash; only equal to the question of the cranberry laws of <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>--as something having no moral question in it &mdash; as something on a par with the question of whether a man shall pasture his land with, cattle, or plant it with tobacco-so little and so small a thing, that he concludes, if I could desire that if anything should be done to bring about the ultimate extinction of that little thing, I must be in favor of bringing about an amalgamation of all the other little things in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>Now, it so happens &mdash; and there, I presume, is the foundation of this mistake &mdash; that the <rs>Judge</rs> thinks thus; and it so happens that there is a vast portion of the <rs>American</rs> people that do not look upon that matter as being this very little thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>They look upon it as a vast moral evil; they can prove it as such by the writings of those who gave us the blessings of liberty which we enjoy, and that they so looked upon it, and not as an evil merely confining itself to the <name>States</name> where it is situated ; and while we agree that, by the <rs>Constitution</rs> we assented to, in the <name>States</name> where it exists we have no right to interfere with it, because it is in the <rs>Constitution</rs>; and me are by both duty and inclination to stick by that Constitution, in all its letter and spirit, from beginning to end. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>So much then as to my disposition-my wish &mdash; to have all the <rs>State Legislatures</rs> blotted out, and to have <num value="1">one</num> consolidated government, and a uniformity of domestic regulations in all the <name>States</name>, by which I suppose it is meant, if we raise corn here, <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> we must make sugar-cane grow here too, and we must make those which grow North grow in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>All this I suppose he understands I am in favor of doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>Now, so, much for all this nonsense &mdash; for I must call it so. The <rs>Judge</rs> can have no issue with me on a question of establishing uniformity in the domestic regulations of the <name>States</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>A little now on the other point &mdash; the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>Another of the issues he says that is to be made with me, is upon his devotion to the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision, and my opposition to it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>I have expressed heretofore, and I now repeat, my opposition to the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision, but I should be allowed to state the nature of that opposition, and I ask your indulgence while I do so. What is fairly implied by the term <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00020.00107" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> has used, <quote>resistance to the decision?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>I do not resist it. If I wanted to take <persName n="Scott,,Dred,,," id="n0024.0003.00020.00108" reg="default:Scott,Dred,,,"><foreName>Dred</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> from his master, I would be interfering with property, and that terrible difficulty that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00020.00109" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> speaks of, of interfering with property would arise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>But I am doing no such thing as that, but all that I am doing is refusing to obey it as a political rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>If I were in Congress, and a vote should come up on a question whether slavery should be prohibited in a new Territory, in spite of the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision, I would vote that it should. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/><persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0003.00020.00110" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>--That is what I would do. <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00020.00111" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> said last night, that before the decision he might advance his opinion, and, it might be contrary to the decision, when it was made; but after it was made he would abide by it until it was reversed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>Just so!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>We let this property abide by the decision, but we will try to reverse that decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>We will try to put it where <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00020.00112" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> would not object, for he says he will obey it until it is reversed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>Somebody has to reverse that decision, since it is made, and we mean to reverse it, and we mean to do it peaceably. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>What are the uses of decisions of courts?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>They have <num value="2">two</num> uses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>As rules of property they have <num value="2">two</num> uses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>--they decide upon the question before the court.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>They decide in this case that <persName n="Scott,,Dred,,," id="n0024.0003.00020.00113" reg="default:Scott,Dred,,,"><foreName>Dred</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> is a slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>Nobody resists that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>Not only that, but they Say to everybody else, that persons standing just as <persName n="Scott,,Dred,,," id="n0024.0003.00020.00114" reg="default:Scott,Dred,,,"><foreName>Dred</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> stands, as he is. That is, they say that when a question comes up upon another person, it will be so decided again, unless the court decides in another way, unless the court overrules its decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>Well, we mean to do what we can to have the court decide the other way. That is <num value="1">one</num> thing we mean to try to do. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>The sacredness that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00020.00115" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> throws around this decision, is a degree of sacredness that has never been before thrown around any other decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>I have never heard of such a thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>Why, decisions apparently contrary to that decision, or the good lawyers thought were contrary to that decision, have been made by that very court before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>It is ; new wonder of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>It is based upon falsehood in the main as to the facts-allegations of facts upon which it stands are not facts at all in many instances, and no decision made on any question &mdash; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance of a decision made under so many unfavorable circumstances &mdash; thus placed, has ever been held by the profession as law, and it has always needed confirmation before the lawyers regarded it as settled law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>He means for the <name>Republicans</name> who do not count themselves as leaders, to be his friends; he makes no fuss over them; it is the leaders that he is making war upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>He wants it understood that the mass of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> are really his friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>It is only the leaders that are doing something, that are intolerant, and that require extermination at his hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>As this is clearly and unquestionably the light in which he presents that matter, I want to ask your attention, addressing myself to the <name>Republicans</name> here, that I may ask you some questions, as to where you, as the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, would be placed if you sustained <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00021.00122" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> in his present position by a reelection?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>I do not claim, gentlemen, to be unselfish ; I do not pretend that I would not like to go to the <orgName n="U. S. Senate" type="org">United States Senate</orgName>, I make no such hypocritical pretense, but I do say to you that in this mighty issue, it is nothing to you &mdash; nothing to the mass of the people of the nation, whether or not <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00021.00123" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> or myself shall ever be heard of after this night ; it may be a trifle to either of us, but in connection with this mighty question, upon which hang the destinies of the nation, perhaps, it is absolutely nothing ; but where will you be placed if you reindorse <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00021.00124" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>Don't you know how apt he is &mdash; how exceedingly anxious he is at all times to seize upon anything and everything &mdash; to persuade you that something <hi rend="italics">he</hi> has done <hi rend="italics">you</hi> did yourselves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>Why, he tried to persuade you last, night that our <orgName n="Illinois Legislature" type="legislature">Illinois Legislature</orgName> instructed him to introduce the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>There was nobody in that Legislature ever thought of such a thing ; and when he <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> introduced the bill, he never thought of it ; but still he fights furiously for the proposition, and that he did it because there was a standing instruction to our <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> to be always introducing <placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName>, bills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>He tells you he is for the <rs>Cincinnati</rs> platform, he tells you he is for the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>He tells you, not in his speech last night, but substantially in a former speech, that he cares not if slavery is voted up or down &mdash; he tells you the struggle on <placeName key="tgn,2036684" n="1.000 1" reg="lecompton, douglas, kansas">Lecompton</placeName> is past &mdash; it may come up again or not, and if it does he stands where he stood when in spite of him and his opposition you built up the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>If you indorse him, you tell him you do not care whether slavery be voted up or down, and he will close, or try to close your mouths with his declaration, repeated by the day, the week, the month, and the year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>Is that what you mean?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>[Cries of <quote>no,</quote> <num value="1">one</num> voice <quote>yes.</quote> ] Yes, I have no doubt you who have always been for him, if you mean that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>No doubt of that, soberly I have said, and I repeat it. I think, in the position in which <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00021.00125" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> stood, in opposing the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>, he was right; he does not know that it will return, but if it does we may know where to find him, and if it does not we may know where to look for him, and that is on the <rs>Cincinnati</rs> platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>Now I could ask the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, after all the hard names that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00021.00126" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> has called them by-all his repeated charges of their inclination to marry with and hug negroes &mdash; all his declarations of Black Republicanism-by the way, we are improving, the black has got rubbed off &mdash; but with all that, if he be indorsed by Republican votes, where do you stand?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>Plainly, you stand ready saddled, bridled and harnessed, and waiting to be driven over to the slavery extension camp of the nation-just ready to be driven over, tied together in a lot &mdash; to be driven over, every man with a rope around his neck, that halter being held by <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00021.00127" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>That is the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>If Republican men have been in earnest in what they have done, I think they had better not do it; but I think that the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> is made up of those who, as far as they can peaceably, will oppose the extension of slavery, and who will hope for its ultimate <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> extinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>If they believe it is wrong in grasping up the new lands of the continent, and keeping them from the settlement of free white laborers, who want the land to bring up their families upon ; if they are in earnest, although they may make a mistake, they will grow restless, and the time will come when they will come back again and reorganize, if not by the same name, at least upon the same principles as their party now has. It is better, then, to save the work while it is begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>You have done the. labor; maintain it &mdash; keep it. If men choose to serve you, go with them ; but as you have made up your organization upon principle, stand by it; for, as surely as <name n="God" type="God">God</name> reigns over you, and has inspired your mind, and given you a sense of propriety, and continues to give you hope, so surely will you still cling to these ideas, and you will at last come back again after your wanderings, merely to do your work over again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>We were often &mdash; more than once at least &mdash; in the course of <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00022.00128" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s speech last night, reminded that this government was made for white men &mdash; that he believed it was made for white men. Well, that is putting it into a shape in which no <num value="1">one</num> wants to deny it ; but the <rs>Judge</rs> then goes into his passion for drawing inferences that are not warranted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>I protest, now and forever, against that counterfeit logic: which presumes that because I did not want a negro woman for a slave, I do necessarily want her for a wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>My understanding is that I need not have her for either, but,, as <name n="God" type="God">God</name> made us separate, we can leave <num value="1">one</num> another alone, and do <num value="1">one</num> another much good thereby.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>There are white men enough to marry all the white women, and enough black men to marry all the black women, and in <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> name let them be so married.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>The <rs type="role2">Judge</rs> regales us with the terrible enormities that take place by the mixture of races ; that the inferior race bears the superior down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>Why, <rs type="role2">Judge</rs>, if we do not let them get together in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> they wont mix there. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>Now, it happens that we meet together once every year, sometimes about the <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, for some reason or other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>These <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> gatherings I suppose have their uses, If you will indulge me, I will state what I suppose to be some of them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>We are now a mighty nation ; we are <num value="30">thirty</num>, or about <num value="30000000">thirty millions</num> of people, and we own and inhabit about <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="15" type="ordinal">fifteenth</num> part of the dry land of the whole earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>We run our memory back over the pages of history for about <measure n="82years" type="date">eighty-two years</measure>, and we discover that we were then a very small people in point of numbers, vastly inferior to what we are now, with a vastly less extent of country, with vastly less of everything we deem desirable among men-we look upon the change as exceedingly advantageous to us and to our posterity, and we fix upon something that happened away back, as in some way or other being connected with this rise of prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>We find a race of men living in that day whom we claim as our fathers and grandfathers ; they were iron men ; they fought for the principle that they were contending for; and we understood that by what they then did it has followed that the degree of prosperity which we now enjoy has come to us. We hold this annual celebration to remind ourselves of all the good done in this process of time, of how it was done and who did it, and how we are historically connected with it ; and we go from these meetings in better humor with ourselves-we feel more attached the <num value="1">one</num> to the other, and more firmly bound to the country we inhabit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>In every way we are better men in the age, and race, and country in which we live, for these celebrations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>But after we have done all this we have not yet reached the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>There is something else connected with it. We have besides these, men-descended by blood from our ancestors-among us, perhaps half our people, who are not descendants at all of these men ; they are men who have come from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>-<name>German</name>, <name>Irish</name>, French and Scandinavian-men that have come from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> themselves, or whose ancestors have come hither and settled here, finding themselves our equals in all things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>If they look back through this history to trace their connection with those days by blood, <pb id="p.23" n="23"/> they find they have none, they cannot carry themselves back into that glorious epoch and make themselves feel that they are part of us, but when they look through that old <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, they find that those old men say that <quote>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,</quote> and then they feel that that moral sentiment taught in that day evidences their relation to those men, that it is the father of all moral principle in them, and that they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood, and flesh of the flesh of the men who wrote that Declaration, and so they are. That is the electric cord in that Declaration that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together, that will link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>Now, sirs, for the purpose of squaring things with this idea of <quote>don't care if slavery is voted up or voted down,</quote> for sustaining the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision, for holding that the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> did, not mean anything at all, we have <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00023.00131" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> giving his exposition of what the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> means, and we have him saying that the people of <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> are equal to the people of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>According to his construction, you Germans are not connected with it. Now I ask you in all soberness, if all these things, if indulged in, if ratified, if confirmed and indorsed, if taught to our children, and repeated to them, do not tend to rub out the sentiment of liberty in the country, and to transform this Government into a Government of some other form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>Those arguments that are made, that the inferior race are to be treated with as much allowance as they are capable of enjoying ; that as much is to be done for them as their condition will allow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>What are these arguments?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>They are the arguments that kings have made for enslaving the people in all ages of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>You will find that all the arguments in favor of king-craft were of this class ; they always bestrode the necks of the people, not that they wanted to do it, but because the people were better off for being ridden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>That is their argument and this argument of the <rs>Judge</rs> is the same old serpent that says you work and I eat, you toil and I will enjoy the fruits of it. Turn in whatever way you will &mdash; whether it come from the mouth of a King, an excuse for enslaving the people of his country, or from the mouth of men of <num value="1">one</num> race as a reason for enslaving the men of another race, it is all the same old serpent, and I hold if that course of argumentation that is made for the purpose of convincing the public mind that we should not care about this, should be granted, it does not stop with the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>I should like to know if, taking this old <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, which declares that all men are equal upon principle, and making exceptions to it, where will it stop?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>If <num value="1">one</num> man says it does not mean a negro, why not another say it does not mean some other man.? If that declaration is not the truth, let, us get the <name>Statute</name> book, in which we find it, and tear it out!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>Who is so bold as to do it!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>If it is not true let us tear it out!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>[cries of <quote>no, no</quote> ] ; let us stick to it then, let us stand firmly by it then. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>It may be argued that there are certain conditions that make necessities and impose them upon us, and to the extent that a necessity is imposed upon a man, he must submit to it. I think that was the condition in which we found ourselves when we established this Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>We had slavery among us, we could not get our Constitution unless we permitted them to remain in slavery, we could not secure the good we did secure if we grasped for more, and having by necessity submitted to that much, it does not destroy the principle that is the charter of our liberties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>Let that charter stand as our standard. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>My friend has said to me that I am a poor hand to quote Scripture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>I will try it again, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>It is said in <num value="1">one</num> of the admonitions of our <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, <quote>As your Father in Heaven is perfect, be ye also perfect.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>The Savior, I suppose, did not expect that any human creature could be perfect as the <rs>Father</rs> in Heaven; but He said, <quote>As your Father in Heaven is perfect, be ye also perfect.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>He set that up as a standard, and he who did most toward reaching that standard, attained the highest degree of moral perfection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>So I say in relation to the principle that all men are <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> created equal, let it be as nearly reached as we can. If we cannot give freedom to every creature, let us do nothing that <corr sic="mill">will</corr> impose slavery upon any other creature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>Let us then turn this Government back into the channel in which the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> originally placed it. Let us stand firmly by each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>If we do not do so we are turning in the contrary direction that our friend <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0003.00024.00132" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> proposes &mdash; not intentionally &mdash; as working in the traces tend to make this <num value="1">one</num> universal slave nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>He is <num value="1">one</num> that runs in that direction, and as such I resist him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>My friends, I have detained you about as long as I desired to do, and I have only to say, let us discard all this quibbling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>about this man and the other man-this race and that race and the other race being inferior, and therefore they must be placed in an inferior position &mdash; discarding our standard that we have left us. Let us discard all these things, and unite as <num value="1">one</num> people throughout this land, until we shall once more stand up declaring that all men are created equal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>My friends, I could not, without launching off upon some new topic, which would detain you too long, continue to-night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>I thank you for this most extensive audience that you have furnished me to-night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>I leave you, hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal.</p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>I appear before you this evening for the purpose of vindicating the course which I have felt it my duty to pursue in the <orgName n="United States Senate" type="senate">Senate of the United States</orgName>, upon the great public questions which have agitated the country since I last addressed you. I am aware that my Senatorial course has been arraigned, not only by political foes, but by a few men pretending to belong to the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>, and yet acting in alliance with the enemies of that party, for the purpose of electing Republicans to Congress in this State, in place of the present Democratic delegation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>I desire your attention whilst I address you, and then I will ask your verdict, whether I have not in all things acted in entire good faith, and honestly carried out the principles, the professions, and the avowals which I made before my constituents, previous to my going to the <name>Senate</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>During the last session of Congress, the great question of, controversy has been the admission of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> into the <rs>Union</rs> under the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>I need not inform you that from the beginning to the end I took bold, determined, and unrelenting ground in opposition to that Lecompton Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>My reason for that course is contained in the fact that that instrument was not the act and deed of the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, and did not embody their will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>I hold it to be a fundamental principle in all free governments &mdash; a principle asserted in the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, and underlying the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, as well as the <rs>Constitution</rs> of every State of the <rs>Union</rs>--that every people ought to have the right to form, adopt and ratify the <rs>Constitution</rs> under which they arc to live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>When I introduced <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill in the <orgName n="United States Senate" type="senate">Senate of the United States</orgName> in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, I incorporated in it the provision that it was the true intent and meaning of the bill, not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State, or to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their own domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>In that bill the pledge was distinctly made that the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> should be left not only free, but perfectly free to form and regulate their own domestic institutions to suit themselves ; and the question arose, when the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> was sent into Congress, and the admission of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> not only asked, but attempted to be forced under it, whether or not that Constitution was the free act and deed of the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>No man pretends that it embodied their will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>Every man in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> knows that it was rejected by the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, by a majority of over <num value="10000">ten thousand</num>, before the attempt was made in Congress to force the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> into the <rs>Union</rs> under that Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>I resisted, therefore, the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> because it was a violation of the great principle of self-government, upon which all our institutions rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>I do not wish to mislead you, or to leave you in doubt as to the motives of my action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>I did not oppose the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> upon the ground of the slavery clause contained in it. I made my speech against that instrument before the vote was taken on the slavery clause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>At the time I made it I did not know whether that clause would be voted in or out; whether it would be included in the <rs>Constitution</rs>, or excluded from it, and it made no difference with me what the result of the vote was, for the reason that I was contending for a principle, under which you have no more right to force a free State upon a people against their will, than you have to force a slave State upon them without their consent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>The error consisted in attempting to control the free action of the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> in any. respect whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>It is no argument with me to say that such and such a clause of the <rs>Constitution</rs> was not palatable, that you did not like it ; it is a matter of no consequence whether you in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> like any clause in the <rs>Kansas Constitution</rs> or not; it is not a question for you, but it is a question for the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>They have the right to make a Constitution in accordance with their own wishes, and if you do not like it you are not bound to go there and live under it. We in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> have made a Constitution to suit ourselves, and we think we have a tolerably good <num value="1">one</num>; but whether we have or not, it is nobody's business but our own. If the people in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> do not like it, they need not come here to live under it ; if the people of <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName> are not satisfied with it, what matters it to us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>We, and we alone, have the right to a voice in its adoption or rejection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>Reasoning thus, my friends, my efforts were directed to the vindication of the great principle involving the right of the people of each State and each Territory to form and regulate their own domestic institutions to suit themselves, subject only to the <rs>Constitution</rs> of our common country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>I am rejoiced to be enabled to say to you that we fought that battle until we forced the advocates of the <name>Lecompton</name> instrument to abandon the attempt of inflicting it upon the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, without <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> giving them an opportunity of rejecting it. When we compelled them to abandon that effort, they resorted to a scheme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>They agreed to refer the <rs>Constitution</rs> back to the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, thus conceding the correctness of the principle for which I had contended, and granting all I had desired, provided the mode of that reference and the mode of submission to the people had been just, fair and equal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>I did not consider the mode of submission provided, in what is known as the <quote><persName n="English,,,,," id="n0024.0004.00025.00137" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName></quote> bill, a fair submission, and for this simple reason, among others : It provided, in effect, that if the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> would accept the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>, that they might come in with <num value="36000">36,000</num> inhabitants, but that, if they rejected it, in order that they might form a Constitution agreeable to their own feelings, and conformable to their own principles, that they should not be received into the <rs>Union</rs> until they had <num value="93420">93,420</num> inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>In other words, it said to the people, if you will come into the <rs>Union</rs> as a slaveholding State, you shall be admitted with <num value="35000">35,000</num> inhabitants, but if you insist on being a free State, you shall not be admitted until you have <num value="93420">93,420</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>I was not willing to <pb id="p.26" n="26"/> discriminate between free States and slave States in this Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>I will not put a restriction upon a slave State that I would not put upon a free State, and I will not permit, if I can prevent it, a restriction being put upon a free State which is not applied with the same force to the slaveholding States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>Equality among the <name>States</name> is a cardinal and fundamental principle in our Confederacy, and cannot be violated without overturning our system of Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>Hence I demanded that the free States and the slaveholding States should be kept on an exact equality, <num value="1">one</num> with the other, as the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> had placed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>If the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> want a slaveholding State, let them have it, and if they want a free State they have a right to it, and it is not for the people of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, or New York, or <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, to complain, whatever the decision of the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> may be upon that point. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>But while I was not content with the mode of submission contained in the <rs>English</rs> bill, and while I could not sanction it for the reason that, in my opinion, it violated the great principle of equality among the different States, yet when it became the law of the land, and under it the question was referred back to the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> for their decision, at an election to be held on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Monday in <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> next, I bowed in deference, because whatever decision the people shall make at that election must be final and conclusive of the whole question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>If the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> accept the proposition submitted by Congress, from that moment <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> will become a State of the <rs>Union</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>and there is no way of keeping her out if you should try. The act of admission would become irrepealable ; <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> would be a State, and there would be an end of the controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>On the other hand, if at that election the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> shall reject the proposition, as it is now generally thought will be the case, from that moment the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> is dead, and again there is an end of the controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>So you see that either way, on the <dateStruct value="-08-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> next, the <name>Lecompton</name> controversy ceases and terminates forever ; and a similar question can never arise unless some man shall attempt to play the <name>Lecompton</name> game over again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>But, my fellow-citizens, I am well convinced that that game will never be attempted again ; it has been so solemnly and thoroughly rebuked during the last session of Congress, that it will find but few advocates in the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, in his annual message, expressly recommends that the example of the <rs>Minnesota</rs> case, wherein Congress required the <rs>Constitution</rs> to be submitted to the vote of the people for ratification or rejection, shall be followed in all future cases ; and all we have to do is to sustain as <num value="1">one</num> man that recommendation, and the <rs>Kansas</rs> controversy can never again arise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>My friends, I do not desire you to understand me as claiming for myself any special merit for the course I have pursued on this question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>I simply did my duty, a duty enjoined by fidelity, by honor, by patriotism; a duty which I could not have shrunk from, in my opinion, without dishonor and faithlessness to my constituency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>Besides, I only did what it was in the power of any <num value="1">one</num> man to do. There were others, men of eminent ability, men of wide reputation, renowned all over <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>, who led the van, and are entitled to the greatest share of the credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>Foremost among them all, as he was head and shoulders above them all, was <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>'s great and gallant statesman, <persName n="Crittenden,,John,J.,," id="n0024.0004.00026.00138" reg="default:Crittenden,John,J.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>By his course upon this question he has shown himself a worthy successor of the immortal <rs>Clay</rs>, and well may <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> be proud of him. I will not withhold, either, the meed of praise due the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> in Congress for the course which they pursued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>In the language of the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York Tribune</orgName></hi>, they came to the <name>Douglas</name> platform, abandoning their own, believing that under the peculiar circumstances they would in that mode best subserve the interests of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>My friends, when I am battling for a great principle, I want aid and support from whatever quarter I can get it in order to carry out that principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>I never hesitate in my course when I find those who on all former occasions differed from me upon the principle finally coming to its support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>Nor is it for me to inquire into the motives which animated the <rs>Republican</rs> members of Congress in supporting the <name>Crittenden</name>-<persName n="Montgomery,,,,," id="n0024.0004.00026.00139" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,nomatch:0"><surname>Montgomery</surname></persName> bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>It is enough for me that <pb id="p.27" n="27"/> in that, case they came square up and indorsed the great principle of the <rs>Kansas</rs>-<placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> bill, which declared that <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> should be received into the <rs>Union</rs>, with slavery or without, as its Constitution should prescribe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>I was the more rejoiced at the action of the <name>Republicans</name> on that occasion for another reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>I could not forget, you will not soon forget, how unanimous that party was, in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, in declaring that never should another slave State be admitted into this Union under any circumstances whatever, and yet we find that during this last winter they came up and voted to a man declaring that <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> should come in as a State with slavery under the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>, if her people desired it, and that if they did not that they might form a new Constitution, with slavery or without just as they pleased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>I do not question the motive when men do a good act ; I give them credit for the act; and if they will stand by that principle in the future, and abandon their heresy of <quote>no more slave States even if the people want them,</quote> I will then give them still more credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>I am afraid, though, that they will not stand by it in the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>If they do; I will freely forgive them all the abuse they heaped upon me in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, for having advocated and carried out that same principle in the <rs>Kansas</rs>-<placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> bill. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/><placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> stands proudly forward as a State which early took her position in favor of the principle of popular sovereignty as applied to the <rs>Territories</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>When the compromise measure of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> passed, predicated upon that principle, you recollect, the excitement which prevailed throughout the northern portion of this State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>I vindicated those measures then, and defended myself for having voted for them, upon the ground that they embodied the principle that every people ought to have the privilege of forming and regulating their own institutions to suit themselves &mdash; that each State had that right, and I saw no reason why it should not be extended to the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>When the people of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> had an opportunity of passing judgment upon those measures, they indorsed them by a vote of their representatives in the <name>Legislature</name>--<num value="61">sixty-one</num> in the affirmative and only <num value="4">four</num> in the negative &mdash; in which they asserted that the principle embodied in the measures was the birthright of freemen, the gift of Heaven, a principle vindicated by our revolutionary fathers, and that no limitation should ever be placed upon it, either in the organization of a Territorial Government, or the admission of a State into the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>That resolution still stands unrepealed on the journals of the <name>Legislature</name> of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>In obedience to it, and in exact conformity with the principle, I brought in the <rs>Kansas</rs>-<placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> bill, requiring that the people should be left perfectly free in the formation of their institutions, and in the organization of their Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>I now submit to you whether I have not in good faith redeemed that pledge, that the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> should be left perfectly free to form and regulate their institutions to suit themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>And yet, while no man can arise in any crowd and deny that I have been faithful to my principles, and redeemed my pledge, we find those who are struggling to crush and defeat me, for the very reason that I have been faithful in carrying out those measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>We find the <rs>Republican</rs> lenders forming an alliance with professed <placeName key="tgn,2036684" n="1.000 1" reg="lecompton, douglas, kansas">Lecompton</placeName> men to defeat every Democratic nominee and elect Republicans in their places, and aiding and defending them in order to help them break down Anti-<placeName key="tgn,2036684" n="1.000 1" reg="lecompton, douglas, kansas">Lecompton</placeName> men, whom they acknowledge did right in their opposition to <placeName key="tgn,2036684" n="1.000 1" reg="lecompton, douglas, kansas">Lecompton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>No Convention was ever more harmonious in its action, or showed a more tolerant, and just spirit toward <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Democrats</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>The leaders of the party there assembled declared their unalterable attachment to the time-honored principles and organization of the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>, and to the <rs>Cincinnati</rs> platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>They declared that that platform was the only authoritative exposition of Democratic principles, and that it must so stand until changed by another <orgName n="National Convention" type="convention">National Convention</orgName> ; that in the meantime they would make no new tests, and submit to none; that they would proscribe no Democrat or permit the proscription of Democrats because of their opinion upon Lecomptonism, or upon any other issue which has arisen; but would recognize all men as Democrats who remained inside of the organization, preserved the usages of the party, and supported its nominees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>These bolting Democrats who now claim to be the peculiar friends of the <rs>National Administration</rs>, and have formed an alliance with <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0004.00028.00143" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and the <name>Republicans</name> for the purpose of defeating the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>, have ceased to claim fellowship with the.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>There is but <num value="1">one</num> possible way in which slavery can be abolished, and that is by leaving a State, according to the principle of the <rs>Kansas</rs>-<placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> bill, perfectly free to form and regulate its institutions in its own way. That was the principle upon which this Republic was founded, and it is under the operation of that principle that we have been able to preserve the <rs>Union</rs> thus far.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>But the moment the <rs>Abolition Societies</rs> were organized throughout the <rs>North</rs>, preaching a violent crusade against slavery in the <rs>Southern States</rs>, this combination necessarily caused a counter-combination in the <rs>South</rs>, and a sectional line was drawn which was a barrier to any further emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>The functions of Congress are to enact the statutes, the province of the <rs type="place">Court</rs> is to pronounce upon their validity, and the duty of the <rs>Executive</rs> is to carry the decision into effect when rendered by the <rs type="place">Court</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>He had better be quite sure that he gets a Republican <rs type="role2">President</rs> at the same time to appoint them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>He wants to have a Republican <rs type="role2">President</rs> elected by Northern votes, not a Southern man participating, and elected for the purpose of placing none but Republicans on the bench, and consequently, if he succeeds in electing that <rs type="role2">President</rs>, and succeeds in persuading the present Judges to die, in.order that their vacancies may be filled, that the <rs>President</rs> will then appoint their successors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>Now, my friends, suppose this scheme was practical, I ask you what confidence you would have in a Court thus constituted a Court composed of partisan Judges, appointed on political grounds, selected with a view to the decision of questions in a particular way, and pledged in regard to a decision before the argument) and without reference to the peculiar state of the facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>If the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> cannot trust Democratic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>My fellow-citizens, whenever partisan politics shall be carried on to the bench ; whenever the <rs>Judges</rs> shall be arraigned upon the stump, and their judicial conduct reviewed in town meetings and caucuses; whenever the independence and integrity of the judiciary shall be tampered with to the extent of rendering them partial, blind and suppliant tools, what security will you have for your rights and your liberties?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>I therefore take issue with <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0004.00034.00182" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> directly in regard to this warfare upon the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>All I have to say is that, with or without that decision, slavery will go just where the people want it, and not <measure n="1inch" type="distance">one inch</measure> further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>You have had experience upon that subject in the case of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>You have been told by the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> that, from <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, when the <rs>Kansas</rs>-<placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> bill passed, down to last winter, that slavery was sustained and supported in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> by the laws of what they called a <quote>bogus</quote> Legislature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>And how many slaves were there in the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> at the end of last winter?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>Not as many at the end of that period as there were on the day the <rs>Kansas</rs>-<placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> bill passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>There was quite a number of slaves in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, taken there under the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>, and in spite of it, before the <rs>Kansas</rs>-<placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> bill passed, and now it is asserted that there are not as many there as there were before the passage of the bill, notwithstanding that they had local laws sustaining and encouraging it, enacted, as the <name>Republicans</name> say, by a <quote>bogus</quote> Legislature, imposed upon <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> by an invasion from <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>Why has not slavery obtained a foothold in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> under these circumstances?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>Simply because there was a majority of her people opposed to slavery, and every slaveholder knew that if he took his slaves there, the moment that majority got possession of the ballot-boxes, and a fair election was held, that moment slavery would be abolished and he would lose them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>For that reason, such owners as took their slaves there brought them back to <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, fearing that if they remained they would he emancipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>Thus you see that under the principle of popular sovereignty, slavery has been kept out of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, notwithstanding the fact that for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> they had a Legislature in that Territory favorable to it. I tell you, my friends, it is impossible under our institutions to force slavery on an unwilling people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>I f this principle of popular sovereignty asserted in the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill be fairly carried out, by letting the people decide the question for themselves, by a fair vote, at a fair election, and with honest returns, slavery will never exist <num value="1">one</num> day, or <num value="1">one</num> hour, in any Territory against the unfriendly legislation of an unfriendly people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>I care not how the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision may have settled the abstract question so far as the practical result is concerned ; for, to use the language of an eminent Southern <rs type="role2">Senator</rs>, on this very question: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/> </p> 
<p>I do not care a fig which way the decision shall be, for it is of no particular consequence ; slavery cannot exist a day or an hour, in any Territory or State, unless it has affirmative laws sustaining and supporting, it, furnishing police regulations and remedies, and an omission to furnish them would be as fatal as a constitutional prohibition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>Without affirmative legislation in its favor, slavery could not exist any longer than a new-born infant could survive under the heat of the sun, on a barren rock, without protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>It would wilt and die for the want of support.</p></quote> <pb id="p.35" n="35"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>Hence, if the people of a Territory want slavery, they will encourage it by passing affirmatory laws, and the necessary police regulations, patrol laws and slave code; if they do not want it they will withhold that legislation, and by withholding it slavery is as dead as if it was prohibited by a constitutional prohibition, especially if, in addition, their legislation is unfriendly, as it would be if they were opposed to it. They could pass such local laws and police regulations as would drive slavery out in <num value="1">one</num> day, or <num value="1">one</num> hour, if they were opposed to it, and therefore, so far as the question of slavery in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> is concerned, so far as the principle of popular sovereignty is concerned, in its practical operation, it matters not how the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> case may be decided with reference to the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>My own opinion on that law point is well known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>It is shown by my votes and speeches in Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>But be it as it may, the question was an abstract question, inviting no practical results, and whether slavery shall exist or shall not exist in any State or Territory, will depend upon whether the people are for or against it, and which ever way they shall decide it in any Territory or in any State, will be entirely satisfactory to me. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>But I must now bestow a few words upon <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0004.00035.00184" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s main, objection to the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>He is not going to submit to it. Not that he is going to make war upon it with force of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>But he is going to appeal and reverse it in some way ; he cannot tell us how. I reckon not by a writ of error, because I do not know where he would prosecute that, except before an <orgName n="Abolition Society" type="society">Abolition Society</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>And when he appeals, he does not exactly tell us to whom he will appeal, except it be the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, and I have yet to learn that the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, has judicial powers; but he is going to appeal from it and reverse it, either by an act of Congress, or by turning out the judges, or in some other way. And why?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>Because he says that that decision deprives the negro of the benefits of that clause of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> which entitles the citizens of each State to all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the several States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>Well, it is very true that the decision does have that effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>By deciding that a negro is not a citizen, of course it denies to him the rights and privileges awarded to citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>It is this that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0004.00035.00185" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> will not submit to. Why?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>For the palpable reason that he wishes to confer upon the negro all the rights, privileges and immunities of citizens of the several States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>I will not quarrel with <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0004.00035.00186" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> for his views on that subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>I have no doubt he is conscientious in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>I have not the slightest idea but that he conscientiously believes that a negro ought to enjoy and exercise all the rights and privileges given to white men ; but I do not agree with him, and hence I cannot concur with him. I believe that this Government of ours was founded on the white basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>I believe that it was established by white men; by men of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> birth, or descended of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> races, for the benefit of white men and their posterity in all time to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>I do not believe that it, was the design or intention of the signers of the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> or the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> to include negroes, <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0024.0004.00035.00187" reg="mostcommon:Indians,nomatch:0"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, or other inferior races, with white man, as citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>Our fathers had at that day seen the evil consequences of conferring civil and political rights upon the <rs>Indian</rs> and negro in the <rs>Spanish</rs> and <rs>French</rs> colonies on the <rs>American</rs> continent and the adjacent islands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>Ask any of those gallant young men in your own county, who went to <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> to fight the battles of their country, in what friend <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0024.0004.00035.00188" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> considers an unjust and unholy war, and hear what they will tell you in regard to the amalgamation of races in that country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>Amalgamation there, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> political, then social, has led to demoralization and degradation, until it has reduced that people below the point of capacity for self-government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>Our fathers knew what the effect of it would be, and from the time they planted foot on the <rs>American</rs> continent, not only those who landed at <placeName reg="Jamestown, Chautauqua, New York" key="tgn,2069910">Jamestown</placeName>, but at <placeName reg="Plymouth Rock, Franklin, New York" key="tgn,2588760">Plymouth Rock</placeName> and all other points on the coast, they pursued the policy of confining <pb id="p.36" n="36"/> civil and political rights to the white race, and excluding the negro in all cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>Still <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0004.00036.00189" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> conscientiously believes that it is his duty to advocate negro citizenship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>He wants to give the negro the privilege of citizenship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>He quotes Scripture again, and says: <quote>As your Father in Heaven is perfect, be ye also perfect.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>And he applies that Scriptural quotation to all classes ; not that he expects us all to be as perfect as our Master, but as nearly perfect as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>In other words, he is willing to give the negro an equality under the law, in order that, he may approach as near perfection, or an equality with the white man, as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>To this same end he quotes the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> in these words : <quote>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men were created equal, and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, among which are life liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;</quote> and goes on to argue that the negro was included, or intended to be included in that Declaration by the signers of the paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>He says that by the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, therefore, all kinds of men, negroes included, were created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, and further, that the right of the negro to be on an equality with the white man is a Divine right conferred by the <name>Almighty</name> and rendered inalienable according to the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>Hence no human law or constitution can deprive the negro of that equality with the white man to which he is entitled by Divine law. [ <quote>Higher law.</quote> ] higher law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>He believes that the negro, by the <name>Divine</name> law, is created the equal of the white man, and that no human law can deprive him of that equality, thus secured ; and he contends that the negro ought therefore to have all the rights and privileges of citizenship on an equality with the white man. In order to accomplish this, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing that would have to be done in this State would be to blot out of our State Constitution that clause which prohibits negroes from coming into this State, and making it an African colony, and permit them to come and spread over these charming prairies until in midday they shall look black as night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>When our friend <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0024.0004.00036.00191" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> gets all his colored brethren around him here, he will then raise them to perfection as fast as possible, and place them on an equality with the white man, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> removing all legal restrictions, because they are our equals by Divine law, and there should be no such restrictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>He wants them to vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>I am opposed to it. If they had a vote, I reckon they would all vote for him in preference to me, entertaining the views I do. But that matters not. The position he has taken on this question not only presents him as claiming for them the right to vote, but their right under the <name>Divine</name> law and the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> to be elected to office to become members of the <name>Legislature</name>, to go to Congress to become Governors, or <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, or <rs type="role" reg="Judge">Judges</rs> of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>; and I suppose that when they control that court, they will probably reverse the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>He is going to bring negroes here, and give them the right of citizenship, the right of voting, and the right of holding office and sitting on juries, and what else?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>Why, he would permit them to marry, would he not?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>And if he gives them that right, I suppose he will let them marry whom they please, provided they marry their equals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>If the <name>Divine</name> law declares that the white man is the equal of the negro woman &mdash; that they are on a perfect equality, I suppose he admits the right of the negro woman to marry the white man. In other words, his doctrine that the negro, by Divine law, is placed on a perfect equality with the white man, and that that equality is recognized by the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> leads him necessarily to establish negro equality under the law ; but whether even then they would be so in fact would depend upon the degree of virtue and intelligence they possessed, and certain other qualities that are matters of taste rather than of law I do not understand <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0004.00036.00192" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> as saying that he expects to make them our equals socially, or by intelligence, nor in fact as citizens, but that he wishes to make them our equals under the law, and then say to them, <quote>as your Master in Heaven is perfect, be ye also perfect.</quote>

<p>Well, I confess to you, my fellow-citizens, that I am utterly opposed to that system <pb id="p.37" n="37"/> of abolition philosophy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>I do not believe that the signers of the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> had any reference to negroes when they used the expression that all men were created equal, or that they had any reference to the <name>Chinese</name> or Coolies, the <name>Indians</name>, the <name>Japanese</name>, or any other inferior race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>They were speaking of the white race, the <rs>European</rs> race on this continent, and their descendants, and emigrants who should come here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>They were speaking only of the white race, and never dreamed that their language would be construed to include the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>And now for the evidence of that fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>At the time the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> was put forth, declaring the equality of all men, every <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="13">thirteen</num> colonies was a slaveholding colony, and every man who signed that Declaration represented a slaveholding constituency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>Did they intend, when they put their signatures to that instrument, to declare that their own slaves were on an equality with them; that they were made their equals by Divine law, and that any human law reducing them to an inferior position, was void, as being in violation of Divine law?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>Was that the meaning of the signers of the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>Did <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0024.0004.00037.00193" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:3"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> and <persName><foreName>Henry</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0024.0004.00037.00194" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> &mdash; did any of the signers of that instrument, or all of them, on the day they signed it, give their slaves freedom?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>History records that they did not. Did they go further, and put the negro on an equality with the white man throughout the country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>They did not. And yet if they had understood that Declaration as including the negro, which <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0004.00037.00195" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> holds they did, they would have been bound, as conscientious men, to have restored the negro to that equality which he thinks the <name>Almighty</name> intended they should occupy with the white man. They did not do it. Slavery was abolished in only <num value="1">one</num> State before the adoption of the <rs>Constitution</rs> in <dateStruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></dateStruct>, and then in others gradually, down to the time this abolition agitation began, and it has not been abolished in <num value="1">one</num> since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>The history of the <name>Country</name> shows that neither the signers of the <name>Declaration</name>, or the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, ever supposed it possible that their language would be used in an attempt to make this nation a mixed nation of <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0024.0004.00037.00196" reg="mostcommon:Indians,nomatch:0"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, negroes, whites and mongrels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>I repeat, that our whole history confirms the proposition, that from the earliest settlement of the colonies down to the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> and the adoption of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, our fathers proceeded on the white basis, making the white people the governing race, but conceding to the <rs>Indian</rs> and negro, and all inferior races, all the rights and all the privileges they could enjoy consistent with the safety of the society in which they lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>That is my opinion now. I told you that humanity, philanthropy, justice and sound policy required that we should give the negro every right, every privilege, every immunity consistent with the safety and welfare of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>The question then naturally arises, what are those rights and privileges, and what is the nature and extent of them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>My answer is, that that is a question which each State and each Territory must decide for itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>We have decided that question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>We have said that in this State the negro shall not be a slave, but that he shall enjoy no political rights-that negro equality shall not exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>I am content with that position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>My friend <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0024.0004.00037.00197" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is not. He thinks that our policy and our laws on that subject are contrary to the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>He thinks that the <name>Almighty</name> made the negro his equal and his brother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>For my part I do not consider the negro any kin to me, nor to any other white man; but I would still carry my humanity and my philanthropy to the extent of giving him every privilege and every immunity that he could enjoy, consistent with our own good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>We in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> have the right to decide upon that question for ourselves, and we are bound to allow every other State to do the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/><placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName> allows the negro to vote on an equality with the white man. I do not quarrel with our friends in <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName> for that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>If they think it wise and proper in <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName> to put the negro on an equality with the white man, and allow him to go to the polls and negative the vote of a white man, it is their business and not mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>On the other hand, New York permits a <pb id="p.38" n="38"/> negro to vote, provided he owns <measure n="250dollars" type="currency">$250</measure> worth of property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>New York thinks that a negro ought to be permitted to vote, provided he is rich, but not otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>They allow the aristocratic negro to vote there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>I never saw the wisdom, the propriety or the justice of that decision on the part of New York, and yet it never occurred to me that I had a right to find fault with that State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>It is her business ; she is a sovereign State, and has a right to do as she pleases, and if she will take care of her own negroes, making such regulations concerning them as suit her, and let us alone, I will mind my business, and not interfere with her. In <placeName key="tgn,7007255" n="1.000 69" reg="kentucky">Kentucky</placeName> they will not give a negro any political or any civil rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>I shall not argue the question whether <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> in so doing has decided right or wrong, wisely or unwisely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>It is a question for <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> to decide for herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>I believe that the <name>Kentuckians</name> have consciences as well as ourselves; they have as keen a perception of their religious, moral and social duties as we have, and I am willing that they shall decide this slavery question for themselves, and be accountable to their <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for their action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>It is not for me to arraign them for what they do. I will not judge them lest I shall be judged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>Let <placeName key="tgn,7007255" n="1.000 69" reg="kentucky">Kentucky</placeName> mind her own business, and take care of her negroes, and we attend to our own affairs, and take care of our negroes, and we will be the best of friends ; but if <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> attempts to interfere with us, or we with her, there will be strife, there will be discord, there will be relentless hatred, there will be everything but fraternal feeling and brotherly love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>It is not necessary that you should enter <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and interfere in that State, to use the language of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0004.00038.00198" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>It is just as offensive to interfere from this State, or send your missiles over there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>I care not whether an enemy, if he is going to assault us, shall actually come into our State, or come along the line, and throw his bomb-shells over to explode in our midst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>Suppose <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> should plant a battery on the <rs>Canadian</rs> side of the <placeName reg="Niagara River, New York, United States" key="tgn,2540762">Niagara river</placeName>, opposite <placeName reg="Buffalo, Erie, New York" key="tgn,7013463">Buffalo</placeName>, and throw bomb-shells over, which would explode in <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address>, in that city, and destroy the buildings, and that, when we protested, she would say, in the language of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0004.00038.00199" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, that she never dreamed of coming into the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to interfere with us, and that she was just throwing her bombs over the line from her own side, which she had a right to do, would that explanation satisfy us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>So it is with <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0004.00038.00200" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>He is not going into <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, but he will plant his batteries on this side of the <rs>Ohio</rs>, where he is safe and secure for a retreat, and will throw his bomb-shells-his abolition documents-over the river, and will carry on a political warfare, and get up strife between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> until he elects a sectional <rs type="role2">President</rs>, reduces the <rs>South</rs> to the condition of dependent colonies, raises the negro to an equality, and forces the <rs>South</rs> to submit to the doctrine that a house divided against itself cannot stand &mdash; that the <rs>Union</rs> divided into half slave States and half free cannot endure &mdash; that they must all be slave or they must all be free, and that as we in the <rs>North</rs> are in the majority, we will not permit them to be all slave, and therefore they in the <rs>South</rs> must consent to the <name>States</name> all being free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>Now, fellow-citizens, I submit to you whether these doctrines are consistent with the peace and harmony of this Union?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>I submit to you whether they are consistent with our duties as citizens of a common confederacy; whether they are consistent with the principles which ought to govern brethern of the same family?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>I recognize all the people of these States, <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, <name>East</name> and <name>West</name>, old or new, Atlantic or Pacific, as our brethren, flesh of <num value="1">one</num> flesh, and I will do no act unto them that I would not be willing they should do unto us. I would apply the same <name>Christian</name> rule to the <name>States</name> of this Union that we are taught to apply to individuals, <quote>do unto others as you would have others do unto you,</quote> and this would secure peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>Why should this slavery agitation be kept up?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>Does it benefit the white man or the slave?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>Who does it benefit except the <rs>Republican</rs> politicians, who use it as their hobby to ride into office?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>Why, I repeat, should it he continued?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>Why cannot we be content to administer this Government as it was made &mdash; a confederacy of sovereign and independent States?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>Let us recognize the sovereignty and independence of each State, refrain from <pb id="p.39" n="39"/> interfering with the domestic institutions and regulations of other States, permit the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> and new States to decide their institutions for themselves, as we did when we were in their condition; blot out these lines of <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, and resort back to these lines of State boundaries which the <rs>Constitution</rs> has marked out, and engraved upon the face of the country; have no other dividing lines but these, and we will be <num value="1">one</num> united, harmonious people, with fraternal feelings, and no discord or dissension. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>These are my views and these are the principles to which I have devoted all my energies since <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, when I acted side by side with the immortal <rs>Clay</rs> and the godlike <rs>Webster</rs> in that memorable struggle in which Whigs and Democrats united upon a common platform of patriotism and the <rs>Constitution</rs>, throwing aside partisan feelings in order to restore peace and harmony to a distracted country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>And when I stood beside the death-bed of <persName n="Clay,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0004.00039.00201" reg="mostcommon:Clay,Henry,,,:24"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName>, and heard him refer with feelings and emotions of the deepest solicitude to the welfare of the country, and saw that he looked upon the principle embodied in the great Compromise measures of <dateStruct value="1550--"><year reg="1550">1550</year></dateStruct>, the principle of the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill, the doctrine of leaving each State and Territory free to decide its institutions for itself, as the only means by which the peace of the country could be preserved and the <rs>Union</rs> perpetuated,--I pledged him, on that death-bed of his, that so long as I lived my energies should be devoted to the vindication of that principle, and of his fame as connected with it. I gave the same pledge to the great expounder of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, he who has been called the <quote><name n="God" type="God">god</name>-like <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0024.0004.00039.00202" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>I looked up to <persName n="Clay,,,,," id="n0024.0004.00039.00203" reg="mostcommon:Clay,Henry,,,:24"><surname>Clay</surname></persName> and him as a son would to a father, and I call upon the people of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, and the people of the whole Union, to bear testimony, that never since the sod has been laid upon the graves of these eminent statesmen have I failed, on any occasion, to vindicate the principle with which the last great, crowning acts of their lives were identified, or to vindicate their names whenever they have been assailed; and now my life and energy are devoted to this great work as the means of preserving this Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>This Union can only be preserved by maintaining the fraternal feeling between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>, the <rs>East</rs> and the <rs>West</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>If that good feeling can be preserved, the <rs>Union</rs> will be as perpetual as the fame of its great founders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>It can be maintained by preserving the sovereignty of the <name>States</name>, the right of each State and each Territory to settle its domestic concerns for itself; and the duty of each to refrain from interfering with the other in any of its local or domestic institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>Let that be done, and the <rs>Union</rs> will be perpetual ; let that be done, and this Republic, which began with <num value="13">thirteen</num> States, and which now numbers <num value="32">thirty-two</num>, which, when it began, only extended from the <rs>Atlantic</rs> to the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, but now reaches to the <rs>Pacific</rs>, may yet expand, <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, until it covers the whole Continent, and becomes <num value="1">one</num> vast ocean-bound confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>Then, my friends, the path of duty, of honor, of patriotism, is plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>There are a few simple principles to be preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>Bear in mind the dividing line between State rights and Federal authority; let us maintain the great principles of popular sovereignty, of State rights, and of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> as the <rs>Constitution</rs> has made it, and this Republic will endure forever. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>While I am willing, sir, to attribute a part of this demonstration to those kind and friendly personal relations to which you have referred, I cannot conceal from myself that the controlling and pervading element in this great mass of human beings is devotion to that principle of self-government to which so many years of my life have been devoted; and rejoice more in considering it, an approval of my support of a cardinal principle than I would if I could appropriate it to myself as a personal compliment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>You but speak rightly when you assert that during the last session of Congress there was an attempt to violate <num value="1">one</num> of the fundamental principles upon which our free institutions rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>The attempt to force the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> upon the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> against their will, would have been, if successful, subversive of the great fundamental principles upon which all our institutions rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>If there is any <num value="1">one</num> principle more sacred and more vital to the existence of a free government than all others, it is the right of the people to form and ratify the <rs>Constitution</rs> under which they are to live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>It is the corner-stone of the temple of liberty, it is the foundation upon which the whole structure rests, and whenever it can be successfully evaded self-government has received a vital stab.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>I deemed it my duty, as a citizen and as a representative of the <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">State of Illinois</placeName>, to resist, with all my energies and with whatever of ability I could command, the consummation of that effort to force a Constitution upon an unwilling people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>I am aware that other questions have been connected, or attempted to be connected, with that great struggle, but they were mere collateral questions, not affecting the main point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>My opposition to the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> rested solely upon the fact that it was not the act and deed of that people, and that it did not embody their will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>I did not object to it upon the ground of the slavery clause contained in it. I should have resisted it with the same energy and determination even if it had <pb id="p.41" n="41"/> been a free State instead of a slaveholding State ; and as an evidence of this fact I wish you to bear in mind that my speech against that <placeName key="tgn,2036684" n="1.000 1" reg="lecompton, douglas, kansas">Lecompton</placeName> act was made on the <dateStruct value="-12-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> day of <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, nearly <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> before the vote was taken on the acceptance or rejection of the slavery clause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>I did not then know, I could not have known, whether the slavery clause would be accepted or rejected ; the general impression was that it would be rejected, and in my speech I assumed that impression to be true ; that probably it would be voted down ; and then I said to the <orgName n="U. S. Senate" type="org">U, S. Senate</orgName>, as I now proclaim to you, my constituents, that you have no more right to force a free State upon an unwilling people than you have to force a slave State upon them against their will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>You have no right to force either a good or a bad thing upon a people who do not choose to receive it. And then, again, the highest privilege of our people is to determine for themselves what kind of institutions are good and what kind of institutions are bad, and it may be true that the same people, situated in a different latitude and different climate, and with different productions and different interests, might decide the same question <num value="1">one</num> way in the <rs>North</rs> and another way in the <rs>South</rs>, in order to adapt their institutions to the wants and wishes of the people to be affected by them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>You all are familiar with the <name>Lecompton</name> struggle and I will occupy no more time upon the subject, except to remark that when we drove the enemies of the principle of popular sovereignty from the effort to force the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> upon the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, and when we compelled them to abandon the attempt and to refer that Constitution to that people for acceptance or rejection, we obtained a concession of the principle for which I had contended throughout the struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>When I saw that the principle was conceded, and that the <rs>Constitution</rs> was not to be forced on <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> against the wishes of the people, I felt anxious to give the proposition my support ; but, when I examined it, I found that the mode of reference to the people and the form of submission, upon which the vote was taken, was so objectionable as to make it unfair and unjust. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>Sir, it is an axiom with me that in every free government an unfair election is no election at all. Every election should be free, should be fair, with the same privileges and the same inducements for a negative as for an affirmative vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>The objection to what is called the <quote><persName n="English,,,,," id="n0024.0005.00041.00209" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName></quote> proposition, by which the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> was referred back to the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, was this that if the people chose to accept the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> they could come in with only <num value="35000">35,000</num> inhabitants, while if they determined to reject it in order to form another more in accordance with their wishes and sentiments, they were compelled to stay out until they should have <num value="93420">93,420</num> inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>In other words, it was making a distinction and discrimination between free States and slave States under the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>I deny the justice, I deny the right, of any distinction or discrimination between the <name>States</name> <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, free or slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>Equality among the <name>States</name> is a fundamental principle of this government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>Hence, while I will never consent to the passage of a law that a slave State may come in with <num value="35000">35,000</num>, while a free State shall not come in unless it have <num value="93000">93,000</num>, on the other hand, I shall not consent to admit a free State with a population of <num value="35000">35,000</num>, and require <num value="93000">93,000</num> in a slaveholding State. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>My principle is to recognize each State of the <rs>Union</rs> as independent, sovereign and equal in its sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>I will apply that principle not only to the original <num value="13">thirteen</num> States, but to the <name>States</name> which have since been brought into the <rs>Union</rs>, and also to every State that shall hereafter be received, <quote>as long as water shall run and grass grow.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>For these reasons I felt compelled, by a sense of duty, by a conviction of principle, to record my vote against what is called the <rs>English</rs> bill ; but yet the bill became a law, and under that law an election has been ordered to be held on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Monday in <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> for the purpose of determining the question of the acceptance or rejection of the proposition submitted by Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>I have no hesitation in saying to you, as the chairman of your committee has justly said in his address, that whatever the decision of the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> may be at that election, it must be final and conclusive of the whole subject; for if at that <pb id="p.42" n="42"/> election a majority of the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> shall vote for the acceptance of the <name>Congressional</name> proposition, <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> from that moment becomes a State of the <rs>Union</rs>, the law admitting her becomes irrepealable, and thus the controversy terminates forever; if, on the other hand, the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> shall vote down that proposition, as it is now generally admitted they will, by a large majority, then from that instant the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> is <hi rend="italics">dead</hi>, dead beyond the power of resurrection, and thus the controversy terminates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>And when the monster shall die I shall be willing, and trust that all of you will be willing, to acquiesce in the death of the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>The controversy may now be considered as terminated, for in <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> from now it will be finally settled, and all the ill-feeling, all the embittered feeling which grew out of it shall cease, unless an attempt should be made in the future to repeat the same outrage upon popular rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>I need not tell you that my past course is a sufficient guarantee that if the occasion shall ever arise again while I occupy a seat in the <orgName n="U. S. Senate" type="org">United States Senate</orgName>, you will find me carrying out the same principle that I have this winter, with all the energy and all the power I may be able to command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>I have the gratification of saying to you that I do not believe that that controversy will ever arise again ; <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, because the fate of <placeName key="tgn,2036684" n="1.000 1" reg="lecompton, douglas, kansas">Lecompton</placeName> is a <hi rend="italics">warning</hi> to the people of every Territory and of every State to be cautious how the example is repeated; and secondly, because the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, in his annual message, has said that he trusts the example in the <rs>Minnesota</rs> case, wherein Congress passed a law, called an enabling act, requiring the <rs>Constitution</rs> to be submitted to the people for acceptance or rejection, will be followed in all future cases. [ <quote>That was right.</quote> ] I agree with you that it was right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>I said so on the day after the message was delivered, in my speech in the <name>Senate</name> on the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>, and I have frequently in the debate tendered to the <rs>President</rs> and his friends, tendered to the <name>Lecomptonites</name>, my voluntary pledge that if he will stand by that recommendation, and they will stand by it, that they will find me working hand in hand with them in the effort to carry it out. All we have to do, therefore, is to adhere firmly in the future as we have done in the past, to the principle contained in the recommendation of the <rs>President</rs> in his annual message, that the example in the <rs>Minnesota</rs> case shall be carried out in all future cases of the admission of Territories into the <rs>Union</rs> as States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>Let that be done and the principle of popular sovereignty will be maintained in all of its vigor and all of its integrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>I rejoice to know that <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> stands prominently and proudly forward among the <name>States</name> which <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> took their position firmly and immovably upon this principle of popular sovereignty, applied to the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> as well as to the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>You all recollect when in <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> the peace of the country was disturbed in consequence of the agitation of the slavery question, and the effort to force the <rs>Wilmot Proviso</rs> upon all the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, that it required all the talent and all the energy, all the wisdom, all the patriotism, of a Clay and a Webster, united with other great party leaders, to devise a system of measures by which peace and harmony could be restored to our distracted country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>Those compromise measures eventually passed and mere recorded on the statute book, not only as the settlement of the then existing difficulties, but as furnishing a rule of action which should prevent in all future time the recurrence of like evils, if they were firmly and fairly carried out. Those compromise measures rested, as I said in my speech at <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>, on my return home that year, upon the principle that every people ought to have the right to form and regulate their own domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>They were founded upon the principle that, while every State possessed that right under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, that the same right ought to be extended to and exercised by the people of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>When the <orgName n="Illinois Legislature" type="legislature">Illinois Legislature</orgName> assembled, a few months after the adoption of these measures, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing the members did was to review their action upon this slavery agitation, and to correct the errors into which their predecessors had fallen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>You remember that their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> act was to repeal the <rs>Wilmot Proviso</rs> instructions to our <persName n="Senators,,U.,S.,," id="n0024.0005.00042.00210" reg="default:Senators,U.,S.,,"><foreName>U.</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Senators</surname></persName>, which had been previously passed, and in lieu of them to record another <pb id="p.43" n="43"/> resolution upon the journal, with which you must all be familiar &mdash; a resolution brought forward by <persName n="Edwards,Mister,Ninian,,," id="n0024.0005.00043.00211" reg="default:Edwards,Ninian,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Ninian</foreName> <surname>Edwards</surname></persName>, and adopted by the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> by a vote of <num value="61">61</num> in the affirmative to <num value="4">4</num> in the negative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>That resolution I can quote to you in almost its precise language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>It declared that the great principle of self-government was the birthright of freemen ; was the gift of heaven ; was achieved by the blood of our revolutionary fathers, and must be continued and carried out in the organization of all the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> and the admission of all new States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>That became the <rs>Illinois</rs> platform by the united voices of the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> and of the <orgName n="Whig Party" type="party">Whig party</orgName> in <dateStruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></dateStruct> ; all the <rs>Whigs</rs> and all the <name>Democrats</name> in the <name>Legislature</name> uniting in an affirmative vote upon it, and there being only <num value="4">4</num> votes in the negative, of Abolitionists, of course, that resolution stands upon the journal of your Legislature to this day and hour unrepealed, as a standing, living, perpetual instruction to the <rs>Senators</rs> from <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> in all time to come to carry out that principle of self-government and allow no limitation upon it in the organization of any Territories or the admission of any new States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>In <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, when it became my duty as the chairman of the committee on Territories to bring forward a bill for the organization of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> and <placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName>, I incorporated that principle in it and Congress passed it, thus carrying the principle into practical effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>I will not recur to the scenes which took place all over the country in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct> when that <placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> bill passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>I could then travel from <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName> by the light of my own effigies, in consequence of having stood up for it. I leave it to you to say how I met that storm, and whether I quailed under it; whether I did not <quote>face the music,</quote> justify the principle, and pledge my life to carry it out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>A friend here reminds me, too, that when making speeches then, justifying the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill and the great principle of self-government, that I predicted that in less than <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> you would have to get out a search warrant to find an anti-<placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> man. Well, I believe I did make that prediction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>I did not claim the power of a prophet, but it occurred to me that among a free people, and an honest people, and an intelligent people, that <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> was long enough for them to come to an understanding that the great principle of self-government was right, not only in the <name>States</name>, but in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>I rejoiced this year to see my prediction, in that respect, carried out and fulfilled by the unanimous vote, in <num value="1">one</num> form or another of both Houses of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>If you will remember that pending this <placeName key="tgn,2036684" n="1.000 1" reg="lecompton, douglas, kansas">Lecompton</placeName> controversy that gallant old <persName n="Roman,,,,," id="n0024.0005.00043.00212" reg="mostcommon:Roman,nomatch:0"><surname>Roman</surname></persName>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>'s favorite son, the worthy successor of the immortal Clay-I allude, as you know, to the gallant <persName n="Crittenden,,John,J.,," id="n0024.0005.00043.00213" reg="default:Crittenden,John,J.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName>-brought forward a bill, now known as the <name>Crittenden</name>-<persName n="Montgomery,,,,," id="n0024.0005.00043.00214" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,nomatch:0"><surname>Montgomery</surname></persName> bill, in which it was proposed that the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> should be referred back to the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, to be decided for or against it, at a fair election, and if a majority of the people were in favor of it, that <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> should come into the <rs>Union</rs> as a slaveholding State, but that if a majority were against it, that they should make a new Constitution, and come in with slavery or without it, as they thought proper. [ <quote>That was right.</quote> ] Yes, my dear sir, it was not only right, but it was carrying out the principle of the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill in its letter and in its spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>Of course I voted for it, and so did every Republican <rs type="role2">Senator</rs> and Representative in Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>I have found some Democrats so perfectly straight that, they blame me for voting for the principle of the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill because the <name>Republicans</name> voted the same way. [Great laughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>Yes! not only that, but with the black Republicans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>Well, there are different modes of stating that proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>The <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi></orgName> says that <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0005.00043.00216" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> did not vote with the <name>Republicans</name>, but that on that question the <name>Republicans</name> went over to <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0005.00043.00217" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> and voted with him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>My friends, I have never yet abandoned a principle because of the support I found men yielding to it, and I shall never abandon my Democratic principles merely because Republicans come to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>For what do we travel over the country and make speeches in every political canvass, if it is not to enlighten the minds <pb id="p.44" n="44"/> of these Republicans ; to remove the scales from their eyes, and to impart to them the light of democratic vision, so that they may be able to carry out the <rs>Constitution</rs> of our country as our fathers made it. And if by preaching our principles to the people we succeed in convincing the <name>Republicans</name> of the errors of their ways, and bring them over to us, are we bound to turn traitors to our principles, merely because they give them their support?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>All I have to say is that I hope the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> will stand firm, in the future, by the vote they gave on the <name>Crittenden</name>-<persName n="Montgomery,,,,," id="n0024.0005.00044.00218" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,nomatch:0"><surname>Montgomery</surname></persName> bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>I hope we will find, in the resolutions of their County and Congressional Conventions, no declarations of <quote>no more slave States to be admitted into this Union,</quote> but in lieu of that declaration that we will find the principle that the people of every State and every Territory shall come into the <rs>Union</rs> with slavery or without it, just as they please, without any interference on the part of Congress. </p>

<p>He believes there is no right on the part of the free people of the free States to enter the slave States and interfere with the question of slavery, hence he does not propose to go into <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and stir up a civil war and a servile war between the blacks and the whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>He is going to carry it out by means of a <orgName n="Political Party" type="party">political party</orgName>, that has its adherents only in the free States ; a <orgName n="Political Party" type="party">political party</orgName> that does not pretend that it can give a solitary vote in the slave States of the <rs>Union</rs> ; and by this sectional vote he is going to elect a President of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> ; form a Cabinet and administer the <rs>Government</rs> on sectional grounds, being the power of the <rs>North</rs> over that of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>In other words, he invites a war of the <rs>North</rs> against the <rs>South</rs>, a warfare of the free States against the slaveholding States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>He asks all men in the free States to conspire to exterminate slavery in the <rs>Southern States</rs>, so as to make them all free, and then he notifies the <rs>South</rs> that unless they are going to submit to our efforts to exterminate their institutions, they must band together and plant slavery in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> and every Northern State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>Permit me to inquire whether the wrong, the outrage of interference by <num value="1">one</num> Slate with the local concerns of another, is worse when you actually invade them than it would be if you carried on the warfare from another State?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>For the purpose of illustration, suppose the <rs>British Government</rs> should plant a battery on the <placeName reg="Niagara River, New York, United States" key="tgn,2540762">Niagara river</placeName> opposite <placeName reg="Buffalo, Erie, New York" key="tgn,7013463">Buffalo</placeName> and throw their shells over into <placeName reg="Buffalo, Erie, New York" key="tgn,7013463">Buffalo</placeName>, where they should explode and blow up the houses and destroy the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>But yet, he says he is going to persevere in this system of sectional warfare, and I have no doubt he is sincere in what he says.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>I believe that the hopes of the friends of liberty throughout the world depend upon the perpetuity of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>But while I believe that my mode of preserving the <rs>Union</rs> is a very different <num value="1">one</num> from that of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0005.00046.00236" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, I believe that the <rs>Union</rs> can only be preserved by maintaining inviolate the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> as our fathers have made it. That Constitution guarantees to the people of every State the right to have slavery or not have it; to have negroes or not have them ; to have <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName> liquor laws or not have them; to have just such institutions as they choose, each State being left free to decide for itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>The framers of that Constitution never conceived the idea that uniformity in the domestic institutions of the different States was either desirable or possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>They well understood that the laws and institutions which would be well adapted to the granite hills of <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName> would be unfit for the rice plantations of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>; they well understood that each <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="13">thirteen</num> States had distinct and separate interests, and required distinct and separate local laws and local institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>And in view of that fact they provided that each State should retain its sovereign power within its own limits, with the right to make just such laws and just such institutions as it saw proper, under the belief that no <num value="2">two</num> of them would be alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>If they had supposed that uniformity was desirable and possible, why did they provide for a separate Legislature for each State?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>Why did they not blot out State sovereignty and State Legislatures, and give all the power to Congress, in order that the laws might be uniform?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>For the very reason that uniformity, in their opinion, was neither desirable or possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>We have increased from <num value="13">thirteen</num> States to <num value="32">thirty-two</num> States, and just in proportion as the number of States increases and our territory expands, there will be a still greater variety and dissimilarity of climate, of production and of interest, requiring a corresponding dissimilarity and variety in the local laws and institutions adapted thereto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>The laws that are necessary in the mining regions of <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>, would be totally useless and vicious on the prairies of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> ; the laws that would suit the lumber regions of <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName> or of <placeName reg="Minnesota" key="tgn,7007521">Minnesota</placeName>, would be totally useless <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> and valueless in the tobacco regions of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> ; the laws which would suit the manufacturing districts of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, would be totally unsuited to the planting regions of the <name>Carolinas</name>, of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, and of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>,. Each State is supposed to have interests separate and distinct from each and every other, and hence must have laws different from each and every other State, in order that its laws shall be adapted to the condition and necessities of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>Hence I insist that our institutions rest on the theory that there shall be dissimilarity and variety in the local laws and institutions of the different States instead of all being uniform; and you find, my friends, that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0005.00047.00237" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and myself differ radically and totally on the fundamental principles of this Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>He goes for consolidation, for uniformity in our local institutions, for blotting out State rights and State sovereignty, and consolidating all the power in the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, for converting these <num value="32">thirty-two</num> sovereign States into <num value="1">one</num> Empire, and making uniformity throughout the length and breadth of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>On the other hand, I go for maintaining the authority of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> within the limits marked out by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and then for maintaining and preserving the sovereignty of each and all of the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Union</rs>, in order that each State may regulate and adopt its own local institutions in its own way, without interference from any power whatsoever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>Thus you find there is a distinct issue of principles-principles irreconcilable-between <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0005.00047.00238" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>He goes for consolidation and uniformity in our Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>The object of his speech was to convey the idea to the people that the court could not be trusted, that the late <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> could not be trusted, that the present <num value="1">one</num> could not be trusted, and that <persName n="Douglas,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0005.00047.00241" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> could not be trusted ; that they were all conspirators in bringing about that corrupt decision, to which <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0005.00047.00242" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is determined he will never yield a willing obedience. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is that he objects to it because the court decided that negroes descended of slave parents are not citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; and secondly, because they have decided that the act of Congress, passed <dateStruct value="1820-03-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year>1820</year>,</dateStruct> prohibiting slavery in all of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> north of <num value="36">36</num>°<num value="30">30</num>&lsquo;, was unconstitutional and void, and hence did not have effect in emancipating a slave brought into that Territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>And he will not submit to that decision.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>But, my friends, <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0005.00049.00263" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> says that this <persName n="Scott,,Dred,,," id="n0024.0005.00049.00264" reg="default:Scott,Dred,,,"><foreName>Dred</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> decision destroys the doctrine of popular sovereignty, for the reason that the court has decided that Congress had no power to prohibit slavery in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, and hence he infers that it would decide that the <rs>Territorial Legislatures</rs> could not prohibit slavery there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1069"/>I will not stop to inquire whether the court will carry the decision that far or not. It would be interesting as a matter of theory, but of no importance in practice ; for this reason, that if the people of a Territory want slavery they will have it, and if they do not want it they will drive it out, and you cannot force it on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1070"/>Slavery cannot exist a day in the midst of an unfriendly people with unfriendly laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/>There is truth and wisdom in a remark made to me by an eminent southern <rs type="role2">Senator</rs>, when speaking of this technical right to take slaves into the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/>Said he, <quote>I do not care a fig which way the decision shall be, for it is of no particular consequence ; slavery cannot exist a day or an hour in any Territory or State unless it has affirmative laws sustaining and supporting it, furnishing police regulations and remedies, and an omission to furnish them would be as fatal as a constitutional prohibition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1073"/>Without affirmative legislation in its favor slavery could not exist any longer than a new-born infant could survive under the heat of the sun, on a barren rock, without protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1074"/>It would wilt and die for the want of support.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1075"/>So it would be in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1076"/>See the illustration in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/>The Republicans have told you, during the whole history of that Territory, down to last winter, that the pro-slavery party in the <name>Legislature</name> had passed a pro-slavery code, establishing and sustaining slavery in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, but that this pro-slavery Legislature did not truly represent the people, but was imposed upon them by an invasion from <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, and hence the <name>Legislature</name> were <num value="1">one</num> way and the people another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1078"/>Granting all this, and what has been the result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1079"/>With laws supporting slavery, but the people against, there is not as many slaves in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> to-day as there were on the day the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill passed and the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs> was repealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/>Why? Simply because slave owners knew that if they took their slaves into <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, where a majority of the people were opposed to slavery, that it would soon be abolished, and they would lose their right of property in consequence of taking them there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/>For that reason they would not take or keep them there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1082"/>If there had been a majority of the people in favor of slavery and the climate had been favorable, they would have taken them there, but the climate not being suitable, the interest of the people being opposed to it, and a majority of them against it, the slave owner did not find it profitable to take his slaves there, and consequently there are not as many slaves there to-day as on the day the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs> was repealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/>This shows clearly that if the people do not want slavery they will keep it out, and if they do want it they will protect it. <pb id="p.50" n="50"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/>You have a good illustration of this in the territorial history of this State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/>You all remember that by the <name>Ordinance</name> of <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>, slavery was prohibited in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, yet you all know, particularly you old settlers, who were here in territorial times, that the <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName>, in defiance of that Ordinance, passed a law allowing you to go into <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, buy slaves' and bring them into the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>, having them sign indentures to serve you and your posterity <measure n="99years" type="date">ninety-nine years</measure>, and their posterity thereafter to do the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/>This hereditary slavery was introduced in defiance of the act of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>That was the exercise of popular sovereignty, the right of a Territory to decide the question for itself in defiance of the act of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>On the other hand, if the people of a Territory are hostile to slavery they will drive it out. Consequently this theoretical question raised upon the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision, is worthy of no consideration whatsoever, for it is only brought into these political discussions and used as a hobby upon which to ride into office, or out of which to manufacture political capital. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>But <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0005.00050.00265" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s main objection to the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision I have reserved for my conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>His principal objection to that decision is that it was intended to deprive the negro of the rights of citizenship in the different States of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>Well, suppose it was, and there is no doubt that that was its legal effect, what is his objection to it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>Why, he thinks that a negro ought to be permitted to have the rights of citizenship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>He is in favor of negro citizenship, and opposed to the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision, because it declares that a negro is not a citizen, and hence is not entitled to vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>Here I have a direct issue with <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0005.00050.00266" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>I am not in favor of negro citizenship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/>I do not, believe that a negro is a citizen or ought-to be a citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>I believe that this Government of ours was founded, and wisely founded, upon the white basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>It was made by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity, to be executed and managed by white men. I freely concede that humanity requires us to extend all the protection, all the privileges, all the immunities, to the <rs>Indian</rs> and the negro which they are capable of enjoying consistent with the safety of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/>You may then ask me what are those rights, what is the nature and extent of the rights which a negro ought to have?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>My answer is that this is a question for each State and each Territory to decide for itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7007251" n="1.000 153" reg="illinois">Illinois</placeName> we have decided that a negro is not a slave, but we have at the same time determined that he is not a citizen and shall not enjoy any political rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/>I concur in the wisdom of that policy and am content with it. I assert that the sovereignty of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> had a right to determine that question as we have decided it, and I deny that any other State has a right to interfere with us or call us to account for that decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>In the <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">State of Maine</placeName> they have decided by their Constitution that the negro shall exercise the elective franchise and hold office on an equality with the white man. Whilst I do not concur in the good sense or correct taste of that decision on the part of <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName>, I have no disposition to quarrel with her. It is her business and not ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/>If the people of <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName> desire to be put on an equality with the negro, I do not know that anybody in this State will attempt to prevent it. If the white people of <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName> think a negro their equal, and that he has a right to come and kill their vote by a negro vote, they have a right to think so, I suppose, and I have no disposition to interfere with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1105"/>Then, again, passing over to New York, we find in that State they have provided that a negro may vote provided he holds <measure n="250dollars" type="currency">$250</measure> worth of property, but that he shall not unless he does; that is to say, they will allow a negro to vote if he is rich, but a poor fellow they will not allow to vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>In New York they think a rich negro is equal to a white man. Well, that is a matter of taste with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/>If they think so in that State, and do not carry the doctrine outside of it and propose to interfere with us, I have no quarrel to make with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>It is their business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/>There is a great, deal of philosophy and good sense in a saying of Fridley of <persName n="Kane,,,,," id="n0024.0005.00050.00267" reg="mostcommon:Kane,nomatch:0"><surname>Kane</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/>Fridley had a law suit before a justice of the peace, and the justice decided it against him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1111"/>That is all I have to say about these negro regulations and this negro voting in other States where they have systems different from ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1112"/>If it is their wish to have it so, be it so. There is no cause to complain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/><placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> has decided that it is not consistent with her safety and her prosperity to allow a negro to have either political rights or his freedom and hence she makes him a slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>That is her business, not mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1115"/>It is her right under the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1116"/>The sovereignty of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, and that alone, can decide that question, and-when she decides it there is no power on earth to which you can appeal to reverse it. Therefore, leave <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> as the <rs>Constitution</rs> has left her, a sovereign, independent State, with the exclusive right to have slavery or not, as she chooses, and so long as I hold power I will maintain and defend her rights against any assaults from whatever quarter they may come. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1117"/>I will never stop to inquire whether I approve or disapprove of the domestic institutions of a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1118"/>I maintain her sovereign rights, I defend her sovereignty from all assault, in the hope that she will join in defending us when we are assailed by any outside power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1119"/>How are we to protect our sovereign rights, to keep slavery out, unless we protect the sovereign rights to every other State to decide the question for itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1120"/>Let <placeName key="tgn,7007255" n="1.000 69" reg="kentucky">Kentucky</placeName>, or <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, or any other State, attempt to interfere in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, and tell us that we shall establish slavery, in order to make it uniform, according to <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0005.00051.00268" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s proposition, throughout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1121"/>the <rs>Union</rs>; let them come here and tell us that we must and shall have slavery, and I will call on you to follow me, and shed the last drop of our heart's blood in repelling the invasion and chastising their insolence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1122"/>And if we would fight for our reserved rights and sovereign power in our own limits, we must respect the sovereignty of each other State. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1123"/>Hence, you find that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0005.00051.00269" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and myself come to a direct issue on this whole doctrine of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1124"/>He is going to wage a war against it every where, not only in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, but in his native <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">State of Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1125"/>And why?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1126"/>Because he says that the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> contains this language : <quote>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal ; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights ; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,</quote> and he asks whether that instrument does not declare that all men are created equal.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1128"/>In his <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName> speech he says, in so many words, that it includes the negroes, that they were endowed by the <name>Almighty</name> with the right of equality with the white man, and therefore that that right is Divine &mdash; a right under the higher law ; that the law of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> makes them equal to the white man, and therefore that the law of the white man cannot deprive them of that right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1129"/>This is <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0005.00051.00274" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1130"/>He is conscientious in his belief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1131"/>I do not question his sincerity, I do not doubt that he in his conscience, believes that the <name>Almighty</name> made the negro equal to the white man. He thinks that the negro is his brother, I do not think that the negro is any kin of mine at all. And here is the difference between us, I believe that the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, in the words <quote>all men are created equal,</quote> was intended to allude only to the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, to men of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> birth or descent, being white men, that they were created equal, and hence that <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> had no right to deprive them of their political and religious privileges ; but the signers of that paper did not intend to include the <rs>Indian</rs> or the negro in that declaration, for if they had would they not have been bound to abolish slavery in every State and Colony from that day. Remember, too, that at the time the <name>Declaration</name> was put forth, every <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="13">thirteen</num> colonies were slaveholding colonies; every man who signed that Declaration represented slaveholding constituents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1132"/><pb id="p.52" n="52"/> Did those signers mean by that act to charge themselves, and all their constituents with having violated the law of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, in holding the negro in an inferior condition to the white man?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/>And yet, if they included negroes in that term, they were bound, as conscientious men, that day and that hour, not only to have abolished slavery throughout the land, but to have conferred political rights and privileges on the negro, and elevated him to an equality with the white man. [ <quote>They did not do it.</quote> ] I know they did not do it, and the very fact that they did not shows that they did not understand the language they used to include any but the white race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1134"/>Did they mean to say that the <rs>Indian</rs>, on this continent, was created equal to the white man, and that he was endowed by the <name>Almighty</name> with inalienable rights-rights so sacred that they could not be taken away by any Constitution or law that man could pass?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1135"/>Why, their whole action toward the <rs>Indian</rs> showed that they never dreamed that they were bound to put him on an equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1136"/>I am not only opposed to negro equality, but I am opposed to <name>Indian</name> equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1137"/>I am opposed to putting the coolies, now importing into this country, on an equality with us, or putting the <name>Chinese</name> or any inferior race on an equality with us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1138"/>And I am for placing them, as our fathers did, on an equality with us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1141"/>Let us only carry out those principles, and we will have peace and harmony in the different States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1143"/>His conscientious scruples lead him to believe that the negro is entitled by Divine right to the civil and political privileges of citizenship on an equality with the white man. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1144"/>For that reason he says he wishes the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision reversed.

He will <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> be called upon to strike out of the <rs>Constitution</rs> of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> that clause which prohibits free negroes and slaves from <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> or any other State coming into <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1147"/>When he blots out that clause, when he lets down the door or opens the gate for all the negro population to flow in and cover our prairies, until in midday they will look dark and black as night; when he shall have done this, his mission will yet be unfulfilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1148"/>Then it will be that he will apply his principles of negro equality, that is, if he can get the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision reversed in the meantime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1149"/>He will then change the <rs>Constitution</rs> again, and allow negroes to vote and hold office, and will make them eligible to the <name>Legislature</name>, so that thereafter they can have the right men for <persName n="Senators,,U.,S.,," id="n0024.0005.00052.00278" reg="default:Senators,U.,S.,,"><foreName>U.</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Senators</surname></persName>, He will allow them to vote to elect the <name>Legislature</name>, the <rs>Judges</rs>, and the <rs>Governor</rs>, and will make them eligible to the <orgName>office of Judge</orgName> or Governor, or to the <name>Legislature</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1150"/>He will put them on an equality with the white man. What then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1151"/>Of course, after making them eligible to the judiciary, when he gets <persName n="Cuffee,,,,," id="n0024.0005.00052.00279" reg="mostcommon:Cuffee,nomatch:0"><surname>Cuffee</surname></persName> elevated to the bench, he certainly will not refuse his judge the privilege of marrying any woman he may select!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1152"/>I submit to you whether these are not the legitimate consequences of his doctrine?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1153"/>If it be true, as he says, that by the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> and by Divine law, the negro is created the equal of the white man; if it be true that the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision is unjust and wrong, because it deprives the negro of citizenship and equality with the white man, then does it, not follow that if he had the power he would make negroes citizens, and give them all the rights and all the privileges of citizenship on an equality with white men?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1154"/>I think that is the inevitable conclusion.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1183"/><emph>Fellow-Citizens</emph>: Another election, which is deemed an important <num value="1">one</num>, is approaching, and, as I suppose, the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> will: without much difficulty, elect their State ticket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1184"/>But in regard to the <name>Legislature</name>, we, the <name>Republicans</name>, labor under some disadvantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1185"/>In the first place, we have a Legislature to elect upon an apportionment of the representation made several years ago, when the proportion of the population was far greater in the <rs>South</rs> (as compared with the <rs>North</rs>) than it now is; and inasmuch as our opponents hold almost entire sway in the <rs>South</rs>, and we a correspondingly large majority in the <rs>North</rs>, the fact that we are now to be represented as we were years ago, when the population was different, is, to us, a very great disadvantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1186"/>We had in the year <dateStruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></dateStruct>, according to law, a census or enumeration of the inhabitants, taken for the purpose of a new apportionment of representation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1187"/>We know what a fair apportionment of representation upon that census would give us. We know that it could not, if fairly made, fail to give the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> from <num value="6">six</num> to <num value="10">ten</num> more members of the <name>Legislature</name> than they can probably get as the law now stands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1188"/>It so happened at the last session of the <name>Legislature</name>, that our opponents, holding the control of both branches of the <name>Legislature</name>, steadily refused to give us such an apportionment as we were rightly entitled to have upon the census already taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1189"/>The Legislature steadily refused to give us such an apportionment as we were rightfully entitled to have upon the census taken of the population of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1190"/>The Legislature would pass no bill upon that subject, except such as was at least as unfair to us as the old <num value="1">one</num>, and in which, in some instances, <num value="2">two</num> men in the <rs type="place">Democratic regions</rs> were allowed to go as far toward sending a member to the <name>Legislature</name> as <num value="3">three</num> were in the <rs>Republican</rs> regions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1191"/>Comparison was made at the time as to representative and senatorial districts, which completely demonstrated that such was the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1192"/>Such a bill was passed and tendered to the <rs>Republican Governor</rs> for his signature ; but principally for the reasons I have stated, he withheld his approval, and the bill fell without becoming a law. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1193"/>Another disadvantage under which we labor is, that there are <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> Democratic <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> who will be members of the next Legislature, and will vote for the election of <rs type="role2">Senator</rs>, who are holding over in districts in which we could, on all reasonable calculation, elect men of our own, if we only had the chance of an election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1194"/>When we consider that there are but <num value="25">twenty-five</num> <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> in the <name>Senate</name>, taking <num value="2">two</num> from the side where they rightfully belong and adding them to the other, is to us a disadvantage not to be lightly regarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1195"/>Still, so it is; we have this to contend with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1196"/>Perhaps there is no ground of complaint on our part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1197"/>In attending to the many things involved in the last general election for <rs type="role2">President</rs>, <rs type="role" n="Governor">Governor</rs>, Auditor, <rs type="role" n="Treasurer">Treasurer</rs>, <rs type="role" reg="Superintendent">Superintendent</rs> of Public Instruction, Members of Congress, of the <name>Legislature</name>, County Officers, and so on, we allowed these things to happen by want of sufficient <pb id="p.55" n="55"/> attention, and we have no cause to complain of our adversaries, so far as this matter is concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1198"/>But we have some cause to complain of the refusal to give us a fair apportionment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1199"/>There is still another disadvantage under which we labor, and to which I will ask your attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1200"/>It arises out of the relative positions of the <num value="2">two</num> persons who stand before the <rs>State</rs> as candidates for the <name>Senate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1201"/><persName n="Douglas,Senator,,,," id="n0024.0006.00055.00289" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> is of world-wide renown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1202"/>All the anxious politicians of his party, or who have been of his party for years past, have been looking upon him as certainly, at no distant day, to be the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1203"/>They have seen in his round, jolly fruitful face, post-offices, land-offices, marshalships and cabinet appointments, charge-ships and foreign missions, bursting and sprouting out in wonderful exuberance, ready to be laid hold of by their greedy hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1204"/>And as they have been gazing upon this attractive picture so long, they cannot, in the little distraction that has taken place in the party, bring themselves to give up the charming hope ; but with greedier anxiety they rush about him, sustain him, and give him marches, triumphal entries, and receptions beyond what even in the days of his highest prosperity they could have brought about in his favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1205"/>On the contrary, nobody has ever expected me to be <rs type="role2">President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1206"/>In my poor, lean, lank face, nobody has ever seen that any cabbages were sprouting out. These are disadvantages all, taken together, that the <name>Republicans</name> labor under.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1207"/><hi rend="italics">We</hi> have to fight this battle upon principle, and upon principle alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1208"/>I am, in a certain sense, made the standard-bearer in behalf of the <name>Republicans</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1209"/>I was made so merely because there had to be some <num value="1">one</num> so placed &mdash; I being in nowise preferable to any other <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="25">twenty-five</num>-perhaps a <num value="100">hundred</num> we have in the <rs>Republican</rs> ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1210"/>Then I say I wish it to be distinctly understood and borne in mind, that, we have to fight this battle without many-perhaps without any &mdash; of the external aids which are brought to bear against us. So I hope those with whom I am surrounded have principle enough to nerve themselves for the task and leave nothing undone, that can be fairly done, to bring about the right result. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1211"/>After <persName n="Douglas,Senator,,,," id="n0024.0006.00055.00290" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> left <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, as his movements were made known by the public prints, he tarried a considerable time in the <placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567">city of New York</placeName> ; and it was heralded that, like another <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName>, he was lying by and framing the plan of his campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1212"/>It was telegraphed to <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington City</placeName>, and published in the <hi rend="italics">Union</hi> that he was framing his plan for the purpose of going to <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> to pounce upon and annihilate the treasonable and disunion speech which <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0024.0006.00055.00291" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had made here on the <dateStruct value="-06-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1213"/>Now, I do suppose that the <rs>Judge</rs> really spent some time in New York maturing the plan of the campaign, as his friends heralded for him. I have been able, by noting his movements since his arrival in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, to discover evidences confirmatory of that allegation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1214"/>I think I have been able to see what are the material points of that plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1215"/>I will, for a little while, ask your attention to some of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1216"/>What I shall point out, though not showing the whole plan, are, nevertheless, the main points, as I suppose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1217"/>They are not very numerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1218"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is Popular Sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1219"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> are attacks upon my speech made on the <dateStruct value="-06-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1220"/>Out of these <num value="3">three</num> points-drawing within the range of popular sovereignty the question of the <name>Lecompton</name> Constitution-he makes his principal assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1221"/>Upon these his successive speeches are substantially <num value="1">one</num> and the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1222"/>On this matter of popular sovereignty I wish to be a little careful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1223"/>Auxiliary to these main points, to be sure, are their thunderings of cannon, their marching and music, their fizzle-gigs and fire-works ; but I will not waste time with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1224"/>They are but the little trappings of the campaign. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1225"/>Coming to the substance &mdash; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> point--<quote>popular sovereignty.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1226"/>It is to be labeled upon the cars in which he travels; put upon the hacks he rides in ; to be flaunted upon the arches he passes under, and the banners which wave over him. It is to be dished up in as many varieties as a French cook can produce soups from potatoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1227"/>Now, as this is so great a staple of the plan of the campaign, it is worth while to examine it carefully; and if we examine only a very little, and do not allow ourselves to be misled, we shall be able to see that the whole thing is the most arrant <pb id="p.56" n="56"/> Quixotism that was ever enacted before a community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1228"/>What is the matter of popular sovereignty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1229"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing, in order to understand it, is to get a good definition of what it is, and after that to see how it is applied. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1230"/>I suppose almost every <num value="1">one</num> knows that, in this controversy, whatever has been said has had reference to the question of negro slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1231"/>We have not been in a controversy about the right of the people to govern themselves in the <hi rend="italics">ordinary</hi> matters of domestic concern in the <name>States</name> and Territories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1232"/><persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0006.00056.00292" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:8"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>, in <num value="1">one</num> of his late messages (I think when he sent up the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>), urged that the main points to which the public attention had been directed, was not in regard to the great variety of small domestic matters, but was directed to the question of negro slavery; and he asserts, that if the people had had a fair chance to vote on that question, there was no reasonable ground of objection in regard to minor questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1233"/>Now, while I think that the people had <hi rend="italics">not</hi> had given, or offered them, a fair chance upon that slavery question ; still, if there had been a fair submission to a vote upon that main question, the <rs>President</rs>'s proposition would have been true to the uttermost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1234"/>Hence, when hereafter I speak of popular sovereignty, I wish to be understood as applying what I say to the question of slavery only, not to other minor domestic matters of a Territory or a State. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1235"/>Does <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0006.00056.00293" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, when he says that several of the past years of his life have been devoted to the question of <quote>popular sovereignty,</quote> and that all the remainder of his life shall be devoted to it, does he mean to say that he has been devoting his life to securing to the people of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> the right to exclude slavery from the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1236"/>If he means so to say, he means to deceive; because he and every <num value="1">one</num> knows that the decision of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>, which he approves and makes especial ground of attack upon me for disapproving, forbids the people of a Territory to exclude slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1237"/>This covers the whole ground, from the settlement of a Territory till it reaches the degree of maturity entitling it to form a State Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1238"/>So far as all that ground is concerned, the <rs>Judge</rs> is not sustaining popular sovereignty, but absolutely opposing it. He sustains the decision which declares that the popular will of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> has no constitutional power to exclude slavery during their territorial existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1239"/>This being so, the period of time from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> settlement of a Territory till it reaches the point of forming a State Constitution, is not the thing that the <rs>Judge</rs> has fought for or is fighting for, but on the contrary, he has fought for, and is fighting for, the thing that annihilates and crushes out that same popular sovereignty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1240"/>Well, so much being disposed of, what is left?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1241"/>Why, he is contending for the right of the people, when they come to make a State Constitution, to make it for themselves, and precisely as best suits themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1242"/>I say again, that is Quixotic I defy contradiction when I declare that the <rs>Judge</rs> can find no <num value="1">one</num> to oppose him on that proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1243"/>I repeat, there is nobody opposing that proposition on <hi rend="italics">principle</hi>. Let me not be misunderstood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1244"/>I know that, with reference to the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>, I may be misunderstood ; but when you understand me correctly, my proposition will be true and accurate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1245"/>Nobody is opposing, or has opposed, the right of the people, when they form a Constitution, to form it for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1246"/><persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0006.00056.00294" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:8"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> and his friends have not done it ; they, too, as well as the <name>Republicans</name> and the <rs>Anti-Lecompton Democrats</rs>, have not done it ; but, on the contrary, they together have insisted on the right of the people to form a Constitution for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1247"/>The difference between the <rs>Buchanan</rs> men on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, and the <name>Douglas</name> men and the <name>Republicans</name> on the other, has not been on a question of principle, but on a question of <hi rend="italics">fact.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1248"/>The dispute was upon the question of fact, whether the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> had been fairly formed by the people or not. <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0006.00056.00295" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:8"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> and his friends have not contended for the contrary principle any more than the <name>Douglas</name> men or the <name>Republicans</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1249"/>They have insisted that whatever of small irregularities existed in getting up the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>, were such as happen in the settlement of all new Territories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1250"/>The question was, was it a fair emanation of the people?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1251"/>It <pb id="p.57" n="57"/> was a question of fact and not of principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1252"/>As to the principle, all were agreed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1253"/><persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0006.00057.00296" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> voted with the <name>Republicans</name> upon that matter of fact. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1254"/>He and they, by their voices and votes, denied that it was a fair emanation of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1255"/>The Administration affirmed that it was. With respect to the evidence bearing upon that question of fact, I readily agree that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0006.00057.00297" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> and the <name>Republicans</name> had the right on their side, and that the <name>Administration</name> was wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1256"/>But I state again that, as a matter of principle, there is no dispute upon the right of a people in a Territory, merging into a State to form a Constitution for themselves without outside interference from any quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1257"/>This being so, what is <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0006.00057.00298" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> going to spend his life for?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1258"/>Is he going to spend his life in maintaining a principle that nobody on earth opposes?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1259"/>Does he expect to stand up in majestic dignity, and go through his <hi rend="italics">apotheosis</hi> and become a <name n="God" type="God">god</name>, in the maintaining of a principle which neither man nor mouse in all <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> creation is opposing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1260"/>Now something in regard to the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> more specially; for I pass from this other question of popular sovereignty as the most arrant humbug that has ever been attempted on an intelligent community. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1261"/>As to the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>, I have already said that on the question of fact as to whether it was a fair emanation of the people or not, <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0006.00057.00299" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> with the <name>Republicans</name> and some <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0024.0006.00057.00300" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> had greatly the argument against the <name>Administration</name> ; and while I repeat this, I wish to know what there is in the opposition of <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0006.00057.00301" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> to the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> that entitles him to be considered the only opponent to it &mdash; as being <hi rend="italics">par excellence</hi> the very <hi rend="italics">quintessence</hi> of that opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1262"/>I agree to the rightfulness of his opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1263"/>He in the <name>Senate</name> and his class of men there formed the number <hi rend="italics"><num value="3">three</num></hi> and no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1264"/>In the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, his class of men &mdash; the <name>Anti-Lecompton</name> Democrats-formed a number of about <num value="20">twenty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1265"/>It took <num value="120">one hundred and twenty</num> to defeat the measure: against <num value="112">one hundred and twelve</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1266"/>Of the votes of that <num value="120">one hundred and twenty</num>, <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0006.00057.00302" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s friends furnished <num value="20">twenty</num>, to add to which there were <num value="6">six</num> <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0024.0006.00057.00303" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> and <num value="94">ninety-four</num> Republicans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1267"/>I do not say that I am precisely accurate in their numbers, but I am sufficiently so for any use I am making of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1268"/>Why is it that <num value="20">twenty</num> shall be entitled to all the credit of doing that work, and the <num value="100">hundred</num> none of it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1269"/>Why, if, as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0006.00057.00304" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> says, the honor is to be divided and due credit is to be given to other parties, why is just so much given as is consonant with the wishes, the interests and advancement of the <num value="20">twenty</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1270"/>My understanding is, when a common job is done, or a common enterprise prosecuted, if I put in <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure> to your <num value="1">one</num>, I have a right to take out <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure> to your <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1271"/>But he does not so understand it. He declares the dividend of credit for defeating <placeName key="tgn,2036684" n="1.000 1" reg="lecompton, douglas, kansas">Lecompton</placeName> upon a basis which seems unprecedented and incomprehensible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1272"/>Let us see. <placeName key="tgn,2036684" n="1.000 1" reg="lecompton, douglas, kansas">Lecompton</placeName> in the raw was defeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1273"/>It afterward took a sort of cooked up shape, and was passed in the <rs>English</rs> bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1274"/>It is said by the <rs>Judge</rs> that the defeat was a good and proper thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1275"/>If it was a good thing, why is he entitled to more credit than others, for the performance of that good act, unless there was something in the antecedents of the <name>Republicans</name> that might induce every <num value="1">one</num> to expect them to join in that good work, and at the same time, something leading them to doubt that he would?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1276"/>Does he place his superior claim to credit, on the ground that he performed a good act which was never expected of him?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1277"/>He says I have a proneness for quoting scripture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1278"/>If I should do so now, it occurs that perhaps he places himself somewhat upon the ground of the parable of the lost sheep which went astray upon the mountains, and when the owner of the <num value="100">hundred</num> sheep found the <num value="1">one</num> that was lost, and threw it upon his shoulders, and came home rejoicing, it was said that there was more rejoicing over the <num value="1">one</num> sheep that was lost and had been found, than over the <num value="90">ninety</num> and <num value="9">nine</num> in the fold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1279"/>The application is made by the <name>Saviour</name> in this parable, thus : <quote>Verily, I say unto you, there is more rejoicing in heaven over <num value="1">one</num> sinner that repenteth, than over <num value="90">ninety</num> and <num value="9">nine</num> just persons that need no repentance.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1280"/><pb id="p.58" n="58"/> </p> 
<p>And now, if the <rs>Judge</rs> claims the benefit of this parable, <hi rend="italics">let him repent</hi>. Let him not come up here and say: <quote>I am the only just person ; and you are the <num value="99">ninety-nine</num> sinners!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1281"/><hi rend="italics">Repentance</hi> before <hi rend="italics">forgiveness</hi> is a provision of the <rs>Christian</rs> system, and on that condition alone will the <name>Republicans</name> grant his forgiveness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1282"/>How will he prove that we have ever occupied a different position in regard to the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> or any principle in it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1283"/>He says he did not make his opposition on the ground as to whether it was a free or slave Constitution, and he would have you understand that the <name>Republicans</name> made their opposition because it ultimately became a slave Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1284"/>To make proof in favor of himself on this point, he reminds us that he opposed <placeName key="tgn,2036684" n="1.000 1" reg="lecompton, douglas, kansas">Lecompton</placeName> before the vote was taken declaring whether the <rs>State</rs> was to be free or slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1285"/>But he forgets to say that our Republican <rs type="role2">Senator</rs>, <persName n="Trumbull,,,,," id="n0024.0006.00058.00305" reg="mostcommon:Trumbull,Lyman,,,:7"><surname>Trumbull</surname></persName>, made a speech against <placeName key="tgn,2036684" n="1.000 1" reg="lecompton, douglas, kansas">Lecompton</placeName> even before he did. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1286"/>Why did he oppose it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1287"/>Partly, as he declares, because the members of the <rs>Convention</rs> who framed it were not fairly elected by the people ; that the people were not allowed to vote unless they had been registered; and that the people of whole counties, in some instances, were not registered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1288"/>For these reasons he declares the <rs>Constitution</rs> was not an emanation, in any true sense, from the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1289"/>He also has an additional objection as to the mode of submitting the <rs>Constitution</rs> back to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1290"/>But bearing on the question of whether the delegates were fairly elected, a speech of his, made something more than <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> ago, from this stand, becomes important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1291"/>It was made a little while before the election of the delegates who made <placeName key="tgn,2036684" n="1.000 1" reg="lecompton, douglas, kansas">Lecompton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1292"/>In that speech he declared there was every reason to hope and believe the election would be fair; and if any <num value="1">one</num> failed to vote, it would be his own culpable fault. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1293"/>I, a few days after, made a sort of answer to that speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1294"/>In that answer, I made, substantially, the very argument with which he combatted his <placeName key="tgn,2036684" n="1.000 1" reg="lecompton, douglas, kansas">Lecompton</placeName> adversaries in the <name>Senate</name> last winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1295"/>I pointed to the facts that the people could not vote without being registered, and that the time for registering had gone by. I commented on it as wonderful that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0006.00058.00306" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> could be ignorant of these facts, which every <num value="1">one</num> else in the nation so well knew. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1296"/>I now pass from popular sovereignty and <placeName key="tgn,2036684" n="1.000 1" reg="lecompton, douglas, kansas">Lecompton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1297"/>I may have occasion to refer to <num value="1">one</num> or both. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1298"/>When he was preparing his plan of campaign, Napoleon-like, in New York, as appears by <num value="2">two</num> speeches I have heard him deliver since his arrival in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, he gave special attention to a speech of mine, delivered here on the <dateStruct value="-06-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1299"/>He says that he carefully read that speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1300"/>He told us that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1301"/>at <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName> a week ago last night, and he repeated it at <placeName reg="Bloomington, McLean, Illinois" key="tgn,2026630">Bloomington</placeName> last night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1302"/>Doubtless, he repeated it again to-clay, though I did not hear him. In the the <num value="2">two</num> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> places-Chicago and <placeName reg="Bloomington, McLean, Illinois" key="tgn,2026630">Bloomington</placeName> &mdash; I heard him ; to-day I did not. He said he had carefully examined that, speech ; <hi rend="italics">when</hi> he did not say; but there is no reasonable doubt it was when he was in New York preparing his plan of campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1303"/>I am glad he did read it carefully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1304"/>He says it was evidently prepared with great care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1305"/>I freely admit it was prepared with care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1306"/>I claim not to be more free from errors than others-perhaps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1307"/>scarcely so much; but I was very careful not to put anything in that speech as a matter of fact, or make any inferences which did not appear to me to be true, and fully warrantable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1308"/>If I had made any mistake I was willing to be corrected; if I had drawn any inference in regard to <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0006.00058.00307" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, or any <num value="1">one</num> else, which was not warranted, I was fully prepared to modify it as soon as discovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1309"/>I planted myself upon the truth and the truth only, so far as I knew it, or could be brought to know it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1310"/>Having made that speech with the most kindly feelings toward <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0006.00058.00308" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, as manifested therein, I was gratified when I found that be had carefully examined it, and had detected no error of fact, nor any inference against him, nor any misrepresentations, of which he thought fit to complain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1311"/>In neither of the <num value="2">two</num> speeches I have mentioned, did he make any such complaint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1312"/>I will thank any <num value="1">one</num> who, will inform <pb id="p.59" n="59"/> me that he, in his speech to-day, pointed out anything I had stated, respecting him: as being erroneous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1313"/>I presume there is no such thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1314"/>I have reason to be gratified that the care and caution used in that speech, left it so that he, most of all others interested in discovering error, has not been able to point out <num value="1">one</num> thing against him which he could say was wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1315"/>He seizes upon the doctrines he supposes to be included in that speech, and declares that upon them will turn the issues of this campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1316"/>He then quotes, or attempts to quote, from my speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1317"/>I will not say that he willfully misquotes, but he does fail to quote accurately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1318"/>His attempt at quoting is from a passage which I believe I can quote accurately from memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1319"/>I shall make the quotation now, with some comments upon it, as I have already said, in order that the <rs>Judge</rs> shall be left entirely without excuse for misrepresenting me. I do so now, as I hope, for the last time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1320"/>I do this in great caution, in order that if he repeats his misrepresentation, it, shall be plain to all that he does so willfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1321"/>If, after all, he still persists, I shall be compelled to reconstruct the course I have marked out for myself; and draw upon such humble resources as I have, for a new course, better suited to the real exigencies of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1322"/>I set out, in this campaign, with the intention of conducting it strictly as a gentleman, in substance at least, if not in the outside polish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1323"/>The latter I shall never be, but that which constitutes the inside of a gentleman I hope I understand, and am not less inclined to practice than others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1324"/>It was my purpose and expectation that this canvass would be conducted upon principle, and with fairness on both sides, and it shall not be my fault if this purpose and expectation shall be given up. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1325"/>He charges, in substance, that I invite a war of sections; that I propose all the local institutions of the different States shall become consolidated and uniform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1326"/>What is there in the language of that speech which expresses such purpose, or bears such construction?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1327"/>I have again and again said that I would not enter into any of the <name>States</name> to disturb the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>. <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0006.00059.00309" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> said, at <placeName reg="Bloomington, McLean, Illinois" key="tgn,2026630">Bloomington</placeName>, that I used language most able and ingenious for concealing what I really meant ; and that while I had protested against entering into the slave States, I nevertheless did mean to go on the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio</placeName> and throw missiles into <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, to disturb them in their domestic institutions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1328"/>I said, in that speech, and I meant no more, that the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> ought to be placed in the very attitude where the framers of this Government placed it and left it. I do not understand that the framers of our Constitution left the people of the free States in the attitude of firing bombs or shells into the slave States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1329"/>I was not using that passage for the purpose for which he infers I did use it. I said : <quote>We are now far advanced into the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> year since a policy was created for the avowed object and with the confident promise of putting an end to slavery agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1330"/>Under the operation that policy that agitation has not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1331"/>In my opinion it will not cease till a crisis shall have been reached and passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1332"/><q direct="unspecified"> A house divided against itself cannot stand.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1333"/>I believe that this Government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1334"/>It will become all <num value="1">one</num> thing or all the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1335"/>Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the <name>States</name>, old as well as new, North as well as South.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1336"/></p> 
<p>Now you all see, from that quotation, I did not express my <hi rend="italics">wish</hi> on anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1337"/>In that passage I indicated no wish or purpose of my own; I simply expressed my <hi rend="italics">expectation</hi>. Cannot the <rs>Judge</rs> perceive a distinction between a <hi rend="italics">purpose</hi> and an <hi rend="italics">expectation</hi>? I have often expressed an expectation to die, but I have never expressed a <hi rend="italics">wish</hi> to die. I said at <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>, and now repeat; that I am quite aware this Government has endured, half slave and half free, for <measure n="82years" type="date">eighty-two years</measure>. I understand that little bit of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1338"/>I expressed the opinion I did, because I perceived-or thought I perceived &mdash; a new set of causes introduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1339"/>I did say at <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>, in my speech there, that I do wish to see the spread of slavery arrested, and to see it placed where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1340"/>I <pb id="p.60" n="60"/> said that because I supposed, when the public mind shall rest in that belief, we shall have peace on the slavery question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1341"/>I have believed-and now believe &mdash; the public mind did rest on that belief up to the introduction of the <rs>Nebraska</rs>, bill. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1342"/>Although I have ever been opposed to slavery, so far I rested in the hope and belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1343"/>For that reason, it had been a minor question with me. I might have been mistaken ; but I had believed, and now believe, that the whole public mind, that is, the mind of the great majority, had rested in that belief up to the repeal of the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1344"/>But upon that event, I became convinced that either I had been resting in a delusion, or the institution was being placed on a new basis &mdash; a basis for making it perpetual, national and universal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1345"/>Subsequent events have greatly confirmed me in that belief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1346"/>I believe that bill to be the beginning of a conspiracy for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1347"/>So believing, I have since then considered that question a paramount <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1348"/>So believing, I thought the public mind will never rest till the power of Congress to restrict the spread of it shall again be acknowledged and exercised on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, or on the other, all resistance be entirely crushed out. I have expressed that opinion, and I entertain it to-night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1349"/>It is denied that there is any tendency to the nationalization of slavery in these States. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1352"/>But he went on to say that the men of the present age, by their experience, have become wiser than the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs>; and the invention of the cotton gin had made the perpetuity of slavery a necessity in this country. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1353"/>As another piece of evidence tending to this same point : Quite recently in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, a man &mdash; the owner of slaves-made &mdash; a will providing that after his death certain of his slaves should have their freedom if they should so choose, and go to <placeName key="tgn,1000171" n="1.000 3" reg="liberia,africa">Liberia</placeName>, rather than remain in slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1354"/>They chose to be liberated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1355"/>But the persons to whom they would descend as property, claimed them as slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1356"/>A suit was instituted, which finally came to the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName></orgName>, and was therein decided against the slaves, upon the ground that a negro cannot make a choice &mdash; that they had no legal power to choose-could not perform the condition upon which their freedom depended. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1357"/>I do not mention this with any purpose of criticising it, but to connect it with the arguments as affording additional evidence of the change of sentiment upon this question of slavery in the direction of making it perpetual and national.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1358"/>I argue now as I did before, that there is such a tendency, and I am backed not merely by the facts, but by the open confession in the slave States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1359"/>And now, as to the <rs>Judge</rs>'s inference, that because I wish to see slavery placed in the course of ultimate extinction &mdash; placed where our fathers originally placed it-I wish to annihilate the <rs>State Legislatures</rs> &mdash; to force cotton to grow upon the tops of the <rs type="place">Green Mountains</rs> &mdash; to freeze ice in <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>--to cut lumber on the broad <placeName key="tgn,7007251" n="1.000 153" reg="illinois">Illinois</placeName> prairies &mdash; that I am in favor of all these ridiculous and impossible things. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1360"/>It seems to me it is a complete answer to all this to ask, if, when Congress did have the fashion of restricting slavery from free territory; when courts did have the fashion of deciding that taking a slave into a free country made him free-I say it is a sufficient answer to ask, if any of this ridiculous nonsense about consolidation, and uniformity, did actually follow?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1361"/>Who heard of any such thing, because of the <name>Ordinance</name> of <num value="87">87</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1362"/>because of the <rs>Missouri Restriction</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1363"/>because of the numerous court decisions of that character? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1364"/>Now, as to the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision ; for upon that he makes his last point at me. He boldly takes ground in favor of that decision. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1365"/>This is <num value="0.5">one-half</num> the onslaught, and <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the entire plan of the campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1366"/>I am opposed to that decision in a certain sense, but not in the sense which he puts <pb id="p.61" n="61"/> on it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1367"/>I never have proposed to do any such thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1368"/>I think, that in respect for judicial authority, my humble history would not suffer in comparison with that of <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0006.00061.00314" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1369"/>He would have the citizen conform his vote to that decision ; the member of Congress, his ; the <rs>President</rs>, his use of the veto power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1370"/>He would make, it a rule of political action for the people and all the departments of the <rs>Government</rs>: I would not. By resisting it as a political rule, I disturb no right of property, create no disorder excite no mobs. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1372"/>Last night, at <placeName reg="Bloomington, McLean, Illinois" key="tgn,2026630">Bloomington</placeName>, he took some notice of that reply; but entirely forgot to remember that part of it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1373"/>He renews his onslaught upon me, forgetting to remember that I have turned the tables against himself on that very point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1374"/>I renew the effort to draw his attention to it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1375"/>I wish to show that I am sustained by authority, in addition to that heretofore presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/>I do not expect to convince the <rs>Judge</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1377"/>It is part of the plan of his campaign, and he will cling to it with a desperate gripe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1378"/>Even; turn it upon him &mdash; the sharp point against him, and gaff him through &mdash; he will still cling to it till he can invent some new dodge to take the place of it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1396"/>They have contended for that declaration, in the very teeth of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>, for more than <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1397"/>In fact, they have reduced the decision to an absolute nullity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1407"/>I submit that the proposition that the thing which determines whether a man is free or a slave, is rather <hi rend="italics">concrete</hi> than <hi rend="italics">abstract</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1408"/>How has the planting of slavery in new countries always been effected?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1453"/>It was a sort of necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1454"/>We had gone through our struggle and secured our own independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1455"/>The framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> found the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> amongst their other institutions at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1456"/>They found that, by an effort to eradicate it, they might, lose much of what they had already gained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1457"/>They were obliged to bow to the necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1458"/>They gave power to Congress to abolish the slave trade at the end of <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>. They also prohibited it in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> where it did not <pb id="p.64" n="64"/> exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1459"/>They did what they could and yielded to the necessity for the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1460"/>I also yield to all which follows from that necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1461"/>What I would most desire would be the separation of the <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs> races. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1462"/><num value="1">One</num> more point; on this <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName> speech which <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0006.00064.00340" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> says he has read so carefully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1463"/>I expressed my belief in the existence of a conspiracy to perpetuate and nationalize slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1464"/>I did not profess to know it, nor do I now. I showed the part <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0006.00064.00341" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> had played in the string of facts, constituting to my mind the proof of that conspiracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1465"/>I showed the parts played by others. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1466"/>I charged that the people had been deceived into carrying the last Presidential election, by the impression that the people of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> might exclude slavery if they chose, when it was known in advance by the conspirators, that the court was to decide that neither Congress nor the people could so exclude slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1467"/>These charges are more distinctly made than anything else in the speech. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1469"/>He has not, so far as I know, contradicted those charges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1470"/>In the <num value="2">two</num> speeches which I heard, he certainly did not. On his own tacit admission I renew that charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1471"/>I charge him with having been a party to that conspiracy and to that deception for the sole purpose of nationalizing slavery. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1478"/>Recent events have interposed difficulties in the way of such an arrangement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1479"/>I went to <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName> last week for the purpose of conferring with the <rs>Democratic</rs> <orgName n="State Central Committee" type="committee">State Central Committee</orgName> upon the mode of conducting the canvass, and with them, and under their advice, made a list of appointments covering the entire period until late in <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1480"/>The people of the several localities have been notified of the times and places of the meetings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1481"/>Those appointments have all been made for Democratic meetings, and arrangements have been made by which the <rs>Democratic</rs> candidates for Congress, for the <name>Legislature</name>, and other offices, will be present and address the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1482"/>It is evident, therefore, that these various candidates, in connection with myself, will occupy the whole time of the day and evening, and leave no opportunity for other speeches. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1483"/>Besides, there is another consideration which should be kept in mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1484"/>It has been suggested recently that an arrangement had been made to bring out <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> candidate for the <orgName n="U. S. Senate" type="org">United States Senate</orgName>, who, with yourself, should canvass the <rs>State</rs> in opposition to me, with no other purpose than to insure my defeat, by dividing the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> for your benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1485"/>If I should make this arrangement with you, it is more than probable that this other candidate, who has a common object with you, would desire to become a party to it, and claim the right to speak from the same stand ; so that he and you, in concert, might be able to take the opening and closing speech in every case. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1486"/>I cannot refrain from expressing my surprise if it was your original intention to invite such an <pb id="p.65" n="65"/> arrangement, that you should have waited until after I had made my appointments, inasmuch as we were both here in <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName> together for several days after my arrival, and again at Blooming ton, <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0024.0007.00065.00351" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName> where it was well known I went for the purpose of consulting with the <orgName n="State Central Committee" type="committee">State Central Committee</orgName>, and agreeing upon the plan of the campaign. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1487"/>While, under these circumstances, I do not feel at liberty to make any arrangements which would deprive the <rs>Democratic</rs> candidates for Congress, State officers, and the <name>Legislature</name> from participating in the discussion at the various meetings designated by the <rs>Democratic</rs> <orgName n="State Central Committee" type="committee">State Central Committee</orgName>, I will, in order to accommodate you as far as it is in my power to do so, take the responsibility of making an arrangement with you for a discussion between us at <num value="1">one</num> prominent point in each <orgName n="Congressional District" type="district">Congressional District</orgName> in the <rs>State</rs>, except the <orgName type="district" n="district 2">second</orgName> and <orgName type="district" n="district 6">sixth district</orgName> where we have both spoken, and in each of which cases you had the concluding speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1488"/>If agreeable to you, I will indicate the following places as those most suitable in the several Congressional Districts at which we should speak, to wit: <placeName key="tgn,2027931" n="1.000 13" reg="freeport, stephenson, illinois">Freeport</placeName>, <placeName reg="Ottawa, La Salle, Illinois" key="tgn,2029529">Ottawa</placeName>, <placeName reg="Galesburg, Knox, Illinois" key="tgn,7014039">Galesburg</placeName>, <placeName reg="Quincy, Adams, Illinois" key="tgn,7014306">Quincy</placeName>, <placeName reg="Alton, Madison, Illinois" key="tgn,7015715">Alton</placeName>, <placeName reg="Jonesboro, Clayton, Georgia" key="tgn,2023284">Jonesboro</placeName> and <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1489"/>I will confer with you at the earliest convenient opportunity in regard to the mode of conducting the debate, the times of meeting at the several places, subject to the condition, that where appointments have already been made by the <rs>Democratic</rs> <orgName n="State Central Committee" type="committee">State Central Committee</orgName> at any of those places, I must insist upon you meeting me at the times specified. </p>

An hour after, I saw a copy of your answer in the <orgName n="Chicago Times" type="newspaper">Chicago <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, and, reaching home, I found the original awaiting me. Protesting that your insinuations of attempted unfairness on my part are unjust, and with the hope that you did not very considerately make them, I proceed to reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1493"/>To your statement that <quote>It has been suggested, recently, that an arrangement had been made to bring out <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> candid date for the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1494"/>Surely you did not <hi rend="italics">deliberately</hi> conclude, as you insinuate, that I was expecting to draw you into an arrangement of terms, to be agreed on by yourself, by which <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> candidate and myself, <quote>in concert, might be able to take the opening and closing speech in every case.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1495"/></p> 
<p>As to your surprise that I did not sooner make the proposal to divide time with you, I can only say, I made it as soon as I resolved to make it. I did not know but that such proposal would come from you; I waited, respectfully to see. It may have been well known to you that you went to <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName> for the purpose of agreeing on the plan of campaign ; but it was not so known to me. When your appointments were announced in the papers, extending only to the <dateStruct value="-08-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, <num value="1">1</num>, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, considered it certain that you would make no proposal to me, and then resolved that, if my friends concurred, I would make <num value="1">one</num> to you. As soon thereafter as I could see and consult with friends satisfactorily, I did make the proposal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1496"/>It did not occur to me that the proposed arrangement could derange your plans after the latest of your appointments already made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1497"/>After that, there was, before the election, largely over <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> of clear time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1498"/>For you to say that we have already spoken at <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName> and <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName> and that on both occasions I had the concluding speech is hardly a fair statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1499"/>The truth rather is this: At <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>, <dateStruct value="-07-9"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="9">9th</day></dateStruct>, you made a carefully-prepared conclusion on my speech of <dateStruct value="-06-16"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="16">16th</day></dateStruct>. <measure n="24hours" type="date">Twenty-four hours</measure> after, I made a hasty conclusion on yours of the <num value="9" type="ordinal">9th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1500"/>You had <measure n="6days" type="date">six days</measure> to prepare, and concluded on me again at <placeName reg="Bloomington, McLean, Illinois" key="tgn,2026630">Bloomington</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="--16"><day reg="2">16th</day></dateStruct>. <measure n="24hours" type="date">Twenty-four hours</measure> after, I concluded again on you at <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1501"/>In the meantime, you had made another conclusion on me at <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName> which I did not hear, and of the contents of which I knew nothing when I spoke I so that your speech made in daylight, and mine at night, of the <num value="17" type="ordinal">17th</num>, at <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName>, were both made in perfect independence of each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1502"/>The.dates of making all these speeches will show, I think, that in the matter of time for preparation, the advantage has all been on your side ; and that none of the external circumstances have stood to my advantage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1503"/>I agree to an arrangement for us to speak at the <num value="7">seven</num> places you have named, and at your own times, provided you name the times at once, so that I, as well as you, can have to myself the time not covered by the arrangement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1504"/>As to the other details, I wish perfect reciprocity, and no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1521"/><emph>Ladies and Gentleman</emph>: I appear before you to-day for the purpose of discussing the leading political topics which now agitate the public mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1522"/>By an arrangement between <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0008.00066.00362" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and myself, we are present here to-day for the purpose of having a joint discussion, as the representatives of the <num value="2">two</num> great political parties of the <rs>State</rs> and Union, upon the principles in issue between those parties ; and this vast concourse of people shows the deep feeling which pervades the public mind in regard to the questions dividing us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1523"/>Prior to <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct> this country was divided into <num value="2">two</num> great political parties, known as the <rs>Whig</rs> and Democratic parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1524"/>Both were national and patriotic, advocating principles that were universal in their application.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1525"/>An old line Whig could proclaim his principles in <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> and <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1526"/>Whig principles had no boundary sectional line &mdash; they were not limited by the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio river</placeName>, nor by the <rs>Potomac</rs>, nor by the line of the free and slave States, but applied and were proclaimed wherever the <rs>Constitution</rs> ruled or the <rs>American</rs> flag waved over the <rs>American</rs> soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1527"/>So it was, and so it is with the great <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>, which, from the days of <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0024.0008.00066.00363" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:3"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> until this period, has proven itself to be the historic party of this nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1528"/>While the <rs>Whig</rs> and Democratic parties differed in regard to a bank, the tariff, distribution, <pb id="p.67" n="67"/> the specie circular and the sub-treasury, they agreed on the great slavery question which now agitates the, Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/>I say that the <orgName n="Whig Party" type="party">Whig party</orgName> and the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> agreed on this slavery question, while they differed on those matters of expediency to which I have referred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1530"/>The <orgName n="Whig Party" type="party">Whig party</orgName> and the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> jointly adopted the <name>Compromise</name> measures of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> as the basis of a proper and just solution of this slavery question in all its forms.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1532"/>In <dateStruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></dateStruct>, the <orgName n="Whig Party" type="party">Whig party</orgName> and the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> united in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> in adopting resolutions indorsing and approving the principles of the <name>Compromise</name> measures of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, as the proper adjustment of that question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/>[Here the speaker was interrupted by loud and long-continued applause.] My friends, silence will be more acceptable to me in the discussion of these questions than applause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/>I desire to address myself to your judgment, your understanding, and your consciences, and not to your passions or your enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/>When the <orgName n="Democratic Convention" type="convention">Democratic Convention</orgName> assembled in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> in the same year, for the purpose of nominating a Democratic candidate for the <name>Presidency</name>, it also adopted the <name>Compromise</name> measures of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> as the basis of Democratic action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/>Thus you see that up to <dateStruct value="1853--"><year reg="1853">1853</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">54</year></dateStruct>, the <orgName n="Whig Party" type="party">Whig party</orgName> and the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> both stood on the same platform with regard to the slavery question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>That platform was the right of the people of each State and each Territory to decide their local and domestic institutions for themselves, subject only to the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>During the session of Congress of <dateStruct value="1853--"><year reg="1853">1853</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">54</year></dateStruct>, I introduced into the <orgName n="United States Senate" type="senate">Senate of the United States</orgName> a bill to organize the <rs>Territories</rs> of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> and <placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> on that principle which had been adopted in the <name>Compromise</name> measures of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, approved by the <orgName n="Whig Party" type="party">Whig party</orgName> and the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></dateStruct>, and indorsed by the <orgName n="Whig Party" type="party">Whig party</orgName> and the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> in <orgName n="National Convention" type="convention">National Convention</orgName> in <dateStruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>In order that there might be no misunderstanding in relation to the principle involved in the <rs>Kansas</rs> and <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill, I put forth the true intent and meaning of the act in these words: <quote>It is the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any State or Territory, or to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1541"/>Thus, you see, that up to <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, when the <rs>Kansas</rs> and <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill was brought into Congress for the purpose of carrying out the principles which both parties had up to that time indorsed and approved, there had been no division in this country in regard to that principle except the opposition of the <name>Abolitionists</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1643"/>We have settled the slavery question as far as we are concerned; we have prohibited it in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> forever, and in doing so, I think we have done wisely and there is no man in the <rs>State</rs> who would be more strenuous in his opposition to the introduction of slavery than I would ; but, when we settled it for ourselves, we exhausted all our power over that subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1644"/>We have done our whole duty, and can do no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1645"/>We must leave each and every other State to decide for itself the same question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1646"/>In relation to the policy to be pursued toward the free negroes, we have said that they shall not vote ; whilst <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName>, on the other hand, has said that they shall vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1647"/><placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName> is a sovereign State, and has the power to regulate the qualifications of voters within her limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1653"/>Now, my friends, if we will only act conscientiously and rigidly upon this great principle of popular sovereignty, which guaranties to each State and Territory the right to do as it pleases on all things, local and domestic, instead of Congress interfering, we will continue at peace <num value="1">one</num> with another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>It is true they did place my name, though without authority, upon the committee, and afterward wrote me to attend the meeting of the committee, but I refused to do so, and I never had anything to do with that organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1685"/>They are just what we would be in their situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1686"/>If slavery did not now exist among them, they would not introduce it. If it did now exist amongst us, we should not instantly give it up. This I believe of the masses <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1687"/>Doubtless there are individuals on both sides, who would not hold slaves under any circumstances; and others who would gladly introduce slavery anew, if it were out of existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1688"/>We know that some Southern men do free their slaves, go North, and become tip-top Abolitionists ; while some Northern ones go South, and become most cruel slave-masters. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1689"/>When Southern people tell us they are no more responsible for the origin of slavery than we, I acknowledge the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1700"/>Free them, and make them politically and socially our equals?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1701"/>My own feelings will not admit of this ; and if mine would, we well know that those of the great mass of white people will not. Whether this feeling accords with justice and sound judgment, is not the sole question, if, indeed, it is any part of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1722"/>And so I think my friend, the <rs>Judge</rs>, is equally at fault when he charges me at the time when I was in Congress of having opposed our soldiers who were fighting in the <rs>Mexican</rs> war. The <rs>Judge</rs> did not make his charge very distinctly, but I can tell you what he can prove, by referring to the record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1723"/>You remember I was an old Whig, and whenever the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> tried to get me to vote that the war had been righteously begun by the <rs>President</rs>, I would not do it. But whenever they asked for any money, or land-warrants, or anything to pay the soldiers there, during all that time, I gave the same vote that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0008.00075.00470" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> did. You can think as you please as to whether that was consistent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1724"/>Such is the truth ; and the <rs>Judge</rs> has the right to make all he can out of it. But when he, by a general charge, conveys the idea that I witheld supplies from the soldiers who were fighting in the <rs>Mexican</rs> war, or did anything else to hinder the soldiers, he is, to say the least, grossly and altogether mistaken, as a consultation of the records will prove to him. As I have not used up so much of my time as I had supposed, I will dwell a little longer upon <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of these minor topics upon which the <rs>Judge</rs> has spoken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1725"/>He has read from my speech in <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName> in which I say that <quote>a house divided <pb id="p.76" n="76"/> against itself cannot stand.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1726"/>Does the <rs>Judge</rs> say it <hi rend="italics">can</hi> stand?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1727"/>I don't know whether he does or not. The <rs>Judge</rs> does not seem to be attending to me just now, but I would like to know if it is his opinion that a house divided against itself can stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1728"/>If he does, then there is a question of veracity, not between him and me, but between the <rs>Judge</rs> and an authority of a somewhat higher character. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1729"/>Now my friends, I ask your attention to this matter for the purpose of saying something seriously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1730"/>I know that the <rs>Judge</rs> may readily enough agree with me that the maxim which was put forth by the <name>Saviour</name> is true, but he may allege that I misapply it ; and the <rs>Judge</rs> has a right to urge that, in my application, I do misapply it, and then I have a right to show that I do not misapply it. When he undertakes to say that because I think this nation, so far as the question of slavery is concerned, will all become <num value="1">one</num> thing or all the other, I am in favor of bringing about a dead uniformity in the various States, in all their institutions, he argues erroneously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1731"/>The great variety of the local institutions in the <name>States</name>, springing from differences in the soil, differences in the face of the country, and in the climate, are bonds of Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1732"/>They do not make <quote>a house divided against itself,</quote> but they make a house united.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1733"/>If they produce in <num value="1">one</num> section of the country what is called for by the wants of another section, and this other section, can supply the wants of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, they are not matters of discord but bonds of union, true bonds of union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1734"/>But can this question of slavery be. considered as among <hi rend="italics">these</hi> varieties in the institutions of the country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1735"/>I leave it to you to say whether, in the history of our Government, this <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> has not always failed to be a bond of union, and, on the contrary, been an apple of discord, and an element of division in the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1736"/>I ask you to consider whether, so long as the moral constitution of men's minds shall continue to be the same, after this generation and assemblage shall sink into the grave, and another race shall arise, with the same moral and intellectual development we have-whether if that institution is standing in the same irritating position in which it now is, it will not continue an element of division?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1737"/>If so, then I have a right, to say that, in regard to this question, the <rs>Union</rs> is a house divided against itself; and when the <rs>Judge</rs> reminds me that I have often said to him that the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> has existed for <measure n="80years" type="date">eighty years</measure> in some States, and yet it does not exist in some others, I agree to the fact, and I account for it by looking at the position in which our fathers originally placed it-restricting it from the new <rs>Territories</rs> where it had not gone, and legislating to cut off its source by the abrogation of the slave-trade, thus putting the seal of legislation <hi rend="italics">against its spread</hi> The public mind <hi rend="italics">did</hi> rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1738"/>But lately, I think-and in this I charge nothing on the <rs>Judge</rs>'s motives-lately, I think, that he, and those acting with him, have placed that institution on a new basis, which looks to the <hi rend="italics">perpetuity and nationalization of slavery</hi>. And while it, is placed upon this new basis, I say, and I have said, that <num value="1">1</num> believe we shall not have peace upon the question until the opponents of slavery arrest the further spread of it, and place it, where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction ; or, on the other hand, that its advocates will push it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the <name>States</name>, old as well as new North as well as South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1739"/>Now, I believe if we could arrest the spread, and place it where <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0024.0008.00076.00471" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:1"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0024.0008.00076.00472" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:3"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Madison,,,,," id="n0024.0008.00076.00473" reg="mostcommon:Madison,nomatch:0"><surname>Madison</surname></persName> placed it, it <hi rend="italics">would be</hi> in the course of ultimate extinction, and the public mind mind as for <measure n="80years" type="date">eighty years</measure> past, believe that it was in the course of ultimate extinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1740"/>The crisis would be past and the institution might be let alone for a <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure>, if it should live so long, in the <name>States</name> where it exists, yet it would be going out of existence in the way best for both the black and the white races. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1743"/>What is Popular Sovereignty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1744"/>Is it the right of the people to have slavery or not have it, as they see fit, in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.? I will state-and I have an able man to watch me-my understanding is that Popular Sovereignty, as now applied to the question <pb id="p.77" n="77"/> of slavery, does allow the people of a Territory to have slavery if they want to, but does not allow them not to have it if they do <hi rend="italics">not</hi> want it. I do not mean that if this vast concourse of people were in a Territory of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, any <num value="1">one</num> of them would be obliged to have a slave if he did not want <num value="1">one</num> ; but I do say that, as I understand the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision, if any <num value="1">one</num> man wants slaves, all the rest have no way of keeping that <num value="1">one</num> man from holding them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1745"/>When I made my speech at <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName>, of which the <rs>Judge</rs> complains, and from which he quotes, I really was not thinking of the things which he ascribes to me at all. I had no thought in the world that I was doing anything to bring about a war between the free and slave States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1746"/>I had no thought in the world that I was doing anything to bring about a political and social equality of the <rs type="color">black</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs> races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1747"/>It never occurred to me that I was doing anything or favoring anything to reduce to a dead uniformity all the local institutions of the various States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1748"/>But I must say, in all fairness to him, if he thinks I am doing something which leads to these bad results, it is none the better that I did not mean it. It is just as fatal to the country, if I have any influence in producing it, whether I intend it or not. But can it be true, that placing this institution upon the original basis &mdash; the basis upon which our fathers placed it-can have any tendency to set the <rs>Northern</rs> and the <rs>Southern States</rs> at war with <num value="1">one</num> another, or that it can have any tendency to make the people of <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName> raise sugar-cane, because they raise it in <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, or that it can compel the people of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> to cut pine logs on the <rs type="place">Grand Prairie</rs>, where they will not grow, because they cut pine logs in <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName>, where they do grow?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1749"/>The <rs>Judge</rs> says this is a new principle started in regard to this question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1750"/>Does the <rs>Judge</rs> claim that he is working on the plan of the founders of Government?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/>I think he says in some of his speeches-indeed, I have <num value="1">one</num> here now &mdash; that he saw evidence of a policy to allow slavery to be south of a certain line, while north of it it should be excluded, and he saw an indisposition on the part of the country to stand upon that policy, and therefore he set about studying the subject upon <hi rend="italics">original principles</hi>, and upon <hi rend="italics">original principles</hi> he got up the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1752"/>I am fighting it upon these <quote>original principles</quote> --fighting it in the <name>Jeffersonian</name>, <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and Madisonian fashion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1753"/>Now, my friends, I wish you to attend for a little while to <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> other things in that <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName> speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1754"/>My main object was to show, so far as my humble ability was capable of showing to the people of this country, what I believed was the truth &mdash; that there was a <hi rend="italics">tendency</hi>, if not a conspiracy among those who have engineered this slavery question for the last <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure>, to make slavery perpetual and universal in this nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1755"/>Having made that speech principally for that object, after arranging the evidences that I thought tended to prove my proposition, I concluded with this hit of comment: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1757"/>When my friend, <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0008.00077.00477" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, came to <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>, on the <dateStruct value="-07-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, this speech having been delivered on the <dateStruct value="-06-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>, he made an harangue there, in which he took hold of this speech of mine, showing that be had carefully read it ; and while be paid no attention to <hi rend="italics">this</hi> matter at all, but complimented me as being a <quote>kind, amiable and intelligent gentleman,</quote> notwithstanding I had said this, he goes on and <pb id="p.78" n="78"/> eliminates, or draws out, from my speech this tendency of mine to set the <name>States</name> at war with <num value="1">one</num> another to make all the institutions uniform, and set the niggers and white people to marrying together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/>Then, as the <rs>Judge</rs> had complimented me with these pleasant titles (I must confess to my weakness), I was a little <quote>taken,</quote> for it came from a great man. I was not very much accustomed to flattery, and it came the sweeter to me. I was rather like the <name>Hoosier</name>, with the gingerbread, when he said he reckoned he loved it better than any other man, and got less of it. As the <rs>Judge</rs> had so flattered me, I could not make up my mind that he meant to deal unfairly with me ; so I went to work to show him that he misunderstood the whole scope of my speech, and that I really never intended to set the people at war with <num value="1">one</num> another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>As an illustration, the next time I met him, which was at <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName>, I used this expression, that I claimed no right under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, nor had I any inclination, to enter into the slave States and interfere with the institutions of slavery He says upon that : <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0024.0008.00078.00478" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> will not enter into the slave States, but will go to the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio</placeName>, on this side, and shoot over!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>He runs on, step by step, in the horse-chestnut style of argument, until in the <rs>Springfield</rs> speech he says, <quote>Unless he shall be successful in firing his batteries, until he shall have extinguished slavery in all the <name>States</name>, the <rs>Union</rs> shall be dissolved.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>Now I don't think that was exactly the way to treat <quote>a kind, amiable, intelligent gentlemen</quote> I know if I had asked the <rs>Judge</rs> to show when or where it was I had said that, if I didn't succeed in firing into the slave States until slavery should be extinguished, the <rs>Union</rs> should be dissolved, he could not, have shown it. I understand what he would do. He would say, <quote>I don't mean to quote from you, but this was the <hi rend="italics">result</hi> of what you say.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/>But I have the right to ask, and I do ask now, Did you not put it in such a form that an ordinary reader or listener would take it as an expression <hi rend="italics">from me</hi>? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/>In a speech at <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName>, on the night of the <dateStruct value="--17"><day reg="17">17th</day></dateStruct>, I thought I might as well attend to my own business a little, and I recalled his attention as well as I could to this charge of conspiracy to nationalize slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>I called his attention to the fact that he had acknowledged, in my hearing twice, that he had carefully read the speech, and, in the language of the lawyers, as he had twice read the speech, and still had put in no plea or answer, I took a default on him. I insisted that I had a right then to renew that charge of conspiracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1765"/><measure n="10days" type="date">Ten days</measure> afterward I met the <rs>Judge</rs> at <placeName reg="Clinton, De Witt, Illinois" key="tgn,2027215">Clinton</placeName> &mdash; that is to say, I was on the ground, but not in the discussion-and heard him make a speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>Then he comes in with his plea to this charge, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, and his pica when put in, as well as I can recollect it, amounted to this : that he never had any talk with <persName n="Taney,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0008.00078.00479" reg="mostcommon:Taney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Taney</surname></persName> or the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> with regard to the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision before it, was made I (<persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0024.0008.00078.00480" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>) ought to know that the man who makes a charge without knowing it to be true, falsifies as much as he who knowingly tells a falsehood; and lastly, that he would pronounce the whole thing a falsehood; but he would make no personal application of the charge of falsehood, not because of any regard for the <quote>kind, amiable, intelligent gentleman,</quote> but because of his own personal self-respect!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1767"/>I have understood since then (but [turning to <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0008.00078.00481" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>] will not hold the <rs>Judge</rs> to it if he is not willing) that he has broken through the <quote>self-respect,</quote> and has got to saying the thing <hi rend="italics">out</hi>. The <rs>Judge</rs> nods to me that it is so. It is fortunate for me that I can keep as good-humored as I do, when the <rs>Judge</rs> acknowledges that he has been trying to make a question of veracity with me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1768"/>I waive all objections that it was not filed till after default was taken, and demur to it upon the merits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1769"/>What if <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0008.00078.00482" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> never did talk with <persName n="Taney,Chief-Justice,,,," id="n0024.0008.00078.00483" reg="mostcommon:Taney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</roleName> <surname>Taney</surname></persName> and the <rs>President</rs>, before the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision was made, does it follow that he could not have had as perfect an understanding without talking as with it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1770"/>I am not disposed to stand upon my legal advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1771"/>I am disposed to take his denial as being like an answer in chancery, that he neither had any knowledge, information or belief in the existence of such a conspiracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1772"/>I am disposed to take his answer as being as broad as though he had put it in these words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1773"/>And now, I ask, even if he had done so, have not I a right <pb id="p.79" n="79"/> <hi rend="italics">to prove it</hi> on <hi rend="italics">him</hi>, and to offer the evidence of more than <num value="2">two</num> witnesses, by whom to prove it ; and if the evidence proves the existence of the conspiracy, does his broad answer denying all knowledge, information, or belief; disturb the fact?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1774"/>It can only show that he was <hi rend="italics">used</hi> by conspirators, and was not a <hi rend="italics">leader of</hi> them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1775"/>Now, in regard to his reminding me of the moral rule that persons who tell what they do not know to be true, falsify as much as those who knowingly tell falsehoods, I remember the rule, and it must be borne in mind that in what I have read to you, I do not say that I <hi rend="italics">know</hi> such a conspiracy to exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1776"/>To that I reply, <hi rend="italics">I believe it.</hi> If the <rs>Judge</rs> says that I do <hi rend="italics">not believe</hi> it, then <hi rend="italics">he</hi> says what <hi rend="italics">he</hi> does not know, and falls within his own rule, that he who asserts a thing which he does not know to be true, falsifies as much as he who knowingly tells a falsehood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1777"/>I want to call your attention to a little discussion on that branch of the case, and the evidence which brought my mind to the conclusion which I expressed as my <hi rend="italics">belief</hi>. If, in arraying that evidence, I had stated anything which was false or erroneous, it needed but that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0008.00079.00484" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> should point it out, and I would have taken it back with all the kindness in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1778"/>I do not deal in that way. If I have brought forward anything not a fact, if he will point it out, it will not even ruffle me to take it back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1779"/>But if he will not point out anything erroneous in the evidence, is it. not rather for him to show, by a comparison of the evidence, that I have <hi rend="italics">reasoned</hi> falsely, than to call the <quote>kind amiable, intelligent gentleman</quote> a liar?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1780"/>If I have reasoned to a false conclusion, it is the vocation of an able debater to show by argument that I have wandered to an erroneous conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1781"/>I want to ask your attention to a portion of the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill, which <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0008.00079.00485" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> has quoted ; <quote>It being the true intent and meaning of this act, not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1784"/>I believe I have the amendment here before me, which was offered, and under which the people of the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>, through their proper representatives, might, if they saw fit, prohibit the existence of slavery therein.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1786"/>And now, I say again, if this was not the reason, it will avail the <rs>Judge</rs> much more to calmly and good-humoredly point out to these people what that <hi rend="italics">other</hi> reason was for voting the amendment down, than, swelling himself up, to vociferate that he may be provoked to call somebody a liar. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>I stop the quotation there, again requesting that it may all be read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/>I have read all of the portion I desire to comment upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/>What is this charge that the <rs>Judge</rs> thinks I must have a very corrupt heart to make?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1826"/>It was a purpose on the part of certain high functionaries to make it impossible for the people of <num value="1">one</num> State to prohibit the people of any other State from entering it with their <quote>property,</quote> so called, and making it a slave State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1827"/>In other words, it was a charge implying a design to make the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> national.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1828"/>And now I ask your attention to what <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0008.00081.00498" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> has himself done here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1829"/>I know he made that part of the speech as a reason why he had refused to vote for a certain man for public printer, but when we get at it, the charge itself is the very <num value="1">one</num> I made against him, that he thinks I am so corrupt for uttering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1830"/>Now, whom does he make that charge against?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1831"/>Does he make it against that newspaper editor merely?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1832"/>No ; he says it is identical in spirit with the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>, and so the framers of that Constitution are brought in with the editor of the newspaper in that <quote>fatal blow being struck.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1833"/>He did not call it a <quote>conspiracy.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1834"/>In his language it is a <quote>fatal blow being struck.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1836"/>We see the charge made not merely against the editor of the <rs>Union</rs>, but all the framers of the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> ; and not only so, but the article was an authoritative article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1837"/>By whose authority?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1838"/>Is there any question but he means it was by the authority of the <rs>President</rs> and his Cabinet &mdash; the <name>Administration</name>? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/>Is there any sort, of question but he means to make that charge?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1840"/>Then there are the editors of the <hi rend="italics">Union</hi>, the framers of the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>, the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and his Cabinet, and all the supporters of the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>, in Congress and out of Congress, who are all involved in this <quote>fatal blow being struck.</quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1842"/>Now, my friends, I have but <num value="1">one</num> branch of the subject, in the little time I have left, to which to call your attention, and as I shall come to a close at the end of that branch, it is probable that I shall not occupy quite all the time allotted to me. Although on these questions I would like to talk twice as long as I have, I could not <pb id="p.82" n="82"/> enter upon another head and discuss it properly without running over my time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1843"/>I ask the attention of the people here assembled and elsewhere, to the course that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0008.00082.00500" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> is pursuing every day as bearing upon this question of making slavery national.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1844"/>Not going back to the records, but taking the speeches he makes, the speeches he made yesterday and day before, and makes constantly all over the country &mdash; I ask your attention to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/>In the first place, what is necessary to make the institution national?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>Not war. There is no danger that the people of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> will shoulder their muskets, and, with a young nigger stuck on every bayonet, march into <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> and force them upon us. There is no danger of our going over there and making war upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>Then what is necessary for the nationalization of slavery?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>It is simply the next <persName n="Scott,,Dred,,," id="n0024.0008.00082.00501" reg="default:Scott,Dred,,,"><foreName>Dred</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1849"/>It is merely for the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> to decide that no <hi rend="italics">State</hi> under the <rs>Constitution</rs> can exclude it, just as they have already decided that under the <rs>Constitution</rs> neither Congress nor the <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> can do it. When that is decided and acquiesced in, the whole thing is done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1850"/>This being true, and this being the way, as I think, that slavery is to be made national, let us consider what <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0008.00082.00502" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> is doing every day to that end. In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1851"/>place, let us see what influence he is exerting on public sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1852"/>In this and like communities, public sentiment is everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1853"/>With public sentiment, nothing can fail ; without it nothing can succeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1854"/>Consequently he who moulds public sentiment, goes deeper than he who enacts statutes or pronounces decisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/>He makes statutes and decisions possible or impossible to be executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>This must be borne in mind, as also the additional fact that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0008.00082.00503" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> is a man of vast influence, so great that it is enough for many men to profess to believe anything, when they once find out that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0008.00082.00504" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> professes to believe it. Consider also the attitude he occupies at the head of a large party &mdash; a party which he claims has a majority of all the voters in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/>This man sticks to a decision which forbids the people of a Territory from excluding slavery, and he does so not because he says it is right in itself-he does not give any opinion on that-but because it has been <hi rend="italics">decided by the court</hi>, and being decided by the court, he is, and you are bound to take it in your political action as law &mdash; not that he judges at all of its merits, but because a decision of the court is to him a <quote><hi rend="italics">Thus saith the <rs>Lord</rs></hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1858"/>He places it on that ground alone, and you will bear in mind that, thus committing himself unreservedly to this decision, <hi rend="italics">commits him to the next <num value="1">one</num></hi> just as firmly as to this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/>He did not commit himself on account of the merit or demerit of the decision, but it is a <hi rend="italics">Thus saith the <rs>Lord</rs></hi>. The next decision, as much as this, will be a <hi rend="italics">Thus saith the <rs>Lord</rs></hi>. There is nothing that can divert or turn him away from this decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>It is nothing that I point out to him that his great prototype, <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0024.0008.00082.00505" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,William,M.,,:3"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1861"/>did not believe in the binding force of decisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1862"/>It is nothing to him that <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0024.0008.00082.00506" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:3"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> did not so believe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1863"/>I have said that I have often heard him approve of <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s course in disregarding the decision of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> pronouncing a <orgName n="National Bank" type="bank">National Bank</orgName> constitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1864"/>He says, I did not hear him say so. He denies the accuracy of my recollection, I say he ought to know better than I, but I will make no question about this thing, though it still seems to me that I heard him say it <num value="20">twenty</num> times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1865"/>I will tell him though, that he now claims to stand on the <rs>Cincinnati</rs> platform, which affirms that Congress <hi rend="italics">cannot</hi> charter a <orgName n="National Bank" type="bank">National Bank</orgName>, in the teeth of that old standing decision that Congress <hi rend="italics">can</hi> charter a bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1866"/>And I remind him of another piece of history on the question of respect for judicial decisions, and it is a piece of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> history, belonging to a time when the large party to which <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0008.00082.00507" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> belonged, were displeased with a decision of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName></orgName>, because they had decided that a Governor could not remove a <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1867"/>You will find the whole story in <placeName reg="Ford, Dinwiddie, Virginia" key="tgn,2111800">Ford</placeName>'s History of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, and I know that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0008.00082.00508" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> will not deny that he was then in favor of overslaughing that decision by the mode of adding <num value="5">five</num> new Judges, so as to vote down the <num value="4">four</num> old ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/>Not only so, but it ended in <hi rend="italics">the <rs>Judge</rs> s sitting down on that very bench as <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="5">five</num> new Judges to break down the <num value="4">four</num> old ones</hi>. It was in this way precisely that he got his title of <rs type="role2">Judge</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>Now, when the <rs>Judge</rs> tells me that men appointed conditionally to sit as members of a court, will <pb id="p.83" n="83"/> have to be catechised beforehand upon some subject, I say, <quote>You know, <rs type="role2">Judge</rs> ; you have tried it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1870"/>When he says a court of this kind will lose the confidence of all men, will be prostituted and disgraced by such a proceeding, I say, <quote>You know best, <rs type="role2">Judge</rs> ; you have been through the mill.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>But I cannot shake <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0008.00083.00509" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s teeth loose from the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1872"/>Like some obstinate animal (I mean no disrespect), that will hang on when he has once got his teeth fixed ; you may cut off a leg, or you may tear away an arm, still he will not relax his hold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1890"/>The fact that it was the platform of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> is not denied, but <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0008.00083.00522" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> now says, that although his name was on the committee which reported it, that he does not think he was there, but thinks he <pb id="p.84" n="84"/> was in <placeName key="tgn,2101777" n="1.000 14" reg="tazewell, claiborne, tennessee">Tazewell</placeName>, holding court.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/>The point I am going to remind <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0008.00084.00524" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> of is this : that after I had made my speech in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, during the fair, he gave me notice that he was going to reply to me the next day. I was sick at the time, but I staid over in <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName> to hear his reply and to reply to him. On that day this very Convention, the resolutions adopted by which I have read, was to meet in the <rs type="place">Senate chamber</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>He spoke in the hall of the <rs type="place">House</rs> ; and when he got through his speech &mdash; my recollection is distinct, and I shall never forget it-<persName n="Codding,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0008.00084.00525" reg="mostcommon:Codding,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Codding</surname></persName> walked in as I took the stand to reply, and gave notice that the <rs>Republican</rs> <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State Convention</orgName> would meet instantly in the <rs type="place">Senate chamber</rs>, and called upon the <name>Republicans</name> to retire there and go into this very Convention, instead of remaining and listening to me. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/>In the first place, <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0008.00084.00526" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was selected by the very men who made the <rs>Republican</rs> organization, on that day, to reply to me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1895"/>Another evidence that he was acting in concert with them is to be found in the fact that that Convention waited an hour after its time of meeting to hear <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0024.0008.00084.00527" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s speech, and <persName n="Codding,,,,," id="n0024.0008.00084.00528" reg="mostcommon:Codding,nomatch:0"><surname>Codding</surname></persName> <num value="1">one</num> of their leading men, marched in the moment <rs>Lincoln</rs> got through, and gave notice that they did not want to hear me, and would proceed with the business of the <rs>Convention</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1896"/>Still another fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1897"/>I have here a newspaper printed at <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName> <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0008.00084.00529" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s own town, in <dateStruct value="1854-10-"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, a few days afterward, publishing these resolutions, charging <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0008.00084.00530" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> with entertaining these sentiments, and trying to prove that they were also the sentiments of <persName n="Yates,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0008.00084.00531" reg="mostcommon:Yates,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Yates</surname></persName>, then candidate for Congress.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1899"/>But, my friends, this denial of his that he did not act on the committee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1900"/>is a miserable quibble to avoid the main issue, which is, that this Republican platform declares in favor of the unconditional repeal of the <rs>Fugitive Slave</rs> law. Has <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0024.0008.00084.00533" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> answered whether he indorsed that or not?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1901"/>I called his attention to it when I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> addressed you, and asked him for an answer, and I then predicted that he would not answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1902"/>How does he answer?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1903"/>Why, that he was not on the committee that wrote the resolutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1904"/>I then repeated the next proposition contained in the resolutions, which was to restrict slavery in those States in which it exists, and asked him whether he indorsed it. Does he answer yes, or no?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1905"/>He says in reply, <quote>I was not on the committee at the time; I was up in <placeName key="tgn,2101777" n="1.000 14" reg="tazewell, claiborne, tennessee">Tazewell</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1906"/>The next question I put to him was, whether he was in favor of prohibiting the admission of any more slave States into the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1907"/>I put the question to him distinctly, whether, if the people of the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>, when they had sufficient population to make a State, should form their Constitution recognizing slavery, he would vote for or against its admission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1908"/>He is a candidate for the <orgName n="U. S. Senate" type="org">United States Senate</orgName>, and it is possible, if he should be elected, that he would have to vote directly on that question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1909"/>I asked him to answer me and you, whether he would vote to admit a State into the <rs>Union</rs>, with slavery or without it, as its own people might choose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1910"/>He did not answer that question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1911"/>He dodges that question also, under the cover that he was not on the <rs>Committee</rs> at the time, that he was not present when the platform was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1912"/>I want to know if he should happen to be in the <name>Senate</name> when a State applied for admission, with a Constitution acceptable to her own people, he would vote to admit that State, if slavery was <num value="1">one</num> of its institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1913"/>He avoids the answer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1914"/>It is true he gives the <name>Abolitionists</name> to understand by a hint that he would not vote to admit such a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1915"/>And why?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1916"/>He goes on to say that the man who would talk about giving each State the right to have slavery, or not, as it pleased, was akin to the man who would muzzle the guns which thundered forth the annual joyous return of the day of our independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1917"/>He says that that kind of talk is casting a blight on the glory of this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1918"/>What is the meaning of that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1919"/>That he is not in favor <pb id="p.85" n="85"/> of each State to have the right of doing as it pleases on the slavery question?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1920"/>I will put the question to him again and again, and I intend to force it out of him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1921"/>Then again, this platform which was made at <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName> by his own party, when he was its acknowledged head, provides that Republicans will insist on the abolition of slavery in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, and I asked <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0024.0008.00085.00534" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> specifically whether he agreed with them in that? [ <quote>Did you get an answer?</quote> ] He is afraid to answer it. He knows I will trot him down to <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1922"/>I intend to make him answer there, or I will show the people of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> that he does not intend to answer these questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1923"/>The Convention to which I have been alluding goes a little further, and pledges itself to exclude slavery from all the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> over which the <rs>General Government</rs> has exclusive jurisdiction north of <num value="36">36</num> deg. <num value="30">30</num> min., as well as South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1924"/>Now I want to know whether he approves that provision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1925"/>I want him to answer, and when he does, I want to know his opinion on another point, which is, whether he will redeem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1926"/>the pledge of this platform and resist the acquirement of any more territory unless slavery therein shall be forever prohibited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1927"/>I want him to answer this last question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1928"/>Each of the questions I have put to him are, practical questions-questions based upon the fundamental principles of the <rs>Black</rs> <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, and I want to know whether he is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, last, and only choice of a party with whom he does not agree in principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1929"/>He does not deny but that that principle was unanimously adopted by the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> ; he does not deny that the whole <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> is pledged to it ; he does not deny that a man who is not faithful to it is faithless to the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> ; and now I want to know whether that party is unanimously in favor of a man who does not adopt that creed and agree with them in their principles: I want to know whether the man who does not agree with them, and who is afraid to avow his differences, and who dodges the issue, is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, last, and only choice of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1936"/>I did not take exception to this figure of his. He has a right to be as playful as he pleases in throwing his arguments together, and I will not object; but I did take objection to his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName> speech, in which he stated that he intended his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> speech as a charge of corruption or conspiracy against the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName>, <persName n="Pierce,President,,,," id="n0024.0008.00085.00539" reg="mostcommon:Pierce,Franklin,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Pierce</surname></persName>, <persName n="Buchanan,President,,,," id="n0024.0008.00085.00540" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:8"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>, and myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1937"/>That gave the offensive character to the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1938"/>He then said that when he made it he did not know whether it was true or not, but inasmuch as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0008.00085.00541" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> had not denied it, although he had replied to the other parts of his speech <num value="3">three</num> times, he repeated it as a charge of conspiracy against me, thus charging me with moral turpitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1939"/>When he put it in that form, I did say, that inasmuch as he repeated the charge simply because I had not denied it, I would deprive him of the opportunity of ever repeating it again, by declaring that it was, <pb id="p.86" n="86"/> in all its bearings, an infamous lie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1948"/>I will tell him. In the first place, the bill already conferred all the, power which Congress had, by giving the people the whole power over the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1954"/>I will tell him. It was put there to meet just such false arguments as he has been adducing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1955"/>That <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, not only the people of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> should do as they pleased, but that when they come to be admitted as States, they should come into the <rs>Union</rs> with or without slavery, as the people determined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1956"/>I meant to knock in the head this Abolition doctrine of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0008.00086.00556" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s, that there shall be no more slave States, even if the people want them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1957"/>And it does not do for him to say, or for any other Black Republican to say, that there is nobody in favor of the doctrine of no more slave States, and that nobody wants to interfere with the right of the people to do as they please.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1958"/>What was the origin of the <rs>Missouri</rs> difficulty and the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1959"/>The people of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> formed a Constitution as a slave State, and asked admission into the <rs>Union</rs>, but the <name>Freesoil</name> party of the <rs>North</rs> being in a majority, refused to admit her because she had slavery as <num value="1">one</num> of her institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1960"/>Hence this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> slavery agitation arose upon a State and not upon a Territory, and yet <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0008.00086.00557" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> does not know why the word State was placed in the <rs>Kansas</rs>-<placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1961"/>The whole Abolition agitation arose on that doctrine of prohibiting a State from coming in with Slavery or not, as it pleased, and that same doctrine is here in this Republican platform of <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct> ; it, has never been repealed; and every Black Republican stands pledged by that platform, never <pb id="p.87" n="87"/> to vote for any man who is not in favor of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1964"/>Now you see that upon these very points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1968"/>Democracy is founded, upon the eternal principle of right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1969"/>The plainer these principles are avowed before the people, the stronger will be the support which they will receive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1970"/>I only wish I had the power to make them so clear that they would shine in the heavens for every man, woman, and child to read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1971"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of those principles that I would proclaim would be in opposition to <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0008.00087.00560" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s doctrine of uniformity between the different States, and I would declare instead the sovereign right of each State to decide the slavery question as well as all other domestic questions for themselves, without interference from any other State or power whatsoever. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1972"/>When that principle is recognized, you will have peace and harmony and fraternal feeling between all the <name>States</name> of this Union ; until you do recognize that doctrine there will be sectional warfare agitating and distracting the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1973"/>What does <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0008.00087.00561" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> propose?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1974"/>He says that the <rs>Union</rs> cannot exist divided into free and slave States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1982"/>Of course there was brought within the scope in that half-hour's speech something of his own opening speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/>In the course of that opening argument <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0009.00087.00564" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> proposed to me <num value="7">seven</num> distinct interrogatories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1985"/>I then distinctly intimated to him that I would answer the rest of his interrogatories on condition only that he should agree to answer as many for me. He made no intimation at the time of the proposition, nor did he in his reply allude at all to that suggestion of mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1986"/>I do him no injustice in saying that he occupied at least half of his reply in dealing with me as though I had <hi rend="italics">refused</hi> to answer his interrogatories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1987"/>I now propose that I will answer any of the interrogatories, upon condition that he will answer questions from me not exceeding the same number.

<p>A. I am not generally opposed to honest acquisition of territory; and, in any given case, I would or would not oppose such acquisition, accordingly as I might think such acquisition would or would not aggravate the slavery question among ourselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2009"/>Now, my friends, it will be perceived upon an examination of these questions and answers, that so far I have only answered that I was not <hi rend="italics">pledged</hi> to this, that or the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2010"/>The <rs>Judge</rs> has not framed his interrogatories to ask me anything more than this, and I have answered in strict accordance with the interrogatories, and have answered truly that I am not <hi rend="italics">pledged</hi> at all upon any of the points to which I have answered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2011"/>But I am not disposed to hang upon the exact form of his interrogatory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2012"/>I am rather disposed to take up at least some of these questions, and state what I really think upon them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2013"/>As to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num>, in regard to the <rs>Fugitive Slave</rs> law, I have never hesitated to say, and I do not now hesitate to say, that I think, under the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, the people of the <rs>Southern States</rs> are entitled to a Congressional Fugitive Slave law. Having said that, I have had nothing to say in regard to the existing Fugitive Slave law, further than that I think it should have been framed so as <pb id="p.89" n="89"/> to be free from some of the objections that pertain to it, without lessening its efficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2014"/>And inasmuch as we are not now in an agitation in regard to an alteration or modification of that law, I would not be the man to introduce it as a new subject of agitation upon the general question of slavery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2015"/>In regard to the other question, of whether I am pledged to the admission of any more slave States into the <rs>Union</rs>, I state to you very frankly that I would he exceedingly sorry ever to be put in a position of having to pass upon that question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2016"/>I should be exceedingly glad to know that there would never be another slave State admitted into the <rs>Union</rs>; but I must add, that if slavery shall be kept out of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> during the territorial existence of any <num value="1">one</num> given Territory, and then the people shall, having a fair chance and a clear field, when they come to adopt the <rs>Constitution</rs>, do such an extraordinary thing as to adopt a slave Constitution, uninfluenced by the actual presence of the institution among them, I see no alternative, if we own the country, but to admit them into the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2017"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> interrogatory is answered by the answer to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, it being, as I conceive, the same as the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2018"/>The <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> <num value="1">one</num> is in regard to the abolition of slavery in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2019"/>In relation to that, I have my mind very distinctly made up. I should be exceedingly glad to see slavery abolished in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2020"/>I believe that, Congress possesses the constitutional power to abolish it. Yet as a member of Congress, I should not with my present views, be in favor of <hi rend="italics">endeavoring</hi> to abolish slavery in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, unless it would be upon these conditions : <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num></hi>, that the abolition should be gradual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2021"/><hi rend="italics"><num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num></hi>, that it should be on a vote of the majority of qualified voters in the <rs>District</rs>; and <hi rend="italics"><num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></hi>, that compensation should be made to unwilling owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2022"/>With these <num value="3">three</num> conditions, I confess I would be exceedingly glad to see Congress abolish slavery in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, and, in the language of <persName n="Clay,,Henry,,," id="n0024.0009.00089.00566" reg="default:Clay,Henry,,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName>, <quote>sweep from our Capital that foul blot upon our nation.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2023"/></p> 
<p>In regard to the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> interrogatory, I must say here, that as to the question of the abolition of the slave-trade between the different States, I can truly answer, as I have, that I am <hi rend="italics">pledged</hi> to nothing about it. It is a subject to which I have not given that mature consideration that would make me feel authorized to state a position so as to hold myself entirely bound by it. In other words, that question has never been prominently enough before me to induce me to investigate whether we really have the constitutional power to do it. I could investigate it if I had sufficient time, to bring myself to a conclusion upon that subject ; but I have not done so, and I say so frankly to you here, and to <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0009.00089.00567" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2024"/>I must say, however, that if I should be of opinion that Congress does possess the constitutional power to abolish the slave-trade among the different States, I should still not be in favor of the exercise of that power unless upon some conservative principle as I conceive it, akin to what I have said in relation to the abolition of slavery in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2025"/>My answer as to whether I desire that slavery should be prohibited in all the <rs>Territories</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, is full and explicit within itself, and cannot be made clearer by any comments of mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2026"/>So I suppose in regard to the question whether I am opposed to the acquisition of any more territory unless slavery is <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> prohibited therein, my answer is such that I could add nothing by way of illustration, or making myself better understood, than the answer which I have placed in writing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2027"/>Now in all this, the <rs>Judge</rs> has me, and he has me on the record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2028"/>I suppose he had flattered himself that I was really entertaining <num value="1">one</num> set of opinions for <num value="1">one</num> place and another set for another place &mdash; that I was afraid to say at <num value="1">one</num> place what I uttered at another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2029"/>What I am saying here I suppose I say to a vast audience as strongly tending to Abolitionism as any audience in the <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">State of Illinois</placeName>, and I believe I am saying that which, if it would be offensive to any persons and render them enemies to myself, would be offensive to persons in this audience. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2030"/>I now proceed to propound to the <rs>Judge</rs> the interrogatories, so far as I have framed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2042"/>As introductory to these interrogatories which <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0009.00090.00568" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> propounded to me at <placeName reg="Ottawa, La Salle, Illinois" key="tgn,2029529">Ottawa</placeName>, he read a set of resolutions which he said <persName n="Trumbull,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0009.00090.00569" reg="mostcommon:Trumbull,Lyman,,,:7"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Trumbull</surname></persName> and myself had participated in adopting in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Republican <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State Convention</orgName>, held at <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1854-10-"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2043"/>He insisted that I and <persName n="Trumbull,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0009.00090.00570" reg="mostcommon:Trumbull,Lyman,,,:7"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Trumbull</surname></persName>, and perhaps the entire <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, were responsible for the doctrines contained in the set of resolutions which he read, and I understand that it was from that set of resolutions that he deduced the interrogatories which he propounded to me, using these resolutions as a sort of authority for propounding those questions to me. Now I say here to-day that I do not answer his interrogatories because of their springing at all from that set of resolutions which he read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2044"/>I answered them because <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0009.00090.00571" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> thought fit to ask them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2045"/>I do not now, nor never did, recognize any responsibility upon myself in that set of resolutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2046"/>When I replied to him on that occasion, I assured him that I never had anything to do with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2047"/>I repeat here to-day, that I never in any possible form had anything to do with that set of resolutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2048"/>It turns out, I believe, that those resolutions were never passed in any Convention held in <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2049"/>It turns out that they were never passed at any Convention or any public meeting that I had any part in. I believe it turns out in addition to all this, that there was not, in the fall of <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, any Convention holding a session in <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName>, calling itself a Republican <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State Convention</orgName> ; yet it is true there was a Convention, or assemblage of men calling themselves a Convention, at <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName>, that did pass <hi rend="italics">some</hi> resolutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2050"/>But so little did I really know of the proceedings of that Convention, or what set of resolutions they had passed, though having a general knowledge that there had been such an assemblage of men there, that when <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0009.00090.00572" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> read the resolutions, I really did not know but they had been the resolutions passed then and there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2051"/>I did not question that they were the resolutions adopted, For I could not bring myself to suppose that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0009.00090.00573" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> could say what he did upon this subject without <hi rend="italics">knowing</hi> that it was true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2052"/>I contented myself; on that occasion, with denying, as I truly could, all connection with them, not denying or affirming whether they were passed at <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2053"/>Now it turns out that he had got hold of some resolutions passed at some Convention or public meeting in <placeName reg="Kane, Illinois, United States" key="tgn,1002531">Kane county</placeName> I wish to say here, that I don't conceive that in any fair and just mind this discovery relieves me at all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2054"/>I am just as much responsible for the resolutions at <placeName key="tgn,1002531" n="1.000 4" reg="kane, illinois, united states">Kane county</placeName> as those at <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName>, the amount of the responsibility being exactly nothing in either case ; no more than there would be in regard to a set of resolutions passed in the moon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2055"/>I allude to this extraordinary matter in this canvass for some further purpose than anything yet advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2056"/><persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0009.00090.00574" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> did not make his statement upon that occasion as matters that he believed to be true, but he stated them roundly as being true, in such form as to pledge his veracity for their truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2057"/>When the whole matter turns out as it does, and when we consider who <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0009.00090.00575" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> is &mdash; that he is a distinguished <rs type="role2">Senator</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>--that he has served nearly <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> as such &mdash; that his character is not at all limited as an ordinary <rs type="role2">Senator</rs> of the <rs>United</rs> <pb id="p.91" n="91"/> States, but that his name has become of world-wide renown &mdash; it is <hi rend="italics">most extraordinary</hi> that he should so far forget all the suggestions of justice to an adversary, or of prudence to himself, as to venture upon the assertion of that which the slightest investigation would have shown him to be wholly false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2058"/>I can only account for his having done so upon the supposition that that evil genius which has attended him through his life, giving to him an apparent astonishing prosperity, such as to lead very many good men to doubt there being any advantage in virtue over vice &mdash; I say I can only account for it on the supposition that that evil genius has at last made up its mind to forsake him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2059"/>And I may add that another extraordinary feature of the <rs>Judge</rs>'s conduct in this canvass, made more extraordinary by this incident &mdash; is, that he is in the habit, in almost all the speeches he makes, of charging falsehood upon his adversaries, myself and others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2060"/>I now ask whether he is able to find in any thing that <persName n="Trumbull,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0009.00091.00576" reg="mostcommon:Trumbull,Lyman,,,:7"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Trumbull</surname></persName>, for instance, has said, or in any thing that I have said, a justification at all compared with what we have, in this instance, for that sort of vulgarity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2061"/>I have been in the habit of charging as a matter of belief on my part, that, in the introduction of the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill into Congress, there was a conspiracy to make slavery perpetual and national.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2062"/>I have arranged from time to time the evidence which establishes and proves the truth of this charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2063"/>I recurred to this charge at <placeName reg="Ottawa, La Salle, Illinois" key="tgn,2029529">Ottawa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2064"/>I shall not now have time to dwell upon it at very great length ; but, inasmuch as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0009.00091.00577" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> in his reply of half an hour, made some points upon me in relation to it, I propose noticing a few of them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2065"/>The <rs>Judge</rs> insists that, in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> speech I made, in which I very distinctly made that charge, he thought for a good while I was in fun!-that I was playful-that I was not sincere about it-and that he only grew angry and somewhat excited when he found that I insisted upon it as a matter of earnestness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2066"/>He says he characterized it as a falsehood as far as I implicated his <hi rend="italics">moral character</hi> in that transaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2067"/>Well, I did not know, till he presented that view, that I had implicated his moral character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2068"/>He is very much in the habit, when he argues me up into a position I never thought of occupying, of very cosily saying he has no doubt <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0024.0009.00091.00578" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is <quote>conscientious</quote> in saying so. He should remember that I did not know but what <hi rend="italics">he</hi> was altogether <quote>conscientious</quote> in that matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2069"/>I can conceive it possible for men to conspire to do a good thing, and I really find nothing in <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0009.00091.00579" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s course or arguments that is contrary to or inconsistent with his belief of a conspiracy to nationalize and spread slavery as being a good and blessed thing, and so I hope he will understand that I do not at all question but that in all this matter he is entirely <quote>conscientious.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2070"/></p> 
<p>But to draw your attention to <num value="1">one</num> of the points I made in this case, beginning at the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2071"/>When the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill was introduced, or a short time afterward, by an amendment, I believe, it was provided that it must be considered <quote>the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any State or Territory, or to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their own domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2072"/>I have called his attention to the fact that when he and some others began arguing that they were giving an increased degree of liberty to the people in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> over and above what they formerly had on the question of slavery, a question was raised whether the law was enacted to give such unconditional liberty to the people, and to test the sincerity of this mode of argument, <persName n="Chase,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0009.00091.00580" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Giddings,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, introduced an amendment, in which he made the law &mdash; if the amendment were adopted-expressly declare that the people of the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> should have the power to exclude slavery if they saw fit. I have asked attention also to the fact that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0009.00091.00581" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> and those who acted with him, voted that amendment down, notwithstanding it expressed exactly the thing they said was the true intent and meaning of the law. I have called attention to the fact that in subsequent times, a decision of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> has been made, in which it has been declared that a <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> has no constitutional right to exclude slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2073"/><pb id="p.92" n="92"/> </p> 
<p>And I have argued and said that for men who did intend that the people of the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> should have the right to exclude slavery absolutely and unconditionally, the voting down of <persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n0024.0009.00092.00582" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Giddings,,,"><surname>Chase</surname></persName>'s amendment is wholly inexplicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2074"/>It is a puzzle &mdash; a riddle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2075"/>But I have said that with men who did look forward to such a decision, or who had it in contemplation, that such a decision of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> would or might be made, the voting down of that amendment would be perfectly rational and intelligible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2076"/>It would keep Congress from coming in collision with the decision when it was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2077"/>Any body can conceive that if there was an intention or expectation that such a decision was to follow, it would not be a very desirable party attitude to get into for the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>--all or nearly all its members belonging to the same party &mdash; to decide <num value="1">one</num> way, when the party in Congress had decided the other way. Hence it would be very rational for men expecting such a decision, to keep the niche in that law clear for it. After pointing this out, I tell <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0009.00092.00583" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> that it looks to me as though here was the reason why <persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n0024.0009.00092.00584" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Giddings,,,"><surname>Chase</surname></persName>'s amendment was voted down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2078"/>I tell him that as he did it, and knows why he did it, if it was done for a reason different from this, <hi rend="italics">he knows what that reason</hi> was, <hi rend="italics">and can tell us what it was</hi>. I tell him, also, it will be vastly more satisfactory to the country for him to give some other plausible, intelligible reason <hi rend="italics">why</hi> it was voted down than to stand upon his dignity and call people liars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2079"/>Well, on Saturday he did make his answer, and what do you think it was?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2080"/>He says if I had only taken upon myself to tell the whole truth about that amendment of <persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n0024.0009.00092.00585" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Giddings,,,"><surname>Chase</surname></persName>'s, no explanation would have, been necessary on his part &mdash; or words to that effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2081"/>Now, I say here, that I am quite unconscious of having suppressed any thing material to the case, and I am very frank to admit if there is any sound reason other than that which appeared to me material, it is quite fair for him to present it. What reason does he propose?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2082"/>That when <persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n0024.0009.00092.00586" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Giddings,,,"><surname>Chase</surname></persName> came forward with his amendment expressly authorizing the people to exclude slavery from the limits of every Territory, <persName n="Cass,General,,,," id="n0024.0009.00092.00587" reg="mostcommon:Cass,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Cass</surname></persName> proposed to <persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n0024.0009.00092.00588" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Giddings,,,"><surname>Chase</surname></persName>, if he (<persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n0024.0009.00092.00589" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Giddings,,,"><surname>Chase</surname></persName>) would add to his amendment that the people should have the power to <hi rend="italics">introduce</hi> or exclude, they would let it go. This is substantially all of his reply. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2083"/>And because <persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n0024.0009.00092.00590" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Giddings,,,"><surname>Chase</surname></persName> would not do that, they voted his amendment clown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2084"/>Well, it turns out, I believe, upon examination, that <persName n="Cass,General,,,," id="n0024.0009.00092.00591" reg="mostcommon:Cass,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Cass</surname></persName> took some part in the little running debate upon that amendment and then ran away <hi rend="italics">and did not vote on it at all</hi>. Is not that the fact?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2085"/>So confident, as I think, was <persName n="Cass,General,,,," id="n0024.0009.00092.00592" reg="mostcommon:Cass,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Cass</surname></persName> that there was a snake somewhere about, he chose to run away from the whole thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2086"/>This is an inference I draw from the fact that, though he took part in the debate, his name does not appear in the ayes and noes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2087"/>But does <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0009.00092.00593" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> reply amount to a satisfactory answer?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2088"/>[Cries of <quote>yes,</quote> <quote>yes,</quote> and <quote>no,</quote> <quote>no.</quote> ] There is some little difference of opinion here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2089"/>But I ask attention to a few more views bearing on the question of whether it amounts to a satisfactory answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2090"/>The men who were determined that that amendment should not get into the bill and spoil the place where the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision was to come in, sought an excuse to get rid of it somewhere. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2091"/><num value="1">One</num> of these ways-<num value="1">one</num> of these excuses &mdash; was to ask <persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n0024.0009.00092.00594" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Giddings,,,"><surname>Chase</surname></persName> to add to his proposed amendment a provision that the people might <hi rend="italics">introduce</hi> slavery if they wanted to. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2092"/>They very well knew <persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n0024.0009.00092.00595" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Giddings,,,"><surname>Chase</surname></persName> would do no such thing &mdash; that <persName n="Chase,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0009.00092.00596" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Giddings,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName> was <num value="1">one</num> of the men differing from them on the broad principle of his insisting that freedom was <hi rend="italics">better</hi> than slavery &mdash; a man who would not consent to enact a law, penned with his own hand, by which he was made to recognized slavery on the <num value="1">one</num> hand and liberty on the other as <hi rend="italics">precisely</hi> equal; and when they insisted on his doing this, they very well knew they insisted on that which he would not for a moment think of doing, and that they were only bluffing him. I believe (I have not, since he made his answer, had a chance to examine the journals or <hi rend="italics">Congressional Globe</hi>, and therefore speak from memory)--I believe the state of the bill at that time, according to parliamentary rules, was such that no member could propose an additional amendment to <persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n0024.0009.00092.00597" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Giddings,,,"><surname>Chase</surname></persName>'s amendment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2093"/>I rather think this is the truth &mdash; the <rs>Judge</rs> shakes his head. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2094"/>Very well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2095"/>I would like to know, then, <hi rend="italics">if they wanted <persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n0024.0009.00092.00598" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Giddings,,,"><surname>Chase</surname></persName>'s amendment fixed over, why somebody else could not have offered to do it</hi>? If they wanted it amended, <pb id="p.93" n="93"/> why did they not offer the amendment?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2096"/>Why did they stand there taunting and quibbling at <persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n0024.0009.00093.00599" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Giddings,,,"><surname>Chase</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2097"/>Why did they not <hi rend="italics">put it in themselves</hi>? But to put it on the other ground; suppose that there was such an amendment offered, and <persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n0024.0009.00093.00600" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Giddings,,,"><surname>Chase</surname></persName>'s was an amendment to an amendment ; until <num value="1">one</num> is disposed of by parliamentary law, you cannot pile another on. Then all these gentlemen had to do was to vote <persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n0024.0009.00093.00601" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Giddings,,,"><surname>Chase</surname></persName>'s on, and then in the amended form in which the whole stood, add their own amendment to it if they wanted to put it in then shape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2098"/>This was all they were obliged to do, and the ayes and noes show that there were <num value="36">thirty-six</num> who voted it down, against <num value="10">ten</num> who voted in favor of it. The <num value="36">thirty-six</num> held entire sway and control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2099"/>They could in some form or other have put that bill in the exact shape they wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2100"/>If there was a rule preventing their amending it at the time, they could pass that, and then <persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n0024.0009.00093.00602" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Giddings,,,"><surname>Chase</surname></persName>'s amendment being merged, put it in the shape they wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2101"/>They did not choose to do so, but they went into a quibble with <persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n0024.0009.00093.00603" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Giddings,,,"><surname>Chase</surname></persName> to get him to add what they knew he would not add, and because he would not, they stand upon that flimsy pretext for voting down what they argued was the meaning and intent of their own bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2102"/>They left room thereby for this <persName n="Scott,,Dred,,," id="n0024.0009.00093.00604" reg="default:Scott,Dred,,,"><foreName>Dred</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> decision, which goes very far to make slavery national throughout the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2103"/>I pass <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> points I have because my time will very soon expire, but I must be allowed to say that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0009.00093.00605" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,S.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> recurs again, as he did upon <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> other occasions, to the enormity of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0024.0009.00093.00606" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> &mdash; an insignificant individual like Lincoln-upon his <foreign lang="la">ipse dixit</foreign> charging a conspiracy upon a large number of members of Congress, the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> and <num value="2">two</num> <rs type="role2">Presidents</rs>, to nationalize slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2127"/>In reference to <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, it is my opinion, that as she has population enough to constitute a slave Slate, she has people enough for a. free State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2129"/>I hold it to be a sound rule of universal application to require a Territory to contain the requisite population for a member of Congress before it is admitted as a State into the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2130"/>I made that proposition in the <name>Senate</name> in <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>, and I renewed it during the last session, in a bill providing that no Territory of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> should form a Constitution and apply for admission until it had the requisite population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2131"/>On another occasion I proposed that neither <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, or any other Territory, should be admitted until it had the requisite population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2132"/>Congress did not adopt any of my propositions containing this general rule, but did make an exception of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2133"/>I will stand by that exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2134"/>Either <placeName key="tgn,7007254" n="1.000 187" reg="kansas">Kansas</placeName> must come in as a free State, with whatever population she may have, or the rule must be applied to all the other <rs>Territories</rs> alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2135"/>I therefore answer at once, that it having been decided that <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> has people enough for a slave State, I hold that she has enough for a free State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2144"/>I answer emphatically, as <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0009.00095.00624" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has heard me answer a <num value="100">hundred</num> times from every stump in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, that in my opinion the people of a Territory can, by lawful means, exclude slavery from their limits prior to the formation of a State Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2145"/><persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0009.00095.00625" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> knew that I had answered that question over and over again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2147"/>It matters not what way the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> may hereafter decide as to the abstract question whether slavery may or may not go into a Territory under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, the people have the lawful means to introduce it or exclude it as they please, for the reason that slavery cannot exist a day or an hour anywhere, unless it is supported by local police regulations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2148"/>Those police regulations can only be established by the local legislature, and if the people are opposed to slavery they will elect representatives to that body who will by unfriendly legislation effectually prevent the introduction of it into their midst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2149"/>If, on the contrary, they are for it, their legislation will favor its extension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2150"/>Hence, no matter what the decision of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> may be on that abstract question, still the right of the people to make a slave Territory or a free Territory is perfect and complete under the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill.

The language of that bill which I have quoted, gave the full power and the full authority over the subject of slavery, affirmatively and negatively, to introduce it or exclude it, so far as the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> would permit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2159"/>What more could <persName n="Chase,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0009.00095.00629" reg="nearbymention:Chase,Giddings,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName> give by his amendment?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2191"/>This question is very ingeniously and cunningly put. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2192"/>The Black Republican creed lays it down expressly, that under no circumstances shall we acquire any more territory unless slavery is <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> prohibited in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2193"/>I ask <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0009.00096.00650" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> whether he is in favor of that proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2195"/>That he does not like to answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2196"/>When I ask him whether he stands up to that article in the platform of his party, he turns, Yankee-fashion, and without answering it, asks me whether I am in favor of acquiring territory without regard to how it may affect the <rs>Union</rs> on the slavery question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2197"/>I answer that whenever it becomes necessary, in our growth and progress, to acquire more territory, that I am in favor of it, without reference to the question of slavery, and when we have acquired it, I will leave the people free to do as they please, either to make it slave or free territory, as they prefer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2198"/>It is idle to tell me or you that we have territory enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2199"/>Our fathers supposed that we had enough when our territory extended to the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName>, but a few years' growth and expansion satisfied them that we needed more, and the <placeName reg="Louisiana, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana territory</placeName>, from the <rs>West</rs> branch of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> to the <rs>British</rs> possessions, was acquired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2204"/>Will you not continue to increase at the end of <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure> as well as now?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2205"/>I tell you, increase, and multiply, and expand, is the law of this nation's existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2206"/>You cannot limit this great Republic by mere boundary lines, saying, <quote>thus far shalt thou go, and no further.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2208"/>What would be the result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2209"/>Either the hoop must burst and be rent asunder, or the child must die. So it would be with this great nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2210"/>With our natural increase, growing with a rapidity unknown in any other part of the globe, with the tide of emigration that is fleeing from despotism in the old world to seek refuge in our own, there is a constant torrent pouring into this country that requires more land, more territory upon which to settle, and just as fast as our interests and our destiny require additional territory in the <rs>North</rs>, in the <rs>South</rs>, or on the <rs>Islands</rs> of the ocean, I am for it, and when we acquire it, will leave the people, according to the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill, free to do as they please on the subject of slavery and every other question. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2414"/>The people in the north end of the <rs>State</rs> were for stronger measures of opposition than we of the central and Southern portions of the <rs>State</rs>, but we were all opposed to the <rs>Nebraska</rs> doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2418"/>So that these meetings which the <rs>Judge</rs> has alluded to, and the resolutions he has read from, were local, and did not spread over the whole State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2419"/>We at last met together in <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>, from all parts of the <rs>State</rs>, and we agreed upon a common platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2507"/>Prior to <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct> this country was divided into <num value="2">two</num> great political parties known as Whig and Democratic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2508"/>These parties differed from each other on certain questions which were then deemed to be important to the best interests of the <rs>Republic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2509"/>Whig and Democrats differed about a bank, the tariff, distribution, the specie circular and the sub-treasury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2510"/>On those issues we went before the country and discussed the principles, objects and measures of the <num value="2">two</num> great parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2511"/>Each of the parties could proclaim its principles in <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> as well as in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> as well as in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2512"/>Since that period, a great revolution has taken place in the formation of parties, by which they now seem to be divided by a geographical line, a large party in the <rs>North</rs> being arrayed under the <name>Abolition</name> or <orgName n="Republican Banner" type="newspaper">Republican banner</orgName>, in hostility to the <rs>Southern States</rs>, Southern people, and Southern institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2513"/>It becomes important for us to inquire how this transformation of parties has occurred, made from those of national principles to geographical factions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2514"/>You remember that in <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>--this country was agitated from its center to its circumference about this slavery question &mdash; it became necessary for the leaders of the great <orgName n="Whig Party" type="party">Whig party</orgName> and the leaders of the great <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> to postpone, for the time being, their particular disputes, and unite <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to save the <rs>Union</rs> before they should quarrel as to the mode in which it was to be governed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2516"/>That great contest of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> resulted in the establishment of the <rs>Compromise Measures</rs> of that year, which measures rested on the great principle that the people of each State and each Territory of this Union ought to be permitted to regulate their own domestic institutions in their own way, subject to no other limitation than that which the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> imposes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2517"/>I now wish to ask you whether that principle was right or wrong which guarantied to every State and every community the right to form and regulate their domestic institutions to suit themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2518"/>These measures were adopted, as I have previously said, by the joint action of the <rs>Union Whigs</rs> and Union Democrats in opposition to Northern Abolitionists and Southern Disunionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2520"/><dateStruct value="-1-"><month reg="1">One month</month></dateStruct> thereafter the <name>Democrats</name> assembled at the same place to nominate a candidate for the <name>Presidency</name>, and declared the same great principle as the rule of action by which the <name>Democracy</name> would be governed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2521"/>The Presidential election of <dateStruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></dateStruct> was fought on that basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2522"/>It <hi rend="italics">is</hi> true that the <rs>Whigs</rs> claimed special merit for the adoption of those measures, because they asserted that their great <persName n="Clay,,,,," id="n0024.0010.00110.00860" reg="nearbymention:Clay,Henry,,,"><surname>Clay</surname></persName> originated them, their <name n="God" type="God">god</name>-like <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0024.0010.00110.00861" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><surname>Webster</surname></persName> defended them and their <persName n="Fillmore,,,,," id="n0024.0010.00110.00862" reg="mostcommon:Fillmore,Millard,,,:1"><surname>Fillmore</surname></persName> signed the bill making them the law of the land; but on the other hand, the <name>Democrats</name> claimed special credit for the <name>Democracy</name>, upon the <pb id="p.111" n="111"/> ground that we gave twice as many votes in both Houses of Congress for the passage of these measures as the <orgName n="Whig Party" type="party">Whig party</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2523"/>Thus you set that in the <name>Presidential</name> election of <dateStruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></dateStruct>, the <rs>Whigs</rs> were pledged by their platform and their candidate to the principle of the <rs>Compromise Measures</rs> of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, and the <name>Democracy</name> were likewise pledged by our principles, our platform, and our candidate to the same line of policy, to preserve peace and quiet between the different sections of this Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2524"/>Since that period the <orgName n="Whig Party" type="party">Whig party</orgName> has been transformed into a sectional party, under the name of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, whilst the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> continues the same national party it was at that day. All sectional men, all men of Abolition sentiments and principles, no matter whether they were old Abolitionists or had been Whigs or Democrats, rally under the sectional <orgName n="Republican Banner" type="newspaper">Republican banner</orgName>, and consequently all national men, all Union-loving men, whether Whigs, Democrats, or by whatever name they have been known, ought to rally under the stars and stripes in defense of the <rs>Constitution</rs> as our fathers made it, and of the <rs>Union</rs> as it has existed under the <rs>Constitution</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2528"/>In the <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">State of New York</placeName> a Convention was held by some of these men and a platform adopted, every plank of which was as black as night, each <num value="1">one</num> relating to the negro, and not <num value="1">one</num> referring to the interests of the white man. That example was followed throughout the <rs>Northern States</rs>, the effect being made to combine all the free Slates in hostile array against the slave States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2529"/>The men who thus thought that they could build up a great sectional party, and through its organization control the political destinies of this country, based all their hopes on the single fact that the <rs>North</rs> was the stronger division of the nation, and hence, if the <rs>North</rs> could be combined against the <rs>South</rs>, a sure victory awaited their efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2637"/>They desired to express by that phrase white men, men of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> birth and <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> descent, and had no reference either to the negro: the savage <rs>Indians</rs>, the <name>Fejee</name>, the <name>Malay</name>, or any other inferior and degraded race, when they spoke of the equality of men. <num value="1">One</num> great evidence that such was their understanding, is to be found in the fact that at that time every <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="13">thirteen</num> colonies was a slaveholding colony, every signer of the <name>Declaration</name> represented, a slaveholding constituency, and we know that no <num value="1">one</num> of them emancipated his slaves, much less offered citizenship to <pb id="p.117" n="117"/> them when they signed the <name>Declaration</name> ; and yet, if they intended to declare that the negro was the equal of the white man, and entitled by divine right to an equality with him, they were bound, as honest men, that day and hour to have put their negroes on an equality with themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2638"/>Instead of doing so, with uplifted eyes to heaven they implored the divine blessing upon them, during the <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> bloody war they had to fight to maintain that Declaration, never dreaming that they were violating divine law by still holding the negroes in bondage and depriving them of equality. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2639"/>My friends, I am in favor of preserving this Government as our fathers made it. It does not follow by any means that because a negro is not your equal or mine, that hence he must necessarily be a slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2640"/>On the contrary, it does follow that we ought to extend to the negro every right, every privilege, every immunity which he is capable of enjoying, consistent with the good of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2641"/>When you ask me what these rights are, what their nature and extent is, I tell you that that is a question which each State of this Union must decide for itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2642"/><placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> has already decided the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2643"/>We have decided that the negro must not be a slave within our limits, but we have also decided that the negro shall not be a citizen within our limits ; that he shall not vote, hold office, or exercise any political rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2644"/>I maintain that <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, as a sovereign State, has a right thus to fix her policy with reference to the relation between the white man and the negro ; but while we had that right to decide the question for ourselves, we must recognize the same right in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and in every other State to make the same decision, or a different <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2648"/>She had as much right to adopt that as her policy as we had to adopt the contrary for our policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2649"/>New York has decided that in that State a negro may vote if he has <measure n="250dollars" type="currency">$250</measure> worth of property, and if he owns that much he may vote upon an equality with the white man.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2655"/>I now come back to the question, why cannot this Union exist forever divided into free and slave States, as our fathers made it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2656"/>It can thus exist if each State will carry out the principles upon which our institutions were founded, to wit: the right of each State to do as it pleases, without meddling with its neighbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2657"/>Just act upon that great principle, and this Union will not only live forever, but it will extend and expand until it covers the whole continent, and makes this confederacy <num value="1">one</num> grand, ocean-bound Republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2658"/>We must bear in mind that we are yet a young nation, <pb id="p.118" n="118"/> growing with a rapidity unequaled in the history of the world, that our national increase is great, and that the emigration from the old world is increasing, requiring us to expand and acquire new territory from time to time, in order to give our people land to live upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2659"/>If we live upon the principle of State rights and State sovereignty, each State regulating its own affairs and minding its own business, we can go on and extend indefinitely, just as fast and as far as we need the territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2660"/>The time may come, indeed has now come, when our interests would be advanced by the acquisition of the <rs type="place">Island of Cuba</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2662"/>So, when it becomes necessary to acquire any portion of <placeName reg="Mexico" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> or <placeName reg="Canada" key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, or of this continent or the adjoining islands, we must take them as we find them, leaving the people free to do as they please &mdash; to have slavery or not, as they choose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2663"/>I never have inquired and never will inquire whether a new State, applying for admission, has slavery or not for <num value="1">one</num> of her institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2664"/>If the <rs>Constitution</rs> that is presented be the act and deed of the people, and embodies their will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2665"/>and they have the requisite population, I will admit them with slavery or without it, just as that people shall determine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2666"/>My objection to the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> did not consist in the fact that it made <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> a slave State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2667"/>I would have been as much opposed to its admission under such a Constitution as a free State as I was opposed to its admission under it as a slave State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2668"/>I hold that that was a question which that people had a right to decide for themselves, and that no power on earth ought to have interfered with that decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2669"/>In my opinion, the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> was not the act and deed of the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, and did not embody their will, and the recent election in that Territory, at which it was voted down by nearly <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, shows conclusively that I was right in saying, when the <rs>Constitution</rs> was presented, that it was not the act and deed of the people, and did not embody their will. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2670"/>If we wish to preserve our institutions in their purity, and transmit them unimpaired to our latest posterity, we must preserve with religious good faith that great principle of self-government which guaranties to each and every State, old and new, the right to make just such Constitutions as they desire, and come into the <rs>Union</rs> with their own Constitution, and not <num value="1">one</num> palmed upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2671"/>Whenever you sanction the doctrine that Congress may crowd a Constitution down the throats of an unwilling people, against their consent, you will subvert the great fundamental principle upon which all our free institutions rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2688"/>I say when this Government was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> established, it was the policy of its founders to prohibit, the spread of slavery into the new <rs>Territories</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, where it had not existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2717"/>I recollect that I, as a member of that party, acquiesced in that compromise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2718"/>I recollect in the <name>Presidential</name> election which followed, when we had <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n0024.0010.00120.00994" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Dred,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> up for the <name>Presidency</name>, <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0010.00120.00995" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> was around berating us Whigs as Abolitionists, precisely as he does to-day &mdash; not a bit of difference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2719"/>I have often heard him. We could do nothing when the old <orgName n="Whig Party" type="party">Whig party</orgName> was alive that was not Abolitionism, but it has got an extremely good name since it has passed away. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2720"/>When that Compromise was made it did not repeal the old <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2721"/><pb id="p.121" n="121"/> It left a region of <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> territory half as large as the present territory of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, north of the line of <num value="36">36</num> degrees <measure n="30minutes" type="date">30 minutes</measure>, in which slavery was prohibited by act of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2722"/>This compromise did not repeal that <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2723"/>It did not affect or propose to repeal it. But at last it became <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0010.00121.00996" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s duty, as he thought (and I find no fault with him), as <rs type="role" reg="Chairman">Chairman</rs> of the <rs>Committee</rs> on Territories, to bring in a bill for the organization of a Territorial Government-<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of <num value="1">one</num>, then of two Territories north of that line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2724"/>When he did so it ended in his inserting a provision substantially repealing the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2725"/>That was because the <name>Compromise</name> of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> <hi rend="italics">had not</hi> repealed it. And now I ask why he could not have let that compromise alone?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2726"/>We were quiet from the agitation of the slavery question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2727"/>We were making no fuss about it. All had acquiesced in the <name>Compromise</name> measures of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2728"/>We never had been seriously disturbed by any abolition agitation before that period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2729"/>When he came to form governments for the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> north of the line of <num value="36">36</num> degrees <measure n="30minutes" type="date">30 minutes</measure>, why could he not have let that matter stand as it was standing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2730"/>Was it necessary to the organization of a Territory?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2731"/>Not at all. <placeName reg="Iowa, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007253">Iowa</placeName> lay north of the line and had been organized as a Territory and come into the <rs>Union</rs> as a State without disturbing that Compromise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2732"/>There was no sort of necessity for destroying it to organize these Territories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2733"/>But, gentlemen, it would take up all my time to meet all the little quibbling arguments of <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0010.00121.00997" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> to show that the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs> was repealed by the <name>Compromise</name> of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2734"/>My own opinion is, that a careful investigation of all the arguments to sustain the position that that Compromise was virtually repealed by the <name>Compromise</name> of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, would show that they are the merest fallacies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2735"/>I have the <name>Report</name> that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0010.00121.00998" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> brought into Congress at the time of the introduction of the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill, which in its original form did not repeal the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>, and he there expressly stated that he had forborne to do so <hi rend="italics">because it had not been done by the <name>Compromise</name> of</hi> <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2736"/>I close this part of the discussion on my part by asking him the question again, <quote>Why, when we had peace under the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>, could you not have let it alone?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2737"/></p> 
<p>In complaining of what I said in my speech at <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName>, in which he says I accepted my nomination for the <name>Senatorship</name> (where, by the way, he is at fault, for if he will examine it, he will find no acceptance in it), he again quotes that portion in which I said that <quote>a house divided against itself cannot stand.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2738"/>Let me say a word in regard to that matter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2739"/>He tries to persuade us that there must be a variety in the different institution of the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Union</rs> ; that that variety necessarily proceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face of the country, and the difference in the natural features of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2740"/>I agree to all that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2741"/>Have these very matters ever produced any difficulty amongst us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2742"/>Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact that they have laws in <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> designed to regulate the commerce that springs from the production of sugar?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2743"/>Or because we have a different class relative to the production of flour in this State?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2744"/>Have they produced any differences?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2745"/>Not at all. They are the very cements of this Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2746"/>They don't make the house a house divided against itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2747"/>They are the props that hold up the house and sustain the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2748"/>But has it been so with this element of slavery?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2749"/>Have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2750"/>And when will we cease to have quarrels over it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2751"/>Like causes produce like effects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2752"/>It is worth while to observe that we have generally had comparative peace upon the slavery question and that there has been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the effort to spread it into new territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2753"/>Whenever it has been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2754"/>All the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from efforts to spread it over more territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2755"/>It was thus at the date of the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2756"/>It was so again with the annexation of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> ; so with the territory acquired by the <rs>Mexican</rs> war, and it is so now. Whenever there has been an effort to spread it there has been agitation and resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2757"/>Now, I appeal to this audience <pb id="p.122" n="122"/> (very few of whom are my political friends), as national men, whether we have reason to expect that the agitation in regard to this subject will cease while the causes that tend to reproduce agitation are actively at work?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2758"/>Will not the same cause that produced agitation in <dateStruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></dateStruct>, when the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs> was formed --that which produced the agitation upon the annexation of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, and at other times-work out the same results always?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2759"/>Do you think that the nature of man will be changed &mdash; that the same causes that produced agitation at <num value="1">one</num> time will not have the same effect at another? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2760"/>This has been the result so far as my observation of the slavery question and my reading in history extends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2761"/>What right have we then to hope that the trouble will cease &mdash; that the agitation will come to an end &mdash; until it shall either he placed back where it originally stood, and where the fathers originally placed it, or, on the other hand, until it shall entirely master all opposition?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2762"/>This is the view I entertain, and this is the reason why I entertained it, as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0010.00122.00999" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> has read from my <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName> speech. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2763"/>Now, my friends, there is <num value="1">one</num> other thing that I feel myself under some sort of obligation to mention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2765"/>He says, <quote>Why cant you come out and make an open avowal of principles in all places alike?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2766"/>and he reads from an advertisement that he says was used to notify the people of a speech to be made by <persName n="Trumbull,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0010.00122.01001" reg="nearbymention:Trumbull,Lyman,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Trumbull</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Waterloo, Monroe, Illinois" key="tgn,2030592">Waterloo</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2767"/>In commenting on it he desires to know whether we cannot speak frankly and manfully as he and his friends do!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2768"/>How, I ask, do his friends speak out their own sentiments?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2769"/>A Convention of his party in this State met on the <dateStruct value="-04-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, at <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName>, and passed a set of resolutions which they proclaim to the country as their platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2770"/>This does constitute their platform, and it, is because <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0010.00122.01002" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> claims it is his platform &mdash; that these are his principles and purposes &mdash; that he has a right to declare he speaks his sentiments <quote>frankly and manfully.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2772"/>Now, what is the reason, that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0010.00122.01006" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> is not willing that <persName n="Dougherty,Colonel,,,," id="n0024.0010.00122.01007" reg="nearbymention:Dougherty,John,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Dougherty</surname></persName> and <persName n="Reynolds,Governor,,,," id="n0024.0010.00122.01008" reg="mostcommon:Reynolds,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Reynolds</surname></persName> should stand upon their own written and printed platform as well as he upon his?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2773"/>Why must he look further than their platform when he claims himself to stand by his platform? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2774"/>Again, in reference to our platform: On the <dateStruct value="-06-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> the <name>Republicans</name> had their Convention and published their platform, which is as clear and distinct as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0010.00122.01009" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2775"/>What is the reason that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0010.00122.01010" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> is not willing I should stand upon that platform?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2776"/>Why must he go around hunting for some <num value="1">one</num> who is supporting me, or has supported me at some time in his life, and who has said something at some time contrary to that platform?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2777"/>Does the <rs>Judge</rs> regard that rule as a good <num value="1">one</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2778"/>If it turn out that the rule is a good <num value="1">one</num> for me &mdash; that I am responsible for any and every opinion that any man has expressed who is my friend-then it is a good rule for him. I ask, is it not as good a rule for him as it is for me?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2782"/>I am glad of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2783"/>I cannot see what he means by parading these resolutions, if it is not to hold me responsible for them in some way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2784"/>I will therefore put in as my answer to the <pb id="p.123" n="123"/> resolutions that he has hunted up against me, what I, as a lawyer, would call a good plea to a bad declaration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2785"/>I understand that it is a maxim of law, that a poor plea may be a good plea to a bad declaration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2786"/>I think that the opinions the <rs>Judge</rs> brings from those who support me, yet differ from me, is a bad declaration against me ; but if I can bring the same things against him, I am putting in a good plea to that kind of declaration and now I propose to try it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2898"/>It seems to me that there is no difficulty in deciding it. In a variety of ways he said that it was a question for the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2899"/>He did not stop then to tell us that whatever the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> decides, the people can by withholding necessary <quote>police regulations</quote> keep slavery out. He did not make any such answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2900"/>I submit to you now, whether the new state of the case has not induced the <rs>Judge</rs> to sheer away from his original ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2901"/>Would not this be the impression of every fair-minded man? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2902"/>I hold that the proposition that slavery cannot enter a new country without police regulations is historically false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2906"/>This shows that there is vigor enough in slavery to plant itself in a new country even against unfriendly legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2907"/>It takes not only law but the <hi rend="italics">enforcement</hi> of law to keep it out. That is the history of this country upon the subject. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2908"/>I wish to ask <num value="1">one</num> other question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2909"/>It being understood that the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> guaranties property in slaves in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, if there is any infringement of the right of that property, would not the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> Courts, organized for the government of the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>, apply such remedy as might be necessary in that case?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2910"/>It is a maxim held by the courts, that there is no wrong without its remedy ; and the courts have a remedy for whatever is acknowledged and treated as a wrong. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2911"/>Again : I will ask you, my friends, if you were elected members of the <name>Legislature</name>, what would be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing you would have to do before entering upon your duties?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2912"/><hi rend="italics">Swear to support the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs></hi>. Suppose you believe, as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0010.00127.01100" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> does, that the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> guaranties to your neighbor the right to hold slaves in that Territory &mdash; that they are his property-how can you clear your oaths unless you give him such legislation as is necessary to enable him to enjoy that property?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2913"/>What do you understand by supporting <pb id="p.128" n="128"/> the <rs>Constitution</rs> of a State, or of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2914"/>Is it not to give such Constitutional helps to the rights established by that Constitution as may be practically needed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2915"/>Can you, if you swear to support the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and believe that, the <rs>Constitution</rs> establishes a right, clear your oath, without giving it support?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2916"/>Do you support the <rs>Constitution</rs> if, knowing or believing there is a right established under it which needs specific legislation, you withhold that, legislation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2917"/>Do you not violate and disregard your oath?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2918"/>I can conceive of nothing plainer in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2919"/>There can be nothing in the words <quote>support the <rs>Constitution</rs>,</quote> if you may run counter to it by refusing support to any right established under the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2920"/>And what I say here will hold with still more force against the <rs>Judge</rs>'s doctrine of <quote>unfriendly legislation.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2921"/>How could you, having sworn to support the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and believing it guarantied the right to hold slaves in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, assist in legislation <hi rend="italics">intended to defeat that right</hi>? That would be violating your own view of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2922"/>Not only so, but if you were to do so, how long would it take the courts to hold your votes unconstitutional and void?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2923"/>Not a moment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2924"/>Lastly I would ask &mdash; is not Congress, itself, under obligation to give legislative support to any right that is established under the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">United States Constitution</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2925"/>I repeat the question &mdash; is not Congress, itself, bound to give legislative support to any right that is established in the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">United States Constitution</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2926"/>A member of Congress swears to support the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, and if he sees a right established by that Constitution which needs specific legislative protection, can he clear his oath without giving that protection?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2927"/>Let me ask you why many of us who are opposed to slavery upon principle, give our acquiescence to a Fugitive Slave law?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2928"/>Why do we hold ourselves under obligations to pass such a law, and abide by it when it is passed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2929"/>Because the <rs>Constitution</rs> makes provision that the owners of slaves shall have the right to reclaim them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2930"/>It gives the right to reclaim slaves, and that right is, as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0010.00128.01101" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> says, a barren right, unless there is legislation that will enforce it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2931"/>The mere declaration, <quote>No person held to service or labor in <num value="1">one</num> State under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such, service or labor may be due,</quote> is powerless without specific legislation to enforce it. Now, on what ground would a member of Congress who is opposed to slavery in the abstract, vote for a Fugitive law, as I would deem it my duty to do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2932"/>Because there is a Constitutional right which needs legislation to enforce it. And although it is distasteful to me, I have sworn to support the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and having so sworn, I cannot conceive that I do support it if I withhold from that right any necessary legislation to make it practical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2933"/>And if that is true in regard to a Fugitive Slave law, is the right to have fugitive slaves reclaimed any better fixed in the <rs>Constitution</rs> than the right to hold slaves in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2934"/>For this decision is a just exposition of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0010.00128.01102" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> thinks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2935"/>Is the <num value="1">one</num> right any better than the other?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2936"/>Is there any man who, while a member of Congress, would give support to the <num value="1">one</num> any more than the other?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2937"/>If I wished to refuse to give Legislative support to slave property in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, if a member of Congress, I could not do it, holding the view that the <rs>Constitution</rs> establishes that, right, If I did it at all, it would be because I deny that this decision properly construes the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2938"/>But if I acknowledge, with <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0010.00128.01103" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, that this decision properly construes the <rs>Constitution</rs>, I cannot conceive that I would be less than a perjured man if I should refuse in Congress to give such protection to that property as in its nature it needed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2939"/>At the end of what I have said here I propose to give the <rs>Judge</rs> my <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> interrogatory, which he may take and answer at his leisure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2945"/>I am aware that in some of the speeches <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0010.00129.01106" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> has made, he has spoken as if he did not know or think that the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> had decided that a <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> cannot exclude slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2946"/>Precisely what the <rs>Judge</rs> would say upon the subject-whether he would say definitely that he does not understand they have so decided, or whether he would say he does understand that the court have so decided, I do not know ; but I know that in his speech at <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName> be spoke of it as a thing they had not decided yet ; and in his answer to me at <placeName key="tgn,2027931" n="1.000 13" reg="freeport, stephenson, illinois">Freeport</placeName>, he spoke of it so far again, as I can comprehend it, as a thing that had not yet been decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2947"/>Now I hold that if the <rs>Judge</rs> does entertain that view, I think that he is not mistaken in so far as it can be said that the court has not decided any thing save the mere question of jurisdiction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2948"/>I know the legal arguments that can be made &mdash; that after a court has decided that it cannot take jurisdiction in a case, it then has decided all that is before it, and that is the end of it. A plausible argument can be made in favor of that proposition, but I know that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0010.00129.01107" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> has said in <num value="1">one</num> of his speeches that the court went forward, <hi rend="italics">like honest men as they were</hi>, and decided all the points in the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2949"/>If any points are really extra-judicially decided because not necessarily before them, then this <num value="1">one</num> as to the power of the <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> to exclude slavery is <num value="1">one</num> of them, as also the <num value="1">one</num> that the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs> was null and void.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2950"/>They are both extra-judicial, or neither is according as the court held that they had no jurisdiction in the case between the parties, because of want of capacity of <num value="1">one</num> party to maintain a suit in that court.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2951"/>I want, if I have sufficient time, to show that the court did <hi rend="italics">pass its opinion</hi>, but that is the only thing actually done in the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2952"/>If they did not decide, they showed what they were ready to decide whenever the matter was before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2953"/>What is that opinion?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2954"/>After having argued that Congress had no power to pass a law excluding slavery from a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> Territory, they then used language to this effect: That inasmuch as Congress itself could not exercise such a power, it followed as a matter of course that it could not authorize a Territorial Government to exercise it, for the <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> can do no more than Congress could do. Thus it expressed its opinion emphatically against the power of a <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> to exclude slavery, leaving us in just as little doubt on that point as upon any other point they really decided. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2955"/>Now, my fellow-citizens, I will detain you only a little while longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2956"/>My time is nearly out.

<p> You know at <placeName reg="Ottawa, La Salle, Illinois" key="tgn,2029529">Ottawa</placeName>, I read this platform, and asked him if he concurred in each and all of the principles set forth in it. He would not answer these questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2958"/>At last I said frankly, I wish you to answer them, because when I get them up here where the color of your principles are a little darker than in <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, I intend to trot you down to <placeName reg="Jonesboro, Clayton, Georgia" key="tgn,2023284">Jonesboro</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2959"/>The very notice that I was going to take him down to <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> made him tremble in the knees so that he had to be carried from the platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2960"/>He laid up <measure n="7days" type="date">seven days</measure>, and in the meantime held a consultation with his political physicians ; they had <persName n="Lovejoy,,,,," id="n0024.0010.00129.01110" reg="mostcommon:Lovejoy,nomatch:0"><surname>Lovejoy</surname></persName> and <persName n="Farnsworth,,,,," id="n0024.0010.00129.01111" reg="mostcommon:Farnsworth,nomatch:0"><surname>Farnsworth</surname></persName> and all the leaders of the <orgName n="Abolition party" type="party">Abolition party</orgName>, they consulted it all over, and at last <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0024.0010.00129.01112" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> came to the conclusion that he would answer, so he came up to <placeName key="tgn,2027931" n="1.000 13" reg="freeport, stephenson, illinois">Freeport</placeName> last <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2961"/>Now that statement altogether furnishes a subject for philosophical contemplation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2962"/>I have been treating it in that .way, and I have really come to the conclusion that I can explain it in no other way than by believing the <rs>Judge</rs> is crazy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2963"/>If he was in his right mind, I cannot conceive how he would have risked disgusting the <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5000">five thousand</num> of his own friends who stood there, and knew, as to my having been carried from the platform, that there was not a word of truth in it. <pb id="p.130" n="130"/> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2966"/>He smiles now and says, <quote>Didn't they carry you off?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2967"/>But he said then, <quote><hi rend="italics">he had to be carried of</hi>,</quote> and he said it to convince the country that he had so completely broken me down by his speech that I had to be carried away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2968"/>Now he seeks to dodge it, and asks, <quote>Didn't they carry you off?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2969"/>Yes, they did. <quote><hi rend="italics">But, <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0010.00130.01116" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, why didn't you tell the truth</hi>?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2970"/>I would like to know why you didn't tell the truth about it. And then again, <quote>He laid up <measure n="7days" type="date">seven days</measure>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2971"/>He puts this in print for the people of the country to read as a serious document.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2972"/>I think if he had been in his sober senses he would not have risked that barefacedness in the presence of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of his own friends, who knew that I made speeches within <num value="6">six</num> of the <measure n="7days" type="date">seven days</measure> at <placeName reg="Henry, Marshall, Illinois" key="tgn,2028261">Henry, Marshall county</placeName>; <placeName reg="Augusta, Hancock, Illinois" key="tgn,2026428">Augusta, Hancock county</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Macomb, McDonough, Illinois" key="tgn,7013983">Macomb, McDonough county</placeName>, including all the necessary travel to meet him again at <placeName key="tgn,2027931" n="1.000 13" reg="freeport, stephenson, illinois">Freeport</placeName> at the end of the <measure n="6days" type="date">six days</measure>. Now, I say, there is no charitable way to look at that statement, except to conclude that he is actually crazy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2973"/>There is another thing in that statement that alarmed me very greatly as he states it, that he was going to <quote>trot me down to <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2974"/>Thereby he would have you to infer that I would not come to <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> unless he forced me &mdash; that I could not be got here, unless he, giant-like, had hauled me down here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2975"/>That statement he makes, too, in the teeth of the knowledge that I had made the stipulation to come down here, and that he himself had been very reluctant to enter into the stipulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2976"/>More than all this, <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0010.00130.01117" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, when he made that statement, must have been crazy, and wholly out of his sober senses, or else he would have known that when he got me down here &mdash; that promise --that windy promise &mdash; of his powers to annihilate me, wouldn't amount, to anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2977"/>Now, how little do I look like being carried away trembling?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2978"/>Let the <rs>Judge</rs> go on, and after he is done with his half hour, I want you all, if I can't go home myself, to let me stay and rot here ; and if anything happens to the <rs>Judge</rs>, if I cannot carry him to the hotel and put him to bed, let me stay here and rot. I say, then, there is something extraordinary in this statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2979"/>I ask you if you know any other living man who would make such a statement?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2980"/>I will ask my friend <persName n="Casey,,,,," id="n0024.0010.00130.01118" reg="mostcommon:Casey,nomatch:0"><surname>Casey</surname></persName>, over there, if he would do such a a thing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2981"/>Would he send that out and have his men take it as the truth?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2982"/>Did the <rs>Judge</rs> talk of trotting me down to <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> to scare me to death?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2983"/>Why, I know this people better than he does.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2984"/>I was raised just a little east of here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2985"/>I am a part of this people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2986"/>But the <rs>Judge</rs> was raised further north, and perhaps he has some horrid idea of what this people might be induced to do. But really I have talked about this matter perhaps longer than I ought, for it is no great thing, and yet the smallest are often the most difficult things to deal with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2987"/>The <rs>Judge</rs> has set about seriously trying to make the impression that when we meet at different places I am literally in his clutches &mdash; that I am a poor, helpless, decrepit mouse, and that I can do nothing at all. This is <num value="1">one</num> of the ways he has taken to create that impression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2988"/>I don't know any other way to meet it, except this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2989"/>I don't want to quarrel with him --to call him a liar &mdash; but when I come square up to him I don't know what else to call him, if I must tell the truth out. I want to be at peace, and reserve all my fighting powers for necessary occasions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2990"/>My time, now, is very nearly out, and I give up the trifle that is left to the <rs>Judge</rs>, to let him set my knees trembling again, if he can.</p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2993"/>I did say there in a playful manner that when I put these questions to <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0010.00131.01121" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> at <placeName key="tgn,2081261" n="1.000 10" reg="Ottawa, Putnam, Ohio">Ottowa</placeName> he failed to answer, and that he trembled and had to be carried off the stand, and required <measure n="7days" type="date">seven days</measure> to get up his reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2994"/>That he did not walk off from that stand he will not deny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2995"/>That when the crowd went away from the stand with me, a few persons carried him home on their shoulders and laid him clown, he will admit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2996"/>I wish to say to you that whenever I degrade my friends and myself by allowing them to carry me on their backs along through the public streets, when I am able to walk, I am willing to be deemed crazy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2997"/>I did not say whether I beat him or he, beat me in the argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2998"/>It is true I put these questions to him, and I put them not as mere idle questions, but showed that I based them upon the creed of the <rs>Black</rs> <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> as declared by their Conventions in that portion of the <rs>State</rs> which he depends upon to elect him, and desired to know whether he indorsed that creed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2999"/>H e would not answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3000"/>When I reminded him that I intended bringing him into <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> and renewing my questions if he refused to answer, he then consulted and did, get up his answers <num value="1">one</num> week after,--answers which I may refer to in a few minutes and show you how equivocal they are. My object was to make him avow whether or not he stood by the platform of his party ; the resolutions I then read, and upon which I based my questions, had been adopted by his party in the <rs>Galena</rs> <orgName n="Congressional District" type="district">Congressional District</orgName>, and the <rs>Chicago</rs> and Bloomington Congressional Districts, composing a large majority of the counties in this State that give Republican or Abolition majorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3003"/>He says that he answered my questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3004"/><num value="1">One</num> of them was whether he would vote to admit any more slave States into the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3005"/>The creed of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> as set forth in the resolutions of their various Conventions was, that they would.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3006"/>under no circumstances vote to admit another slave State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3007"/>It was put forth in the <name>Lovejoy</name> resolutions in the <name>Legislature</name> ; it was put forth and passed in a majority of all the counties of this State which give Abolition or Republican majorities, or elect members to the <name>Legislature</name> of that school of politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3008"/>I had a right to know whether he would vote for or against the admission of another slave State in the event the people wanted it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3009"/>I should be exceedingly glad to know that there would-never be another slave State admitted into the <rs>Union</rs> ; but I must add that if slavery shall be kept out of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> during the territorial existence of any <num value="1">one</num> given Territory, and then the people, having a fair chance and clean field when they come to adopt a Constitution, do such an extraordinary thing as adopt a slave Constitution, uninfluenced by the actual presence of the institution among them, I see no alternanative if we own the country, but to admit them into the <rs>Union</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3010"/></p> 
<p>Now analyze that answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3011"/>In the first place he says he would be exceedingly sorry to be put in a position where he would have to vote on the question of the admission of a slave State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3012"/>Why is be a candidate for the <name>Senate</name> if he would be sorry to be put in that position?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3013"/>I trust the people of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> will not put him in a position which he would be so sorry to occupy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3014"/>The next position he takes is that he would be glad to know that there would never be another slave State, yet, in certain contingencies, he might have to vote for <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3015"/>What is that contingency?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3016"/><quote>If Congress keeps slavery out by law while it is a Territory, and then the people should have a fair chance and should adopt slavery, uninfluenced by the presence of the institution,</quote> he supposed he would have to admit the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3017"/>Suppose Congress should not keep slavery out during their territorial existence, then how would he <pb id="p.132" n="132"/> vote when the people applied for admission into the <rs>Union</rs> with a slave Constitution?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3018"/>That he does not answer, and that is the condition of every Territory we have now got. Slavery is not kept out of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> by act of Congress, and when I put the question to <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0010.00132.01124" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, whether he will vote for the admission with or without slavery, as her people may desire, he will not answer, and you have not got an answer from him. In Nebraska slavery is not prohibited by act of Congress, but the people are allowed under the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill, to do as they please on the subject ; and when I ask him whether he will vote to admit <placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> with a slave Constitution if her people desire it, he will not answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3024"/>He has not done it, and he will not do it. The Abolitionists up North understand that this answer is made with a view of not committing himself on any one Territory now in existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3025"/>It is so understood there, and you cannot expect an answer from him on a case that applies to any one Territory, or applies to the new States which by compact we are pledged to admit out of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>; when they have the requisite population and desire admission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3026"/>I submit to you whether he has made a frank answer, so that you can tell how he would vote in any <num value="1">one</num> of these cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3027"/><quote>He would be sorry to be put in the position.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3028"/>Why would he be sorry to be put in this position if his duty required him to give the vote?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3029"/>If the people of ad Territory ought to be permitted to come into the <rs>Union</rs> as a State with slavery or without it, as they pleased, why not give the vote admitting them cheerfully?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3030"/>If in his opinion they ought not to come in with slavery, even if they wanted to, why not say that he would cheerfully vote against their admission?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3096"/>So the absence of local legislation to encourage and support slave property in a Territory excludes it practically just as effectually as if there was a positive Constitutional provision against it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3099"/>I am willing to take the decision of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> as it was pronounced by that august tribunal without stopping to inquire whether I would have decided that way or not.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3103"/><emph>Ladies and Gentlemen</emph>: It will be very difficult for an audience so large as this to hear distinctly what a speaker says, and consequently it is important that as profound silence be preserved as possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3104"/>While I was at the hotel to-day: an elderly gentleman called upon me to know whether I was really in favor of producing a perfect equality between the negroes and white people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3105"/>While I had not proposed to myself on this occasion to say much on that subject, yet as the question was asked me I thought I would occupy perhaps <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> in saying something in regard to it. I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs> races &mdash; that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office nor to intermarry with white people ; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs> races which I believe will forever forbid the <num value="2">two</num> races living together on terms of social and political equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3106"/>And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3107"/>I say upon this occasion I do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be denied every thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3108"/>I do not understand that because I do not want a negro woman for a slave I must necessarily want her for a wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3109"/>My understanding is that I can just let her alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3110"/>I am now in my <num value="50" type="ordinal">fiftieth</num> year, and I certainly never have had a black woman for either a slave or a wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3111"/>So it seems to me quite possible for us to get along without making either slaves or wives of negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3112"/>I will add to this that I have never seen, to my knowledge, a man, woman or child who was in favor of producing a perfect equality, social and political, between negroes and white men. I recollect of but <num value="1">one</num> distinguished instance that I ever heard of so frequently as to be entirely satisfied of its correctness-and that is the case of <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00136.01177" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s old friend <persName n="Johnson,Colonel,Richard,M.,," id="n0024.0011.00136.01178" reg="default:Johnson,Richard,M.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>Richard</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3113"/>I will also add to the remarks I have made (for I am not going to enter at large upon this subject), that I have never had the least apprehension that I or my friends would marry negroes if there was no law to keep them from it ; but as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00136.01179" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> and his friends seem to be in great apprehension that they might, if there were no law to keep them from it, I give him the most solemn pledge that I will to the very last stand by the law of this State, which forbids the marrying of white people with negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3114"/>I will add <num value="1">one</num> further word, which is this: that I do not understand that there is any place where an alteration, of the social and political relations of the negro and the white man can be made except in the <orgName n="State Legislature" type="legislature">State Legislature</orgName>--not in the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName>--and as I do not really apprehend the approach of any such thing myself, and as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00136.01180" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> seems to be in constant horror that some such danger is rapidly approaching, I propose as the best means to prevent it that the <rs>Judge</rs> be kept at home and placed in the <orgName n="State Legislature" type="legislature">State Legislature</orgName> to fight the measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3115"/>I do not propose dwelling longer at this time on this subject. </p>

The <rs>Judge</rs> was at that time out upon <num value="1">one</num> of his speaking tours through the country, and when the news of it reached him, as I am informed, he denounced <persName n="Trumbull,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00137.01183" reg="nearbymention:Trumbull,Lyman,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Trumbull</surname></persName> in rather harsh terms for having said what he did in regard to that matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3117"/>I was traveling at that time, and speaking at the same places with <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00137.01184" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> on subsequent days, and when I heard of what <persName n="Trumbull,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00137.01185" reg="nearbymention:Trumbull,Lyman,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Trumbull</surname></persName> had said of <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0011.00137.01186" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, and what <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0011.00137.01187" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> had said back again, I felt that I was in a position where I could not remain entirely silent in regard to the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3118"/>Consequently, upon <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> occasions I alluded to it, and alluded to it in no otherwise than to say that in regard to the charge brought by <persName n="Trumbull,,,,," id="n0024.0011.00137.01188" reg="nearbymention:Trumbull,Lyman,,,"><surname>Trumbull</surname></persName> against <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0011.00137.01189" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, I <hi rend="italics">personally</hi> knew nothing, and sought to say nothing about it &mdash; that I did personally know <persName n="Trumbull,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00137.01190" reg="nearbymention:Trumbull,Lyman,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Trumbull</surname></persName>--that I believed him to be a man of veracity &mdash; that I believed him to be a man of capacity sufficient to know very well whether an assertion he was making, as a conclusion drawn from a set of facts, was true or false ; and as a conclusion of my own from that, I stated it as my belief, if <persName n="Trumbull,,,,," id="n0024.0011.00137.01191" reg="nearbymention:Trumbull,Lyman,,,"><surname>Trumbull</surname></persName> should ever be called upon, he would prove every thing he had said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3119"/>I said this upon <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> occasions.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3131"/>It will be perceived <persName n="Trumbull,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00137.01210" reg="nearbymention:Trumbull,Lyman,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Trumbull</surname></persName> shows that <persName n="Bigler,Senator,,,," id="n0024.0011.00137.01211" reg="mostcommon:Bigler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Bigler</surname></persName>, upon the floor of the <name>Senate</name>, had declared there had been a conference among the <rs>Senators</rs>, in which conference it was determined to have an Enabling Act passed for the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> to form a Constitution under, and in this conference it was agreed among them that it was best not to have a provision for submitting the <rs>Constitution</rs> to a vote of the people after it should be formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3132"/>He then brings forward to show, and showing, as he deemed, that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00137.01212" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> reported the bill back to the <name>Senate</name> with that clause stricken out.

These are the general statements that he has made. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3133"/>I propose to examine the points in <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00137.01213" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s speech, in which he attempts to answer that speech of <persName n="Trumbull,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00137.01214" reg="nearbymention:Trumbull,Lyman,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Trumbull</surname></persName>'s. When you come to examine <rs type="role2">Judge</rs> <pb id="p.138" n="138"/> <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0011.00138.01215" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s speech, you will find that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> point he makes is <quote>Suppose it were true that there was such a change in the bill, and that I struck it out &mdash; is that a proof of a plot to force a Constitution upon them against their will?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3134"/>His striking out such a provision, if there was such a <num value="1">one</num> in the bill, argues, does not establish the proof that it was stricken out for the purpose of robbing the people of that right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3135"/>I would say, in the first place, that that would be a <hi rend="italics">most manifest</hi> reason for it. It is true, as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00138.01216" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> states, that many Territorial bills have passed without having such a provision in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3136"/>I believe it is true, though I am not certain, that in some instances, Constitutions framed under such bills have been submitted to a vote of the people, with the law silent upon the subject, but it does not appear that they once had their Enabling Acts framed with an express provision <hi rend="italics">for</hi> submitting the <rs>Constitution</rs> to be framed to a vote of the people, and then that they were stricken out when Congress did not mean to alter the effect of the law. That there have been bills which never had the provision in, I do not question ; but when was that provision taken out of <num value="1">one</num> that it was in?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3137"/>More especially does this evidence tend to prove the proposition that <persName n="Trumbull,,,,," id="n0024.0011.00138.01217" reg="nearbymention:Trumbull,Lyman,,,"><surname>Trumbull</surname></persName> advanced, when we remember that the provision was stricken out of the bill almost simultaneously with the time that <persName n="Bigler,,,,," id="n0024.0011.00138.01218" reg="mostcommon:Bigler,nomatch:0"><surname>Bigler</surname></persName> says there was a conference among certain <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, and in which it was agreed that a bill should be passed leaving that out. <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00138.01219" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, in answering <persName n="Trumbull,,,,," id="n0024.0011.00138.01220" reg="nearbymention:Trumbull,Lyman,,,"><surname>Trumbull</surname></persName>, omits to attend to the testimony of <persName n="Bigler,,,,," id="n0024.0011.00138.01221" reg="mostcommon:Bigler,nomatch:0"><surname>Bigler</surname></persName>, that there was a meeting in which it was agreed they should so frame the bill that there should be no submission of the <rs>Constitution</rs> to a vote of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3138"/>The <rs>Judge</rs> does not notice this part of it. If you take this as <num value="1">one</num> piece of evidence, and then ascertain that simultaneously <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00138.01222" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> struck out a provision that did require it to be submitted, and put the <num value="2">two</num> together, I think it will make a pretty fair, show of proof that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00138.01223" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> did, as <persName n="Trumbull,,,,," id="n0024.0011.00138.01224" reg="nearbymention:Trumbull,Lyman,,,"><surname>Trumbull</surname></persName> says, enter into a plot to put in force a Constitution for <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> without giving the people any opportunity of voting upon it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3139"/>But I must hurry on.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3140"/>This is a mere question of fact, and can be determined by evidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3141"/>I only want to ask this question-why did not <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00138.01226" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> say that these words were not stricken out of the <name>Toombs</name> bill, or this bill from which it is alleged the provision was stricken out &mdash; a bill which goes by the name of <persName n="Toombs,,,,," id="n0024.0011.00138.01227" reg="mostcommon:Toombs,nomatch:0"><surname>Toombs</surname></persName>, because he originally brought it forward?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3142"/>I ask why, if the <rs>Judge</rs> wanted to make a direct issue with <persName n="Trumbull,,,,," id="n0024.0011.00138.01228" reg="nearbymention:Trumbull,Lyman,,,"><surname>Trumbull</surname></persName>, did he not take the exact proposition <persName n="Trumbull,,,,," id="n0024.0011.00138.01229" reg="nearbymention:Trumbull,Lyman,,,"><surname>Trumbull</surname></persName> made in his speech, and say it was not stricken out?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3144"/>We see at once that he is merely making an issue upon the meaning of the words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3145"/>He has not undertaken to say that <persName n="Trumbull,,,,," id="n0024.0011.00138.01233" reg="nearbymention:Trumbull,Lyman,,,"><surname>Trumbull</surname></persName> tells a lie about these words being stricken out ; but he is really, when pushed up to it, only taking an issue upon the meaning of the words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3146"/>Now, then, if there be any issue upon the meaning of the words, or if there be upon the question of fact as to whether these words were stricken out, I have before me what I suppose to be a genuine copy of the <name>Toombs</name> bill, in which it can be shown that the words <rs>Trumbull</rs> says were in it, were, in fact, originally there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3147"/>If there be any dispute upon the fact, I have got the documents here to show they were there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3148"/>If there be any controversy upon the sense of the words-whether these words which were stricken out really constituted a provision for submitting the matter to a vote of the people, as that is a matter of argument, I think I may as well use <persName n="Trumbull,,,,," id="n0024.0011.00138.01234" reg="nearbymention:Trumbull,Lyman,,,"><surname>Trumbull</surname></persName>'s own argument.

<p>Nothing was further from my mind than to allude to any social or confidential interview.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3228"/>The meeting was not of that character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3229"/>Indeed, it was semi-official and called to promote the public good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3230"/>My recollection was clear that I left the conference under the impression that it had been deemed best to adopt measures to admit <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> as a State through the agency of <num value="1">one</num> popular election, and that for delegates to this Convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3231"/>This impression was stronger because I thought the spirit of the bill infringed upon the doctrine of non-intervention, to which I had great aversion ; but with the hope of accomplishing a great good, and as no movement had been made in that direction in the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>, I waived this objection, and concluded to support the measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3232"/>I have a few items of testimony as to the correctness of these impressions, and with their submission I shall be content.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3234"/>That the following propositions be, and the same are hereby offered to the said Convention of the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, when formed, for their free acceptance or rejection ; which, if accepted by the <rs>Convention</rs> and ratified by the people at the <pb id="p.142" n="142"/> election for the adoption of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, shall be obligatory upon the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and the said <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">State of Kansas</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3236"/>Both these bills were under consideration at the conference referred to ; but, sir, when the <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> reported the <name>Toombs</name> bill to the <name>Senate</name> with amendments, the next morning it did not contain that portion of the <orgName type="regiment" key="3Section">third section</orgName> which indicated to the <rs>Convention</rs> that the <rs>Constitution</rs> should be approved by the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3264"/>How can he make out that it is a forgery?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3265"/>What is a forgery?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3266"/>It is the bringing forward something in writing or in print purporting to be of certain effect when it is altogether untrue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3268"/>If you come forward with a letter purporting to be written by me which I never wrote, there is another forgery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3269"/>If you produce anything in writing or in print saying it is so and so, the document not being genuine, a forgery has been committed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3270"/>How do you make this a forgery when every piece of the evidence is genuine?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3271"/>If <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00143.01346" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> does say these documents and quotations are false and forged, he has a full right to do so, but until he does it specifically we don't know how to get at him. If he does say they are false and forged, I will then look further into it, and I presume I can procure the certificates of the proper officers that they are genuine copies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3272"/>I have no doubt each of these extracts will be found exactly where <persName n="Trumbull,,,,," id="n0024.0011.00143.01347" reg="nearbymention:Trumbull,Lyman,,,"><surname>Trumbull</surname></persName> says it is.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3273"/>I repeat again, if he will point out which <num value="1">one</num> is a forgery, I will carefully examine it, and if it proves that any <num value="1">one</num> of them is really a forgery it will not be me who will hold to it any longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3279"/>The bill that went into his hands had the provision in it for a submission of the <rs>Constitution</rs> to the people ; and I say its language amounts to an express provision for a submission, and that he took the provision out.

It was vocal with the declaration when you got it, for a submission of the <rs>Constitution</rs> to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3280"/>And now, my direct question to <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00143.01354" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Fred,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> is, to answer why, if he deemed the bill silent on this point, he found it necessary to strike out those particular harmless words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3281"/>If he had found the bill silent and without this provision, he might say what he does now. If he supposes it was implied that the <rs>Constitution</rs> would be submitted to a vote of the people, how could these <num value="2">two</num> lines so encumber the statute as to make it necessary to strike them out?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3282"/>How could he infer that a submission was still implied, after its express provision had been stricken from the bill?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3283"/>I find the bill vocal with the provision, while he silenced it. He took it out, and although he took out the other provision preventing a submission to a vote of the people, I ask, <hi rend="italics">why did you <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> put it in</hi>? I ask him whether he took the original provision out, which <persName n="Trumbull,,,,," id="n0024.0011.00143.01355" reg="nearbymention:Trumbull,Lyman,,,"><surname>Trumbull</surname></persName> alleges was in the bill?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3284"/>If he admits that he did take it, I <hi rend="italics">ask him what he did for it</hi>? It looks to us as if he had altered the bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3285"/>If it looks differently to him &mdash; if he has a different reason for his action from the <num value="1">one</num> we assign him-he can tell it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3317"/>I will tell you what the facts of the case were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3318"/>I introduced a bill to authorize the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> to form a Constitution, and come into the <rs>Union</rs> as a State whenever they should have the requisite population for a member of Congress, and <persName n="Toombs,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0011.00145.01385" reg="mostcommon:Toombs,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Toombs</surname></persName> proposed a substitute, authorizing the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, with their then population of only <num value="25000">25,000</num>, to form a Constitution, and come in at once The question at issue was, whether we would admit <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> with a population of <num value="25600">25,600</num>, or, make her wait until she had the ratio entitling her to a representative in Congress, which was <num value="93420">93,420</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3319"/>That was the point of dispute in the <rs>Committee</rs> of Territories, to which both my bill and <persName n="Toombs,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0011.00145.01386" reg="mostcommon:Toombs,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Toombs</surname></persName>'s substitute had been referred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3321"/>Accordingly, a bill to carry out his idea of immediate admission was reported as a substitute for mine &mdash; the only points at issue being, as I have already said, the question of population, and the adoption of safeguards against frauds at the election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3330"/>The general rule made the law silent on the subject, taking it for granted that the people would demand and compel a popular vote on the ratification of their Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3532"/>This furnishes me an occasion for saying a few words upon the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3533"/>I mentioned in a certain speech of mine which has been printed, that the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> had decided that a negro could not possibly be made a citizen, and without saying what was my ground of complaint in regard to that, or whether I had any ground of complaint, <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00156.01644" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> has from that thing manufactured nearly every thing that he ever says about my disposition to produce an equality between the negroes and the white people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3540"/>I have said so, and I did not say it without what seemed to me to be good reasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3541"/>It perhaps would require more time than I have now to set forth these reasons in detail; but let me ask you a few questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3542"/>Have we ever had any peace on this slavery question?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3543"/>When are we to have peace upon it if it is kept in the position it now occupies?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3544"/>How arc we ever to have peace upon it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3545"/>That is an important question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3547"/>But let me ask <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00157.01650" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> how he is going to get the people to do that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3548"/>They have been wrangling over this question for at least <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure>. This was the cause of the agitation resulting in the <rs>Missouri</rs> Compromise-this produced the troubles at the annexation of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, in the acquisition of the territory acquired in the <rs>Mexican</rs> war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3549"/>That <quote>forever</quote> turned out to be just <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, <hi rend="italics">when <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00157.01651" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> himself reopened it</hi>. When is it likely to come to an end?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3550"/>He introduced the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct> to put another end to the slavery agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3551"/>He promised that it would finish it all up immediately, and he has never made a speech since until he got into a quarrel with the <rs>President</rs> about the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>, in which he has not declared that we are <hi rend="italics">just at the end</hi> of the slavery agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3552"/>But in <num value="1">one</num> speech, I think last winter, he did say that he didn't quite see when the end of the slavery agitation would come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3553"/>Now he tells us again that it is all over, and the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> have voted down the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3554"/>How is it over?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3555"/>That was only <num value="1">one</num> of the attempts at putting an end to the slavery agitation-<num value="1">one</num> of these <quote>final settlements.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3556"/>Is <placeName key="tgn,7007254" n="1.000 187" reg="kansas">Kansas</placeName> in the <rs>Union</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3557"/>Has she formed a Constitution that she is likely to come in under?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3558"/>Is not the slavery agitation still an open question in that Territory?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3559"/>Has the voting down of that Constitution put an end to all the trouble?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3560"/>Is that more likely to settle it than every <num value="1">one</num> of these previous attempts to settle the slavery agitation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3561"/>Now, at this day in the history of the world we can no more foretell where the end of this slavery agitation will be than we can see the end of the world itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3562"/>The <placeName key="tgn,7007525" n="1.000 51" reg="nebraska">Nebraska</placeName>-<placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> bill was introduced <measure n="4.5years" type="date">four years and a half</measure> ago, and if the agitation is ever to come to an end, we may say we are <measure n="4.5years" type="date">four years and a half</measure> nearer the end. So, too, we can say we are <measure n="4.5years" type="date">four years and a half</measure> nearer the end of the world; and we can just as clearly see the end of the world as we can see the end of this agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3563"/>The Kansas settlement did not conclude it. If <placeName key="tgn,7007254" n="1.000 187" reg="kansas">Kansas</placeName> should sink to-day, and leave a great vacant space in the earth's surface, this vexed question would still be among us. I say, then, there is no way of putting an end to the slavery agitation amongst us but to put it back upon the basis where our fathers placed it, no way but to keep it out of our new Territories &mdash; to restrict it forever to the old States where it now exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3564"/>Then the public mind will rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3565"/>That is <num value="1">one</num> way of putting an end to the slavery agitation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3566"/>The other way is for us to surrender and let <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00157.01652" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> and his friends have their way and plant slavery over all the States-cease speaking of it as in any way a wrong-regard slavery as <num value="1">one</num> of the common matters of property, and speak of negroes as we do of our horses and cattle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3567"/>But while it drives on in its state of progress as it is now driving, and as it has driven for the last <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure>, I have ventured the opinion, and I say to-day, that we will have no end to the slavery agitation until it takes <num value="1">one</num> turn or the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3568"/>I do not mean that when it takes a turn toward ultimate extinction it will be in a day, nor in a year, nor in <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>. I do not suppose that in the most peaceful way ultimate extinction would occur in less than a <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure> at least ; but that it will occur in the best way for both races, in <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> own good time, I have no doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3569"/>But, my friends, I have used up more of my time than I intended on this point. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3626"/>Not only is this the evidence, but when he comes in with the bill having the provision stricken out, he tells us in a speech, not then, but since, that these alterations and modifications in the bill <hi rend="italics">had been made by</hi> him <hi rend="italics">in consultation with <persName n="Toombs,,,,," id="n0024.0011.00160.01728" reg="mostcommon:Toombs,nomatch:0"><surname>Toombs</surname></persName>, the originator of the bill</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3629"/>What is the reason he will not tell you any thing about how it was made, by whom it was made, or that he remembers it being made at all?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3630"/>Why does he stand playing upon the meaning of words, and quibbling around the edges of the evidence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3631"/>If he can explain all this, but leaves it unexplained, I have a right to infer that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00160.01731" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> understood it was the purpose of his party, in engineering that bill through, to make a Constitution, and have <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> come into the <rs>Union</rs> with that Constitution, <hi rend="italics">without its being submitted to a vote of the people</hi>. If he will explain his action on this question, by giving a <hi rend="italics">better reason</hi> for the facts that happened, than he has done, it will be satisfactory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3632"/>But until he does that-until he gives a better or more plausible reason than he has offered against the evidence in the case --<hi rend="italics">I suggest to</hi> him <hi rend="italics">it will not avail him at all that he swells himself up, takes on dignity, and calls people liars</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3633"/>There is not a statement in the whole speech that depends on <persName n="Trumbull,,,,," id="n0024.0011.00160.01734" reg="nearbymention:Trumbull,Lyman,,,"><surname>Trumbull</surname></persName>'s word: If you have ever studied geometry, you remember that by a course of reasoning, <persName><foreName>Euclid</foreName></persName> proves that all the angles in a triangle are equal to <num value="2">two</num> right angles.

I shall attend to that branch of the subject by and by. My object now is to prove the existence of the plot, what the design was, and I ask if I have not already done so. Here are the facts: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3687"/>The introduction of a bill on the <dateStruct value="1856-03-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year>1856</year>,</dateStruct> providing for the calling of a Convention in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, to form a State Constitution, and providing that the <rs>Constitution</rs> should be submitted to the people for adoption ; an amendment to this bill, proposed by <persName n="Toombs,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0011.00163.01759" reg="mostcommon:Toombs,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Toombs</surname></persName>, containing the same requirement ; a reference of these various bills to the <rs>Committee</rs> on Territories ; a consultation of <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> to determine whether it was advisable to have the <rs>Constitution</rs> submitted for ratification ; the determination that it was not advisable; and a report of the bill back to the <name>Senate</name> next morning, with the clause providing for the submission stricken out. Could evidence be more complete to establish the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> part of the charge I have made of a plot having been entered into by somebody, to have a Constitution adopted without submitting it to the people? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3688"/>Now, for the other part of the charge, that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00163.01760" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> was in this plot, whether knowingly or ignorantly, is not material to my purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3689"/>The charge is that he was an instrument co-operating in the project to have a Constitution formed and put into operation, without affording the people an opportunity to pass upon it. The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> evidence to sustain the charge is the fact that he reported back the <name>Toombs</name> amendment with the clause providing for the submission stricken out. This, in connection with his speech in the <name>Senate</name> on the <dateStruct value="1857-12-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct> (<hi rend="italics">Congressional Globe</hi>, part <num value="1">1</num>, <ref n="page 14">page 14</ref>), wherein he stated: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3691"/>Subsequently the <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> (<persName n="Toombs,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0011.00164.01762" reg="mostcommon:Toombs,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Toombs</surname></persName>), brought forward a substitute for my bill, which, after having been modified by him and myself in consultation, was passed by the <name>Senate</name>.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3692"/>This of itself ought to be sufficient to show that my colleague was an instrument in the plot to have a Constitution put in force without submitting it to the people, and to forever close his mouth from attempting to deny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3693"/>No man can reconcile his acts and former declarations with his present denial, and the only charitable conclusion would be that he was being used by others without knowing it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3706"/>Whether this statement is consistent with the statement just before made, that had the point been made it would have been yielded to, or that it was a new discovery, you will determine ; for if the public records do not convict and condemn him, he may go uncondemned, so far as I am concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3709"/>What will you think, after listening to the facts already presented, to show that there was a design with those who concocted the <name>Toombs</name> bill as amended, not to submit the <rs>Constitution</rs> to the people, if I now bring before you the amended bill as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0011.00164.01770" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> reported it back, and show the clause of the original bill <pb id="p.165" n="165"/> requiring submission, was not only struck out, but that other clauses mere inserted in the bill putting it absolutely out of the power of the <rs>Convention</rs> to submit the <rs>Constitution</rs> to the people for approval, had they desired to do so?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3739"/>Suppose it were true that there was such a clause in the bill, and that I struck it out, is that proof of a plot to force a Constitution upon a people against their will?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3740"/>Bear in mind, that from the days of <persName n="Washington,,George,,," id="n0024.0011.00166.01790" reg="default:Washington,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName> to the <name>Administration</name> of <persName n="Pierce,,Franklin,,," id="n0024.0011.00166.01791" reg="default:Pierce,Franklin,,,"><foreName>Franklin</foreName> <surname>Pierce</surname></persName>, there had never been passed by Congress a bill requiring the submission of a Constitution to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3746"/>It. is true, however, that, the <name>Toombs</name> bill and its authors all took it for granted that the <rs>Constitution</rs> would be submitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3759"/>He cannot pretend that he had no chance to do this, for he did offer some amendments, but none requiring submission. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3779"/>In another part of the same speech, he says: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3788"/>In the first place, no such provision had ever before been put in any similar act passed by Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3789"/>I did not suppose that there was an honest man who would pretend that the omission of such a clause furnished evidence of a conspiracy or attempt to impose on the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3790"/>It could not be expected that such of us as did not think that omission was evidence of such a scheme, would offer such an amendment ; but if <persName n="Trumbull,,,,," id="n0024.0011.00168.01805" reg="nearbymention:Trumbull,Lyman,,,"><surname>Trumbull</surname></persName> then believed what he now says, why did he not offer the amendment, and try to prevent it, when he was, as he says, invited to do so? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3791"/>In this connection I will tell you what the main point of discussion was: There was a bill pending to admit <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> whenever she should have a population of <num value="93420">93,420</num>, that being the ratio required for a member of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3792"/>Under that bill <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> could not have become a State for some years, because she could not have had the requisite population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3794"/>The Committee considered that question, and overruled me by deciding in favor of the immediate admission of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, and I reported accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3795"/>I hold in my hand a copy of the <name>Report</name> which I made at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3796"/>I will read from it <quote>The point upon which your Committee have entertained the most serious and grave doubts in regard to the propriety of indorsing the proposition, relates to the fact that, in the absence of any census of the inhabitants, there is reason to apprehend that the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> does not contain sufficient population to entitle them to demand admission under the treaty with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, if we take the ratio of representation for a member of Congress as the rule.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3797"/></p> 
<p>Thus you see that in the written report accompanying the bill, I said that the great difficulty with the <rs>Committee</rs> was the question of population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3798"/>In the same report I happened to refer to the question of submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3841"/>Those of you before me, who were present then, will remember that I vindicated myself for supporting those <num value="2">two</num> measures by the fact that they rested upon the great fundamental principle that the people of each State and each Territory of this Union have the right, and ought to be permitted to exercise the right, of regulating their own domestic concerns in their own way, subject to no other limitation or restriction than that which the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> imposes upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3842"/>I then called upon the people of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> to decide whether that principle of self-government was right or wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3843"/>If it was and is right, then the <name>Compromise</name> measures of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> were right, and, consequently, the <rs>Kansas</rs> and <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill, based upon the same principle must necessarily have been right. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3844"/>The Kansas and <placeName key="tgn,7007525" n="1.000 51" reg="nebraska">Nebraska</placeName> bill declared, in so many words, that it was the true intent and meaning of the act not to legislate slavery into any State or Territory, nor to exclude it therefrom,, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3845"/>For the last <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> I have devoted all my energies, in private and public, to commend that principle to the <rs>American</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3846"/>Whatever else may be said in condemnation or support of my political course, I apprehend <pb id="p.171" n="171"/> that no honest man will doubt the fidelity with which, under all circumstances, I have stood by it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3847"/>During the last year a question arose in the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName> whether or not that principle would be violated by the admission of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> into the <rs>Union</rs> under the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3848"/>In my opinion, the attempt, to force <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> in under that Constitution, was a gross violation of the principle enunciated in the <name>Compromise</name> measures of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, and <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> and <placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> bill of <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, and therefore I led off in the fight against the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>, and conducted it until the effort to carry that Constitution through Congress was abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3849"/>And I can appeal to all men, friends and foes, Democrats and Republicans, Northern men and Southern men, that during the whole of that fight I carried the banner of Popular Sovereignty aloft, and never allowed it to trail in the dust, or lowered my flag until victory perched upon our arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3850"/>When the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> was defeated, the question arose in the minds of those who had advocated it what they should next resort to in order to carry out their views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3851"/>They devised a measure known as the <rs>English</rs> bill, and granted a general amnesty and political pardon to all men who had fought against the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>, provided they would support that bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3852"/>I for <num value="1">one</num> did not choose to accept the pardon, or to avail myself of the amnesty granted on that condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3853"/>The fact that the supporters of <placeName key="tgn,2036684" n="1.000 1" reg="lecompton, douglas, kansas">Lecompton</placeName> were willing to forgive all differences of opinion at that time in the event those who opposed it favored the <rs>English</rs> bill, was an admission they did not think that opposition to <placeName key="tgn,2036684" n="1.000 1" reg="lecompton, douglas, kansas">Lecompton</placeName> impaired a man's standing in the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3854"/>Now the question arises, what was that <name>English</name> bill which certain men are now attempting to make a test of political orthodoxy in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3855"/>It provided, in substance, that the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> should be sent back to the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> for their adoption or rejection, at an election which was held in <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> last, and in case they refused admission under it, that <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> should be kept out of the <rs>Union</rs> until she bad <num value="93420">93,420</num> inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3856"/>I was in favor of sending the <rs>Constitution</rs> back in order to enable the people to say whether or not it was their act and deed, and embodied their will; but the other proposition, that if they refused to come into the <rs>Union</rs> under it, they should be kept out until they had double or treble the population they then had, I never would sanction by my vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3857"/>The reason why I could not sanction it is to be found in the fact that by the <rs>English</rs> bill, if the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> had only agreed to become a slaveholding State under the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs>, they could have done so with <num value="35000">35,000</num> people, but if they insisted on being a free State, as they had a right to do, then they were to be punished by being kept out of the <rs>Union</rs> until they had nearly <num value="3">three</num> times that population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3858"/>I then said in my place in the <name>Senate</name>, as I now say to you, that whenever <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> has population enough for a slave State she has population enough for a free State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3859"/>I have never yet given a vote, and I never intend to record <num value="1">one</num>, making an odious and unjust distinction between the different States of this Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3860"/>I hold it to be a fundamental principle in our republican form of government that all the <name>States</name> of this Union, old and new, free and slave, stand on an exact equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3861"/>Equality among the different States is a cardinal principle on which all our institutions rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3862"/>Wherever, therefore, you make a discrimination, saying to a slave State that it shall be admitted with <num value="35000">35,000</num> inhabitants, and to a free State that it shall not be admitted until it has <num value="93000">93,000</num> or <num value="100000">100,000</num> inhabitants, you are throwing the whole weight of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> into the scale in favor of <num value="1">one</num> class of States against the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3863"/>Nor would I on the other hand any sooner sanction the doctrine that a free State could be admitted into the <rs>Union</rs> with <num value="35000">35,000</num> people, while a slave State was kept out until it had <num value="93000">93,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3864"/>I have always declared in the <name>Senate</name> my willingness, and I am willing now to adopt the rule, that no Territory shall ever become a State, until it has the requisite population for a member of Congress, according to the then existing ratio.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3865"/>But while I have always been, and am now willing to adopt that general rule, I was not willing and would not consent to make an exception of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, as a punishment for her obstinacy, in demanding the right to do as she pleased in the formation of her Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3866"/>It is proper that I <pb id="p.172" n="172"/> should remark here, that my opposition to the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> did not rest upon the peculiar position taken by <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> on the subject of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3867"/>I held then, and hold now, that if the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> want a slave State, it is their right to make <num value="1">one</num> and be received into the <rs>Union</rs> under it ; if, on the contrary, they want a free State, it is their right to have it, and no man should ever oppose their admission because they ask it under the <num value="1">one</num> or the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3868"/>I hold to that great principle of self-government which asserts the right of every people to decide for themselves the nature and character of the domestic institutions and fundamental law under which they are to live. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3869"/>The effort has been and is now being made in this State by certain postmasters and other <orgName n="Federal office" type="office">Federal office</orgName>-holders, to make a test of faith on the support of the <rs>English</rs> bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3870"/>These men are now making speeches all over the <rs>State</rs> against me and in favor of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0024.0012.00172.01822" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, either directly or indirectly, because I would not sanction a discrimination between slave and free States by voting for the <rs>English</rs> bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3953"/>It was made by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever, and was intended to be administered by white men in all time to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3954"/>But while I hold that under our Constitution and political system the negro is not a citizen, cannot be a citizen, and ought not to be a citizen, it does not follow by any means that he should be a slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3956"/>Humanity requires, and Christianity commands, that you shall extend to every inferior being, and every dependent being, all the privileges, immunities and advantages which can be granted to them consistent with the safety of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3969"/>Suppose any <num value="2">two</num> of you, neighbors, should conclude to go to <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, <num value="1">one</num> carrying <measure n="100000dollars" type="currency">$100,000</measure> worth of negro slaves and the other <measure n="100000dollars" type="currency">$100,000</measure> worth of mixed merchandise, including quantities of liquors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3970"/>You both agree that under that decision you may carry your property to <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, but when you get it there, the merchant who is possessed of the liquors is met by the <rs>Maine</rs> liquor law, which prohibits the sale or use of his property, and the owner of the slaves is met by equally unfriendly legislation, which makes his property worthless after he gets it there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3971"/>What is the right to carry your property into the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> worth to either, when unfriendly legislation in the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> renders it worthless after you get it there?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3972"/>The slaveholder when he gets his slaves there finds that there is no local law to protect him in holding them no slave code, no police regulation maintaining and supporting him in his right, and he discovers at once that the absence of such friendly legislation excludes his property from the <pb id="p.177" n="177"/> Territory, just as irresistibly as if there was a positive Constitutional prohibition excluding it. Thus you find it is with any kind of property in a Territory, it depends for its protection on the local and municipal law. If the people of a Territory want slavery, they make friendly legislation to introduce it, but if they do not want it, they withhold all protection from it, and then it cannot exist there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3973"/>Such was the view taken on the subject by different Southern men when the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill passed, See the speech of <persName n="Orr,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0012.00177.01862" reg="mostcommon:Orr,James,L.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Orr</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, the present Speaker of the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> of Congress, made at that time, and there you will find this whole doctrine argued out at full length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3987"/>Thus you see that the doctrine he now advocates, if proclaimed at the beginning of the <rs>Government</rs>, would hare established slavery every where throughout the <rs>American</rs> continent, and are you willing, now that we have the majority section, to exercise a power which we never would have submitted to when we were in the minority?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4013"/>And I have not supposed, and do not now suppose, that there is any conflict whatever between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4014"/>But the <rs>Judge</rs> will have it that if we do not confess that there is a sort of inequality between the <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs> races, which justifies us in making them slaves, we must, then, insist that there is a degree of equality that requires us to make them our wives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4015"/>Now, I have all the while taken a broad distinction in regard to that matter ; and that is all there is in these different speeches which he arrays here, and the entire reading of either of the speeches will show that that distinction was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4016"/>Perhaps by taking <num value="2">two</num> parts of the same speech, he could have got up as much of a conflict as the <num value="1">one</num> he has found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4017"/>I have all the while maintained, that in so far as it should be insisted that there was an equality between the <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs> races that should produce a perfect social and political equality, it was an impossibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4018"/>This you have seen in my printed speeches, and with it I have said, that in their right to <quote>life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,</quote> as proclaimed in that old Declaration, the inferior races are our equals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4019"/>And these declarations I have constantly made in reference to the abstract moral question, to contemplate and consider when we are legislating about any new country which is not already cursed with the actual presence of the evil-slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4020"/>I have never manifested any impatience with the necessities that spring from the actual presence of black people amongst us, and the actual existence of slavery amongst us where it does already exist ; but I have insisted that, in legislating for new countries, where it does not exist, there is no just rule other than that of moral and abstract right!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4021"/>With reference to those new countries, those maxims as to the right of a people to <quote>life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,</quote> were the just rules to be constantly referred to. There is no misunderstanding this, except by men interested to misunderstand it. I take it that I have to address an intelligent and reading community, who will peruse what I say, weigh it, and then judge whether I advance improper or unsound views, or whether I advance hypocritical, and deceptive, and contrary views in different portions of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4022"/>I believe myself to be guilty of no such thing as the latter, though, of course, I cannot claim that I am entirely free from all error in the opinions I advance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4023"/>The <rs>Judge</rs> has also detained us awhile in regard to the distinction between his party and our party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4024"/>His he assumes to be a national party-ours a sectional <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4025"/>He does this in asking the question whether this country has any interest in the maintenance of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4026"/>He assumes that our party is altogether sectional ---that the party to which he adheres is national; and the argument is, that no party can be a rightful party-can be based upon rightful principles-unless it can announce its principles every where.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4027"/>I presume that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00179.01882" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> could not go into <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> and announce the doctrine of our national Democracy; he could not denounce the doctrine of kings and emperors and monarchies in <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>; and it may be true of this country, that in some places we may not be able to proclaim a doctrine as clearly true as the truth of Democracy, because there is a section so directly opposed to it that they will not tolerate us in doing so. Is it the true test of the soundness of a doctrine, that in some places people won't let you proclaim it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4028"/>Is that the way to test the truth of any doctrine?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4029"/>Why, I understood that at <num value="1">one</num> time the people of <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName> would not let <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00179.01883" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> preach a certain favorite doctrine of his. I commend to his consideration the question, whether he takes that as a test of the unsoundness of what he wanted to preach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4030"/><pb id="p.180" n="180"/> </p> 
<p>There is another thing to which I wish to ask attention for a little while on this occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4031"/>What has always been the evidence brought forward to prove that the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> is a sectional party?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4032"/>The main <num value="1">one</num> was that in the <rs>Southern</rs> portion of the <rs>Union</rs> the people did not let the <name>Republicans</name> proclaim their doctrines amongst them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4033"/>That has been the main evidence brought forward &mdash; that they had no supporters, or substantially none, in the slave <rs>Stales</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4034"/>The South have not taken hold of our principles as we announce them; nor does <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00180.01884" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> now grapple with those principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4035"/>We have a Republican State Platform, laid down in <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName>; in <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> last, stating our position all the way through the questions before the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4036"/>We are now far advanced in this canvass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4037"/><persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00180.01885" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> and I have made perhaps <num value="40">forty</num> speeches apiece, and we have now for the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> time met face to face in debate, and up to this day I have not found either <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00180.01886" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> or any friend of his taking hold of the <rs>Republican</rs> platform or laying his finger upon anything in it that is wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4038"/>I ask you all to recollect that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4039"/><persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00180.01887" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> turns away from the platform of principles to the fact that he can find people somewhere who the not allow us to announce those principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4040"/>If be had great confidence that our principles were wrong, he would the hold of them and demonstrate them to be wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4041"/>But he does not do so. The only evidence he has of their being wrong is in the fact that there are people who wont allow us to preach them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4042"/>I ask again is that the way to test the soundness of a doctrine? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4043"/>I ask his attention also to the fact that by the rule of nationality he is himself fast becoming sectional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4044"/>I ask his attention to the fact that his speeches would not go as current now south of the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio river</placeName> as they have formerly gone there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4045"/>I ask his attention to the fact that he felicitates himself to-day that all the <name>Democrats</name> of the free States are agreeing with him, while he omits to tell us that the <name>Democrats</name> of any slave State agree with him. If he has not thought of this, I commend to his consideration the evidence in his own declaration, on this day, of his becoming sectional too. I see it rapidly approaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4046"/>Whatever may be the result of this ephemeral contest between <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00180.01888" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> and myself, I see the day rapidly approaching when his pill of sectionalism, which he has been thrusting down the throats of Republicans for years past, will be crowded down his own throat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4047"/>How in regard to what <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00180.01889" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> said (in the beginning of his speech) about the <name>Compromise</name> of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, containing the principle of the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill, although I have often presented my views upon that subject, yet as I have not done so in this canvass, I will, if you please, detain you a little with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4048"/>I have always maintained, so far as I was able, that there was nothing of the principle of the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill in the <name>Compromise</name> of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> at all-nothing whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4049"/>Where can you find the principle of the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill in that Compromise?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4050"/>If any where, in the <num value="2">two</num> piece of the <name>Compromise</name> organizing the <rs>Territories</rs> of <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName> and <placeName reg="Utah" key="tgn,7007827">Utah</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4051"/>It was expressly provided in these <num value="2">two</num> acts, that, when they came to be admitted into the <rs>Union</rs>, they should be admitted with or without slavery, as they should choose, by their own Constitutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4052"/>Nothing was said in either of those acts as to what was to be done in relation to slavery during the territorial existence of those Territories, while <persName n="Clay,,Henry,,," id="n0024.0012.00180.01890" reg="default:Clay,Henry,,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName> constantly made the declaration (<persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00180.01891" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> recognizing him as a leader) that, in his opinion, the old <placeName key="tgn,7005560" n="1.000 10" reg="Mexico,North and Central America">Mexican</placeName> laws would control that question during the territorial existence, and that these old <placeName key="tgn,7005560" n="1.000 10" reg="Mexico,North and Central America">Mexican</placeName> laws excluded slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4053"/>How can that be used as a principle for declaring that during the territorial existence as well as at the time of framing the <rs>Constitution</rs>, the people, if you please, might have slaves if they wanted them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4054"/>I am not discussing the question whether It is right or wrong ; but bow are the <orgName n="New Mexican" type="newspaper">New Mexican</orgName> and <placeName key="tgn,7007827" n="1.000 4" reg="utah">Utah</placeName> laws patterns for the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4055"/>I maintain that the organization of <placeName key="tgn,7007827" n="1.000 4" reg="utah">Utah</placeName> and <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName> <hi rend="italics">did not</hi> establish a <rs n="General Principle" type="misc">general principle</rs> at all. It had no feature of establishing a <rs n="General Principle" type="misc">general principle</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4056"/>The acts to which I have referred were a part of a general system of Compromises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4057"/>They did not lay down what was proposed as a regular policy for the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> ; only an agreement in this particular case to do in that way, because other things were done that were to be a compensation for it. They were allowed <pb id="p.181" n="181"/> to come in in that shape, because in another way it was paid for-considering that as a part of that system of measures called the <name>Compromise</name> of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, which finally included half a dozen acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4058"/>It included the admission of <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> as a free State, which was kept out of the <rs>Union</rs> for half a year because it had formed a free Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4059"/>It included the settlement of the boundary of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, which had been undefined before, which was in itself a slavery question : for, if you pushed the line farther west, you made <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> larger, and made more slave Territory ; while, if you drew the line toward the east, you narrowed the boundary and diminished the domain of slavery, and by so much increased free Territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4060"/>It included the abolition of the slave-trade in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4061"/>It included the passage of a new Fugitive Slave law. All these things were put together, and though passed in separate acts, were nevertheless in legislation (as the speeches at the time will show), made to depend upon each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4062"/>Each got votes, with the understanding that the other measures were to pass, and by this system of Compromise, in that series of measures, those <num value="2">two</num> bills --the <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName> and <placeName reg="Utah" key="tgn,7007827">Utah</placeName> bills &mdash; were passed; and I say for that reason they could not be taken as models, framed upon their own intrinsic principle, for all future Territories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4063"/>And I have the evidence of this in the fact that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00181.01892" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, a year afterward, or more than a year afterward, perhaps, when he <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> introduced bills for the purpose of framing new Territories, did not attempt to follow these bills of <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName> and <placeName reg="Utah" key="tgn,7007827">Utah</placeName> ; and even when he introduced this <placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> bill, I think you will discover that he did not exactly follow them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4064"/>But I do not wish to dwell at great length upon this branch of the discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4065"/>My own opinion is, that a thorough investigation will show most plainly that the <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName> and <placeName reg="Utah" key="tgn,7007827">Utah</placeName> bills were part of a system of Compromise, and not designed as patterns for future territorial legislation ; and that this <placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> bill did not follow them as a pattern at all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4066"/>The <rs type="role2">Judge</rs> tells, in proceeding, that he is opposed to making any odious distinctions between free and slave States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4067"/>I am altogether unaware that the <name>Republicans</name> are in favor of making any odious distinctions between the free and slave States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4068"/>But there still is a difference I think, between <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00181.01893" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> and the <name>Republicans</name> in this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4069"/>I suppose that the real difference between <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00181.01894" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> and his friends, and the <name>Republicans</name> on the contrary, is, that the <rs>Judge</rs> is not in favor of making any difference between slavery and liberty &mdash; that he is in favor of eradicating, of pressing out of view, the questions of preference in this country for free or slave institutions; and consequently every sentiment he utters discards the idea that there is any wrong in slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4070"/>Every thing that emanates from him or his coadjutors in their course of policy, carefully excludes the thought that there is any thing wrong in slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4071"/>All their arguments, if you will consider them, will be seen to exclude the thought that there is any thing whatever wrong in slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4072"/>If you will take the <rs>Judge</rs>'s speeches, and select the short and pointed sentences expressed by him &mdash; as his declaration that he <quote>don't care whether slavery is voted up or down</quote> --you will see at once that this is perfectly logical, if you do not admit that slavery is wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4073"/>If you do admit that it is wrong, <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00181.01895" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> cannot logically say he don't care whether a wrong is voted up or voted down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4074"/><persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00181.01896" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> declares that if any community want slavery they have a right to have it. He can say that logically, if he says that there is no wrong in slavery ; but if you admit that there is a wrong in it, he cannot logically say that any body has a right to do wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4075"/>He insists that, upon the score of equality, the owners of slaves and owners of property &mdash; of horses and every other sort of property &mdash; should be alike and hold them alike in a new Territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4076"/>That is perfectly logical, if the <num value="2">two</num> species of property are alike and are equally founded in right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4077"/>But if you admit that <num value="1">one</num> of them is wrong, you cannot institute any equality between right and wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4078"/>And from this difference of sentiment &mdash; the belief on the part of <num value="1">one</num> that the institution is wrong, and a policy springing from that belief which looks to the arrest of the enlargement of that wrong; and this other sentiment, that it is no wrong, and a policy sprung from that sentiment which will tolerate no idea of preventing that wrong from growing larger, and looks to there never being an end of it through all the existence of things,--arises the real difference <pb id="p.182" n="182"/> between <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00182.01897" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> and his friends on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, and the <name>Republicans</name> on the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4079"/>Now, I confess myself as belonging to that class in the country who contemplate slavery as a moral, social and political evil, having due regard for its actual existence amongst us and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way, and to all the <name>Constitutional</name> obligations which have been thrown about it; but, nevertheless, desire a policy that looks to the prevention of it as a wrong, and looks hopefully to the time when as a wrong it may come to an end. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4081"/>What evidence <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00182.01899" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> has upon this subject I know not, inasmuch as he never favors us with any. I have said upon a former occasion, and I do not choose to suppress it now, that I have no objection to the division in the <rs>Judge</rs>'s party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4082"/>He got it up himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4083"/>It was all his and their work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4084"/>He had, I think, a great deal more to do with the steps that led to the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> than <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0012.00182.01900" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:8"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> had ; though at last, when they reached it, they quarreled over it, and their friends divided upon it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4085"/>Dont you remember how <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> ago the opponents of the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> were divided between <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n0024.0012.00182.01903" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName> and <persName n="Fillmore,,,,," id="n0024.0012.00182.01904" reg="mostcommon:Fillmore,Millard,,,:1"><surname>Fillmore</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4086"/>I guess you do. Any Democrat who remembers that division, will remember also that he was at the time very glad of it, and then he will be able to see all there is between the <rs>National Democrats</rs> and the <name>Republicans</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4087"/>What we now think of the <num value="2">two</num> divisions of Democrats, you then thought of the <name>Fremont</name> and <name>Fillmore</name> divisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4088"/>That is all there is of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4089"/>But, if the <rs>Judge</rs> continues to put forward the declaration that there is an unholy and unnatural alliance between the <rs>Republican</rs> and the <rs>National Democrats</rs>, I now want to enter my protest against receiving him as an entirely competent witness upon that subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4159"/>And he said, substantially, that <quote>whenever a free people should give up in absolute submission to any department of government, retaining for themselves no appeal from it, their liberties were gone.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4160"/>I have asked his attention to the fact that the <rs>Cincinnati</rs> platform, upon which he says he stands, disregards a time-honored decision of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>, in denying the power of Congress to establish a <orgName n="National Bank" type="bank">National Bank</orgName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4162"/>So far in this controversy I can get no answer at all from <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00185.01965" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> upon these subjects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4164"/>Now, in this very devoted adherence to this decision, in opposition to all the great political leaders whom he has recognized as leaders-in opposition to his former self and history, there is something very marked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4165"/>And the manner in which he adheres to it &mdash; not as being right upon the merits, as he conceives (because he did not discuss that at all), but as being absolutely obligatory upon every <num value="1">one</num> simply because of the source from whence it comes &mdash; as that which no man can gainsay, whatever it may be-this is another marked feature of his adherence to that decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4166"/>It marks it in this respect, that it commits him to the next decision, whenever it comes, as being as obligatory as this <num value="1">one</num>, since he does not investigate it, and wont inquire whether this opinion is right or wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4167"/>So ho takes the next <num value="1">one</num> without inquiring whether it is right or wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4168"/>He teaches men this doctrine, and in so doing prepares the public mind to take the next decision when it comes, without any inquiry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4169"/>In this I think I argue fairly (without questioning motives at all), that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00185.01966" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> is most ingeniously and powerfully preparing the public mind to take that decision when it comes; and not only so, but he is doing it in various other ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4172"/>I repeat again, for I wish no <pb id="p.186" n="186"/> misunderstanding, that I do not charge that he means it so; but I call upon your minds to inquire, if you were going to get the best instrument you could, and then set it to work in the most ingenious way, to prepare the public mind for this movement, operating in the free States, where there is now an abhorrence of the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, could you find an instrument so capable of doing it as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00186.01967" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4178"/>Among the interrogatories that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00186.01970" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> propounded to me at <placeName key="tgn,2027931" n="1.000 13" reg="freeport, stephenson, illinois">Freeport</placeName>, there was <num value="1">one</num> in about this language : <quote>Are you opposed to the acquisition of any further territory to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, unless slavery shall <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> be prohibited therein?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4179"/>I answered as I thought, in this way, that I am not generally opposed to the acquisition of additional territory, and that I would support a proposition for the acquisition of additional territory, according as my supporting it was or was not calculated to aggravate this slavery question amongst us. I then proposed to <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00186.01971" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> another interrogatory, which was correlative to that <quote>Are you in favor of acquiring additional territory in disregard of how it may affect us upon the slavery question?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4180"/><persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00186.01972" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> answered, that is, in his own way he answered it. I believe that, although he took a good many words to answer it, it was a little more fully answered than any other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4181"/>The substance of his answer was, that this country would continue to expand &mdash; that it would need additional territory &mdash; that it was as absurd to suppose that we could continue upon our present territory, enlarging in population as we are, as it would be to hoop a boy <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> of age, and expect him to grow to man's size without bursting the hoops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4182"/>I believe it was something like that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4183"/>Consequently he was in favor of the acquisition of further territory, as fast as we might need it, in disregard of how it might affect the slavery question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4184"/>I do not say this as giving his exact language, but he said so substantially, and he would leave the question of slavery where the territory was acquired, to be settled by the people of the acquired territory. [ <quote>That's the doctrine.</quote> ] Maybe it is ; let us consider that for a while.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4185"/>This will probably, in the run of things, become <num value="1">one</num> of the concrete manifestations of this slavery question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4186"/>If <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00186.01973" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s policy upon this question succeeds and gets fairly settled down, until all opposition is crushed out, the next thing will be a grab for the territory of poor <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, an invasion of the rich lands of <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName>, then the adjoining islands will follow, each <num value="1">one</num> of which promises additional slave Gelds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4187"/>And this question is to be left to the people of those countries for settlement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4188"/>When we shall get <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, I dont know whether the <rs>Judge</rs> will be in favor of the <rs>Mexican</rs> people that we get with it settling that question for themselves and all others; because we know the <rs>Judge</rs> has a great horror for <pb id="p.187" n="187"/> mongrels, and I understand that the people of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> are most decidedly a race of mongrels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4189"/>I understand that there is not more than <num value="1">one</num> person there out of <num value="8">eight</num> who is pure white, and I suppose from the <rs>Judge</rs>'s previous declaration that when we get <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> or any considerable portion of it, that he will be in favor of these mongrels settling the question, which would bring him somewhat into collision with his horror of an inferior race. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4190"/>It is to be remembered, though, that this power of acquiring additional territory is a power confided to the <rs>President</rs> and <orgName n="United States Senate" type="senate">Senate of the United States</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4191"/>It is a power not under the control of the representatives of the people any further than they, the <rs>President</rs> and the <name>Senate</name>, can be considered the representatives of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4192"/>Let me illustrate that by a case we have in our history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4193"/>When we acquired the territory from <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> in the <rs>Mexican</rs> war, the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> composed of the immediate representatives of the people, all the time insisted that the territory thus to be acquired should be brought in upon condition that slavery should be forever prohibited therein, upon the terms and in the language that slavery had been prohibited from coming into this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4194"/>That was insisted upon constantly, and never failed to call forth an assurance that any territory thus acquired should have that prohibition in it, so far as the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> was concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4195"/>But at last the <rs>President</rs> and Senate acquired the territory without asking the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> any thing about it, and took it without that prohibition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4196"/>They have the power of acquiring territory without the immediate representatives of the people being called upon to say any thing about it, and thus furnishing a very apt and powerful means of bringing new territory into the <rs>Union</rs>, and when it is once brought into the country, involving us anew in this slavery agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4197"/>It is, therefore, as I think, a very important question for the consideration of the <rs>American</rs> people, whether the policy of bringing in additional territory, without considering at all how it will operate upon the safety of the <rs>Union</rs> in reference to this <num value="1">one</num> great disturbing element in our national politics, shall be adopted as the policy of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4198"/>You will bear in mind that it is to be acquired, according to the <rs>Judge</rs>'s view, as fast as it is needed, and the indefinite part of this proposition is that we have only <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00187.01974" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> and his class of men to decide how fast it is needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4199"/>We have no clear and certain way of determining or demonstrating how fast territory is needed by the necessities of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4200"/>Whoever wants to go out fillibustering, then thinks that more territory is needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4201"/>Whoever wants wider slave fields, feels sure that some additional territory is needed as slave territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4202"/>Then it is as easy to show the necessity of additional slave territory as it is to assert any thing that is incapable of absolute demonstration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4203"/>Whatever motive a man or a set of men may have for making annexation of property or territory, it is very easy to assert, but much less easy to disprove, that it is necessary for the wants of the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4204"/>And now it only remains for me to say that I think it is a very grave question for the people of this Union to consider whether, in view of the fact that this slavery question has been the only <num value="1">one</num> that has ever endangered our Republican institutions &mdash; the only <num value="1">one</num> that has ever threatened or menaced a dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>---that has ever disturbed us in such a way as to make us fear for the perpetuity of our liberty &mdash; in view of these facts, I think it is an exceedingly interesting and important question for this people to consider, whether we shall engage in the policy of acquiring additional territory, discarding altogether from our consideration, while obtaining new territory, the question how it may affect us in regard to this the only endangering element to our liberties and national greatness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4205"/>The <rs>Judge</rs>'s view has been expressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4206"/>I, in my answer to his question, have expressed mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4207"/>I think it will become an important and practice question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4208"/>Our views are before the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4209"/>I am willing and anxious that they should consider them fully &mdash; that they should turn it about and consider the importance of the question, and arrive at a just, conclusion as to whether it is or is not wise in the people of this Union, in the acquisition of new territory, to consider whether it will add to the disturbance that is existing amongst us &mdash; whether it will add to the <num value="1">one</num> only danger that has ever <pb id="p.188" n="188"/> threatened the perpetuity of the <rs>Union</rs> or our own liberties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4210"/>I think it is extremely important that they shall decide, and rightly decide, that question before entering upon that policy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4211"/>And now, my friends, having said the little I wish to say upon this head, whether I have occupied the whole of the remnant of my time or not, I believe I could not enter upon any new topics so as to treat it fully without transcending my time, which I would not for a moment think of doing, I give way to <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0012.00188.01975" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>.</p></div2>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4311"/>In the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num> of these joint discussions between <persName n="Douglas,Senator,,,," id="n0024.0013.00192.02015" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> and myself, <persName n="Douglas,Senator,,,," id="n0024.0013.00192.02016" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, without alluding at all to these platforms, or any <num value="1">one</num> of them, of which I have spoken, attempted to hold me responsible for a set of resolutions passed long before the meeting of either <num value="1">one</num> of these Conventions of which I have spoken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4312"/>And as a ground for holding me responsible for these resolutions, he assumed that they had been passed at a <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State Convention</orgName> of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, and that I took part in that Convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4313"/>It was discovered afterward that this was erroneous, that the resolutions which he endeavored to hold me responsible for, had not been passed by any <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State Convention</orgName> any where-had not been passed at <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName>, where he supposed they had, or assumed that they had, and that they had been passed in no Convention in which I had taken part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4314"/>The <rs>Judge</rs>, nevertheless, was not willing to give up the point that he was endeavoring to make upon me, and he therefore thought to still hold me to the point that he was endeavoring to make, by showing that the resolutions that he read, had been passed at a local <pb id="p.193" n="193"/> Convention in the northern part of the <rs>State</rs>, although it was not a local Convention that embraced my residence at all, nor <num value="1">one</num> that reached, as I suppose, nearer than <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> or <measure n="200miles" type="distance">two hundred miles</measure> of where I was when it met, nor <num value="1">one</num> in which I took any part at all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4316"/>meeting, I insisted to the <rs>Judge</rs> that I was in no way rightfully held responsible for the proceedings of this local meeting or Convention in which I had taken no part, and in which I was in no way embraced; but I insisted to him that if he thought I was responsible for every man or every set of men every where, who happen to be my friends, the rule ought to work both ways, and he ought to be responsible for the acts and resolutions of all men or sets of men who were or are now his supporters and friends, and gave him a pretty long string of resolutions, passed by men who are now his friends, and announcing doctrines for which he does not desire to be held responsible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4317"/>This still does not satisfy <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0013.00193.02017" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4318"/>He still adheres to his proposition, that I am responsible for what some of my friends in different parts of the <rs>State</rs> have done; but that he is not responsible for what his have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4319"/>At least, so I understand him. But in addition to that, the <rs>Judge</rs>, at our meeting in <placeName key="tgn,2036402" n="1.000 1" reg="galesburg, neosho, kansas">Galesburgh</placeName>, last week, undertakes to establish that I am guilty of a species of double-dealing with the public &mdash; that I make speeches of a certain sort in the north, among the <name>Abolitionists</name>, which I would not make in the south, and that I make speeches of a certain sort in the south which I would not make in the north.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4320"/>I apprehend, in the course I have marked out for myself, that I shall not have to dwell at very great length upon this subject. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4321"/>As this was done in the <rs>Judge</rs>'s opening speech at <placeName key="tgn,2036402" n="1.000 1" reg="galesburg, neosho, kansas">Galesburgh</placeName>, I had an opportunity, as I had the middle speech then, of saying something in answer to it.

I have not time now to dwell on this as long as I would like, and wish only now to requote that portion of my speech at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, which the <rs>Judge</rs> quoted, and then make some comments upon it. This he quotes from me as being delivered at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, and I believe correctly: <quote>I will say, then, that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs> races &mdash; that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people ; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs> races which will ever forbid the <num value="2">two</num> races living together on terms of social and political equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4322"/>And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together, there must be the position of superior and inferior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4323"/>I am as much as any other man in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4324"/>This, I believe, is the entire quotation from the <rs>Charleston</rs> speech, as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0013.00193.02018" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> made it, His comments are as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4326"/>And down south with the old line Whigs, with the <name>Kentuckians</name>, the <name>Virginians</name>, and the <name>Tennesseeans</name>, he tells you that there is a physical difference between the races, making the <pb id="p.194" n="194"/> <num value="1">one</num> superior, the other inferior, and he is in favor of maintaining the superiority of the white race over the negro.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4327"/>Those are the <rs>Judge</rs>'s comments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4328"/>Now I wish to show you, that a month, or, only lacking <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> of a month, before I made the speech at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, which the <rs>Judge</rs> quotes from, he had himself heard me say substantially the same thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4329"/>It was in our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meeting, at <placeName reg="Ottawa, La Salle, Illinois" key="tgn,2029529">Ottawa</placeName> &mdash; and I will say a word about where it was, and the atmosphere it was in, after awhile &mdash; but at our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meeting, at <placeName reg="Ottawa, La Salle, Illinois" key="tgn,2029529">Ottawa</placeName>, I read an extract from an old speech of mine, made nearly <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> ago, not merely to show my sentiments, but to show that my sentiments mere long entertained and openly expressed ; in which extract I expressly declared that my own feelings would not admit a social and political equality between the <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs> races, and that even if my own feelings would admit of it, I still knew that the public sentiment of the country would not, and that such a thing was an utter impossibility, or substantially that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4330"/>That extract from my old speech, the reporters, by some sort of accident, passed over, and it was not reported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4331"/>I lay no blame upon any body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4332"/>I suppose they thought that I would hand it over to them, and dropped reporting while I was reading it, but afterward went away without getting it from me. At the end of that quotation from my old speech, which I read at <placeName reg="Ottawa, La Salle, Illinois" key="tgn,2029529">Ottawa</placeName>, I made the comments which were reported at that time, and which I will now road, and ask you to notice how very nearly they are the same as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0013.00194.02021" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> says were delivered by we, down in <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4333"/>After reading I added these words: <quote>Now, gentlemen, I don't want to read at any great length, but this is the true complexion of all I have ever said in regard to the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> or the black race, and this is the whole of it; any thing that argues me into his idea of perfect social and political equality with the negro, is but a specious and fantastical arrangement of words by which a man can prove a horse-chestnut to be a chestnut horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4334"/>I will say here, while upon this subject that I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution in the <name>States</name> where it exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4335"/>I believe I have no right to do so. I have no inclination to do so. I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs> races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4336"/>There is a physical difference between the <num value="2">two</num>, which, in my judgment, will probably forever forbid their living together on the footing of perfect equality, and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference, I, as well as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0013.00194.02022" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, am in favor of the race to which I belong having the superior position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4337"/>I have never said any thing to the contrary, but I hold that, notwithstanding all this, there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the rights enumerated in the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>-the right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4338"/>I hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man. I agree with <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0013.00194.02023" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> that he is not my equal in many respects, certainly not in color-perhaps not in intellectual and moral endowments; but, in the right to eat the bread without the leave of any body else which his own hand earns, he is my equal and the equal of <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0013.00194.02024" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, and the equal of every other man.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4339"/></p> 
<p>I have chiefly introduced this for the purpose of meeting the <rs>Judge</rs>'s charge that the quotation he took from my <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> speech was what I would say down south among the <name>Kentuckians</name>, the <name>Virginians</name>, etc., but would not say in the regions in which was supposed to be more of the <name>Abolition</name> element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4340"/>I now make this comment : That speech from which I have now rend the quotation, and which is there given correctly, perhaps too much so for good taste, was made away up north in the <rs>Abolition District</rs> of this State <hi rend="italics">par excellence</hi>--in the <rs>Lovejoy District</rs> &mdash; in the personal presence of <persName n="Lovejoy,,,,," id="n0024.0013.00194.02025" reg="mostcommon:Lovejoy,nomatch:0"><surname>Lovejoy</surname></persName>, for he was on the stand with us when I made it. It had been made and put in print in that region only <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> less than a month before the speech made at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, the like of which <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0013.00194.02026" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> thinks I would not make where there was any Abolition element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4341"/>I only refer to this matter to say that I am altogether unconscious of having attempted any double-dealing any where --that upon <num value="1">one</num> occasion I may say <num value="1">one</num> thing and leave other things unsaid, and <hi rend="italics">vice versa</hi>; but that I have said any thing on <num value="1">one</num> occasion that is inconsistent with what <pb id="p.195" n="195"/> I have said elsewhere, I deny-at least I deny it so far as the intention is concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4342"/>I find that I have devoted to this topic a larger portion of my time than I had intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4343"/>I wished to show, but I will pass it upon this occasion, that in the sentiment I have occasionally advanced upon the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, I am entirely borne out by the sentiments advanced by our old Whig leader, <persName n="Clay,,Henry,,," id="n0024.0013.00195.02027" reg="default:Clay,Henry,,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName>, and I have the book here to show it from; but because I have already occupied more time than I intended to do on that topic, I pass over it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4344"/>At <placeName key="tgn,2036402" n="1.000 1" reg="galesburg, neosho, kansas">Galesburgh</placeName>, I tried to show that by the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision, pushed to its legitimate consequences, slavery would be established in all the <name>States</name> as well as in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4345"/>I did this because, upon a former occasion, I had asked <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0013.00195.02028" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> whether, if the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> should make a decision declaring that the <name>States</name> had not the power to exclude slavery from their limits, he would adopt and follow that decision as a rule of political action ; and because he had not directly answered that question, but had merely contented himself with sneering at it, I again introduced it, and tried to show that the conclusion that I stated followed inevitably and logically from the proposition already decided by the court.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4346"/><persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0013.00195.02029" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> had the privilege of replying to me at <placeName key="tgn,2036402" n="1.000 1" reg="galesburg, neosho, kansas">Galesburgh</placeName>, and again he gave me no direct answer as to whether he would or would not sustain such a decision if made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4347"/>I give him this <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> chance to say yes or no. He is not obliged to do either-probably he will not do either-but I give him the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> chance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4348"/>I tried to show then that this result-this conclusion inevitably followed from the point already decided by the court.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4349"/>The <rs>Judge</rs>, in his reply, again sneers at the thought of the court making any such decision, and in the course of his remarks upon this subject, uses the language which I will now read, Speaking of me the <rs>Judge</rs> says: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4351"/>He knows that every <num value="1">one</num> of them in their opinions held the reverse.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4352"/></p> 
<p>I especially introduce this subject again for the purpose of saying that I have the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision here, and I will thank <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0013.00195.02031" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> to lay his finger upon the place in the entire opinions of the court where any <num value="1">one</num> of them <quote>says the contrary.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4353"/>It is very hard to affirm a negative with entire confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4354"/>I say, however, that I have examined that decision with a good deal of care, as a lawyer examines a decision, and so far as I have been able to do so, the court has no where in its opinions said that the <name>States</name> have the power to exclude slavery, nor have they used other language substantially that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4355"/>I also say, so far as I can find, not <num value="1">one</num> of the concurring Judges has said that the <name>States</name> can exclude slavery, nor said any thing that was substantially that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4356"/>The nearest approach that any <num value="1">one</num> of them has made to it, so far as I can find, was by <persName n="Nelson,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0013.00195.02032" reg="mostcommon:Nelson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Nelson</surname></persName>, and the approach he made to it, was exactly, in substance, the <rs>Nebraska Bill</rs> &mdash; that the <name>States</name> had the exclusive power over the question of slavery, so far as they are not limited by the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

When I met him at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> after that, although I think that I should not have noticed the subject if he had not said he would hold me responsible for it, I spread out before him the statements of the evidence that <persName n="Trumbull,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0013.00196.02046" reg="mostcommon:Trumbull,Lyman,,,:7"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Trumbull</surname></persName> had used, and I asked <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0013.00196.02047" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, piece by piece, to put his finger upon <num value="1">one</num> piece of all that evidence that he would say was a forgery!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4369"/>I dared to suggest to him that he had expressly promised in <num value="1">one</num> of his public speeches to investigate that matter, and I dared to suggest to him that there was an implied promise that when he investigated it he would make known the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4370"/>I dared to suggest to the <rs>Judge</rs> that he could not expect to be quite clear of suspicion of that fraud, for since the time that promise was made he had been with those friends, and had not kept his promise in regard to the investigation and the report upon it. I am not a very daring on, but I dared that much, <rs type="role2">Judge</rs>, and I am not much scared about it yet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4371"/>It sets me to thinking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4372"/>I was aware, when it was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> agreed that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0013.00196.02053" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> and I were to have these <num value="7">seven</num> joint discussions, that they were the successive acts of a drama-perhaps I should say, to be enacted not merely in the face of audiences like this, but in the face of the nation, and to some extent, by my relation to him, and not from any thing in myself, in the face of the world; and I am anxious that they should be conducted with dignity and in the good temper which would be befitting the vast audience before which it was conducted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4373"/>But when <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0013.00196.02054" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> got home from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and made his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> speech in <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>, the evening afterward I made some sort of a reply to it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4374"/>Now, I understand that this is an imputation upon my veracity and my candor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4375"/>I do not know what the <rs>Judge</rs> understood by it; but in our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> discussion at <placeName reg="Ottawa, La Salle, Illinois" key="tgn,2029529">Ottawa</placeName>, he led off by charging a bargain, somewhat corrupt in its character, upon <persName n="Trumbull,,,,," id="n0024.0013.00196.02055" reg="mostcommon:Trumbull,Lyman,,,:7"><surname>Trumbull</surname></persName> and myself &mdash; that we had entered into a bargain, <num value="1">one</num> of the terms of which was that <persName n="Trumbull,,,,," id="n0024.0013.00196.02056" reg="mostcommon:Trumbull,Lyman,,,:7"><surname>Trumbull</surname></persName> was to abolitionize the old <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>, and I (<persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0024.0013.00196.02057" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>) was to abolitionize the old <orgName n="Whig Party" type="party">Whig party</orgName>--I pretending to be as good an old line Whig as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4377"/>I think it originated with the <rs>Judge</rs>, and when he quits, I probably will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4378"/>But I shall not ask any favors at all. He asks me, or he asks the audience, if I wish to push this matter to the point of personal difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4379"/>I tell him, no. He did not make a mistake, in <num value="1">one</num> of his early speeches, when he called me an <quote>amiable</quote> man, though perhaps he did when he called me an <quote>intelligent</quote> man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4380"/>I again tell him, no!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4381"/>I very much prefer, when this canvass shall be over, however it may result, that we at least part without any bitter recollections of personal difficulties. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4383"/>I say to the <rs>Judge</rs> and this audience now, that I will again state our principles as well as I hastily can in all their enormity, and if the <rs>Judge</rs> hereafter chooses to confine himself to a war upon these principles, he will probably not find me departing from the same course. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4384"/>We have in this nation this element of domestic slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4385"/>It is a matter of absolute certainty that it is a disturbing element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4386"/>It is the opinion of all the great men who have expressed an opinion upon it, that it is a dangerous element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4387"/>We keep up a controversy in regard to it. That controversy necessarily springs from difference of opinion, and if we can learn exactly &mdash; can reduce to the lowest elements-what that difference of opinion is, we perhaps shall be better prepared for discussing the different systems of policy that we would propose in regard to that disturbing element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4388"/>I suggest that the difference of opinion, reduced to its lowest terms, is no other than the difference between the men who think slavery a wrong and those who do not think it wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4389"/>The <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> think it wrong-we think it is a moral, a social and a political wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4390"/>We think it as a wrong not confining itself merely to the persons or the <name>States</name> where it exists, but that it is a wrong in its tendency, to say the least, that extends itself to the existence of the whole nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4391"/>Because we think it wrong, we propose a course of policy that shall deal with it as a wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4392"/>We deal with it as with any other wrong, in so far as we can prevent its growing any larger, and so deal with it that in the run of time there may he some promise of an end to it. We have a due regard to the actual presence of it amongst us and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way, and all the <name>Constitutional</name> obligations thrown about it. I suppose that in reference both to its actual existence in the nation, and to our Constitutional obligations, we have no right at all to disturb it in the <name>States</name> where it exists, and we profess that we have no more inclination to disturb it than we have the right to do it. We go further than that; we dont propose to disturb it where, in <num value="1">one</num> instance, we think the <rs>Constitution</rs> would permit us. We think the <rs>Constitution</rs> would permit us to disturb it in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4393"/>Still we do not propose to do that, unless it should be in terms which I dont suppose the nation is very likely soon to agree to --the terms of making the emancipation gradual and compensating the unwilling owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4394"/>Where we suppose we have the <name>Constitutional</name> right, we restrain ourselves in reference to the actual existence of the institution and the difficulties thrown about it. We also oppose it as an evil so far as it seeks to spread itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4395"/>We insist on the policy that shall restrict it to its present limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4396"/>We don't suppose that in doing this we violate any thing due to the actual presence of the institution, or any thing due to the <name>Constitutional</name> guaranties thrown around it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4397"/>We oppose the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision in a certain way, upon which I ought perhaps to address you a few words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4398"/>We do not propose that when <persName n="Scott,,Dred,,," id="n0024.0013.00197.02060" reg="default:Scott,Dred,,,"><foreName>Dred</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> has been decided to be a slave by the court, we, as a mob, will decide him to be free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4399"/>We do not propose that, when any other <num value="1">one</num>, or <num value="1000">one thousand</num>, shall be decided by that court to be slaves, we will in any violent way disturb the rights of property thus settled but we nevertheless do oppose that decision as a political rule, which shall be <pb id="p.198" n="198"/> binding on the voter to vote for nobody who thinks it wrong, which shall be binding on the members of Congress or the <rs>President</rs> to favor no measure that does not actually concur with the principles of that decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4400"/>We do not propose to be bound by it as a political rule in that way, because we think it lays the foundation not merely of enlarging and spreading out what we consider an evil, but it lays the foundation for spreading that evil into the <name>States</name> themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4401"/>We propose so resisting it as to have it reversed if we can, and a new judicial rule established upon this subject. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4402"/>I will add this, that if there be any man who does not believe that slavery is wrong in the <num value="3">three</num> aspects which I have mentioned, or in any <num value="1">one</num> of them, that man is misplaced, and ought to leave us. While, on the other hand, if there be any man in the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> who is impatient over the necessity springing from its actual presence, and is impatient of the <name>Constitutional</name> guaranties thrown around it, and would act in disregard of these, he too is misplaced, standing with us. He will find his place somewhere else ; for we have a due regard, so far, as we are capable of understanding them, for all these things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4403"/>This, gentlemen, as well as I can give it, is a plain statement of our principles in all their enormity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4404"/>I will say now that there is a sentiment in the country contrary to me &mdash; a sentiment which holds that slavery is not wrong, and therefore it goes for the policy that does not propose dealing with it as a wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4405"/>That policy is the <rs>Democratic</rs> policy, and that sentiment is the <rs>Democratic</rs> sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4406"/>If there be a doubt in the mind of any <num value="1">one</num> of this vast audience that this is really the central idea of the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>, in relation to this subject, I ask him to bear with me while I state a few things tending, as I think, to prove that proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4407"/>In the first place, the leading man &mdash; I think I may do my friend <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0013.00198.02061" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> the honor of calling him suchadvocating the present Democratic policy, never himself says it is wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4408"/>He has the high distinction, so far as I know, of never having said slavery is either right or wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4409"/>Almost every body else says <num value="1">one</num> or the other, but the <rs>Judge</rs> never does.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4410"/>If there be a man in the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> who thinks it is wrong, and yet clings to that party, I suggest to him in the first place that his leader don't talk as he does, for he never says that it is wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4411"/>In the second place, I suggest to him that if he will examine the policy proposed to be carried forward, he will find that he carefully excludes the idea that there is any thing wrong in it. If you will examine the arguments that are made on it, you will find that every <num value="1">one</num> carefully excludes the idea that there is any thing wrong in slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4412"/>Perhaps that Democrat who says he is as much opposed to slavery as I am, will tell me that I am wrong about this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4413"/>I wish him to examine his own course in regard to this matter a moment, and then see if his opinion will not be changed a little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4414"/>You say it is wrong; but don't you constantly object to any body else saying so?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4415"/>Do you not constantly argue that this is not the right place to oppose it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4416"/>You say it must not be opposed in the free States, because slavery is not here ; it must not be opposed in the slave States, because it is there ; it must not be opposed in politics, because that will make a fuss ; it must not be opposed in the pulpit, because it is not religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4417"/>Then where is the place to oppose it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4418"/>There is no suitable place to oppose it. There is no plan in the country to oppose this evil overspreading the continent, which you say yourself is coming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4421"/>He cannot say that he would as soon see a wrong voted up as voted down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4422"/>When <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0013.00198.02065" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> says that whoever or whatever community wants slaves, they have a right to have them, he is perfectly logical if there is nothing wrong in the institution ; but if you admit <pb id="p.199" n="199"/> that it is wrong, he cannot logically say that any body has a right to do wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4423"/>When he says that slave property and horse and hog property are, alike, to be allowed to go into the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, upon the principles of equality, he is reasoning truly: if there is no difference between them as property; but if the <num value="1">one</num> is property, held rightfully, and the other is wrong, then there is no equality between the right and wrong; so that, turn it in any way you can, in all the arguments sustaining the <rs>Democratic</rs> policy, and in that policy itself, there is a careful, studied exclusion of the idea that there is any thing wrong in slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4424"/>Let us understand this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4425"/>I am not, just here, trying to prove that we are right and they are wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4426"/>I have been stating where we and they stand, and trying to show what is the real difference between us; and I now say that whenever we can get the question distinctly stated---can get all these men who believe that slavery is in some of these respects wrong, to stand and act with us in treating it as a wrong-then, and not till then, I think me will in some way come to an end of this slavery agitation.</p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4454"/>I called his attention to the fact, that at the time alluded to, to wit: the introduction of the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill, it was not possible that such a conspiracy could have been entered into, for the reason that the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> case had never been taken before the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>, and was not taken before it for a year after; and I asked him to take back that charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4469"/>I did not think that I had a right to put idle questions to him, and I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> laid a foundation for my questions by showing that the principles which I wished him either to affirm or deny had been adopted by some portion of his friends, at least as their creed.

In answer to my question whether he indorsed the <rs>Black Republican</rs> principle of <quote>no more slave States,</quote> he answered that he was not pledged against the admission of any more slave States, but that he would be very sorry if he should ever be placed in a position where he would have to vote on the question ; that he would rejoice to know that no more slave States would be admitted into the <rs>Union</rs> ; <quote>but,</quote> he added, <quote>if slavery shall be kept out of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> during the territorial existence of any <num value="1">one</num> given Territory, and then the people shall, having a fair chance and a clear field when they come to adopt the <rs>Constitution</rs>, do such an extraordinary thing as to adopt a slave Constitution, uninfluenced by the actual presence of the institution among them, I see no alternative, if we own the country, but to admit them into the <rs>Union</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4473"/>The point I wish him to answer is this : Suppose Congress should not prohibit slavery in the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>, and it applied for admission with a Constitution recognizing slavery, then how would he vote?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4474"/>His answer at <placeName key="tgn,2027931" n="1.000 13" reg="freeport, stephenson, illinois">Freeport</placeName> does not apply to any territory in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4475"/>I ask you [turning to <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0024.0013.00201.02096" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>], will you vote to admit <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> into the <rs>Union</rs>, with just such a Constitution as her people want, with slavery or without, as they shall determine?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4476"/>He will not answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4477"/>I have put that question to him time and time again, and have not been able to get an answer out of him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4480"/>He will not answer these questions in reference to any territory now in existence ; but says, that if Congress should prohibit slavery in a Territory, and when its people asked for admission as a State, they should adopt slavery as <num value="1">one</num> of their institutions, that he supposes he would have to let it come in. I submit to you whether that answer of his to my question does not justify me in saying that he has a fertile genius in devising language to conceal his thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4481"/>I ask you whether there is an intelligent man in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> who does not believe, that that answer was made for the purpose of concealing what he intended to do.

It would have been quite easy for him to have said, that he would let, the people of a State do just as they pleased, if he desired to convey such an idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4482"/>Why did he not do it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4483"/>He <pb id="p.202" n="202"/> would not answer my question directly, because up north, the <name>Abolition</name> creed declares that there shall be no more slave States, while down south, in <placeName reg="," key="possibilities=12">Adams county</placeName>, in <persName n="Coles,,,,," id="n0024.0013.00202.02100" reg="mostcommon:Coles,nomatch:0"><surname>Coles</surname></persName>, and in <placeName reg="Sangamon, Illinois, United States" key="tgn,1129619">Sangamon</placeName>, he and his friends are afraid to advance that doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4484"/>Therefore, he gives an evasive and equivocal answer, to be construed <num value="1">one</num> way in the south and another way in the north, which, when analyzed, it is apparent is not an answer at all with reference to any territory now in existence. </p>

Now, of what use is his right to go there with his property unless he is protected in the enjoyment of that right after he gets there?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4666"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, is the right of the people of a Territory, the same as a State, to decide for themselves the question whether slavery shall exist within their limits, in the language of <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0013.00209.02161" reg="nearbymention:Buchanan,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> ; and the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> is, that a Constitution shall be submitted to the people of a Territory for its adoption or rejection before their admission as a State under it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4668"/>Thus you find that this little corrupt gang who control the <hi rend="italics">Union</hi> and wish to elect <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0024.0013.00209.02163" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> in preference to me &mdash; because, as they say, of these <num value="2">two</num> heresies which I support-denounce <persName n="Buchanan,President,,,," id="n0024.0013.00209.02164" reg="nearbymention:Buchanan,James,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> when they denounce me, if he stands now by the principles upon which he was elected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4669"/>Will they pretend that he does not now stand by the principles on which he was elected?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4670"/>Do they hold that he has abandoned the <rs>Kansas</rs>-<placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> bill, the <rs>Cincinnati</rs> platform, and his own letter accepting his nomination, all of which declare the right of the people of a Territory, the same as a State, to decide the slavery question for themselves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4671"/>I will not believe that he has betrayed or intends to betray the platform which elected him ; but if he does, I will not follow him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4672"/>If each State will only agree to mind its own business, and let its neighbors alone, there will be peace forever between us. We in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> tried slavery when a Territory, and found it was not good for us in this climate, and with our surroundings, and hence we abolished it. We then adopted a free State Constitution, as me had a right to do. In this State we have declared that a negro shall not be a citizen, and we have also declared that be shall not be a slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4676"/>I do not discuss the morals of the people of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, but let them settle that matter for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4677"/>I hold that the people of the slaveholding States are civilized men as well as ourselves ; that they bear consciences as well as we, and that they are accountable to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and their posterity and not to us. It is for them to decide, therefore, the moral and religions right of the slavery question for themselves within their own limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4678"/>I assert that they had as much right under the <rs>Constitution</rs> to adopt the system of policy which they have as we had to adopt ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4679"/>So it is with every other State in this Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4680"/>Let each State stand firmly by that great Constitutional right, let each State mind its own business and let its neighbors alone, and there will be no trouble on this question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4681"/>If we will stand by that principle, then <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0013.00209.02165" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> will find that this Republic can exist forever divided into free and slave States, as our fathers made it and the people of each State have decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4682"/>Stand by that great principle, and we can go on as we have done, increasing in wealth, in population, in power, and in all the elements of greatness, until me shall be the admiration and and terror of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4683"/>We can go on and enlarge as our population increase, require more room, until we make this continent <num value="1">one</num> ocean-bound republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4684"/>Under that principle the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> can perform that great mission, that destiny, which <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> has marked out for us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4685"/>We have this great mission to perform, and it can only be performed by adhering faithfully to that principle of selfgovernment <pb id="p.210" n="210"/> on which our institutions were all established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4686"/>I repeat that the principle is the right of each State, each Territory, to decide this slavery question for itself, to have slavery or not, as it chooses, and it does not become <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0013.00210.02166" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, or anybody else, to tell the people of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> that they have no consciences, that they are living in a state of iniquity, and that they are cherishing an institution to their bosoms in violation of the law of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4808"/>The principal points in that speech of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0014.00215.02241" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s were : <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, that this Government could not endure permanently divided into free and slave States, as our fathers made it ; that they must all become free or all become slave ; all become <num value="1">one</num> thing or all become the other, otherwise this Union could not continue to exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4809"/>I give you his opinions almost in the identical language he used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4810"/>His <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> proposition was a crusade against the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName> because of the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision ; urging as an especial reason for his opposition to that decision that it deprived the negroes of the rights and benefits of that clause in the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> which guaranties to the citizens of each State all the rights, privileges, and immunities of the citizens of the several States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4811"/>On the <dateStruct value="-07-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> I returned home, and delivered a speech to the people of <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>, in which I announced it to be my purpose to appeal to the people of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> to sustain the course I had pursued in Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4812"/>In that speech I joined issue with <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0014.00215.02242" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> on the points which he had presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4813"/>Thus there was an issue clear and distinct made up between us on these <num value="2">two</num> propositions laid down in the speech of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0014.00215.02243" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName>, and controverted by me in my reply to him at <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4814"/>On the next day, the <dateStruct value="-07-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0014.00215.02244" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> replied to me at <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>, explaining at some length, and reaffirming the positions which he had taken in his <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName> speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4815"/>In that <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName> speech he even went further than he had before, and uttered sentiments in regard to the negro being on an equality with the white man. He adopted in support of this position the argument which <persName n="Lovejoy,,,,," id="n0024.0014.00215.02245" reg="mostcommon:Lovejoy,nomatch:0"><surname>Lovejoy</surname></persName> and <persName n="Codding,,,,," id="n0024.0014.00215.02246" reg="mostcommon:Codding,nomatch:0"><surname>Codding</surname></persName>, and other Abolition lecturers had made familiar in the northern and central portions of the <rs>State</rs>, to wit: that the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> having declared all men free and equal, by Divine law, also that negro equality was an inalienable right, of which they could not be deprived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4816"/>He insisted, in that speech, that the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> included the negro in the clause, asserting that all men were created equal, and went so far as to say that if <num value="1">one</num> man was allowed to take the position, that it did not include the negro, others might take the position that it did not include other men. He said that, all these distinctions between this man and that man, this race and the other race, must be discarded, and we must all stand by the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, declaring that all men were created equal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4818"/>During the following <measure n="7weeks" type="date">seven weeks</measure>, between the <rs>Chicago</rs> speeches and our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meeting at <placeName reg="Ottawa, La Salle, Illinois" key="tgn,2029529">Ottawa</placeName>, he and I addressed large assemblages of the people in many of the central counties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4819"/>In my speeches I confined myself closely to those <num value="3">three</num> positions which he had taken, controverting his proposition that this Union could not exist as our fathers made it, divided into free and slave States, controverting his proposition of a crusade against the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> because of the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision, and controverting his proposition that the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> included and meant the negroes as well as the white men, when it declared all men to be created equal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4820"/>I supposed at that time that <pb id="p.216" n="216"/> these propositions constituted a distinct issue between us, and that the opposite positions we had taken upon them me would be willing to be held to in every part of the <rs>State</rs>, I never intended to waver <num value="1">one</num> hair's breadth from that issue either in the north or the south, or wherever I should address the people of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4821"/>I hold that when the time arrives that I cannot proclaim my political creed in the same terms not only in the northern but the southern part of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, not only in the <rs>Northern</rs> but the <rs>Southern States</rs>, and wherever the <rs>American</rs> flag waves over American soil, that then there must be something wrong in that creed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4822"/>So long as we live under a common Constitution, so long as we live in a confederacy of sovereign and equal States, joined together as <num value="1">one</num> for certain purposes, that any political creed is radically wrong which cannot be proclaimed in every State, and every section of that Union, alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4823"/>I took up <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0014.00216.02248" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s <num value="3">three</num> propositions in my several speeches, analyzed them, and pointed out what I believed to be the radical errors contained in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4824"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, in regard to his doctrine that this Government was in violation of the law of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, which says that a house divided against itself cannot stand, I repudiated it as a slander upon the immortal framers of our Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4825"/>I then said, I have often repeated, and now again assert, that in my opinion our Government can endure forever, divided into free and slave States as our fathers made it,--each State having the right to prohibit, abolish or sustain slavery, just as it pleases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4826"/>This Government was made upon the great basis of the sovereignty of the <name>States</name>, the right of each State to regulate its own domestic institutions to suit itself, and that right was conferred with the understanding and expectation that inasmuch as each locality had separate interests, each locality must have different and distinct local and domestic institutions, corresponding to its wants and interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4827"/>Our fathers knew when they made the <rs>Government</rs>, that the laws and institutions which were well adapted to the green mountains of <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName>, were unsuited to the rice plantations of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4828"/>They knew then, as well as we know now, that the laws and institutions which would be well adapted to the beautiful prairies of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> would not be suited to the mining regions of <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4829"/>They knew that in a Republic as broad as this, having such a variety of soil, climate and interest, there must necessarily be a corresponding variety of local laws &mdash; the policy and institutions of each State adapted to its condition and wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4830"/>For this reason this Union was established on the right of each State to do as it pleased on the question of slavery, and every other question; and the various States were not allowed to complain of, much less interfere with the policy, of their neighbors. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4831"/>Suppose the doctrine advocated by <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0014.00216.02249" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and the <name>Abolitionists</name> of this day had prevailed when the <rs>Constitution</rs> was made, what would have been the result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4832"/>Imagine for a moment that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0014.00216.02250" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had been a member of the <rs>Convention</rs> that framed the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, and that when its members were about to sign that wonderful document, he had arisen in that Convention as he did at <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName> this summer, and addressing himself to the <rs>President</rs>, had said, <quote>A house divided against itself cannot stand ; this Government, divided into free and slave States, cannot endure, they must all be free or all be slave, they must all be <num value="1">one</num> thing or all the other, otherwise, it is a violation of the law of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and cannot continue to exist;</quote> --suppose <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0014.00216.02251" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had convinced that body of sages that that doctrine was sound what would have been the result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4833"/>Remember that the <rs>Union</rs> was then composed of <num value="13">thirteen</num> States, <num value="12">twelve</num> of which were slaveholding and <num value="1">one</num> free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4834"/>Do you think that the <num value="1">one</num> free State would have outvoted the <num value="12">twelve</num> slaveholding States, and thus have secured the abolition of slavery?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4835"/>On the other hand, would not the <num value="12">twelve</num> slaveholding States have outvoted the <num value="1">one</num> free State, and thus have fastened slavery?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4836"/>by a Constitutional provision, on every foot of the <rs>American Republic</rs> forever?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4837"/>You see that if this Abolition doctrine of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0014.00216.02252" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had prevailed when the <rs>Government</rs> was made, it would have established slavery as a permanent institution, in all the <name>States</name>, whether they wanted it or not., and the question for us to determine in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> now as <num value="1">one</num> of the free States is, whether or not we are willing, having become the majority section, to enforce a doctrine on the minority, which we would <pb id="p.217" n="217"/> have resisted with our heart's blood had it been attempted on us when we were in a minority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4838"/>How has the <rs>South</rs> lost her power as the majority section in this Union, and how have the free States gained it, except under the operation of that principle which declares the right of the people of each State and each Territory to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way. It was under that principle that slavery was abolished in <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName>, <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName>, <placeName reg="Connecticut" key="tgn,7007159">Connecticut</placeName>, New York, <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> ; it was under that principle that <num value="0.5">one half</num> of the slaveholding States became free ; it was under that principle that the number of free States increased until from being <num value="1">one</num> out of <num value="12">twelve</num> States, we have grown to be the majority of States of the whole Union, with the power to control the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> and Senate, and the power, consequently, to elect a President by Northern votes without the aid of a Southern State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4839"/>Having obtained this power under the operation of that great principle, are you now prepared to abandon the principle and declare that merely because we have the power you will wage a war against the <rs>Southern States</rs> and their institutions until you force them to abolish slavery every where. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4840"/>After having pressed these arguments home on <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0014.00217.02253" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> for <measure n="7weeks" type="date">seven weeks</measure>, publishing a number of my speeches, me met at <placeName reg="Ottawa, La Salle, Illinois" key="tgn,2029529">Ottawa</placeName> in joint discussion, and he then began to crawfish a little, and let himself down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4841"/>I there propounded certain questions to him. Amongst others, I asked him whether he would vote for the admission of any more slave States in the event the people wanted them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4842"/>He would not answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4843"/>I then told him that if he did not answer the question there I would renew it at <placeName key="tgn,2027931" n="1.000 13" reg="freeport, stephenson, illinois">Freeport</placeName>, and would then trot him down into <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> and again put it to him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4844"/>I will show you what his answer was. After saying that he was not pledged to the <rs>Republican</rs> doctrine of <quote>no more slave States,</quote> he declared: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4847"/>Here permit me to remark, that I do not think the people will ever force him into a position against his will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4848"/>He went on to say: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4849"/> </p> 
<p>But I must add in regard to this, that if slavery shall be kept out of the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> during the territorial existence of any <num value="1">one</num> given Territory, and then the people should, having a fair chance and a clear field when they come to adopt a Constitution, if they should do the extraordinary thing of adopting a slave Constitution, uninfluenced by the actual presence of the institution among them, I see no alternative, if we own the country, but we must admit it into the <rs>Union</rs>.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4850"/>That answer <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0014.00217.02254" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> supposed would satisfy the old line Whigs, composed of <persName><foreName>Kentuckians</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Virginians,,,,," id="n0024.0014.00217.02255" reg="mostcommon:Virginians,nomatch:0"><surname>Virginians</surname></persName>, down in the southern part of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4851"/>Now, what does it amount to?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4852"/>I desired to know whether he would vote to allow <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> to come into the <rs>Union</rs> with slavery or not, as her people desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4853"/>He would not answer ; but in a roundabout way said that if slavery should be kept out of a Territory during the whole of its territorial existence, and then the people, when they adopted a State Constitution, asked admission as a slave State, he supposed he would have to let the <rs>State</rs> come in. The case I put to him was an entirely different <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4854"/>I desired to know whether he would vote to admit a State if Congress had not prohibited slavery in it during its territorial existence, as Congress never pretended to do under <persName n="Clay,,,,," id="n0024.0014.00217.02256" reg="nearbymention:Clay,Henry,,,"><surname>Clay</surname></persName>'s Compromise measures of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4855"/>He would not answer, and I have not yet been able to get an answer from him. I have asked him whether he would vote to admit <placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> if her people asked to come in as a State with a Constitution recognizing slavery, and he refused to answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4856"/>I have put the question to him with reference to <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName>, and he has not uttered a word in answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4857"/>I have enumerated the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, <num value="1">one</num> after another, putting the same question to him with reference to each, and he has not said, and will not say, whether, if elected to Congress, <pb id="p.218" n="218"/> he will vote to admit any Territory now in existence with such a Constitution as her people may adopt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4858"/>He invents a case which does not exist, and cannot exist under this Government, and answers it ; but he will not answer the question I put to him in connection with any of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> now in existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4859"/>The contract we entered into with <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> when she entered the <rs>Union</rs> obliges us to allow <num value="4">four</num> States to be formed out of the old State, and admitted with or without slavery as the respective inhabitants of each may determine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4860"/>I have asked <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0014.00218.02257" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> <num value="3">three</num> times in our joint discussions whether he would vote to redeem that pledge, and he has never yet answered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4861"/>He is as silent as the grave on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4862"/>He would rather answer as to a state of the case which will never arise than commit himself by telling what he would do in a case which would come up for his action soon after his election to Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4863"/>Why can he not say whether he is willing to allow the people of each State to have slavery or not as they please, and to come into the <rs>Union</rs> when they have the requisite population as a slave or a free State as they decide?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4864"/>I have no trouble in answering the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4865"/>I have said every where, and now repeat it to you, that if the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> want a slave State they have a right, under the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, to form such a State, and I will let them come into the <rs>Union</rs> with slavery or without, as they determine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4866"/>If the people of any other Territory desire slavery, let them have it. If they do not want it, let them prohibit it. It is their business, not mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4867"/>It is none of our business in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> whether <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> is a free State or a slave State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4869"/>The people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> have as much right to decide that question for themselves as you have in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> to decide it for yourselves, or we in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> to decide it for ourselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4870"/>And here I may repeat what I have said in every speech I have made in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, that I fought the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> to its death, not because of the slavery clause in it, but because it was not the act and deed of the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4871"/>I said then in Congress, and I say now, that if the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> want a slave State, they have a right to have it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4886"/>I was and am willing to adopt the rule that no State shall ever come into the <rs>Union</rs> until she has the full ratio of population for a member of Congress, provided that rule is made uniform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4950"/>I hold that there is no principle on earth more sacred to all the friends of freedom than that which says that no institution, no law, no constitution, should be forced on an unwilling people contrary to their wishes ; and I assert that the <rs>Kansas</rs> and <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill contains that principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4951"/>It is the great principle contained in that bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4952"/>It is the principle on which <persName n="Buchanan,,James,,," id="n0024.0014.00222.02277" reg="default:Buchanan,James,,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> was made <rs type="role2">President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4953"/>Without that principle he never would have been made <rs type="role2">President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4954"/>I will never violate or abandon that doctrine if I have to stand alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4955"/>I have resisted the blandishments and threats of power on the <num value="1">one</num> side, and seduction on the other, and have stood immovably for that principle, fighting for it when assailed by Northern mobs, or threatened by Southern hostility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4956"/>I have defended it against the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>, and I will defend it against whoever assails it, and I will follow it wherever its logical conclusions lead me. I say to you that there is but <num value="1">one</num> hope, <num value="1">one</num> safety for this country, and that is to stand immovably by that principle which declares the right of each State and each Territory to decide these questions for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4957"/>This Government was founded on that principle, and must be administered in the same sense in which it was founded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4958"/>But the <orgName n="Abolition party" type="party">Abolition party</orgName> really think that under the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> the negro is equal to the white man, and that negro equality is an inalienable right conferred by the <name>Almighty</name>, and hence that all human laws in violation of it are null and void.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4959"/>With such men it is no use for me to argue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4960"/>I hold that the signers of the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> had no reference to negroes at all when they declared all men to be created equal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4961"/>They did not mean negro, nor the savage <rs>Indians</rs>, nor the <rs>Fejee Islanders</rs>, nor any other barbarous race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4962"/>They were speaking of white men. They alluded to men of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> birth and <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> descent &mdash; to white men, and to none others, when they declared that doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4963"/>I hold that this Government was established on the white basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4964"/>It was established by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever, and should be administered by white men, and none others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4965"/>But it does not follow, by any means, that merely because the negro is not a citizen, and merely because he is not our equal, that, therefore, he should be a slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4966"/>On the contrary, it does follow that we ought to extend to the negro race, and to all other dependent races all the rights, all the privileges, and all the immunities which they can exercise consistently with the safety of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4967"/>Humanity requires that we should give them all these privileges ; Christianity commands that we should extend those privileges to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4968"/>The question then arises what are those privileges, and what is the nature and extent of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4969"/>My answer is that that is a question which each State must answer for itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4970"/>We in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> have decided it for ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4971"/>We tried slavery, kept it up for <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure>, and finding that it was not profitable, we abolished it for that reason, and became a free State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4972"/>We adopted in its stead the policy that a negro in this State shall not be a slave and shall not be a citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4973"/>We have a right to adopt that policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4974"/>For my part I think it is a wise and sound policy for us. You in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> must judge for yourselves whether it is a wise policy for you. If you choose to follow our example, very good ; if you reject it, still well, it is your business, not ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4975"/>So with <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4976"/>Let <placeName key="tgn,7007255" n="1.000 69" reg="kentucky">Kentucky</placeName> adopt a policy to suit herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4977"/>If we do not like it we will keep away from it, and if she does not like ours let her stay at home, mind her own business and let us alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4978"/>If the people of all the <name>States</name> will act on that great principle, and each State mind its own business, attend to its own affairs, take care of its own negroes and not meddle with its neighbors, then there will be peace between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>, the <rs>East</rs> and the <rs>West</rs>, throughout the whole Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4979"/>Why can we not thus have peace?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4980"/>Why should we thus allow a sectional party to agitate this country, to array the <rs>North</rs> against the <rs>South</rs>, and convert us into enemies instead of friends, merely that <pb id="p.223" n="223"/> a few ambitious men may ride into power on a sectional hobby?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4981"/>How long is it since these ambitious Northern men wished for a sectional organization?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4982"/>Did any <num value="1">one</num> of them dream of a sectional party as long as the <rs>North</rs> was the weaker section and the <rs>South</rs> the stronger?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4983"/>Then all were opposed to sectional parties ; but the moment the <rs>North</rs> obtained the majority in the <rs type="place">House</rs> and Senate by the admission of <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>, and could elect a President without the aid of Southern votes, that moment ambitious Northern men formed a scheme to excite the <rs>North</rs> against the <rs>South</rs>, and make the people be governed in their votes by geographical lines, thinking that the <rs>North</rs>, being the stronger section, would outvote the <rs>South</rs>, and consequently they, the leaders, would ride into office on a sectional hobby.

<p>There is <num value="1">one</num> other thing I will mention before I leave this branch of the discussion-although I do not consider it much of my business, any way.

I would only remind the <rs>Judge</rs> that while he is very valiantly fighting for the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill and the repeal of the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>, it has been but a little while since he was the <hi rend="italics">valiant advocate of</hi> the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4993"/>I want to know if <persName n="Buchanan,,,,," id="n0024.0014.00223.02283" reg="nearbymention:Buchanan,James,,,"><surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> has not as much right to be inconsistent as <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0014.00223.02284" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> has?

Is nobody allowed that high privilege but himself?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4995"/>Is he to have an entire <hi rend="italics">monopoly</hi> on that subject? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4996"/>So far as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0014.00223.02286" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> addressed his speech to me, or so far as it was about me, it is my business to pay some attention to it. I have heard the <rs>Judge</rs> state <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> times what.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4997"/>he has stated to-day that in a speech which I made at <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield, Illinois</placeName>, I had in a very especial manner complained that the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> in the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> case had decided that a negro could never be a citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4998"/>I have omitted by some accident heretofore to analyze this statement, and it is required of me to notice it now. In point of tact it is <hi rend="italics">untrue</hi>. I never have complained <hi rend="italics">especially</hi> of the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision because it held that a negro could not be a citizen: and the <rs>Judge</rs> is always wrong when he says I ever did so complain of it. I have the speech here, and I will thank him or any of his friends to show where I said that a negro should be a citizen, and complained especially of the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision because it declared he could not be <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4999"/>I have done no such thing, and <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0014.00223.02287" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> so persistently insisting that I have done so, has strongly impressed me with the belief of a predetermination on his part to misrepresent me. <pb id="p.224" n="224"/> He could not get his foundation for insisting that I was in favor of this negro equality any where else as well he could by assuming that untrue proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5000"/>Let me tell this audience what is true in regard to that matter; and the means by which they may correct me if I do not tell them truly is by a recurrence to the speech itself I spoke of the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision in my <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName> speech, and I was then endeavoring to prove that the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision was a portion of a system or scheme to make slavery national in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5001"/>I pointed out what things had been decided by the court.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5002"/>I mentioned as a fact that they had decided that a negro could not be a citizen &mdash; that they had done so, as I supposed, to deprive the negro, under all circumstances, of the remotest possibility of ever becoming a citizen and claiming the rights of a citizen of the. <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> under a certain clause of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5003"/>I stated that, without making any complaint of it at all. I then went on and stated the other points decided in the case, namely : that the bringing of a negro into the <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">State of Illinois</placeName> and holding him in slavery for <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> here was a matter in regard to which they would not decide whether it would make him free or not ; that they decided the further point that taking him into a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> Territory where slavery was prohibited by act of Congress, did not make him free, because that act of Congress, as they held, was unconstitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5004"/>I mentioned these <num value="3">three</num> things as making up the points decided in that case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5005"/>I mentioned them in a lump taken in connection with the introduction of the <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill, and the amendment of <persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n0024.0014.00224.02288" reg="mostcommon:Chase,Giddings,,,:1"><surname>Chase</surname></persName>, offered at the time, declaratory of the right of the people of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> to exclude <hi rend="italics">slavery</hi>, which was voted down by the friends of the bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5006"/>I mentioned all these things together, as evidence tending to prove a combination and conspiracy to make the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> national.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5007"/>In that connection and in that way I mentioned the decision on the point that a negro could not be a citizen, and in no other connection. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5008"/>Out of this, <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0014.00224.02289" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> builds up his beautiful fabrication &mdash; of my purpose to introduce a perfect, social, and political equality between the <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs> races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5009"/>His assertion that I made an <quote>especial objection</quote> (that is his exact language) to the decision on this account, is .untrue in point of fact. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5010"/>Now, while I am upon this subject, and as <persName n="Clay,,Henry,,," id="n0024.0014.00224.02290" reg="default:Clay,Henry,,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName> has been alluded to, I desire to place myself, in connection with <persName n="Clay,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0014.00224.02291" reg="nearbymention:Clay,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName>, as nearly right before this people as may be. I am quite aware what the <rs>Judge</rs>'s object is here by all these allusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5011"/>He knows that we are before an audience, having strong sympathies southward by relationship, place of birth, and so on. He desires to place me in an extremely Abolition attitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5012"/>He read upon a former occasion, and alludes without reading today, to a portion of a speech which I delivered in <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5013"/>In his quotations from that speech, as he has made them upon former occasions, the extracts were taken in such a way as, I suppose, brings them within the definition of what is called <hi rend="italics">garbling</hi>--taking portions of a speech which, when taken by themselves, do not present the entire sense of the speaker as expressed at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5014"/>I propose, therefore, out of that same speech, to show how <num value="1">one</num> portion of it, which he skipped over (taking an extract before and an extract after) will give a different idea, and the true idea I intended to convey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5015"/>It will take me some little time to read it, but I believe I will occupy the time that way. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5016"/>You have heard him frequently allude to my controversy with him in regard to the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>.

<p>It may be argued that there are certain conditions that make necessities and impose them upon us, and to the extent that a necessity is imposed upon a man he must submit to it. I think that was the condition in which we found ourselves when we established this Government.

<p>I think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include <hi rend="italics">all</hi> men, but they did not mean to declare all men equal <hi rend="italics">in all respects</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5028"/>They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth, that all were then actually enjoying that equality, or yet, that they were about to confer it immediately upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5029"/>In fact they had no power to confer such a boon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5045"/>In the first place I would say he was not an old line Whig.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5046"/>I am somewhat acquainted with old line Whigs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5047"/>I was with the old line Whigs from the origin to the end of that party ; I became pretty well acquainted with them, and I know they always had some sense, whatever else you could ascribe to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5048"/>I know there never was <num value="1">one</num> who had not more sense than to try to show by the evidence he produces that some man had, prior to the time I named, said that negroes were not included in the term <quote>all men</quote> in the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5049"/>What is the evidence he produces?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5050"/>I will bring forward <hi rend="italics">his</hi> evidence and let you see what <hi rend="italics">he</hi> offers by way of showing that somebody more than <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> ago had said negroes were not included in the <name>Declaration</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5051"/>He brings forward part of a speech from <persName n="Clay,,Henry,,," id="n0024.0014.00226.02302" reg="default:Clay,Henry,,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName>--<hi rend="italics">the</hi> part of <hi rend="italics">the</hi> speech of <persName n="Clay,,Henry,,," id="n0024.0014.00226.02303" reg="default:Clay,Henry,,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName> which I used to bring forward to prove precisely the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5052"/>I guess we are surrounded to some extent to-day by the old friends of <persName n="Clay,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0014.00226.02304" reg="nearbymention:Clay,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName>, and they will be glad to hear any thing from that authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5053"/>While he was in <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName> a man presented a petition to liberate his negroes, and he (<persName n="Clay,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0014.00226.02305" reg="nearbymention:Clay,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName>) made a speech in answer to it, which I suppose he carefully wrote out himself and caused to be published.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5057"/>It is a general declaration in the act announcing to the world the independence of the <num value="13">thirteen</num> American colonies, that all men are created equal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5058"/>Now, as an abstract principle, <hi rend="italics">there is no doubt of the truth of that declaration</hi> ; and it is desirable, <hi rend="italics">in the original construction of society, and in organized societies</hi>, to keep it in view as a great fundamental principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5059"/>But, then, I apprehend that in no society that ever did exist, or ever shall be formed, was or can the equality asserted among the members of the human race, be practically enforced and carried out.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5060"/>That declaration, whatever may be the extent of its import, was made by the delegations of the <num value="13">thirteen</num> States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5061"/>In most of them slavery existed, and had long existed, and was established by law. It was introduced and forced upon the colonies by the paramount law of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5062"/>Do you believe, that in making that declaration the <name>States</name> that concurred in it intended that it should be tortured into a virtual emancipation of all the slaves within their respective limits?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5063"/>Would <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and other Southern States have ever united in a declaration which was to be interpreted into an abolition of slavery among them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5064"/>Did any <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="13">thirteen</num> colonies entertain such a design or expectation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5065"/>To impute such a secret and unavowed purpose, would be to charge a political fraud upon the noblest band of patriots that ever assembled in council &mdash; a fraud upon the <rs>Confederacy</rs> of the <name>Revolution</name> &mdash; a fraud upon the union of those States whose Constitution not only recognized the lawfulness of slavery, but permitted the importation of slaves from <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> until the year <dateStruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></dateStruct>.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5070"/>He illustrates this by bringing forward the cases of females, minors, and insane persons, with whom it cannot be enforced; but he says it is true as an abstract principle in the organization of society as well as in organized society, and it should be kept in view as a fundamental principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5071"/>Let me read a few words more before I add some comments of my own. <persName n="Clay,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0014.00226.02309" reg="nearbymention:Clay,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName> says a little further on: <pb id="p.227" n="227"/> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5076"/>Now, here in this same book &mdash; in this same speech &mdash; in this same extract brought forward to prove that <persName n="Clay,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0014.00227.02310" reg="nearbymention:Clay,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName> held that the negro was not included in the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>--no such statement on his part, but the declaration <hi rend="italics">that it is a great fundamental truth</hi>, which should be constantly kept in view in the organization of society and in societies already organized.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5080"/>And when this new principle-this new proposition that no human being ever thought of <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> ago &mdash; is brought forward, <hi rend="italics">I combat it</hi> as having an evil tendency, if not an evil design.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5081"/>I combat it as having a tendency to dehumanize the negro &mdash; to take away from him the right of ever striving to be a man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5082"/>But there is a point that I wish, before leaving this part of the discussion, to ask attention to.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5107"/>Here now are my views upon it in brief. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5108"/>I said we were now far into the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> year, since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to the slavery agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5109"/>Is it not so?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5110"/>When that <placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> bill was brought forward <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> ago last <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, was it not for the <quote>avowed object</quote> of putting an end to the slavery agitation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5111"/>We were to have no more agitation in Congress it was all to be banished to the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5112"/>By the way, I will remark here that, as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0014.00228.02317" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> is very fond of complimenting <persName n="Crittenden,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0014.00228.02318" reg="mostcommon:Crittenden,John,J.,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName> in these days, <persName n="Crittenden,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0014.00228.02319" reg="mostcommon:Crittenden,John,J.,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName> has said there was a falsehood in that whole business, for there was <hi rend="italics">no</hi> slavery <hi rend="italics">agitation at that time to allay</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5115"/>The last tip of the last joint of the old serpent's tail was just drawing out of view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5116"/>But has it proved so?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5117"/>I have asserted that under that policy that agitation <quote>has not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5118"/>When was there ever a greater agitation in Congress than last winter?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5119"/>When was it as great in the country as to-day? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5120"/>There was a collateral object in the introduction of that <placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> policy which was to clothe the people of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> with a superior degree of self-government, beyond what they had ever had before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5121"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, object and the main <num value="1">one</num> of conferring upon the people a higher degree of <quote>self-government,</quote> is a question of fact to be determined by you in answer to a single question.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5124"/>I have intimated that I thought the agitation would not cease until a crisis should have been reached and passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5125"/>I have stated in what way I thought it would be reached and passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5126"/>I have said that it might go <num value="1">one</num> way or the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5127"/>We might, by arresting the further spread of it, and placing it where the fathers originally placed it, put it where the public mind should rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5128"/>Thus the agitation may cease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5129"/>It may be pushed forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the <name>States</name>, old as well as new, North as well as South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5130"/>I have said, and I repeat, my wish is that the further spread of it may be arrested, and that it may be placed where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5131"/>I have expressed that as my wish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5132"/>I entertain the opinion upon evidence sufficient to my mind, that the fathers of this Government placed that, institution where the public mind <hi rend="italics">did</hi> rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5133"/>Let me ask why they made provision that, the source of slavery &mdash; the <name>African</name> slave-trade &mdash; should be cut off at the end of <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>? Why did they make provision that in all the new territory we owned at that time, slavery should be forever inhibited?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5134"/>Why stop its spread in <num value="1">one</num> direction and cut off its source in another, if they did not look to its being placed in the course of ultimate extinction? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5135"/>Again; the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> is only mentioned in the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <pb id="p.229" n="229"/> <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> times, and in neither of these cases does the word <quote>slavery</quote> or <quote>negro race</quote> occur; but covert language is used each time, and for a purpose full of significance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5136"/>What is the language in regard to the prohibition of the <name>African</name> slave-trade?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5137"/>It runs in about this way <quote>The migration or importation of such persons as any of the <name>States</name> now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the <rs>Congress</rs> prior to the year <dateStruct value="1808"><year reg="1808">one thousand eight hundred and eight</year></dateStruct>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5138"/></p> 
<p>The next allusion in the <rs>Constitution</rs> to the question of slavery and the black race, is on the subject of the basis of representation, and there the language used is, <quote>Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed-<num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of all other persons.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5139"/></p> 
<p>It says <quote>persons,</quote> not slaves, not negroes ; but this <quote><num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num></quote> can be applied to no other class among us than the negroes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5140"/>Lastly, in the provision for the reclamation of fugitive slaves, it is said : <quote>No person held to service or labor in <num value="1">one</num> State, under the laws thereof; escaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5142"/>In all <num value="3">three</num> of these places, being the only allusions to slavery in the. instrument, covert language is used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5143"/>Language is used not suggesting that slavery existed or that the black race were among us. And I understand the contemporaneous history of those times to be that covert language was used with a purpose, and that purpose was that in our Constitution, which it was hoped and is still hoped will endure forever-when it should be read by intelligent and patriotic men, after the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> had passed from among us &mdash; there should be nothing on the face of the great charter of liberty suggesting that such a thing as negro slavery had ever existed among us. This is part of the evidence that the fathers of the <rs>Government</rs> expected and intended the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> to come to an end. They expected and intended that it should be in the course of ultimate extinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5144"/>And when I say that I desire to see the further spread of it arrested, I only say I desire to see that done which the fathers have <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5145"/>When I say I desire to see it placed where the public mind will rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, I only say I desire to see it placed where they placed it. It is not true that our fathers, as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0014.00229.02322" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> assumes, made this Government part slave and part free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5146"/>Understand the sense in which he puts it. He assumes that slavery is a rightful thing within itself &mdash; was introduced by the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5147"/>The exact truth is, that they found the institution existing among us, and they left it as they found it. But in making the <rs>Government</rs> they left this institution with many clear marks of disapprobation upon it. They found slavery among them, and they left it among them because of the difficulty &mdash; the absolute impossibility of its immediate removal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5148"/>And when <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0014.00229.02323" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> asks me why we cannot let it remain part slave and part free, as the fathers of the <rs>Government</rs> made it, be asks a question based upon an assumption which is itself a falsehood; and I turn upon him and ask him the question, when the policy that the fathers of the <rs>Government</rs> had adopted in relation to this element among us was the best policy in the world-the only wise policy &mdash; the only policy that we can ever safely continue upon &mdash; that will ever give us peace, unless this dangerous element masters us all and becomes a national <hi rend="italics">institution &mdash; I turn upon him and ask him why he could not leave it alone</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5149"/>He said so in his speech on the <dateStruct value="-03-22"><day reg="22">22d</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> of the present year, <dateStruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5150"/>I ask him why he could not let it remain where our fathers placed it.

I ask you, when he infers that I am in favor of setting the free and slave States at war, when the institution was placed in that attitude by those who made the <rs>Constitution</rs>, <hi rend="italics">did they make any war</hi>? If we had no war out of it, when thus placed, wherein is the ground of belief that we shall have war out of it, if we return to that policy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5151"/>Have we had any peace upon this matter springing from any other basis?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5152"/>I maintain that we have not. I have proposed nothing more than a return to the policy of the fathers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5153"/>I confess, when I propose a certain measure of policy, it is not enough for me that I do not intend any thing evil in the result, but it is incumbent on me to show that it has not a tendency to that result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5155"/>I have not only made the declaration that I do not <hi rend="italics">mean</hi> to produce a conflict between the <name>States</name>, but I have tried to show by fair reasoning, and I think I have shown to the minds of fair men, that I propose nothing but what has a most peaceful tendency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5156"/>The quotation that I happened to make in that <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName> speech, that <quote>a house divided against itself cannot stand,</quote> and which has proved so offensive to the <rs>Judge</rs>, was part and parcel of the same thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5157"/>He tries to show that variety in the domestic institutions of the different States is necessary and indispensable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5158"/>I do not dispute it. I have no controversy with <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0014.00230.02326" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> about that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5163"/>I understand quite as well as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0014.00230.02328" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, that if we here raise a barrel of flour more than we want, and the <name>Louisianians</name> raise a barrel of sugar more than they want, it is of mutual advantage to exchange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5164"/>That produces commerce, brings us together, and makes us better friends.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5166"/>But when I have admitted all this, I ask if there is any parallel between these things and this <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5167"/>I do not see that there is any parallel at all between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5168"/>Consider it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5169"/>When have we had any quarrels over these things?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5170"/>When have we had perfect peace in regard to this thing which I say is an element of discord in this Union?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5171"/>We have sometimes had peace, but when was it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5172"/>It was when the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> remained quiet where it was. We have had difficulty and turmoil whenever it has made a struggle to spread itself where it was not. I ask, then, if experience does not speak in thunder-tones, telling us that the policy which has given peace to the country heretofore, being returned to, gives the greatest promise of peace again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5173"/>You may say, and <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0014.00230.02330" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> has intimated the same thing, that all this difficulty in regard to the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> is the mere agitation of office-seekers and ambitious northern politicians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5174"/>He thinks we want to get <quote>his place,</quote> I suppose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5175"/>I agree that there are office-seekers amongst us. The <rs type="document">Bible</rs> says somewhere that we are desperately selfish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5176"/>I think we would have discovered that fact without the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5177"/>I do not claim that I am any less so than the average of men, but I do claim that I am not more selfish than <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0014.00230.02331" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5178"/>But is it true that all the difficulty and agitation we have in regard to this <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> springs from office-seeking &mdash; from the mere ambition of politicians?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5197"/>If you will get every body else to stop talking about it, I assure you I will quit before they have half done so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5213"/>Let me suggest it in a different way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5219"/>I have stated upon former occasions, and I may as well state again, what I understand to be the real issue in this controversy between <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0014.00232.02335" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> and myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5220"/>On the point of my wanting to make war between the free and the slave States, there has been no issue between us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5221"/>These are false issues, upon which <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0014.00232.02336" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> has tried to force the controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5222"/>There is no foundation in truth for the charge that I maintain either of these propositions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5223"/>The real issue in this controversy &mdash; the <num value="1">one</num> pressing upon every mind &mdash; is the sentiment on the part of <num value="1">one</num> class that looks upon the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> <hi rend="italics">as a wrong</hi>, and of another class that <hi rend="italics">does not</hi> look upon it as a wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5224"/>The sentiment that contemplates the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> in this country as a wrong is the sentiment of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5225"/>It is the sentiment around which all their actions-all their arguments circle &mdash; from which all their propositions radiate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5226"/>They look upon it as being a moral, social and political wrong ; and while they contemplate it as such, they nevertheless have due regard for its actual existence among us, and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way and to all the constitutional obligations thrown about it. Yet having a due regard for these, they desire a policy in regard to it that looks to its not creating any more danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5227"/>They insist that it should as far as may be, <hi rend="italics">be treated</hi> as a wrong, and <num value="1">one</num> of the methods of treating it as a wrong is to <hi rend="italics">make provision that it shall grow no larger</hi>. They also desire a policy that looks to a peaceful end of slavery at sometime, as being wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5228"/>These are the views they entertain in regard to it as I understand them; and all their sentiments-all their arguments and propositions are brought within this range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5229"/>I have said and I repeat it here, that if there be a man amongst us who does not think that the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> is wrong in any <num value="1">one</num> of the aspects of which I have spoken, he is misplaced and ought not to be with us. And if there be a man amongst us who is so impatient of it as a wrong as to disregard its actual presence among us and the difficulty of getting rid of it suddenly in a satisfactory way, and to disregard the constitutional obligations thrown about it, that man is misplaced if he is on our platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5230"/>We disclaim sympathy with him in practical action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5231"/>He is not placed properly with us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5232"/>On this subject of treating it as a wrong, and limiting its spread, let me say a word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5233"/>Has any thing ever threatened the existence of this Union save and except this very <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5234"/>What is it that we hold most dear amongst us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5235"/>Our own liberty and prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5236"/>What has ever threatened our liberty and prosperity save and except this <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5237"/>If this is true, how do you propose to improve the condition of things by enlarging slavery-by spreading it out and making it bigger?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5238"/>You may have a wen or cancer upon your person and not be able to cut it out lest you bleed to death; but surely it is no way to cure it, to engraft <pb id="p.233" n="233"/> it and spread it over your whole body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5239"/>That is no proper way of treating what you regard a wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5240"/>You see this peaceful way of dealing with it as a wrong-restricting the spread of it, and not allowing it to go into new countries where it has not already existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5241"/>That is the peaceful way, the old-fashioned way, the way in which the fathers themselves set us the example. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5242"/>On the other hand, I have said there is a sentiment which treats it as <hi rend="italics">not</hi> being wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5243"/>That is the <rs>Democratic</rs> sentiment of this day. I do not mean to say that every man who stands within that range positively asserts that it is right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5244"/>That class will include all who positively assert that it is right, and all who like <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0014.00233.02337" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> treat it as indifferent and do not say it is either right or wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5245"/>These <num value="2">two</num> classes of men fall within the general class of those who do not look upon it as a wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5246"/>And if there be among you any body who supposes that he, as a Democrat, can consider himself <quote>as much opposed to slavery as anybody,</quote> I would like to reason with him. You never treat it as a wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5247"/>What other thing that you consider as a wrong, do you deal with as you deal with that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5248"/>Perhaps you <hi rend="italics">say</hi> it is wrong, <hi rend="italics">but your leader never does, and you quarrel with any body who says it is wrong.</hi> Although you pretend to say so yourself you can find no fit place to deal with it as a wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5249"/>You must not say any thing about it in the free States, <hi rend="italics">because it is not here</hi>. You must not say any thing about it in the slave States, <hi rend="italics">because it is there.</hi> You must not say any thing about it in the pulpit, because that is religion and has nothing to do with it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5250"/>There is no place to talk about it as being a wrong, although you say yourself it is a wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5251"/>But finally you will screw yourself up to the belief that if the people of the slave States should adopt a system of gradual emancipation on the slavery question, you would be in favor of it. You would be in favor of it. You say that is getting it in the right place, and you would be glad to see it succeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5252"/>But you are deceiving yourself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5254"/>They fought as valiantly as they could for the system of gradual emancipation which you pretend you would be glad to see succeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5255"/>Now I will bring you to the test.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5256"/>After a hard fight they were beaten, and when the news came over here you threw up your hats and <hi rend="italics">hurraed for Democracy</hi>. More than that, take all the argument made in favor of the system you have proposed, and it carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5257"/>The arguments to sustain that policy carefully excluded it.

The Democratic policy in regard to that institution will not tolerate the merest breath, the slightest hint, of the least degree of wrong about it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5258"/>He says he <quote>dont care whether it is voted up or voted down</quote> in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5259"/>I do not care myself in dealing with that expression, whether it is intended to be expressive of his individual sentiments on the subject, or only of the national policy he desires to have established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5260"/>It is alike valuable for my purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5261"/>Any man can say that who does not see any thing wrong in slavery, but no man can logically say it who does see a wrong in it; because no man can logically say he dont care whether a wrong is voted up or voted down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5262"/>He may say he dont care whether an indifferent thing is voted up or down, but he must logically have a choice between a right thing and a wrong thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5263"/>He contends that whatever community wants slaves has a right to have them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5264"/>So they have if it is not a wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5265"/>But if it is a wrong, he cannot say people have a right to do wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5266"/>He says that upon the score of equality, slaves should be allowed to go in a new Territory, like other property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5267"/>This is strictly logical if there is no difference between it and other property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5268"/>If it and other property are equal, his argument is entirely logical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5269"/>But if you insist that <num value="1">one</num> is wrong and the other right, <pb id="p.234" n="234"/> there is no use to institute a comparison between right and wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5270"/>You may turn over every thing in the <rs>Democratic</rs> policy from beginning to end, whether in the shape it takes on the statute book, in the shape it takes in the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision, in the shape it takes in conversation, or the shape it takes in short maxim-like arguments &mdash; it every where carefully excludes the idea that there is any thing wrong in it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5271"/>That is the real issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5272"/>That is the issue that will continue in this country when these poor tongues of <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0014.00234.02344" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> and myself shall be silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5275"/>The <num value="1">one</num> is the common right of humanity and the other the divine right of kings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5280"/>Then there will soon be an end of it, and that end will be its <quote>ultimate extinction.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5281"/>Whenever the issue can be distinctly made, and all extraneous matter thrown out so that men can fairly see the real difference between the parties, this controversy will soon be settled, and it will be done peaceably too. There will be no war, no violence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5282"/>It will be placed again where the wisest and best men of the world placed it. Brooks of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> once declared that when this Constitution was framed, its framers did not look to the institution existing until this day. When he said this, I think he stated a fact that is fully borne out by the history of the times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5283"/>But he also said they were better and wiser men than the men of these days ; yet the men of these days had experience which they had not, and by the invention of the cotton-gin it became a necessity in this country that slavery should be perpetual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5284"/>I now say that, willingly or unwillingly, purposely or without purpose, <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0014.00234.02347" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> has been the most prominent instrument in changing the position of the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> which the fathers of the <rs>Government</rs> expected to come to an end ere this--<hi rend="italics">and putting it upon <persName n="Brooks,,,,," id="n0024.0014.00234.02348" reg="mostcommon:Brooks,nomatch:0"><surname>Brooks</surname></persName>'s cotton-gin basis</hi>--placing it where he openly confesses he has no desire there shall ever be an end of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5285"/>I understand I have <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> yet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5286"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing I ask attention to is the fact that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0014.00234.02350" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> constantly said, before the decision, that whether they could or not, <hi rend="italics">was a question for the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName></hi>. But after the court has made the decision he virtually says it is not a question for the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>, but for the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5287"/>And how is it he tells us they can exclude it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5288"/>He says it needs <quote>police regulations,</quote> and that admits of <quote>unfriendly legislation.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5289"/>Although it is a right established by the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> to take a slave into a Territory of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and hold him as property, yet unless the <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> will give friendly legislation, and, more especially, if they adopt unfriendly legislation, they can practically exclude him. Now, without meeting this proposition as a matter of fact, I pass to consider the real Constitutional obligation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5290"/>Let me take the gentleman who looks me in the face before me, and let us suppose that he is a member of the <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5291"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing he will do will be to swear that he mill support the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5292"/>His neighbor by his side in the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> has slaves and needs Territorial legislation to enable <pb id="p.235" n="235"/> him to enjoy that Constitutional right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5293"/>Can he withhold the legislation which his neighbor needs for the enjoyment of a right which is fixed in his favor in the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> which he has sworn to support?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5294"/>Can he withhold it without violating his oath?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5295"/>And more especially, can he pass unfriendly legislation to violate his oath?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5296"/>Why, this is a <hi rend="italics">monstrous</hi> sort of talk about the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>! <hi rend="italics">There has never been as outlandish or lawless</hi> a <hi rend="italics">doctrine</hi> from <hi rend="italics">the mouth of any respectable man on earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5297"/>I</hi> do not believe it is a Constitutional right to hold slaves in a Territory of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5298"/>I believe the decision was improperly made and I go for reversing it. <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0014.00235.02351" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> is furious against those who go for reversing a decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5299"/>But he is for legislating it out of all force while the law itself stands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5300"/>I repeat that there has never been so monstrous a doctrine uttered from the mouth of a respectable man. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5301"/>I suppose most of us (I know it of myself) believe that the people of the <rs>Southern States</rs> are entitled to a Congressional Fugitive Slave law &mdash; that is a right fixed in the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5302"/>But it cannot be made available to them without Congressional legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5303"/>In the <rs>Judge</rs>'s language, it is a <quote>barren right</quote> which needs legislation before it can become efficient and valuable to the persons to whom it is guarantied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5304"/>And as the right is Constitutional I agree that the legislation shall be granted to it --and that not that we like the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5305"/>We profess to have no taste for running and catching niggers-at least I profess no taste for that job at all. Why then do I yield support to a Fugitive Slave law?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5306"/>Because I do not understand that the <rs>Constitution</rs>, which guaranties that right, can be supported without it. And if I believed that the right to hold a slave in a Territory was equally fixed in the <rs>Constitution</rs> with the right to reclaim fugitives, I should be bound to give it the legislation necessary to support it. I say that no man can deny his obligation to give the necessary legislation to support slavery in a Territory, who believes it is a Constitutional right to have it there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5307"/>No man can, who does not give the <name>Abolitionists</name> an argument to deny the obligation enjoined by the <rs>Constitution</rs> to enact a Fugitive Slave law. Try it now. It is the strongest Abolition argument ever made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5308"/>I say if that <persName n="Scott,,Dred,,," id="n0024.0014.00235.02352" reg="default:Scott,Dred,,,"><foreName>Dred</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> decision is correct, then the right to hold slaves in a Territory is equally a Constitutional right with the right of a slaveholder to have his runaway returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5309"/>No <num value="1">one</num> can show the distinction between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5310"/>The <num value="1">one</num> is express, so that we cannot deny it. The other is construed to be in the <rs>Constitution</rs>, so that he who believes the decision to be correct believes in the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5311"/>And the man who argues that by unfriendly legislation, in spite of that Constitutional right, slavery may be driven from the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, cannot avoid furnishing an argument by which Abolitionists may deny the obligation to return fugitives, and claim the power to pass laws unfriendly to the right of the slaveholder to reclaim his fugitive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5312"/>I do not know how such an argument may strike a popular assembly like this, but I defy any body to go before a body of men whose minds are educated to estimating evidence and reasoning, and show that there is an iota of difference between the <name>Constitutional</name> right to reclaim a fugitive, and the <name>Constitutional</name> right to hold a slave, in a Territory, provided this <persName n="Scott,,Dred,,," id="n0024.0014.00235.02353" reg="default:Scott,Dred,,,"><foreName>Dred</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> decision is correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5313"/>I defy any man to make an argument that will justify unfriendly legislation to deprive a slaveholder of his right to hold his slave in a Territory, that will not equally, in all its length, breadth and thickness, furnish an argument for nullifying the <rs>Fugitive Slave</rs> law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5414"/>Appearing here for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in my life, I have been somewhat embarrassed for a topic by way of introduction to my speech; but I have been relieved from that embarrassment by an introduction which the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Ohio Statesman" type="newspaper">Ohio Statesman</orgName></hi> newspaper gave me this morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5415"/>In this paper I have read an article, in which, among other statements, I find the following: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5417"/>I mention this now, at the opening of my remarks, for the purpose of making <num value="3">three</num> comments upon it. The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> I have already announced &mdash; it furnishes me an introductory topic ; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> is to show that the gentleman is mistaken ; thirdly, to give him an opportunity to correct it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5418"/>In the first place, in regard to this matter being a mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5419"/>I have found that it is not entirely safe, when <num value="1">one</num> is misrepresented under his very nose, to allow the misrepresentation to go uncontradicted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5420"/>I therefore propose, here at the outset, not only to say that this is a misrepresentation, but to show conclusively that it is so ; and you will bear with me while I read a couple of extracts from that very <quote>memorable</quote> debate with <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00240.02436" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> last year, to which this newspaper refers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5421"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> pitched battle which <persName n="Douglas,Senator,,,," id="n0024.0015.00240.02437" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> and myself had, at the town of <placeName reg="Ottawa, La Salle, Illinois" key="tgn,2029529">Ottawa</placeName>, I used the language which I will now read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5422"/>Having been previously reading an extract, I continued as follows : <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5423"/> </p> 
<p> Now, gentlemen, I dont want to read at any greater length, but this is the true complexion of all I have ever said in regard to the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> and the black race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5424"/>This is the whole of it, and any thing that argues me into his idea of perfect social and political equality with the negro, is but a specious and fantastic arrangement of words, by which a man can prove a horse-chestnut to be a chestnut horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5425"/>I will say here, while upon this subject, that I have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> in the <name>States</name> where it exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5426"/>I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so. I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5427"/>There is a physical difference between the <num value="2">two</num> which, in my judgment, will probably forbid their ever living together upon the footing of perfect equality, and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference, I, as well as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00240.02438" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, am in favor of the race to which I belong having the superior position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5428"/>I have never said any thing to the contrary, but I hold that, notwithstanding all this, there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights <pb id="p.241" n="241"/> enumerated in the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5429"/>I hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man. I agree with <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00241.02439" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, he is not my equal in many respects-certainly not in color, perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5430"/>But in the right to eat the bread, without leave of any body else, which his own hand earns, <hi rend="italics">he is my equal, and the equal of <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00241.02440" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, and the equal of every living man.</hi></p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5431"/>Upon a subsequent occasion, when the reason for making a statement like this recurred, I said: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5432"/> </p> 
<p>While I was at the hotel to-day an elderly gentleman called upon me to know whether I was really in favor of producing perfect equality between the negroes and white people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5433"/>While I had not proposed to myself on this occasion to say much on that subject, yet as the question was asked me I thought I would occupy perhaps <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> in saying something in regard to it. I will say then, that I am not nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs> races &mdash; that I am not or ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, or intermarry with the white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs> races which I believe will forever forbid the <num value="2">two</num> races living together on terms of social and political equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5434"/>And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I, as much as any other man, am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5435"/>I say upon this occasion I do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position, the negro should be denied every thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5436"/>I do not understand that because I do not want a negro woman for a slave, I must necessarily want her for a wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5437"/>My understanding is that I can just let her alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5438"/>I am now in my <num value="50" type="ordinal">fiftieth</num> year, and I certainly never have had a black woman for either a slave or a wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5439"/>So it seems to me quite possible for us to get along without making either slaves or wives of negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5440"/>I will add to this that I have never seen to my knowledge a man, woman or child, who was in favor of producing perfect equality, social and political, between negroes and white men. I recollect of but <num value="1">one</num> distinguished instance that I ever heard of so frequently as to be satisfied of its correctness --and that is the case of <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00241.02441" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s old friend, <persName n="Johnson,Colonel,Richard,M.,," id="n0024.0015.00241.02442" reg="default:Johnson,Richard,M.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>Richard</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5441"/>I will also add to the remarks I have made (for I am not going to enter at large upon this subject), that I have never had the least apprehension that I or my friends would marry negroes, if there was no law to keep them from it ; but as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00241.02443" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> and his friends seem to be in great apprehension that they might, if there were no law to keep them from it, I give him the most solemn pledge that I will to the very last stand by the law of the <rs>State</rs>, which forbids the marrying of white people with negroes.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5442"/>There, my friends, you have briefly what I have, upon former occasions, said upon the subject to which this newspaper, to the extent of its ability, has drawn the public attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5443"/>In it you not only perceive, as a probability, that in that contest I did not at any time say I was in favor of negro suffrage ; but the absolute proof that twice-once substantially and once expressly &mdash; I declared against it. Having shown you this, there remains but a word of comment upon that newspaper article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5444"/>It is this : that I presume the editor of that paper is an honest and truth-loving man, and that he will be greatly obliged to me for furnishing him thus early an opportunity to correct the misrepresentation he has made, before it has run so long that malicious people can call him a liar. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5445"/>The Giant himself has been here recently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5446"/>I have seen a brief report of his speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5447"/>If it were otherwise unpleasant to me to introduce the subject of the negro as a topic for discussion, I might be somewhat relieved by the fact that he dealt exclusively in that subject while he was here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5448"/>I shall, therefore, without much hesitation or diffidence, enter upon this subject. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5449"/>The American people, on the <dateStruct value="1854-01-1"><day reg="1">first</day> day of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year>1854</year>,</dateStruct> found the <name>African</name> slave-trade prohibited by a law of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5450"/>In a majority of the <name>States</name> of this Union, <pb id="p.242" n="242"/> they found <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery, or any other sort of slavery, prohibited by State Constitutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5451"/>They also found a law existing, supposed to be valid, by which slavery was excluded from almost all the territory the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> then owned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5452"/>This was the condition of the country, with reference to the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, on the <dateStruct value="1854-01-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5453"/>A few days after that, a bill was introduced into Congress, which ran through its regular course in the <num value="2">two</num> branches of the <orgName n="National Legislature" type="legislature">National Legislature</orgName>, and finally passed into a law in the month of <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, by which the act of Congress prohibiting slavery from going into the <rs>Territories</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was repealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5454"/>In connection with the law itself, and, in fact, in the terms of the law, the then existing prohibition was not only repealed, but, there was a declaration of a purpose on the part of Congress never thereafter to exercise any power that they might have, real or supposed, to prohibit the extension or spread of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5455"/>This was a very great change ; for the law thus repealed was of more than <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> standing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5456"/>Following rapidly upon the heels of this action of Congress, a decision of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> is made, by which it is declared that Congress, if it desires to prohibit the spread of slavery into the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, has no Constitutional power to do so. Not only so, but that decision lays down principles, which, if pushed to their logical conclusion &mdash; I say pushed to their logical conclusion-would decide that the <name>Constitutions</name> of free States, forbidding slavery, are themselves unconstitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5457"/>Mark me, I do not say the <rs>Judge</rs> said this, and let no man say I affirm the <rs>Judge</rs> used these words ; but I only say it is my opinion that what they did say, if pressed to its logical conclusion, will inevitably result thus. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5458"/>Looking at these things, the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, as I understand its principles and policy, believe that there is great danger of the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> being spread out and extended, until it is ultimately made alike lawful in all the <name>States</name> of this Union ; so believing, to prevent that incidental and ultimate consummation, is the original and chief purpose of the <rs>Republican</rs> organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5459"/>I say <quote>chief purpose</quote> of the <rs>Republican</rs> organization ; for it is certainly true that if the <rs type="place">National House</rs> shall fall into the hands of the <name>Republicans</name>, they will have to attend to all the other matters of <placeName reg="National House">National House</placeName>-keeping, as well as this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5460"/>The chief and real purpose of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> is eminently conservative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5461"/>It proposes nothing save and except to restore this Government to its original tone in regard to this element of slavery, and there to maintain it, looking for no further change in reference to it, than that which the original framers of the <rs>Government</rs> themselves expected and looked forward to. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5462"/>The chief danger to this purpose of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> is not just now the revival of the <name>African</name> slave-trade, or the passage of a Congressional slave code, or the declaring of a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <persName n="Scott,,Dred,,," id="n0024.0015.00242.02444" reg="default:Scott,Dred,,,"><foreName>Dred</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> decision, making slavery lawful in all the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5463"/>These are not pressing us just now. They are not quite ready yet. The authors of these measures know that we are too strong for them ; but they will be upon us in due time, and we will be grappling with them hand to hand, if they are not now headed off. They are not now the chief danger to the purpose of the <rs>Republican</rs> organization ; but the most imminent danger that now threatens that purpose is that insidious Douglas Popular Sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5464"/>This is the miner and sapper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5465"/>While it does not propose to revive the <name>African</name> slave-trade, nor to pass a slave code, nor to make a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <persName n="Scott,,Dred,,," id="n0024.0015.00242.02445" reg="default:Scott,Dred,,,"><foreName>Dred</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> decision, it is preparing the onslaught and charge of these ultimate enemies when they shall be ready to come on and the word of command for them to advance shall be given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5466"/>I say this Douglas Popular Sovereignty --for there is a broad distinction, as I now understand it, between that article and a genuine Popular Sovereignty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5467"/>I believe there is a genuine popular sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5468"/>I think a definition of genuine popular sovereignty, in the abstract, would he about this : That each man shall do precisely as he pleases with himself, and with all those things which exclusively concern him. Applied to Government, this principle would be, that a General Government shall do all those things which pertain to it, and all the local Governments shall do precisely as they please in respect to those matters which exclusively concern them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5469"/><pb id="p.243" n="243"/> I understand that this Government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, under which we live, is based upon this principle; and I am misunderstood if it is supposed that I have any war to make upon that principle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5470"/>Now, what is <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00243.02446" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s Popular Sovereignty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5471"/>It is, as a principle, no other than that, if <num value="1">one</num> man chooses to make a slave of another man, neither that other man nor any body else has a right to object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5472"/>Applied in Government, as he seeks to apply it, it is this: If, in a new Territory into which a few people are beginning to enter for the purpose of making their homes, they choose to either exclude slavery from their limits, or to establish it there, however <num value="1">one</num> or the other may affect the persons to be enslaved, or the infinitely greater number of persons who are afterward to inhabit that Territory, or the other members of the families of communities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5473"/>of which they are but an incipient member, or the general head of the family of States as parent of all-however their action may affect <num value="1">one</num> or the other of these, there is no power or right to interfere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5474"/>That is <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0015.00243.02447" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s popular sovereignty applied. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5475"/>He has a good deal of trouble with popular sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5476"/>His explanations explanatory of explanations explained are interminable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5477"/>The most lengthy, and, as I suppose: the most maturely considered of his long series of explanations, is his great essay in <persName n="Harper,,,,," id="n0024.0015.00243.02448" reg="mostcommon:Harper,nomatch:0"><surname>Harper</surname></persName>'s Magazine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5478"/>I will not attempt to enter on any very thorough investigation of his argument, as there made and presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5479"/>I will nevertheless occupy a good portion of your time here in drawing your attention to certain points in it. Such of you as may have rend this document will have perceived that the <rs>Judge</rs>, early in the document, quotes from <num value="2">two</num> persons as belonging to the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, without naming them, but who can readily be recognized as being <persName n="Seward,Governor,,,," id="n0024.0015.00243.02449" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> of New York and myself: It is true, that exactly <measure n="15months" type="date">fifteen months</measure> ago this day, I believe, I for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time expressed a sentiment upon this subject, and in such manner that it should get into print, that the public might see it beyond the circle of my hearers; and my expression of it at that time is the quotation that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00243.02450" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> makes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5480"/>He has not made the quotation with accuracy, but justice to him requires me to say that it is sufficiently accurate not to change its sense. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5481"/>The sense of that quotation condensed is this &mdash; that this slavery element is a durable element of discord among us, and that we shall probably not have perfect peace in this country with it until it either masters the free principle in our Government, or is so far mastered by the free principle as for the public mind to rest in the belief that it is going to its end. This sentiment, which I now express in this way, was, at no great distance of time, perhaps in different language, and in connection with some collateral ideas, expressed by <persName n="Seward,Governor,,,," id="n0024.0015.00243.02451" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>. <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00243.02452" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> has been so much annoyed by the expression of that sentiment that he has constantly, I believe, in almost all his speeches since it was uttered, been referring to it. I find he alluded to it in his speech here, as well as in the copy-right essay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5482"/>I do not now enter upon this for the purpose of making an elaborate argument to show that me were right in the expression of that sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5483"/>In other words, I shall not stop to say all that might properly be said upon this point; but I only ask your attention to it for the purpose of making <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> point upon it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5484"/>If you will read the copy-right essay, you will discover that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00243.02453" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> himself says a controversy between the <rs>American Colonies</rs> and the <rs>Government</rs> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> began on the slavery question in <dateStruct value="1699--"><year reg="1699">1699</year></dateStruct>, and continued from that time until the <name>Revolution</name>; and, while he did not say so, we all know that it has continued with more or less violence ever since the <name>Revolution</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5485"/>Then we need not appeal to history, to the declarations of the framers of the <rs>Government</rs>, but me know from <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00243.02454" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> himself that slavery began to be an clement of discord among the white people of this country as far back as <dateStruct value="1699--"><year reg="1699">1699</year></dateStruct>, or <measure n="160years" type="date">one hundred and sixty years</measure> ago, or <num value="5">five</num> generations of men-counting <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> to a generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5486"/>Now it would seem to me that it might have occurred to <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00243.02455" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, or any body who had turned his attention to these facts, that there was something in the nature of that thing, slavery, somewhat durable for mischief and discord.

<p>There is another point I desire to make in regard to this matter, before I leave it. From the adoption of the <rs>Constitution</rs> down to <dateStruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></dateStruct> is the precise period of our history when we had comparative peace upon this question &mdash; the precise period of time when we came nearer to having peace about it than any other time of that entire <measure n="160years" type="date">one hundred and sixty years</measure>, in which he says it began, or of the <measure n="80years" type="date">eighty years</measure> of our own Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5488"/>Then it would be worth our while to stop and examine into the probable reason of our coming nearer to having peace then than at any other time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5489"/>This was the precise period of time in which our fathers adopted, and during which they followed, a policy restricting the spread of slavery, and the whole Union was acquiescing in it. The whole country looked forward to the ultimate extinction of the institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5490"/>It was when a policy had been adopted and was prevailing, which led all just and right-minded men to suppose that slavery was gradually coming to an end, and that they might be quiet about it, watching it as it expired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5491"/>I think <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00244.02456" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> might have perceived that too, and whether he did or not, it is worth the attention of fair-minded men, here and elsewhere, to consider whether that is not the truth of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5492"/>If he had looked at these <num value="2">two</num> facts, that this matter has been an element of discord for <measure n="160years" type="date">one hundred and sixty years</measure> among this people, and that the only comparative peace we have had about it was when that policy prevailed in this Government, which he now wars upon, he might then, perhaps, have been brought to a more just appreciation of what I said <measure n="15months" type="date">fifteen months</measure> ago &mdash; that <quote>a house divided against itself cannot stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5493"/>I believe that this Government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5494"/>I do not expect the house to fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5495"/>I do not expect the <rs>Union</rs> to dissolve ; but I do expect it will cease to be divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5496"/>It will become all <num value="1">one</num> thing or all the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5497"/>Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind mill rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction; or its advocates will push it forward, until it shall become alike lawful in all the <name>States</name>, old as well as new, north as well as south.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5498"/>That was my sentiment at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5499"/>In connection with it, I said, <quote>we are now far into the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> year, since a policy was inaugurated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to slavery agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5500"/>Under the operation of the policy, that agitation has not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5501"/>I now say to you here that we are advanced still farther into the <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> year since that policy of <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00244.02457" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>--that Popular Sovereignty of his, for quieting the slavery question &mdash; was made the national policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5502"/><measure n="15months" type="date">Fifteen months</measure> more have been added since I uttered that sentiment, and I call upon you, and all other right-minded men, to say whether that <measure n="15months" type="date">fifteen months</measure> have belied or corroborated my words. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5503"/>While I am here upon this subject, I cannot but express gratitude that this true view of this element of discord among us &mdash; as I believe it is &mdash; is attracting more and more attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5504"/>I do not believe that <persName n="Seward,Governor,,,," id="n0024.0015.00244.02458" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> uttered that sentiment because I had done so before, but because he reflected upon this subject and saw the truth of it. Nor do I believe, because <persName n="Seward,Governor,,,," id="n0024.0015.00244.02459" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> or I uttered it, that, <persName n="Hickman,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0015.00244.02460" reg="mostcommon:Hickman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hickman</surname></persName> of <placeName key="tgn,7007710" n="1.000 5" reg="pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</placeName>, in different language since that time, has declared his belief in the utter antagonism which exists between.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5505"/>the principles of liberty and slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5506"/>You see we are multiplying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5507"/>Now, while I am speaking of <persName n="Hickman,,,,," id="n0024.0015.00244.02461" reg="mostcommon:Hickman,nomatch:0"><surname>Hickman</surname></persName>, let me say, I know but little about him. I have never seen him, and know scarcely any thing about the man ; but I will say this much of him : Of all the anti-Lecompton Democracy that have been brought to my notice, he alone has the true, genuine ring of the metal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5508"/>And now, without indorsing any thing else he has said, I will ask this audience to give <num value="3">three</num> cheers for <persName n="Hickman,,,,," id="n0024.0015.00244.02462" reg="mostcommon:Hickman,nomatch:0"><surname>Hickman</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5510"/>It is a general feature of that document, and indeed, of all of <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00244.02464" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s discussions of this question, that the <rs>Territories</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and the <name>States</name> of this Union are exactly alikethat <pb id="p.245" n="245"/> there is no difference between them at all &mdash; that the <rs>Constitution</rs> applies to the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> precisely as it does to the States-and that the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName>, under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, may not do in a State what it may not do in a Territory, and what it must do in a State, it must do in a Territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5511"/>Gentlemen, is that a true view of the case?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5512"/>It is necessary for this squatter sovereignty ; but is it true? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5513"/>Let us consider.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5514"/>What does it depend upon?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5515"/>It depends altogether upon the proposition that the <name>States</name> must, without the interference of the <rs>General Government</rs>, do all those things that pertain exclusively to themselves-that are local in their nature, that have no connection with the <rs>General Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5516"/>After <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00245.02465" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> has established this proposition, which nobody disputes or ever has disputed, he proceeds to assume, without proving it, that slavery is <num value="1">one</num> of those little, unimportant, trivial matters which arc of just about as much consequence as the question would be to me, whether my neighbor should raise homed cattle or plant tobacco ; that there is no moral question about it; but that it is altogether a matter of dollars and cents ; that when a new Territory is opened for settlement, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> man who goes into it may plant there a thing, which, like the <rs>Canada</rs> thistle or some other of those pests of the soil, cannot be dug out by the <num value="1000000">millions</num> of men who will come thereafter ; that it is <num value="1">one</num> of those little things that is so trivial in its nature that it has no effect upon any body save the few men who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> plant upon the soil ; that it is not a thing which in any way affects the family of communities composing these States, nor any way endangers the <rs>General Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5517"/><persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00245.02466" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> ignores altogether the very well known fact, that we have never had a serious menace to our political existence, except it sprang from this thing, which he chooses to regard as only upon a par with onions and potatoes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5518"/>Turn it, and contemplate it in another view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5519"/>He says, that according to his Popular Sovereignty, the <rs>General Government</rs> may give to the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> governors, <rs type="role" n="Judge">judges</rs>, marshals, secretaries, and all the other chief men to govern them, but they must not touch upon this other question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5520"/>Why? The question of who shall be <rs type="role" reg="Governor">Governor</rs> of a Territory for a year or <num value="2">two</num>, and pass away, without his track being left upon the soil, or an act which he did for good or for evil being left behind, is a question of vast national magnitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5521"/>It is so much opposed in its nature to locality, that the nation itself must decide it ; while this other matter of planting slavery upon a soil &mdash; a thing which once planted cannot be eradicated by the succeeding <num value="1000000">millions</num> who have as much right there as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> comers, or if eradicated, not without infinite difficulty and a long struggle-he considers the power to prohibit it, as <num value="1">one</num> of these little, local, trivial things that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5522"/>the nation ought not to say a word about ; that it affects nobody save the few men who are there. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5523"/>Take these <num value="2">two</num> things and consider them together, present the question of planting a State with the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> by the side of a question of who shall be <rs type="role" reg="Governor">Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> for a year or <num value="2">two</num>, and is there a man here,--is there a man on earth, who would not say the <rs>Governor</rs> question is the little <num value="1">one</num>, and the slavery question is the great <num value="1">one</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5524"/>I ask any honest Democrat if the small, the local, and the trivial and temporary question is not, who shall be Governor.? While the durable, the important and the mischievous <num value="1">one</num> is, shall this soil be planted with slavery? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5525"/>This is an idea, I suppose, which has arisen in <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00245.02467" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s mind from his peculiar structure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5526"/>I suppose the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> really looks small to him. H e is so put up by nature that a lash upon his back would hurt him, but a lash upon any body else's back does not hurt him. That is the build of the man, and consequently he looks upon the matter of slavery in this unimportant light. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5527"/><persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00245.02468" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> ought to remember when he is endeavoring to force this policy upon the <rs>American</rs> people that while he is put up in that way a good many are not.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5528"/>In contemplation of this thing, we all know he was led to exclaim, <pb id="p.246" n="246"/> <quote>I tremble for my country when I remember that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is just!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5529"/>We know how he looked upon it when he thus expressed himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5530"/>There was danger to this country-danger of the avenging justice of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in that little unimportant Popular Sovereignty question of <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00246.02471" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5531"/>He supposed there was a question of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> eternal justice wrapped up in the enslaving of any race of men, or any man, and that those who did so braved the arm of Jehovah &mdash; that when a nation thus dared the <name>Almighty</name>, every friend of that nation had cause to dread his wrath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5532"/>Choose ye between <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0024.0015.00246.02472" reg="nearbymention:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0015.00246.02473" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> as to what is the true view of this element among us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5533"/>There is another little difficulty about this matter of treating the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> and States alike in all things, to which I ask your attention, and I shall leave this branch of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5534"/>If there is no difference between them, why not make the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> States at once?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5535"/>What is the reason that <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> was not fit to come into the <rs>Union</rs> when it was organized into a Territory, in <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00246.02474" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s view?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5536"/>Can any of you tell any reason why it should not have come into the <rs>Union</rs> at once?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5537"/>They are fit, as he thinks, to decide upon the slavery question &mdash; the largest and most important with which they could possibly deal-what could they do by coming into the <rs>Union</rs> that they are not fit to do, according to his view, by staying out of it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5538"/>Oh, they are not fit to sit in Congress and decide upon the rates of postage, or questions of <foreign lang="la">ad valorem</foreign> or specific duties on foreign goods, or live oak timber contracts ; they are not fit to decide these vastly important matters, which are national in their import, but they are fit, <quote>from the jump,</quote> to decide this little negro question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5539"/>But, gentlemen, the case is too plain ; I occupy too much time on this head, and I pass on. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5540"/>Near the close of the copy-right essay, the <rs>Judge</rs>, I think, comes very near kicking his own fat into the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5541"/>I did not think, when I commenced these remarks, that I would read from that article, but I now believe I will : <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5543"/>When the <rs>Judge</rs>.

<p><quote> Whether the number shall be fixed at <num value="10">ten</num>, <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> inhabitants, does not affect the principle.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5549"/></p> 
<p>Now I have only a few comments to make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5550"/>Popular Sovereignty, by his own words, does not pertain to the few persons who wander upon the public domain in violation of law. We have his words for that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5551"/>When it does pertain to them, is when they are sufficient to be formed into an organized political community, and he fixes the minimum for that at <num value="10000">10,000</num>, and the maximum at <num value="20000">20,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5552"/>Now I would like to know what is to be done with the <num value="9000">9,000</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5553"/>Are they all to be treated, until they are large enough to be organized into a political community, as wanderers upon the public land in violation of law?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5554"/>And if so treated and driven out, at what point of time would there ever be <num value="10000">ten thousand</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5555"/>If they were not driven out, but remained there as trespassers upon the public land in violation of the law, can they establish <pb id="p.247" n="247"/> slavery there?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5556"/>No,--the <rs>Judge</rs> says Popular Sovereignty don't pertain to them then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5557"/>Can they exclude it then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5558"/>No, Popular Sovereignty :don't pertain to them then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5559"/>I would like to know, in the case covered by the <name>Essay</name>, what condition the people of the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> are in before they reach the number of <num value="10000">ten thousand</num>? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5560"/>But the main point I wish to ask attention to is, that the question as to when they shall have reached a sufficient number to be formed into a regular organized community, is to be decided <quote>by Congress.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5561"/><persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00247.02476" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> says so. Well, gentlemen, that is about all we want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5562"/>No, that is all the <name>Southerners</name> want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5563"/>That is what all those who are for slavery want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5564"/>They do not want Congress to prohibit slavery from coming into the new <rs>Territories</rs>, and they do not want Popular Sovereignty to hinder it; and as Congress is to say when they are ready to be organized, all that the <rs>South</rs> has to do is to get Congress to hold off. Let Congress hold off until they are ready to be admitted as a State, and the <rs>South</rs> has all it wants in taking slavery into and planting it in all the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> that we now have, or hereafter may have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5565"/>In a word, the whole thing, at a dash of the pen, is at last put in the power of Congress ; for if they do not have this Popular Sovereignty until Congress organizes them, I ask if it at last does not come from Congress?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5566"/>If, at last, it amounts to any thing at all, Congress, gives it to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5567"/>I submit this rather for your reflection than for comment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5568"/>After all that is said, at last by a dash of the pen, every thing that has gone before is undone, and he puts the whole question under the control of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5569"/>After fighting through more than <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure>, if you undertake to read it, he at last places the whole matter under the control of that power which he had been contending against, and arrives at a result directly contrary to what he had been laboring to do. He at last leaves the whole matter to the control of Congress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5570"/>There are <num value="2">two</num> main objects, as I understand it, of this <persName n="Harper,,,,," id="n0024.0015.00247.02477" reg="mostcommon:Harper,nomatch:0"><surname>Harper</surname></persName>'s Magazine essay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5571"/><num value="1">One</num> was to show, if possible, that the men of our revolutionary times were in favor of his Popular Sovereignty ; and the other was to show that the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision had not entirely squelched out this Popular Sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5572"/>I do not propose, in regard to this argument drawn from the history of former times, to enter into a detailed examination of the historical statements he has made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5573"/>I have the impression that they are inaccurate in a great many instances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5574"/>Sometimes in positive statement, but very much more inaccurate by the suppression of statements that really belong to the history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5575"/>But I do not propose to affirm that this is so to any very great extent ; or to enter into a very minute examination of his historical statements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5576"/>I avoid doing so upon this principle &mdash; that if it were important for me to pass out of this lot in the least period of time possible, and I came to that fence and saw by a calculation of my known strength and agility that I could clear it at a bound, it would be folly for me to stop and consider whether I could or not crawl through a crack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5577"/>So I say of the whole history, contained in his essay, where he endeavored to link the men of the <name>Revolution</name> to Popular Sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5578"/>It only requires an effort to leap out of it-a single bound to be entirely successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5579"/>If you read it over you will find that he quotes here and there from documents of the revolutionary times, tending to show that the people of the colonies were desirous of regulating their own concerns in their own way, that the <rs>British Government</rs> should not interfere ; that at <num value="1">one</num> time they struggled with the <rs>British Government</rs> to be permitted to exclude the <name>African</name> slave-trade ; if not directly, to be permitted to exclude it indirectly by taxation sufficient to discourage and destroy it. From these and many things of this sort, <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00247.02478" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> argues that they were in favor of the people of our own Territories excluding slavery if they wanted to, or planting it there if they wanted to, doing just as they pleased from the time they settled upon the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5580"/>Now, however his history may apply, and whatever of his argument there may be that is sound and accurate or unsound and inaccurate, if we can find out what these men did themselves do upon this very question of slavery in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, does it not end the whole thing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5581"/>If after all this labor and effort to show that the men of the <name>Revolution</name> were in favor of his Popular Sovereignty and his mode of dealing with slavery in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, we can show that these very men took hold of that subject, and dealt with it, we can <pb id="p.248" n="248"/> see for ourselves how they dealt with it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5582"/>It is precisely upon that part of the history of the country, that <num value="1">one</num> important omission is made by <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00248.02479" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5583"/>He selects parts of the history of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> upon the subject of slavery, and treats it as the whole, omitting from his historical sketch the legislation of Congress in regard to the admission of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, by which the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs> was established, and slavery excluded from a country half as large as the present <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5584"/>All this is left out of his history, and in nowise alluded to by him, so far as I can remember, save once, when he makes a remark, that upon his principle the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> were authorized to pronounce a decision that the act called the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs> was unconstitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5585"/>All that history has been left out. But this part of the history of the country was not made by the men of the <name>Revolution</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5586"/>There was another part of our political history made by the very men who were the actors in the <name>Revolution</name>, which has taken the name of the <name>Ordinance</name> of &lsquo;<num value="87">87</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5587"/>Let me bring that history to your attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5588"/>In <dateStruct value="1784--"><year reg="1784">1784</year></dateStruct>, I believe, this same <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0015.00248.02480" reg="nearbymention:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> drew up an ordinance for the government of the country upon which we now stand ; or rather a frame or draft of an ordinance for the government of this country, here in <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, our neighbors in <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>, us who live in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, our neighbors in <placeName reg="Wisconsin" key="tgn,7007922">Wisconsin</placeName> and <placeName reg="Michigan" key="tgn,7007520">Michigan</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5589"/>In that ordinance, drawn up not only for the government of that Territory, but for the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> south of the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio River</placeName>, <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0015.00248.02481" reg="nearbymention:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> expressly provided for the prohibition of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5590"/><persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00248.02482" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> says, and perhaps is right, that that provision was lost from that ordinance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5591"/>I believe that is true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5592"/>When the vote was taken upon it, a majority of all present in the <orgName n="Confederation Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Confederation</orgName> voted for it; but there were so many absentees that those voting for it did not make the clear majority necessary, and it was lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5593"/>But <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> after that the <orgName n="Confederation Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Confederation</orgName> were together again, and they adopted a new ordinance for the government of this <placeName reg="Northwest, Tioga, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2550350">Northwest Territory</placeName>, not contemplating territory south of the river, for the <name>States</name> owning that territory had hitherto refrained from giving it to the <rs>General Government</rs>; hence they made the ordinance to apply only to what the <rs>Government</rs> owned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5594"/>In that, the provision excluding slavery <hi rend="italics">was inserted and passed unanimously</hi>, or at any rate it passed and became a part of the law of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5595"/>Under that ordinance we live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5596"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> here in <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> you were a Territory, then an enabling act was passed, authorizing you to form a Constitution and State Government, provided it was republican and not in conflict with the <name>Ordinance</name> of <num value="87">87</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5597"/>When you framed your Constitution and presented it for admission, I think you will find the legislation upon the subject will show that, <quote>whereas you had formed a Constitution that was republican, and not in conflict with the <name>Ordinance</name> of <num value="87">87</num>,</quote> therefore, you were admitted upon equal footing with the original States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5598"/>The same process in a few years was gone through with in <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>, and so with <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, and the same substantially with <placeName reg="Michigan" key="tgn,7007520">Michigan</placeName> and <placeName reg="Wisconsin" key="tgn,7007922">Wisconsin</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5599"/>Not only did that ordinance prevail, but it was constantly looked to whenever a step was taken by a new Territory to become a <orgName n="State Congress" type="congress">State. Congress</orgName> always turned their attention to it, and in all their movements upon this subject, they traced their course by that Ordinance of <num value="87">87</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5600"/>When they admitted new States, they advertised them of this ordinance as a part of the legislation of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5601"/>They did so because they had traced the <name>Ordinance</name> of <num value="87">87</num> throughout the history of this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5602"/>Begin with the men of the <name>Revolution</name>, and go down for <num value="60">sixty</num> entire years, and until the last scrap of that Territory comes into the <rs>Union</rs> in the form of the <placeName reg="Wisconsin" key="tgn,7007922">State of Wisconsin</placeName>-every thing was made to conform with the <name>Ordinance</name> of &lsquo;<num value="87">87</num>, excluding slavery from that vast extent of country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5603"/>I omitted to mention in the right place that the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> was in process of being framed when that ordinance was made by the <orgName n="Confederation Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Confederation</orgName>; and <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> acts of Congress itself, under the new Constitution itself, was to give force to that ordinance by putting power to carry it out in the hands of the new officers under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, in the place of the old <pb id="p.249" n="249"/> ones, who had been legislated out of existence by the change in the <rs>Government</rs> from the <name>Confederation</name> to the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5604"/>Not only so, but I believe <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName> once or twice, if not <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, petitioned the <rs>General Government</rs> for the privilege of suspending that provision and allowing them to have slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5605"/>A report made by <persName n="Randolph,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0015.00249.02483" reg="mostcommon:Randolph,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Randolph</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, himself a slaveholder, was directly against it, and the action was to refuse them the privilege of violating the <name>Ordinance</name> of &lsquo;<num value="87">87</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5606"/>This period of history, which I have run over briefly, is, I presume, as familiar to most of this assembly as any other part of the history of our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5607"/>I suppose that few of my hearers are not as familiar with that part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5608"/>of history as I am, and I only mention it to recall your attention to it at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5609"/>And hence I ask how extraordinary a thing it is that a man who has occupied a position upon the floor of the <orgName n="United States Senate" type="senate">Senate of the United States</orgName>, who is now in his <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> term, and who looks to see the <rs>Government</rs> of this whole country fall into his own hands, pretending to give a truthful and accurate history of the slavery question in this country, should so entirely ignore the whole of that portion of our history &mdash; the most important of all. Is it not a most extraordinary spectacle, that a man should stand up and ask for any confidence in his statements who sets out as he does with portions of history, calling upon the people to believe that it is a true and fair representation, when the leading part, and controlling feature of the whole history is carefully suppressed? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5610"/>But the mere leaving out is not the most remarkable feature of this most remarkable essay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5611"/>His proposition is to establish that the leading men of the <name>Revolution</name> were for his great principle of non-intervention by the <rs>Government</rs> in the question of slavery in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> ; while history shows that they decided in the cases actually brought before them, in exactly the contrary way, and he knows it. Not only did they so decide at that time, but they stuck to it during <measure n="60years" type="date">sixty years</measure>, through thick and thin, as long as there was <num value="1">one</num> of the revolutionary heroes upon the stage of political action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5612"/>Through their whole course, from <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to fast, they clung to freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5613"/>And now he asks the community to believe that the men of the <name>Revolution</name> were in favor of his great principle, when we have the naked history that they themselves dealt with this: very subject-matter of his principle, and utterly repudiated his principle acting upon a precisely contrary ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5614"/>It is as impudent and absurd as if a prosecuting attorney should stand up before a jury, and ask them to convict A as the murderer of B, while B was walking alive before them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5615"/>I pay again, if <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00249.02484" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> asserts that the men of the <name>Revolution</name> acted upon principles by which, to be consistent with themselves, they ought to have adopted his popular sovereignty, then, upon a consideration of his own argument, he had a right to make you believe that they understood the principles of government, but misapplied them &mdash; that he has arisen to enlighten the world as to the just application of this principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5616"/>He has a right to try to persuade you that he understands their principles better than they did, and, therefore, he will apply them now, not as they did, but as they ought to have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5617"/>He has a right to go before the community, and try to convince them of this; but he has no right to attempt to impose upon any <num value="1">one</num> the belief that these men themselves approved of his great principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5618"/>There are <num value="2">two</num> ways of establishing a proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5619"/><num value="1">One</num> is by trying to demonstrate it upon reason; and the other is, to show that great men in former times have thought so and so, and thus to pass it by the weight of pure authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5620"/>Now, if <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00249.02485" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> will demonstrate somehow that this is popular sovereignty &mdash; the right of <num value="1">one</num> man to make a slave of another, without any right in that other or any <num value="1">one</num> else to object-demonstrate it as <persName><foreName>Euclid</foreName></persName> demonstrated propositions &mdash; there is no objection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5621"/>But when he comes forward, seeking to carry a principle by bringing to it the authority of men who themselves utterly repudiate that principle, I ask that he shall not be permitted to do it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5622"/>I see, in the <rs>Judge</rs>'s speech here, a short sentence in these words : <quote>Our fathers, when they formed this Government under which we live, understood this question just as well and even better than we do now.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5623"/>That is true; I stick to that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5624"/>I <pb id="p.250" n="250"/> will stand by <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00250.02486" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> in that to the bitter end. And now, <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00250.02487" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, come and stand by me, and truthfully show how they acted, understanding it better than me do. All I ask of you, <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00250.02488" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, is to stick to the proposition that the men of the <name>Revolution</name> understood this subject better than we do now, and with that <hi rend="italics">better understanding they acted better than you are trying to act now.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5625"/>I wish to say something now in regard to the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision, as dealt with by <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00250.02489" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5626"/>In that <quote>memorable debate</quote> between <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00250.02490" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> and myself, last year, the <rs>Judge</rs> thought fit to commence a process of catechising me, and at <placeName key="tgn,2027931" n="1.000 13" reg="freeport, stephenson, illinois">Freeport</placeName> I answered his questions, and propounded some to him. Among others propounded to him was <num value="1">one</num> that I have here now. The substance, as I remember it, is, <quote>Can the people of a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> Territory, under the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision, in any lawful way, against the wish of any citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, exclude slavery from its limits, prior to the formation of a State Constitution?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5627"/>He answered that they could lawfully exclude slavery from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> Territories, notwithstanding the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5628"/>There was something about that answer that has probably been a trouble to the <rs>Judge</rs> ever since. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5629"/>The <rs>Dred Scott</rs>, decision expressly gives every citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> a right to carry his slaves into the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> Territories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5630"/>And now there was some inconsistency in saying that the decision was right, and saying, too, that the people of the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> could lawfully drive slavery out again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5631"/>When all the trash, the words, the collateral matter, was cleared away from it-all the chaff was fanned out of it, it was a bare absurdity--<hi rend="italics">no less than that a thing may be lawfully driven away from where it has a lawful right to be</hi>. Clear it of all the verbiage, and that is the naked truth of his proposition &mdash; that a thing may be lawfully driven from the place where it has a lawful right to stay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5632"/>Well, it was because the <rs>Judge</rs> couldnt help seeing this, that he has had so much trouble with it; and what I want to ask your especial attention to, just now, is to remind you, if you have not noticed the fact, that the <rs>Judge</rs> does not any longer say that the people can exclude slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5633"/>He does not say so in the copy-right essay ; he did not say so in the speech that he made here; and, so far as I know, since his re-election to the <name>Senate</name>, he has never said, as he did at <placeName key="tgn,2027931" n="1.000 13" reg="freeport, stephenson, illinois">Freeport</placeName>, that the people of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> can exclude slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5634"/>He desires that you, who wish the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> to remain free, should believe that he stands by that position, but he does not say it himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5635"/>He escapes to some extent the absurd position I have stated by changing his language entirely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5636"/>What he says now is something different in language, and we will consider whether it is not different in sense too. It is now that the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision, or rather the <rs>Constitution</rs> under that decision, does not carry slavery into the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> beyond the power of the people of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> <hi rend="italics">to control it as other property</hi>. He does not say the people can drive it out, but, they can control it as other property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5637"/>The language is different ; we should consider whether the sense is different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5638"/>Driving a horse out of this lot is too plain a proposition to be mistaken about ; it is putting him on the other side of the fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5639"/>Or it might be a sort of exclusion of him from the lot if you were to kill him and let the worms devour him ; but neither of these things is the same as <quote>controlling him as other property.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5640"/>That would be to feed him, to pamper him, to ride him, to use and abuse him, to make the most money out of him <quote>as other property ;</quote> but please you, what do the men who are in favor of slavery want more than this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5641"/>What do they really want, other than that slavery, being in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, shall be controlled as other property? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5642"/>If they want any thing else, I do not comprehend it. I ask your attention to this, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, for the purpose of pointing out the change of ground the <rs>Judge</rs> has made ; and, in the second place, the importance of the change &mdash; that that change is not such as to give you gentlemen who want his popular sovereignty the power to exclude the institution or drive it out at all. I know the <rs>Judge</rs> sometimes squints at the argument that in controlling it as other property by unfriendly legislation they may control it to death, as you might in the case of a horse, perhaps, feed him so lightly and ride him so much that he would die. But when you come to legislative control, there is something <pb id="p.251" n="251"/> more to be attended to. I have no doubt, myself, that if the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> should undertake to control slave property as other property &mdash; that is, control it in such a way that it would be the most valuable as property, and make it bear its just proportion in the way of burdens as property-really deal with it as property &mdash; the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName> will say, <quote><name n="God" type="God">God</name> speed you and amen.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5643"/>But I undertake to give the opinion, at least, that if the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> attempt by any direct legislation to drive the man with his slave out of the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>, or to decide that his slave is free because of his being taken in there, or to tax him to such an-extent that he cannot keep him there, the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> will unhesitatingly decide all such legislation unconstitutional, as long as that <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> is constructed as the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> is. The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="2">two</num> things they have already decided, except that there is a little quibble among lawyers between the words <foreign lang="la">dicta</foreign> and decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5644"/>They have already decided a negro cannot be made free by territorial legislation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5645"/>What is that <persName n="Scott,,Dred,,," id="n0024.0015.00251.02491" reg="default:Scott,Dred,,,"><foreName>Dred</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> decision?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5647"/>It is a long opinion, but it is all embodied in this short statement: <quote>The <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> forbids Congress to deprive a man of his property, without due process of law; the right of property in slaves is distinctly and expressly affirmed in that Constitution ; therefore if Congress shall undertake to say that a man's slave is no longer his slave, when he crosses a certain line into a Territory, that is depriving him of his property without due process of law, and is unconstitutional.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5648"/>There is the whole <persName n="Scott,,Dred,,," id="n0024.0015.00251.02493" reg="default:Scott,Dred,,,"><foreName>Dred</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5649"/>They add that if Congress cannot do so itself, Congress cannot confer any power to do so, and hence any effort by the <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> to do either of these things is absolutely decided against.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5650"/>It is a foregone conclusion by that court. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5651"/>Now, as to this indirect mode by <quote>unfriendly legislation,</quote> all lawyers here will readily understand that such a proposition cannot be tolerated for a moment, because a legislature cannot indirectly do that which it cannot accomplish directly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5652"/>Then I say any legislation to control this property, as property, for its benefit as property, would be hailed by this <persName n="Scott,,Dred,,," id="n0024.0015.00251.02494" reg="default:Scott,Dred,,,"><foreName>Dred</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>, and fully sustained; but any legislation driving slave property out, or destroying it as property, directly or indirectly, will most assuredly, by that court, be held unconstitutional. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5653"/><persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00251.02495" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> says if the <rs>Constitution</rs> carries slavery into the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, beyond the power of the people of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> to control it as other property, then it follows logically that every <num value="1">one</num> who swears to support the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, must give that support to that property which it needs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5654"/>And if the <rs>Constitution</rs> carries slavery into the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, beyond the power of the people to control it as other property, then it also carries it into the <name>States</name>, because the <rs>Constitution</rs> is the supreme law of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5655"/>Now, gentlemen, if it were not for my excessive modesty I would say that I told that very thing to <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00251.02496" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> quite a year ago. This argument is here in print, and if it were not for my modesty, as I said, I might call your attention to it. If you read it, you will find that I not only made that argument, but made it better than he has made it since. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5656"/>There is, however, this difference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5657"/>I say now, and said then, there is no sort of question that the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> <hi rend="italics">has</hi> decided that it is the right of the slaveholder to take his slave and hold him in the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> ; and saying this, <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00251.02497" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> himself admits the conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5658"/>He says if that is so, this consequence will follow ; and because this consequence would follow, his argument is, the decision cannot, therefore, be that way-<quote>that would spoil my Popular Sovereignty, and it cannot be possible that this great principle has been squelched out in this extraordinary way. It might be, if it were not for the extraordinary consequences of spoiling my humbug.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5659"/></p> 
<p>Another feature of the <rs>Judge</rs>'s argument about the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> case is, an effort to show that that decision deals altogether in declarations of negatives ; that the <rs>Constitution</rs> does not affirm any thing as expounded by the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision, but it only declares a want of power &mdash; a total absence of power, in reference to the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5660"/>It seems to be his purpose to make the whole of that decision to result in a mere negative declaration of a want of power in Congress to do any thing in relation to this <pb id="p.252" n="252"/> matter in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5661"/>I know the opinion of the <rs>Judges</rs> states that there is a total absence of power; but that is, unfortunately, not all it states ; for the <rs>Judges</rs> add that the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5662"/>It does not stop at saying that the right of property in a slave is recognized in the <rs>Constitution</rs>, is declared to exist somewhere in the <rs>Constitution</rs>, but says it is <hi rend="italics">affirmed</hi> in the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5663"/>Its language is equivalent to saying that it is embodied and so woven into that instrument that it cannot be detached without breaking the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5664"/>In a word, it is part of the <rs>Constitution</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5665"/><persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0015.00252.02498" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> is singularly unfortunate in his effort to make out that decision to be altogether negative, when the express language at the vital part is that this is distinctly affirmed in the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5666"/>I think myself, and I repeat it here, that this decision does not merely carry slavery into the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, but by its logical conclusion it carries it into the <name>States</name> in which we live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5667"/><num value="1">One</num> provision of that Constitution is, that it shalt be the supreme law of the land &mdash; I do not quote the language-any Constitution or law of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5668"/>This <persName n="Scott,,Dred,,," id="n0024.0015.00252.02499" reg="default:Scott,Dred,,,"><foreName>Dred</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> decision says that the right of property in a slave is affirmed in that Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land, any State Constitution or law notwithstanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5669"/>Then I say that to destroy a thing which is distinctly affirmed and supported by the supreme law of the land, even by a State Constitution or law, is a violation of that supreme law, and there is no escape from it. In my judgment there is no avoiding that result, save that the <rs>American</rs> people shall see that Constitutions are better construed than our Constitution is construed in that decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5670"/>They must take care that it is more faithfully and truly carried out than it is there expounded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5671"/>I must hasten to a conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5672"/>Near the beginning of my remarks, I said that this insidious Douglas Popular Sovereignty is the measure that now threatens the purpose of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, to prevent slavery from being nationalized in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5673"/>I propose to ask your attention for a little while to some propositions in affirmance of that statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5674"/>Take it just as it stands, and apply it as a principle; extend and apply that principle elsewhere and consider where it will lead you. I now put this proposition, that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00252.02500" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s Popular Sovereignty applied will reopen the <name>African</name> slave-trade ; and I will demonstrate it by any variety of ways in which you can turn the subject or look at it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5675"/>The <rs>Judge</rs> says that the people of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> have the right, by his principle, to have slaves, if they want them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5676"/>Then I say that the people in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> have the right to buy slaves in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, if they want them, and I defy any man on earth to show any distinction between the <num value="2">two</num> things &mdash; to show that the <num value="1">one</num> is either more wicked or more unlawful ; to show, on original principles, that <num value="1">one</num> is better or worse than the other ; or to show by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, that <num value="1">one</num> differs a whit from the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5677"/>He will tell me, doubtless, that there is no Constitutional provision against people taking slaves into the new <rs>Territories</rs>, and I tell him that there is equally no Constitutional provision against buying slaves in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5678"/>He will tell you that a people, in the exercise of popular sovereignty, ought to do as they please about that thing, and have slaves if they want them ; and I tell you that the people of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> are as much entitled to popular sovereignty and to buy slaves in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, if they want them, as the people of the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> are to have slaves if they want them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5679"/>I ask any man, dealing honestly with himself, to point out a distinction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5680"/>I have recently seen a letter of <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00252.02501" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s in which, without stating that to be the object, he doubtless endeavors to make a distinction between the <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5681"/>He says he is unalterably opposed to the repeal of the laws against the <name>African</name> slave-trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5682"/>And why?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5683"/>He then seeks to give a reason that would not apply to his popular sovereignty in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5684"/>What is that reason?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5685"/><quote>The abolition of the <name>African</name> slave-trade is a compromise of the <rs>Constitution</rs>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5686"/>I deny it. There is no truth in the proposition that the abolition of the <name>African</name> slave-trade is a compromise of the constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5687"/>No man can put his finger on anything in the constitution on the line of history which shows it!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5688"/>It is a mere barren assertion, made simply for the <pb id="p.253" n="253"/> purpose of getting up a distinction between the revival of the <name>African</name> slave-trade and his <quote>great principle.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5689"/></p> 
<p>At the time the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> was adopted it was expected that the slave-trade would be abolished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5690"/>I should assert, and insist upon that, if <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00253.02502" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> denied it. But I know that it was equally expected that slavery would be excluded from the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, and I can show by history, that in regard to these <num value="2">two</num> things, public opinion was exactly alike, while in regard to positive action, there was more done in the <name>Ordinance</name> of &lsquo;<num value="87">87</num> to resist the spread of slavery than was ever done to abolish the foreign slave-trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5691"/>Lest I be misunderstood, I say again that at the time of the formation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, public expectation was that the slave-trade would be abolished, but no more so than the spread of slavery in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> should be restrained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5692"/>They stand alike, except that in the <name>Ordinance</name> of <num value="87">87</num> there was a mark left by public opinion, showing that it was more committed against the spread of slavery in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> than against the foreign slave-trade. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5693"/>Compromise! What word of compromise was there about it. Why, the public sense was then in favor of the abolition of the slave-trade ; but there was at the time a very great commercial interest involved in it and extensive capital in that branch of trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5694"/>There were doubtless the incipient stages of improvement in the <rs>South</rs> in the wily of farming, dependent on the slave-trade, and they made a proposition to Congress to abolish the trade after allowing it <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>, a sufficient time for the capital and commerce engaged in it to be transferred to other channels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5695"/>They made no provision that it should be abolished in <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> ; I do not doubt that they expected it would be ; but they made no bargain about it. The public sentiment left no doubt in the minds of any that it would be done away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5696"/>I repeat, there is nothing in the history of those times in favor of that matter being a <hi rend="italics">compromise</hi> of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5697"/>It was the public expectation at the time, manifested in a <num value="1000">thousand</num> ways, that the spread of slavery should also be restricted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5698"/>Then I say if this principle is established, that there is no wrong in slavery, and whoever wants it has a right to have it, is a matter of dollars and cents, a sort of question as to how they shall deal with brutes, that between us and the negro here there is no sort of question, but that at the <rs>South</rs> the question is between the negro and the crocodile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5699"/>That is all. It is a mere matter of policy; there is a perfect right according to interest to do just as you please-when this is done, where this doctrine prevails, the miners and sappers will have formed public opinion for the slave-trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5700"/>They will be ready for <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0024.0015.00253.02503" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> and <persName n="Stephens,,,,," id="n0024.0015.00253.02504" reg="mostcommon:Stephens,Alexander,H.,,:2"><surname>Stephens</surname></persName> and other leaders of that company, to sound the bugle for the revival of the slave-trade, for the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <persName n="Scott,,Dred,,," id="n0024.0015.00253.02505" reg="default:Scott,Dred,,,"><foreName>Dred</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> decision, for the flood of slavery to be poured over the free States, while we shall be here tied down and helpless and run over like sheep. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5701"/>It is to be a part and parcel of this same idea, to say to men who want to adhere to the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>, who have always belonged to that party, and are only looking about for some excuse to stick to it, but nevertheless hate slavery, that <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0015.00253.02506" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s popular sovereignty is as good a way as any to oppose slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5702"/>They allow themselves to be persuaded easily in accordance with their previous dispositions, into this belief, that it is about as good a way of opposing slavery as any, and we can do that without straining our old party ties or breaking up old political associations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5703"/>We can do so without being called negro worshipers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5704"/>We can do that without being subjected to the jibes and sneers that are so readily thrown out in place of argument where no argument am be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5705"/>So let us stick to this popular sovereignty-this insidious popular sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5706"/>Now let me call your attention to <num value="1">one</num> thing that has really happened, which shows this gradual and steady debauching of public opinion, this course of preparation for the revival of the slave-trade, for the territorial slave code, and the new <persName n="Scott,,Dred,,," id="n0024.0015.00253.02507" reg="default:Scott,Dred,,,"><foreName>Dred</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> decision that is to carry slavery into the free States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5707"/>Did you ever, <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> ago, hear of any body in the world saying that the negro had no share in the <name>Declaration</name> of National Independence; that it did not <pb id="p.254" n="254"/> mean negroes at all; and when <quote>all men</quote> were spoken of negroes were not included? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5708"/>I am satisfied that <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> ago that proposition was not put upon paper by any living being any where.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5709"/>I have been unable at any time to find a man in an audience who would declare that he had ever known of any body saying so <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> ago. But last year there was not a Douglas popular sovereign in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> who did not say it. Is there <num value="1">one</num> in <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> but declares his firm belief that the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> did not mean negroes at all?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5710"/>I do not know how this is; I have not been here much; but I presume you are very much alike every where.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5711"/>Then I suppose that all now express the belief that the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> never did mean negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5712"/>I call upon <num value="1">one</num> of them to say that he said it <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> ago. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5713"/>If you think that now, and did not think it then, the next thing that strikes me is to remark that there has been a <hi rend="italics">change</hi> wrought in you, and a very significant change it is, being no less than changing the negro, in your estimation, from the rank of a man to that of a brute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5714"/>They are taking him down, and placing him, when spoken of, among reptiles and crocodiles, as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0015.00254.02508" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> himself expresses it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5715"/>Is not this change wrought in your minds a very important change?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5716"/>Public opinion in this country is every thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5717"/>In a nation like ours this popular sovereignty and squatter sovereignty have already wrought a change in the public mind to the extent I have stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5718"/>There is no man in this crowd who can contradict it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5719"/>Now, if you are opposed to slavery honestly, as much as any body, I ask you to note that fact, and the like of which is to follow, to be plastered on, layer after layer, until very soon you are prepared to deal with the negro every where us with the brute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5720"/>If public sentiment has not been debauched already to this point, a new turn of the screw in that direction is all that is wanting; and this is constantly being done by the teachers of this insidious popular sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5721"/>You need but <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> turns further until your minds, now ripening under these teachings, will be ready for all these things, and you will receive and support, or submit to, the slave-trade, revived with all its horrors, a slave code enforced in our Territories, and a new <persName n="Scott,,Dred,,," id="n0024.0015.00254.02509" reg="default:Scott,Dred,,,"><foreName>Dred</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> decision to bring slavery up into the very heart of the free <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5722"/>This, I must, say, is but carrying out those words prophetically spoken by <persName n="Clay,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0015.00254.02510" reg="mostcommon:Clay,Henry,,,:24"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName>, many, many years ago &mdash; I believe more than <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>, when he told an audience that if they would repress all tendencies to liberty and ultimate emancipation, they must go back to the era of our independence and muzzle the cannon which thundered its annual joyous return on the <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">Fourth</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> ; they must blow out the moral lights around us ; they must penetrate the human soul and eradicate the love of liberty; but until they did these things, and others eloquently enumerated by him, they could not repress all tendencies to ultimate emancipation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5723"/>I ask attention to the fact that in a pre-eminent degree these popular sovereigns are at this work; blowing out the moral lights around us; teaching that the negro is no longer a man but a brute; that the <name>Declaration</name> has nothing to do with him ; that he ranks with the crocodile and the reptile ; that man, with body and soul, is a matter of dollars and cents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5724"/>I suggest to this portion of the <rs>Ohio Republicans</rs>, or Democrats, if there be any present, the serious consideration of this fact, that there is now going on among you a steady process of debauching public opinion on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5729"/>I understand that you have had recently with you my very distinguished friend, <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0016.00255.02512" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, and I understand, without having had an opportunity (not greatly sought to be sure) of seeing a report of the speech that he made here, that he did me the honor to mention my humble name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5730"/>I suppose that he did so for the purpose of making some objection to some sentiment at some time expressed by me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5731"/>I did, <measure n="15months" type="date">fifteen months</measure> ago, express that opinion, and upon many occasions <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0016.00255.02514" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> has denounced it, and has greatly, intentionally or unintentionally, misrepresented my purpose in the expression of that opinion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5732"/>I presume, without having seen a report of his speech, that he did so here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5733"/>I presume that he alluded also to that opinion in different language, having been expressed at a subsequent time by <persName n="Seward,Governor,,,," id="n0024.0016.00255.02515" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> of New York, and that he took the <num value="2">two</num> in a lump and denounced them; that he tried to point out that there was something couched in this opinion which led to the making of an entire uniformity of the local institutions of the various States of the <rs>Union</rs>, in utter disregard of the different States, which in their nature would seem to require a variety of institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5734"/>and a variety of laws conforming to the differences in the nature of the different States Not only so; I presume he insisted that this was a declaration of war between the free and slave States--that it was the sounding to the onset of continual war between the different States, the slave and free States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5735"/>This charge, in this form, was made by <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0016.00255.02516" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, on, I believe, the <dateStruct value="1858-07-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year>1858</year>,</dateStruct> in <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>, in my hearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5736"/>On the next evening, I made some reply to it I informed him that many of the inferences he drew from that expression of mine were altogether foreign to any purpose entertained by me, and in so far as he should ascribe these inferences to me, as my purpose, he was entirely mistaken ; and in so far as he might argue that whatever might be my purpose, actions, conforming to my views, would lead to these results, he might argue and establish if he could; but, so far as purposes were concerned, he was totally mistaken as to me. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5740"/>So, upon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> occasion that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0016.00256.02517" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> got an opportunity to reply to me, he passed by the whole body of what I had said upon that subject, and seized upon the particular expression of mine, that I had no purpose of entering into the slave States to disturb the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>. <quote>Oh, no,</quote> said he, <quote>he (<persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0024.0016.00256.02518" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>) wont enter into the slave States to disturb the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> ; he is too prudent a man to do such a thing as that ; he only means that he will go on to the line between the free and slave States, and shoot over at them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5741"/>This is all he means to do. He means to do them all the harm he can, to disturb them all he can, in such a way as to keep his own hide in perfect safety.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5742"/></p> 
<p>Well, now, I did not think, at that time, that that was either a very dignified or very logical argument; but so it was, I had to get along with it as well as I could. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5743"/>It has occured to me here to-night, that if I ever do shoot over the line at the people on the other side of the line into a slave State, and purpose to do so, keeping my skin safe, that I have now about the best chance I shall ever have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5744"/>I should not wonder that there are some <persName><foreName>Kentuckians</foreName></persName> about this audience ; me are close to <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> ; and whether that be so or not, we are on elevated ground, and by speaking distinctly, I should not wonder if some of the <name>Kentuckians</name> would hear me on the other side of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5745"/>For that reason I propose to address a portion of what I have to say to the <name>Kentuckians</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5746"/>I say, then, in the first place, to the <name>Kentuckians</name>, that I am what they call, as I understand it, a <quote>Black Republican.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5747"/>I think slavery is wrong, morally and politically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5748"/>I desire that it should be no further spread in these <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and I should not object if it should gradually terminate in the whole Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5749"/>While I say this for myself, I say to you <persName><foreName>Kentuckians</foreName></persName>, that I understand you differ radically with me upon this proposition; that you believe slavery is a good thing; that slavery is right; that it ought to be extended and perpetuated in this Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5750"/>Now, there being this broad difference between us, I do not pretend in addressing myself to you <persName><foreName>Kentuckians</foreName></persName>, to attempt proselyting you; that would be a vain effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5751"/>I do not enter upon it. I only propose to try to show you that you ought to nominate for the next Presidency, at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, my distinguished friend, <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0016.00256.02519" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5752"/>In all that there is a difference between you and him, I understand he is sincerely for you, and more wisely for you, than you are for yourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5753"/>I will try to demonstrate that proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5754"/>Understand now, I say that I believe he is as sincerely for you, and more wisely for you, than you are for yourselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5755"/>What do you want more than anything else to make successful your views of slavery &mdash; to advance the outspread of it, and to secure and perpetuate the nationality of it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5756"/>What do you want more than any thing else?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5757"/>What is needed absolutely?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5758"/>What is indispensable to you?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5759"/>Why! if I may be allowed to answer the question, it is to retain a hold upon the <rs>North</rs>--it is to retain support and strength from the free States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5760"/>If you can get this support and strength from the free States you can <pb id="p.257" n="257"/> succeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5761"/>If you do not get this support and this strength from the free States, you are in the minority, and you are beaten at ones. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5762"/>If that proposition be admitted-and it is undeniable-then the next thing I say to you is, that <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0016.00257.02520" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> of all the men in this nation is the only man that affords you any hold upon the free States ; that no other man can give you any strength in the free States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5763"/>This being so if you doubt the other branch of the proposition, whether he is for you-whether he is really for you, as I have expressed it, I propose asking your attention for a while to a few facts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5764"/>The issue between you and me, understand, is, that I think slavery is wrong, and ought not to be outspread, and you think it is right and ought to be extended and perpetuated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5765"/>[A voice, <quote>Oh, <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>.</quote> ] That is my Kentuckian I am talking to now. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5766"/>I now proceed to try to show you that <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0016.00257.02521" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> is as sincerely for you and more wisely for you than you are for yourselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5767"/>In the first place we know that in a Government like this, in a Government of the people, where the voice of all the men of that country, substantially, enters into the execution &mdash; or administration rather &mdash; of the <rs>Government</rs> &mdash; in such a Government, what lies at the bottom of all of it, is public opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5768"/>I lay down the proposition, that <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0016.00257.02522" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> is not only the man that promises you in advance a hold upon the <rs>North</rs>, and support in the <name>Earth</name>, but that he constantly moulds public opinion to your ends ; that in every possible way he can, he constantly moulds the public opinion of the <rs>North</rs> to your ends ; and if there are a few things in which he seems to be against you &mdash; a few things which he says that appear to be against you, and a few that he forbears to say which you would like to have him say-you ought to remember that the saying of the <num value="1">one</num>, or the forbearing to say the other, would lose his hold upon the <rs>North</rs>, and, by consequence, would lose his capacity to serve you. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5769"/>Upon this subject of moulding public opinion, I call your attention to the fact-for a well-established fact it is &mdash; that the <rs>Judge</rs> never says your <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> is wrong ; he never says it is right, to be sure, but he never says it, is wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5770"/>There is not a public man in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, I believe, with the exception of <persName n="Doug,Senator,,,," id="n0024.0016.00257.02523" reg="mostcommon:Doug,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Doug</surname></persName> las, who has not, at some time in his life, declared his opinion whether the thing is right or wrong; but, <persName n="Douglas,Senator,,,," id="n0024.0016.00257.02524" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> never declares it is wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5771"/>He leaves himself at perfect liberty to do all in your favor which he would be hindered from doing if he were to declare the thing to be wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5772"/>On the contrary, he takes all the chances that he has for inveigling the sentiment of the <rs>North</rs>, opposed to slavery, into your support, by never saying it is right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5773"/>This you ought to set down to his credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5774"/>You ought to give him full credit for this much, little though it be, in comparison to the whole which he does for you. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5775"/>Some other things I will ask your attention to. He said upon the floor of the <orgName n="U. S. Senate" type="org">United States Senate</orgName>, and he has repeated it as I understand a great many times, that he does not care whether slavery is: <quote>voted up or voted down.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5776"/>This again shows you, or ought to show you, if you would reason upon it that he does not believe it to be wrong, for a man may say, when he sees nothing wrong in a thing, that he does not care whether it be voted up or voted down ; but no man can logically say that he cares not whether a thing goes up or goes down, which to him appears to be wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5777"/>You therefore have a demonstration in this, that to <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0016.00257.02525" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s mind your favorite institution which you would have spread out, and made perpetual, is no wrong. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5778"/>Another thing he tells you, in a speech made at <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis, in Tennessee</placeName>, shortly after the canvass in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, last year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5779"/>He there distinctly told the people, that there was a <quote>line drawn by the <name>Almighty</name> across this continent, on the <num value="1">one</num> side of which the soil must always be cultivated by slaves;</quote> that he did not pretend to know exactly where that line was, but that there was such a line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5780"/>I want to ask your attention to that proposition again ; that there is <num value="1">one</num> portion of this continent where the <name>Almighty</name> has designed the soil shall always be cultivated by slaves ; that its being cultivated by slaves at that place is right ; that it has the direct sympathy and <pb id="p.258" n="258"/> authority of the <name>Almighty</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5781"/>Whenever you can get these Northern audiences to adopt the opinion that slavery is right on the other side of the <rs>Ohio</rs> ; whenever you can get them, in pursuance of <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0016.00258.02526" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s views, to adopt that sentiment, they will very readily make the other argument, which is perfectly logical, that that which is right on that side of the <rs>Ohio</rs>, cannot be wrong on this, and that if you have that property on that side of the <rs>Ohio</rs>, under the seal and stamp of the <name>Almighty</name>, when by any means it escapes over here, it is wrong to have Constitutions and laws <quote>to devil</quote> you about it. So <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0016.00258.02527" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> is moulding the public opinion of the <rs>North</rs>, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to say that the thing is right in your State over the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio river</placeName>, and hence to say that that which is right there is not wrong here, and that all laws and Constitutions here, recognizing it as, being wrong, are themselves wrong, and ought to be repealed and abrogated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5782"/>He will tell you, men of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, that if you choose here to have laws against slavery, it is in conformity to the idea that your climate is not suited to it, that your climate is not suited to slave labor, and therefore you have Constitutions and laws against it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5783"/>Let us attend to that argument for a little while and see if it be sound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5784"/>You do not raise sugar-cane (except the new-fashioned sugar-cane, and you wont raise that long), but they do raise it in <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5785"/>You dont raise it in <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> because you cant raise it profitably, because the climate dont suit it. They do raise it in <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> because there it is profitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5786"/>Now, <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0016.00258.02528" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> will tell you that is precisely the slavery question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5787"/>That they do have slaves there because they are profitable, and you dont have them here because they are not profitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5788"/>If that is so, then it leads to dealing with the <num value="1">one</num> precisely as with the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5789"/>Is there then any thing in the <rs>Constitution</rs> or laws of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> against raising sugar-cane?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5790"/>Have you found it necessary to put any such provision in your law?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5791"/>Surely not!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5792"/>No man desires to raise sugar-cane in <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>; but, if any man did desire to do so, you would say it was a tyrannical law that forbids his doing so, and whenever you shall agree with <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0016.00258.02529" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, whenever your minds are brought to adopt his argument, as surely you will have reached the conclusion, that although slavery is not profitable in <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, if any man wants it, it is wrong to him not to let him have it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5793"/>In this matter <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0016.00258.02530" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> is preparing the public mind for you of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, to make perpetual that good thing in your estimation, about which you and I differ. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5794"/>In this connection let me ask your attention to another thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5795"/>I believe it is safe to assert that <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> ago, no living man had expressed the opinion that the negro had no share in the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5796"/>Let me state that again : <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> ago no living man had expressed the opinion that the negro had no share in the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5797"/>If there is in this large, audience any man who ever knew of that opinion being put upon paper as much as <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> ago, I will be obliged to him now or at a subsequent time to show it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5798"/>If that be true I wish you then to note the next fact ; that within the space of <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> <persName n="Douglas,Senator,,,," id="n0024.0016.00258.02531" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, in the argument of this question, has got his entire party, so far as I know, without exception, to join in saying that the negro has no share in the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5799"/>If there be now in all these <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <num value="1">one</num> <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0016.00258.02532" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> man that does not say this, I have been unable upon any occasion to scare him up. Now if none of you said this <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> ago, and all of you say it now, that is a matter that you <persName><foreName>Kentuckians</foreName></persName> ought to note.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5800"/>That is a vast change in the <rs>Northern</rs> public sentiment upon that question. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5801"/>Of what tendency is that change?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5802"/>The tendency of that change is to bring the public mind to the conclusion that when men are spoken of, the negro is not meant ; that when negroes are spoken of, brute alone are contemplated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5803"/>That change in public sentiment has already degraded the black man in the estimation of <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0016.00258.02533" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> and his followers from the condition of a man of some sort, and assigned him to the condition of a brute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5804"/>Now, you <persName><foreName>Kentuckians</foreName></persName> ought to give <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0016.00258.02534" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> credit for this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5805"/>That is the largest possible stride that can be made in regard to the perpetuation of your thing of slavery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5806"/>A voice--<quote>Speak to <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> men, and not to <persName><foreName>Kentuckians</foreName></persName>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5807"/></p> 
<p><persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0016.00258.02535" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>--I beg permission to speak as I please.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5808"/><pb id="p.259" n="259"/> </p> 
<p>In <placeName key="tgn,7007255" n="1.000 69" reg="kentucky">Kentucky</placeName> perhaps, in many of the slave States certainly, you are trying to establish the rightfulness of slavery by reference to the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5809"/>You are trying to show that slavery existed in the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> times by divine ordinance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5810"/>Now, <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0016.00259.02536" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> is wiser than you, for your own benefit, upon that subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5811"/><persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0016.00259.02537" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> knows that whenever you establish that slavery was right by the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, it will occur that that slavery was the slavery of the white man &mdash; of men without reference to color-and he knows very well that you may entertain that idea in <placeName key="tgn,7007255" n="1.000 69" reg="kentucky">Kentucky</placeName> as much as you please, but you will never win any Northern support upon it. He makes a wiser argument for you ; he makes the argument that the slavery of the black man, the slavery of the man who has a skin of a different color from your own, is right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5812"/>He thereby brings to your support Northern voters who could not for a moment be brought by your own argument of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>-right of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5813"/>Will you not give him credit for that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5814"/>Will you not say that in this matter he is more wisely for you than you are for yourselves? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5815"/>Now, hating established with his entire party this doctrine-having been entirely successful in that branch of his efforts in your behalf, he is ready for another. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5816"/>At this same meeting at <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, he declared that, while in all contests between the negro and the white man, be was for the white man, but that in all questions between the negro and the crocodile he was for the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5817"/>He did not make that declaration accidentally at <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5818"/>He made it a great many times in the canvass in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> last year (though I don't know that it was reported in any of his speeches there), but he frequently made it. I believe he repeated it at <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>, and I should not wonder if he repeated it here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5819"/>It is, then, a deliberate way of expressing himself upon that Subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5820"/>It is a matter of mature deliberation with him thus to express himself upon that point of his case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5821"/>It therefore requires some deliberate attention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5822"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> interference seems to be that if you do not enslave the negro you are wronging the white man in some way or other; and that whoever is opposed to the negro being enslaved, is, in some way or other, against the white man. Is not that a falsehood?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5823"/>If there was a necessary conflict between the white man and the negro, I should be for the white man as much as <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0016.00259.02538" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> ; but I say there is no such necessary conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5824"/>I say that there is room enough for us all to be free, and that it not only does not wrong the white man that the negro should be free, but it positively wrongs the mass of the white men that the negro should be enslaved; that the mass of white men are really injured by the effects of slave labor in the vicinity of the fields of their own labor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5825"/>But I do not desire to dwell upon this branch of the question more than to say that this assumption of his is false, and I do hope that that fallacy will not long prevail in the minds of intelligent white men. At all events, you ought to thank <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0016.00259.02539" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> for it. It is for your benefit it is made. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5826"/>The other branch of it is, that in a struggle between the negro and the crocodile, he is for the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5827"/>Well, I don't know that there is any struggle between the negro and the crocodile, either.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5828"/>I suppose that if a crocodile (or as we old <placeName reg="Ohio River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7014265">Ohio River</placeName> boatmen used to call them, alligators) should come across a white man, he would kill him if he could, and so he would a negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5829"/>But what, at last, is this proposition?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5830"/>I believe that it is a sort of proposition in proportion, which may be stated thus: <quote>As the negro is to the white man, so is the crocodile to the negro ; and as the negro may rightfully treat the crocodile as a beast or reptile, so the white man may rightfully treat the negro as a beast or a reptile.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5831"/>That is really the <quote>knip</quote> of all that argument of his. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5832"/>Now, my <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Kentuckians</foreName></persName>, who believe in this, you ought to thank <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0016.00259.02540" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> for having put that in a much more taking way than any of yourselves have done. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5833"/>Again, <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0016.00259.02541" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s <hi rend="italics">great principle</hi>, <quote>Popular Sovereignty,</quote> as he calls it, gives you, by natural consequence, the revival of the slave-trade whenever you want it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5851"/>I know, or at least I think I know, that the framers of that Constitution did expect that the <name>African</name> slave-trade would be abolished at the end of <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>, to which time their prohibition against its being abolished extended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5858"/>But while they expected the slave-trade would be abolished at that time, they expected that the spread of slavery into the new <rs>Territories</rs> should also be restricted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5878"/>He has never seemed to notice that be is stating his views differently from what he did then; but, by some sort of accident, he has always really stated it differently.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5880"/>What is it to exclude?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5881"/>Why, it is to drive it out. It is in some way to put it out of the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5886"/>I understand the <pb id="p.262" n="262"/> controlling of property means the controlling of it for the benefit of the owner of it. While I have no doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5917"/>Now that all these conflicting elements should be brought, while at daggers' points, with <num value="1">one</num> another, to support him, is a feat that is worthy for you to note and consider.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5918"/>It is quite probable that each of these classes of men thought, by the re-election of <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0016.00263.02580" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, their peculiar views would gain something; it is probable that the anti-slavery men thought their views would gain something; that <persName n="Wise,,,,," id="n0024.0016.00263.02581" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><surname>Wise</surname></persName> and <persName n="Breckinridge,,,,," id="n0024.0016.00263.02582" reg="mostcommon:Breckinridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName> thought so too, as regards their opinions; that <persName n="Crittenden,Mister,,,," id="n0024.0016.00263.02583" reg="mostcommon:Crittenden,John,J.,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName> thought that his views would gain something, although he was opposed to both these other men.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5919"/>There is <num value="1">one</num> other thing that I will say to you in this relation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5920"/>It is but my opinion, I give it to you without a fee. It is my opinion that it is for you to take him or be defeated ; and that if you do take him you may be beaten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5921"/>You will surely be beaten if you do not take him. We, the <name>Republicans</name> and others forming the opposition of the country, intend to <quote>stand by our guns,</quote> to be patient and firm, and in the long run to beat you whether you take him or not. We know that before we fairly beat you, we have to beat you both together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5922"/>We know that you are <quote>all of a feather,</quote> and that we have to beat you altogether, and we expect to do it. We dont intend to be very impatient about it. We mean to be as deliberate and calm about it as it is possible to be, but as firm and resolved as it is possible for men to be. When we do as we say, beat you, you perhaps want to know what we will do with you. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5923"/>I will tell you, so far as I am authorized to speak for the opposition, what we mean to do with you.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5924"/>We mean to remember that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5925"/>you are as good as we; that there is no difference between us other than the difference of circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5926"/>We mean to recognize and bear in mind always that you have as good hearts in your bosoms as other people, or as we claim to have, and treat you accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5927"/>We mean to marry your girls when we <pb id="p.264" n="264"/> have a chance &mdash; the white ones I mean, and I have the honor to inform you that I once did have a chance in that way. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5928"/>I have told you what we mean to do. I want to know, now, when that thing takes place, what do you mean to do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5929"/>[A voice-<quote>That is so.</quote> ] <quote>That is so,</quote> <num value="1">one</num> of them says ; I wonder if he is a Kentuckian?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5930"/>[A voice-<quote>He is a Douglas man.</quote> ] Well, then, I want to know what you are going to do with your half of it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5931"/>Are you going to split.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5932"/>the <rs>Ohio</rs> down through, and push your half off a piece?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5933"/>Or are you going to keep it right alongside of us outrageous fellows?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5934"/>Or are you going to build up a wall some way between your country and ours, by which that movable property of yours cant come over here any more, to the danger of your losing it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5935"/>Do you think you can better yourselves on that subject, by leaving us here under no obligation whatever to return those specimens of your movable property that come hither?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5936"/>You have divided the <rs>Union</rs> because we would not do right with you, as you think, upon that subject; when we cease to be under obligations to do any thing for you, how much better off do you think you will be?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5937"/>Will you make war upon us and kill us all?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5938"/>Why, gentlemen, I think you arc as gallant and as brave men as live; that you can fight as bravely in a good cause, man for man, as any other people living; that you have shown yourselves capable of this upon various occasions ; but man for man, you are not better than we are, and there are not so many of you as there are of us. You will never make much of a hand at whipping us. If we were fewer in numbers than you, I think that you could whip us ; if we were equal it would likely be a drawn battle ; but being inferior in numbers, you will make nothing by attempting to master us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5939"/>But perhaps I have addressed myself as long, or longer, to the <name>Kentuckians</name> than I ought to have done, inasmuch as I have said that whatever course you take we intend in the end to beat you.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5940"/>It may appear a little episodical for me to mention the topic of which I shall speak now. It is a favorable proposition of <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0016.00264.02589" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s that the interference of the <rs>General Government</rs>, through the <name>Ordinance</name> of &lsquo;<num value="87">87</num> or through any other act of the <rs>General Government</rs>, never has made or ever can make a Free State ; that the <name>Ordinance</name> of <num value="87">87</num> did not make Free States of <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName> or <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5941"/>That these States are free upon his <quote>great principle</quote> of Popular Sovereignty, because the people of those several States have chosen to make them so. At <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>, and probably here, he undertook to compliment the people that they themselves have made the <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">State of Ohio</placeName> free, and that the <name>Ordinance</name> of <num value="87">87</num> was not entitled in any degree to divide the honor with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5942"/>I have no doubt that the people of the <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">State of Ohio</placeName> did make her free according to their own will and judgment, but let the facts be remembered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5943"/>In <dateStruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></dateStruct>, I believe, it was you who made your <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Constitution, with the clause prohibiting slavery, and you did it I suppose very nearly unanimously ; but you should bear in mind that you &mdash; speaking of you as <num value="1">one</num> people &mdash; that you did so unembarrassed by the actual presence of the institution amongst you ; that you made it a Free State, not with the embarrassment upon you of already having among you many slaves, which if they had been here, and you had sought to make a Free State, you would not know what to do with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5944"/>If they had been among you, embarrassing difficulties, most probably, would have induced you to tolerate a slave Constitution instead of a free <num value="1">one</num>, as indeed these very difficulties have constrained every people on this continent who have adopted slavery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5945"/>Pray what was it that made you free?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5946"/>What kept you free?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5947"/>Did you not find your country free when you came to decide that <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> should be a Free State?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5948"/>It is important to inquire by what reason you found it so?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5949"/>Let us take an illustration between the <name>States</name> of <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>. <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> is separated by this River <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, not a mile wide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5950"/>A portion of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, by reason of the course of the <rs>Ohio</rs>, is further north than this portion of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, in which we now stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5951"/><placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> is entirely <pb id="p.265" n="265"/> covered with slavery-Ohio is entirely free from it. What made that difference?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5952"/>Was it climate?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5953"/>No! A portion of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> was further north than this portion of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5954"/>Was it soil?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5955"/>No! There is nothing in the soil of the <num value="1">one</num> more favorable to slave labor than the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5956"/>It was not climate or soil that caused <num value="1">one</num> side of the line to be entirely covered with slavery and the other side free of it. What was it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5957"/>Study over it. Tell us if you can, in all the range of conjecture, if there be any thing you can conceive of that made that difference, other than that there was no law of any sort keeping it out of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5958"/>while the <name>Ordinance</name> of <num value="87">87</num> kept it out of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5959"/>It there is any other reason than this, I confess that it is wholly beyond my power to conceive of it. This, then, I offer to combat the idea that that ordinance has never made any State free. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5960"/>I don't stop at this illustration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5961"/>I come to the <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">State of Indiana</placeName>; and what I have said as between <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5962"/>I repeat as between <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> ; it is equally applicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5963"/><num value="1">One</num> additional argument is applicable also to <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5964"/>In her Territorial condition she more than once petitioned Congress to abrogate the ordinance entirely, or at least so far as to suspend its operation for a time, in order that they should exercise the <quote>Popular Sovereignty</quote> of having slaves if they wanted them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5965"/>The men then controlling the <rs>General Government</rs>, imitating the men of the <name>Revolution</name>, refused <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName> that privilege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5966"/>And so we have the evidence that <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName> supposed she could have slaves, if it were not for that ordinance ; that she besought Congress to put that barrier out of the way ; that Congress refused to do so, and it all ended at last in <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName> being a Free State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5967"/>Tell me not then that the <name>Ordinance</name> of &lsquo;<num value="87">87</num> had nothing to do with making <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName> a free state, when we find some men chafing against and only restrained by that barrier. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5968"/>Come down again to our <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">State of Illinois</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5969"/>The great North-west Territory, including <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>, <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, <placeName reg="Michigan" key="tgn,7007520">Michigan</placeName> and <placeName reg="Wisconsin" key="tgn,7007922">Wisconsin</placeName>, was acquired <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, I believe, by the <rs>British Government</rs>, in part at least, from the <rs>French</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5970"/>Before the establishment of our independence, it becomes a part of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>; enabling <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> afterward to transfer it to the <rs>General Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5971"/>There were <name>French</name> settlement in what is now <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, and at the same time there were <name>French</name> settlements in what is now <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>--in the tract of country that was not purchased till about <dateStruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5972"/>In these <name>French</name> settlements negro slavery had existed for many years-perhaps more than a <num value="100">hundred</num> if not as much as <measure n="200years" type="date">two hundred years</measure>--at <placeName reg="Kaskaskia, Randolph, Illinois" key="tgn,7013821">Kaskaskia, in Illinois</placeName>, and at <placeName key="tgn,7014540" n="1.000 3" reg="sainte genevieve, sainte genevieve, missouri">St. Genevieve</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Cape Girardeau, Cape Girardeau, Missouri" key="tgn,7013539">Cape Girardeau</placeName>, perhaps, in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5973"/>The number of slaves was not, very great, but there was about the same number in each place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5974"/>They were there when we acquired the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5975"/>There was no effort made to break up the relation of master and slave, and even the <name>Ordinance</name> of <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct> was not so enforced as to destroy that slavery in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> ; nor did the ordinance apply to <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> at all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5976"/>What I want to ask your attention to, at this point, is that <placeName key="tgn,7007251" n="1.000 153" reg="illinois">Illinois</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7007523" n="1.000 35" reg="missouri">Missouri</placeName> came into the <rs>Union</rs> about the same time, <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> in the latter part of <dateStruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></dateStruct>, and, <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, after a struggle, I believe sometime in <dateStruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5977"/>They had been filling up with American people about the same period of time ; their progress enabling them to come into the <rs>Union</rs> about the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5978"/>At the end of that <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>, in which they had been so preparing (for it was about that period of time), the number of slaves in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> had actually decreased ; while in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, beginning with very few, at the end of that <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>, there were about <num value="10000">ten thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5979"/>This being so, and it being remembered that <placeName key="tgn,7007523" n="1.000 35" reg="missouri">Missouri</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7007251" n="1.000 153" reg="illinois">Illinois</placeName> are, to a certain extent, in the same parallel of latitude &mdash; that the northern halt of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> and the southern half of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> are in the same parallel of latitude-so that climate would have the same effect upon <num value="1">one</num> as upon the other, and that in the soil there is no material difference so far as bears upon the question of slavery being settled upon <num value="1">one</num> or the other &mdash; there being none of those natural causes to produce a difference in filling them, and yet there being a broad difference in their filling up, we are led again to inquire what was the cause of that difference It is most natural to say that in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> there was no law to keep that country front filling up with slaves, while in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> there was the <name>Ordinance</name> of &lsquo;<num value="87">87</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5980"/>The <pb id="p.266" n="266"/> ordinance being there, slavery decreased during that <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>--the ordinance not being in the other, it increased from a few to <num value="10000">ten thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5981"/>Can any body doubt the reason of the difference? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5982"/>I think all these facts most abundantly prove that my friend <persName n="Douglas,Judge,,,," id="n0024.0016.00266.02590" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s proposition, that the <name>Ordinance</name> of <num value="87">87</num>, or the national restriction of slavery, never had a tendency to make a Free State, is a fallacy &mdash; a proposition without the shadow or substance of truth about it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5983"/><persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0016.00266.02591" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> sometimes says that all the <name>States</name> (and it is part of this same proposition I have been discussing) that have become free, hare become so upon his <quote>great principle ;</quote> that the <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">State of Illinois</placeName> itself came into the <rs>Union</rs> as a slave State, and that the people, upon the <quote>great principle</quote> of Popular Sovereignty, have since made it a Free State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5984"/>Allow me but a little while to state to you what facts there are to justify him in saying that <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> came into the <rs>Union</rs> as a Slave State. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5985"/>I have mentioned to you that there were a few old <name>French</name> slaves there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5986"/>They numbered, I think, <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="200">two hundred</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5987"/>Besides that, there had been a Territorial law for indenturing black persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5988"/>Under that law, in violation of the <name>Ordinance</name> of <num value="87">87</num>, but without any enforcement of the ordinance to overthrow the system, there had been a small number of slaves introduced as indentured persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5989"/>Owing to this the clause for the prohibition of slavery was slightly modified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5990"/>Instead of running like yours, that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except for crime, of which the party shall have been duly convicted, should exist in the <rs>State</rs>, they said that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5991"/>neither slavery nor involuntary servitude should thereafter be introduced, and that the children of indentured servants should be born free; and nothing was said about the few old <name>French</name> slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5992"/>Out of this fact, that the clause for prohibiting slavery was modified because of the actual presence of it, <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0016.00266.02592" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> asserts again and again that <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> came into the <rs>Union</rs> as a Slave State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5993"/>How far the facts sustain the conclusion that he draws, it is for intelligent and impartial men to decide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5994"/>I leave it with you with these remarks, worthy of being remembered, that that little thing those few indentured servants being there, was of itself sufficient to modify a Constitution made by a people ardently desiring to have a free Constitution ; showing the power of the actual presence of the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> to prevent any people, however anxious to make a Free State, from making it perfectly so. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5995"/>I have been detaining you longer perhaps than I ought to do. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5996"/>I am in some doubt whether to introduce another topic upon which I could talk awhile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5997"/>[Cries of <quote>Go on,</quote> and <quote>Give us it.</quote> ] It is this then : <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0016.00266.02593" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s Popular Sovereignty, as a principle, is simply this : If <num value="1">one</num> man chooses to make a slave of another man, neither that man or any body else has a right to object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5998"/>Apply it to Government, as he seeks to apply it, and it is this: if; in a new Territory, into which a few people are beginning to enter for the purpose of making their homes, they choose to either exclude slavery from their limits, :or to establish it there, however <num value="1">one</num> or the other may affect the persons to be enslaved, or the infinitely greater number of persons who are afterward to inhabit that Territory, or the other members of the family of communities, of which they are but an incipient member, or the general head of the family of States as parent, of all-however their action may affect <num value="1">one</num> or the other of these, there is no power or right to interfere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5999"/>That is <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0016.00266.02594" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s Popular Sovereignty applied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6000"/>Now I think that there is a real Popular Sovereignty in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6001"/>I think a definition of Popular Sovereignty, in the abstract, would be about this &mdash; that each man shall do precisely as he pleases with himself, and with all those things which exclusively concern him. Applied in government, this principle would be, that a general government shall do all those things which pertain to it, and all the local governments shall do precisely as they please in respect to those matters which exclusively concern them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6002"/><persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0024.0016.00266.02595" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:5"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> looks upon slavery as so insignificant that the people must decide that question for themselves, and yet they are not fit to decide who shall be their Governor, <rs type="role2">Judge</rs> or <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs> or who shall be any of their officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6003"/>These are vast national matters, in his estimation, but the little matter in his estimation is that of <pb id="p.267" n="267"/> planting slavery there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6004"/>That is purely of local interest, which nobody should be allowed to say a word about. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6005"/>Labor is the great source from which nearly all, if not all, human comforts and necessities are drawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6006"/>There is a difference in opinion about the elements of labor in society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6007"/>Some men assume that there is a necessary connection between capital and labor, and that connection draws within it the whole of the labor of the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6008"/>They assume that nobody works unless capital excites them to work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6009"/>They begin next to consider what is the best way. They say there are but <num value="2">two</num> ways ; <num value="1">one</num> is to hire men and to allure them to labor by their consent; the other is to buy the men and drive them to it, and that is slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6010"/>Having assumed that, they proceed to discuss the question of whether the laborers themselves are better off in the condition of slaves or of hired laborers, and they usually decide that they are better off in the condition of slaves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6011"/>In the first place, I say that the whole thing is a mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6012"/>That there is a certain relation between capital and labor, I admit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6013"/>That it does exist, and rightfully exists, I think is true, That men who are industrious, and sober, and honest in the pursuit of their own interests should after a while accumulate capital, and after that should be allowed to enjoy it in peace, and also if they should choose, when they have accumulated it, to use it to save themselves from actual labor and hire other people to labor for them, is right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6014"/>In doing so they do not wrong the man they employ, for they find men who have not of their own laud to work upon, or shops to work in, and who are benefited by working for others, hired laborers, receiving their capital for it. Thus a few men that own capital, hire a few others, and these establish the relation of capital and labor rightfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6015"/>A relation of which I make no complaint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6016"/>But I insist that that relation after all does not embrace more than <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="8" type="ordinal">eighth</num> of the labor of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6017"/>[The speaker proceeded to argue that the hired laborer, with his ability to become an employer, must have every precedence over him who labors under the inducement of force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6018"/>He continued :] I have taken upon myself in the name of some of you to say, that we expect upon these principles to ultimately beat them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6019"/>In order to do so, I think we want and must have a national policy in regard to the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, that acknowledges and deals with that institution as being wrong Whoever desires the prevention of the spread of slavery and the nationalization of that institution, yields all, when he yields to any policy that either recognizes slavery as being right, or as being an indifferent thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6020"/>Nothing will make you successful but setting up a policy which shall treat the thing as being wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6021"/>When I say this, I do not mean to say that this General Government is charged with the duty of redressing or preventing all the wrongs in the world ; but I do think that it is charged with preventing and redressing all wrongs which are wrongs to itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6022"/>This Government is expressly charged with the duty of providing for the general welfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6023"/>We believe that the spreading out and perpetuity of the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> impairs the general welfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6024"/>We believe-nay, we know, that that is the only thing that has ever threatened the perpetuity of the <rs>Union</rs> itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6025"/>The only thing which has ever menaced the destruction of the government under which we live, is this very thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6026"/>To repress this thing, we think, is providing for the general welfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6027"/>Our friends in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> differ from us. We need not make our argument for them, but we who think it is wrong in all its relations, or in some of them at least, must decide as to our own actions, and our own course, upon our own judgment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6028"/>I say that we must not interfere with the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> in the <name>States</name> where it exists, because the <rs>Constitution</rs> forbids it, and the general welfare does not require us to do so. We must not withhold an efficient Fugitive Slave law because the <rs>Constitution</rs> requires us, as I understand it, not to withhold such a law. But we must prevent the outspreading of the institution, because neither the <rs>Constitution</rs> nor general welfare requires us to extend it. We must prevent the revival of the <name>African</name> slave-trade, and the enacting by Congress of a Territorial slave code.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6029"/>We must prevent <pb id="p.268" n="268"/> each of these things being done by either congresses or courts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6030"/>The people of these <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are the rightful masters of both congresses and courts, not to overthrow the <rs>Constitution</rs>, but to overthrow the men who pervert the <rs>Constitution</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6031"/>To do these things we must employ instrumentalities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6032"/>We must hold conventions; we must adopt platforms, if we conform to ordinary custom; we must nominate candidates, and we must carry elections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6033"/>In all these things, I think that we ought to keep in view our real purpose, and in none do any thing that stands adverse to our purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6034"/>If we shall adopt a platform that fails to recognize or express our purpose, or elect a man that declares himself inimical to our purpose, we not only take nothing by our success, but we tacitly admit that we act upon no other principle than a desire to have <quote>the loaves and fishes,</quote> by which, in the end, our apparent success is really an injury to us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6035"/>I know that this is very desirable with me, as with every body else, that all the elements of the <name>Opposition</name> shall unite in the next Presidential election and in all future time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6036"/>I am anxious that that should he, but there are things seriously to be considered in relation to that matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6037"/>If the terms can be arranged, I am in favor of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6038"/>But suppose we shall take up some man and put him upon <num value="1">one</num> end or the other of the ticket, who declares himself against us in regard to the prevention of the spread of slavery &mdash; who turns up his nose and says he is tired of hearing any thing more about it, who is more against us than against the enemy, what will be the issue?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6039"/>Why, he will get no slave States after all-he has tried that already until being beat is the rule for him. If we nominate him upon that ground, he will not carry a slave State, and not only so, but that portion of our men who are high-strung upon the principle we really fight for, will not go for him, and he wont get a single electoral vote any where, except, perhaps, in the <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">State of Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6040"/>There is no use in saying to us that we are stubborn and obstinate, because we wont do some such thing as this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6041"/>We cannot do it. We cannot get our men to vote it. I speak by the card, that we cannot give the <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">State of Illinois</placeName> in such case by <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6042"/>We would be flatter down than the <quote>Negro Democracy</quote> themselves have the heart to wish to see us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6043"/>After saying this much, let me say a little on the other side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6044"/>There are plenty of men in the slave States that are altogether good enough for me to be either <rs type="role2">President</rs> or <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice President</rs>, provided they will profess their sympathy with our purpose, and will place themselves on the ground that our men, upon principle, can vote for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6045"/>There are scores of them, good men in their character for intelligence and talent and integrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6046"/>If such a one will place himself upon the right ground, I am for his occupying <num value="1">one</num> place upon the next Republican or Opposition ticket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6047"/>I will heartily go for him. Rut, unless he does so place himself, I think it a matter of perfect nonsense to attempt to bring about a union upon any other basis ; that if a union be made, the elements will scatter so that there can be no success for such a ticket, nor any thing like success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6048"/>The good old maxims of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> are applicable, and truly applicable, to human affairs, and in this, as in other things, we may say here that he who is not for us is against us ; he who gathereth not with us scattereth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6049"/>I should be glad to have some of the many good, and able, and noble men of the <rs>South</rs> to place themselves where we can confer upon them the high honor of an election upon <num value="1">one</num> or the other end of our ticket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6050"/>It would do my soul good to do that thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6051"/>It would enable us to teach them that, inasmuch as we select <num value="1">one</num> of their own number to carry out our principles, we are free from the charge that we mean more than we say. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6052"/>But, my friends, I have detained you much longer than I expected to do. I believe I may do myself the compliment to say that you have stayed and heard me with great patience, for which I return you my most sincere thanks. </p></div1></body> </text></TEI.2>
