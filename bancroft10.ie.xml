<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Important aid has been derived from the exceedingly copious and as yet unedited cabinet correspondence of <persName><foreName>Frederic</foreName> the <genName n="2">Second</genName></persName> of <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 7" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName> with his foreign ministers in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, the <name>Netherlands</name>, <placeName key="tgn,1000066" n="1.000 9" reg="danmark">Denmark</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 7" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>In choosing from this vast mass of materials, I received the most friendly assistance from the superintendent, <persName n="Dunker,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0001.00005.00002" reg="mostcommon:Dunker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Dunker</surname></persName>, and from <persName n="Friedlander,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0001.00005.00003" reg="mostcommon:Friedlander,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Friedlander</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The American government has manifested the same disposition, and this I hold to be wise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The <num value="2">two</num> great cosmopolitan nations are entering on a new era in their relations to <num value="1">one</num> another; and their statesmen may mutually derive lessons alike from the errors which disturbed the past, and from what was done well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The interest of this exposition is heightened rather than impaired by the fact that his motives sprung from his love to his own people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>It also becomes certain that the <rs>Empress Catharine</rs> promulgated her naval code, not in ignorance of its character as has been hitherto stated, but with a full knowledge of what she was doing; and that she practised on the <rs>British</rs> minister at <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> no other cajolery than was needed to make him the channel through which the code was communicated to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, so that direct crimination might be avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The contemporary documents show that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 17" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> declared war on the <rs>Dutch</rs> republic, solely to prevent her from being unconditionally received into the armed neutrality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>As to separatism, or the exaggerated expression of what we call States Rights, it did not grow out of the existence of slavery, but out of an element in human nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The much agitated question as to the time and manner of the abolition of slavery in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> finds itself solved without going from home: the witness was at the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 17" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> it was never misapprehended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It is worth noticing that, though the negotiators on each side reciprocally marked the boundary agreed upon by a well-defined line on the map, yet, during the strife which was kept up about it for half a century, the <rs>American</rs> government did not catch a glimpse of this evidence till a treaty of compromise was ratified, and the map <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> of <persName n="Oswald,,,,," id="n0334.0001.00010.00050" reg="mostcommon:Oswald,Richard,,,:1"><surname>Oswald</surname></persName> was not produced till the <rs>British</rs> ministry that made the compromise had to defend it in parliament.
